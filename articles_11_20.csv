https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-extension-general-election-4869746-Oct2019/,"BRITISH MPS WILL today vote on whether to back a December general election while EU ambassadors decide on the length of a Brexit extension.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election bid, to be made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), would require a two-thirds Commons majority – 434 MPs – to agree to an election on 12 December.
The Guardian is reporting that Brussels has agreed to Britain’s request for anextension until 31 January.
The UK would be able to leave earlier, with Brexit going ahead on the first day of the month after a deal is ratified, according to the newspaper.
Johnson has said in the past he would prefer to be “dead in a ditch” than miss the 31 October deadline.
He will likely fail to secure “super majority” support for a December election today – but knows he will require 100 fewer MPs to grant the same request just 24 hours later.
Labour’s lack of support for the proposal means it is likely to be defeated when voted upon this evening.
Johnson has already had two requests for an election refused, but the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party have offered Johnson a way out of the deadlock.
Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford have put forward a tightly-drafted Bill that would grant an election on 9 December – three days earlier than the PM’s suggested polling date – as long as the European Union grant an extension until 31 January.
The draft law, currently scheduled for tomorrow’s sitting, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament – 114 fewer than under the FTPA “super majority” rules.

With the SNP and Lib Dems supporting the initiative, the Bill is likely to pass even without Labour backing.

Downing Street indicated it could be willing to support the pro-Remain parties’ proposals in a possible compromise offer.
A Number 10 source said if the Government’s request for an election was lost, “we will look at all options to get Brexit done including ideas similar to that proposed by other opposition parties”.
If passed on Tuesday, the SNP-Lib Dem Bill is likely to achieve Royal Assent by Thursday and Parliament would be dissolved by the end of the week for the first December poll in almost a century.
Its quick dissolution turnaround period would mean the Withdrawal Agreement Bill – the attempt to put Johnson’s Brexit deal with the EU into law – would fail to pass before Halloween.
‘Do or die’
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon took to Twitter to explain why the SNP was backing a 9 December election.
She said there was “no evidence” that a majority for a second referendum existed in Parliament and that it would be more embarrassing for the Conservative Party leader to have to fight an election before having delivered Brexit as promised.
“An election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October ‘do or die’ promise and also defend his bad deal,” the SNP leader said.

Swinson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme yesterday: “We think we need to resolve this impasse. We think the best way to resolve it would be a ‘people’s vote’ but, in the absence of proper Labour numbers to do that, a general election would be the other way.”

Labour looks unlikely to back the Bill with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying, according to the Telegraph, that even with the Article 50 deadline pushed into next year, no-deal was “still there as a threat”.
His words came as former Labour prime minister Tony Blair warned his party it must ensure no-deal was entirely removed as a possibility, meaning Johnson must rule it out as an option if the trade talks with the EU turn “ugly”.
Blair said any no-deal promises from the PM had to “encompass the future negotiations and not simply the exit deal” in order to warrant approving an election.
Meanwhile, analysis by the Financial Times found the level of toxic messages directed at MPs “spiked sharply” following the PM’s dismissal of MPs’ death threat fears as “humbug”.
On the evening the comment was made, which followed the Supreme Court’s judgment that the former London mayor’s suspension of Parliament was unlawful, toxic messages with MPs’ Twitter handles included rose by 392%, according to the paper.

Labour MP Paula Sheriff, to whom the PM made the “humbug” remark, received more than 100 toxic tweets per hour, including one message that said: “Do what the people told you to effing do otherwise, yes, expect to be strung up metaphorically or physically.”
It comes as police started an investigation into a crowdfunding page which sought to raise £10,000 (about €11,600) to have campaigner Gina Miller killed.
The GoFundMe page targeting Miller, who twice won Supreme Court cases challenging the British government on Brexit, has been taken down since being created in April.

MORE THAN £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.
Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme, Goveavoided answeringwhether UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was wrong to say there would be no checks on goods going to or from Northern Ireland, Gove didn’t give a yes-or-no response.
He said that was unfettered access on goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but said there would be some checks on goods travelling in the opposite direction.

The £705 million packageincludes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.
New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.
Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:
The funding relates only to the implementation of the GB-EU border; the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.
Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.
“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.
Liz Truss’ letter
In a letter to her cabinet colleague Michael Gove, leaked to the media this week, international trade minister Liz Truss expressed concern that border infrastructure would not be ready by July 2021.

(The UK has said it will not immediately introduce checks on EU imports, but will instead introduce them on a phased basis over the first half of next year, due to the coronavirus.)
She warned the delay in imposing checks could spark a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization, adding: “I would like assurances that we are able to deliver full controls at these ports by July 2021.”
Gove, the minister in charge of preparing for Brexit, said the government had been consulting on the issue for months and insisted the borders would be ready.
“That’s the basis of the announcement today – more than £700 million in order to provide infrastructure at ports, to invest in technology and also to make sure we have the personnel to keep ourselves safe,” he told the BBC.
The main opposition Labour party said Truss’ letter showed a “growing sense of chaos and confusion” within the cabinet about Brexit preparations.
The government is also planning a new public information campaign to prepare businesses and individuals for the end of the transition, dubbed “The UK’s new start: let’s get going”.
It will include detailed guidance for everyone from traders to holidaymakers on what might change, Gove said.
Background
The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.
The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.
Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.
Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.
The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year.

THE BRITISH FLAG has been removed from its flagpole outside the European Parliament and replaced with the flag of the EU.
The Union flag was removed at exactly 8pm by parliamentary staff, watched by crowds of journalists and British expats. A European flag was raised in its place.
At the clocks strike 11:00 pm — midnight in Brussels — Britain becomes the first country to leave the 28-member bloc and will go it alone for the first time since 1973.
Dozens of people had gathered on the pavement outside the parliamentary building from dusk to witness the last symbol of Britain’s membership of the EU be taken away.
A group of newly redundant assistants to the UK’s MEPs attended sporting their commemorative UK/EU scarves.
There was a small cheer as the lowering mechanism got briefly stuck, with one onlooker joking: “It means you have to Remain.”
The flag is due to be placed in the House of European History in Brussels, a spokesman for the European Parliament said.

Earlier today, British flags were removed from the foyer of the parliament and from inside the European Council.

Tonight meanwhile in the UK, both Remainers and Leavers are marking the exit with a series of events.
Brexiteers will gather for a party in Parliament Square led by Nigel Farage, while Union flags are already flying around Westminster.
In official events, Downing Street will be illuminated with a light show while a new commemorative 50p coin is entering circulation.
Prime Minister Johnson will spend the evening in Number 10 hosting a celebratory reception for senior ministers, officials, and supporters of the 2016 referendum campaign to leave the EU.
While Nigel Farage will lead festivities at a rally in central London tonight, pro-EU groups are set to hold a candlelit vigil down the road in Westminster this evening.
In Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum, candlelit vigils are planned.
The Leave a Light On gatherings are taking place in Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, and Stirling, among other locations, and participants intend to send a message to the EU to keep open a place for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit was staging a series of protests near the border in Armagh.

European reaction
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Britain’s departure a “sea-change” for the bloc, although nothing will immediately feel different because of an 11-month transition period negotiated as part of an EU-UK exit deal ratified this week.
French president Emmanuel Macron has taken a thinly veiled swipe at Boris Johnson by claiming the Brexit campaign was “based on lies”.
Macron said Brexit was an “alarm signal” which should be heard across the EU.
The French president said: “At midnight, for the first time in 70 years, a country will leave the European Union.
“It is a historic alarm signal that must be heard in each of our countries.”
President Macron said France had always respected the decision taken by the British people in the 2016 referendum.
But he restated his belief that much the referendum campaign was “based on lies, exaggerations, simplifications, cheques that were promised and will never be delivered”.

ALL THE TALK is over. And, in the Brexit election, the Tories are the clear winners.
Voters across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland went to the polls in what both main parties have described as the “most important in a generation”.
The polls snapped shut at 10pm, the BBC published the results of the exit poll, and the counting got under way in earnest up and down the UK.
It was clear from early on that the Conservatives and Boris Johnson will get a big majority, as Labour’s vote crumbled around England and Scotland.
It’s now official that the Conservatives have returned to power, exceeding the 326 seats required for a majority.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-history-5001062-Jul2020/,"ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS could be summed up in recent times by one word – Brexit.
On 31 January, the United Kingdom stopped being a member of the European Union and disenthralled itself not only from the most successful economic bloc in history but also from over forty years of supranational cooperation.
For Ireland, both north and south, Brexit presents real and present dangers to the political and economic stability of the island.
Few observers can predict the long-term impact of this momentous event yet the answers to this dilemma may be found in history, and in this case, in the life on an extraordinary Irish diplomat named Leopold Kerney.
Ireland’s economy back then was overwhelmingly agricultural with only minor industrial sectors in north-east Ulster’s shipyards and in Guinness’ brewery Dublin. The famine, land war and mass emigration had seen the island suffer immeasurable hardship and republican risings to overthrow British hegemony proved ill-judged. Ireland’s life was controlled and guided by Britain.
Kerney’s vision
Educated to be a quintessential civil servant Kerney should have seen that Britain was the land of opportunity and progress, yet two key events in his childhood shaped his economic vision: first was when he fished for crabs off Poolbeg Lighthouse as a teenager and noticed that all the ships sailing up the River Liffey were British – why did Ireland not control its own trade he wondered?
He saw everything British now as negative and he questioned everything he was being taught at school ‘one hour of English history five days a week and one half-hour of Irish history every Saturday – the Irish history being a narrative of English military victories in Ireland and Irish crimes, and written by an Englishman of course’.
The solution to him was clear – Ireland had to break its connection with Britain and look to the continent for its future prosperity. Breaking away from Britain could mean further economic destitution and threaten war, which did indeed happen.
Today, Ireland faces none of these risks.
Whilst Anglo-Irish relations may now be less cordial, they remain nonetheless warm and Ireland does not stand alone as it did in Kerney’s time. The European Union and its twenty-seven member states are a formidable ally in Ireland’s corner.
Flashback in time again to the Anglo-Irish War, the declaration of independence and the gathering of Dáil Éireann. Britain still controlled Ireland’s economic life and maintained it by military force: ‘Ireland had hardly any export or import [trade] except what passed between Ireland and England under English control,’ said Eoin MacNeill Minister for Industries in the newly established Irish Republic of 1919.

If Ireland was to stand on its feet, not only would politics and arms be essential but also trade. Living at the time in France, Kerney was recruited to the cause and began to use trade as a pillar of independence.
He travelled the length and breadth of France, writing reports on industries that Ireland should create – ‘I visited sugar factories in the north of France and made reports on that industry with a view to its introduction into Ireland’ – and denying business to British firms: ‘nothing gave me greater pleasure than to translate and circulate as widely as possible the successive Boycott Orders which reached me from Mr Blythe, Minister for Commerce.’
In 1922 he achieved a major success by establishing the first direct shipping route between Brest and Cork thus breaking centuries of British dominance over Ireland’s maritime life.
What would Kerney make of Brexit?
Europe was open for business then and now, regardless of what Britain does. Irish firms are interlinked with their continental partners. So long as the country maintains its entrepreneurial spirit and is supported by its government – as Kerney was in his time – then markets other than Britain’s can be found. As an island Ireland simply has to trade.
One of the great worries of Brexit is its impact on agriculture – on jobs, quality and foreign competition. For decades Ireland’s agricultural policy was centred on ferrying live cattle to Britain and hoping for a decent price. The European market, the Common Agricultural Policy, the role of state authorities and farmer lobbyists broke this downward cycle.
Yet does Brexit risk endangering Ireland’s agricultural sector? After World War One, Britain was bankrupt. Farmers worried about finding good prices for their cattle and did not know where to turn to.
Kerney in France with his family when he was our trade agent during the War of Independence.Barry Whelan, with permission.Barry Whelan, with permission.
Kerney led a delegation of the Irish Farmer’s Union (forerunner of the Irish Farmers’ Association) at international agricultural conferences to market goods to French, Italian, Belgian, Dutch and Eastern European delegates.
As Britain walks away from the EU now many hope it closes the door as it leaves. Kerney insisted back then that Britain close the door behind itself as he informed his French counterpart: ‘I made certain reservations as to the admission of England; her case being on a par with that of Germany, to whose admission the French objected.’
The decision of the British electorate to leave the EU was a democratic one yet few had considered the ramifications the referendum would have on Britain’s obligations under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Despite not being inside the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic has now been placed in an unenviable position.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and other government departments will try at best to plan a path forward but so long as Ireland remains tied in any significant measure to the United Kingdom it lives with the vagaries of Brexit and its champions – the Brexiteers.
In 1932, Éamon de Valera upheld an electoral promise to stop paying land annuity payments to Britain. The result was the Anglo-Irish economic war that dragged on until 1938. With Ireland’s only viable market at the time cut off, de Valera struggled to find a path forward. He turned to Leopold Kerney who went to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal to find alternative markets for Ireland’s goods.

He found willing markets, as the following communique stated: ‘I am directed by the Minister to acknowledge the receipt to Mr Kerney of his minute of 14 June from Madrid enclosing Agreement made between the Irish Free State and Spain.
‘The Minister has directed me to convey to Mr Kerney his appreciation of the very valuable work which he has successfully concluded in Spain.’
De Valera himself declared before the Dáil on 11 July 1933: ‘there is nothing that can be said about Mr Kerney except that which is good’.
The Ireland of the Twentieth Century lived in Britain’s shadow even when it did well. During World War Two, Ireland remained neutral, the only member of the Commonwealth not to join in the war on Britain’s side.
Despite neutrality that leaned very much towards the Allies and the bravery of thousands of Irishmen and women who aided the Allied cause, Ireland found itself diplomatically isolated by the victors and denied admission to the United Nations.
The political ramifications of standing alone even for all the right reasons gave the then Irish government few options. In 1947 de Valera again turned to Kerney to find a new pathway. The diplomat led a landmark political and trade mission to South America, connecting to the Irish diaspora in Argentina and Chile, fostering direct relations, forging new economic trading markets and ensuring the island remained open for business.
Ireland’s EU membership, the investment of multinational companies and growing links to the Asian market ensure that the country has nothing to fear from loosening the Anglo-Irish connection.
The 21st Century will be defined by Ireland looking expansively outward towards its continental neighbours and achieving the vision that Leopold Kerney first dreamed about as a young boy – break the British connection and look to continental Europe.
This vision has stood the test of time and Brexit has done more to forge this vital continental link. For this reason alone, Brexit is a blessing, not a curse.
Barry Whelan is a historian of Twentieth Century Irish and European history in DCU. He is author of the book Ireland’s Revolutionary Diplomat: A Biography of Leopold Kerney (University of Notre Dame Press).

https://www.thejournal.ie/central-bank-irish-economy-5004155-Feb2020/,"ECONOMIC GROWTH IN Ireland is “broadly positive” but expected to slow down in the coming years even if an EU-UK trade deal is reached, according to the Central Bank.
The first quarterly bulletin of the year from the Central Bank has outlined that economic growth has stayed “remarkably resilient” in recent years despite weak world demand and heightened Brexit uncertainty.
Director of economics and statistics at the Central Bank Mark Cassidy said economic growth has been positive, but is expected to slow down.
“While the economy has been growing strongly in recent years, the pace of that expansion is likely to slow down,” Cassidy said in a statement.
“Our forecasts are based on an assumption that an EU-UK trade agreement is in place from January 2021, but even in that scenario, which is not guaranteed, we still see the pace of economic growth gradually slowing.”
Ireland’s economy is approaching full employment, the quarterly bulletin says. There will a gradual growth in services prices as a result of this.

Consumer spending growth last year was broadly similar to that in 2018.
Strong export growth is expected to continue, although it was mainly focused in certain sectors such as pharmaceuticals, computer processors and computer services.
Growth in other sectors was more modest. Employment growth is also expected to slow down somewhat from previous strong growths.
The economic impact of a Brexit trade deal will depend on “how close or far” they are from the current arrangement, the Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf said today.
“But it seems likely and unsurprising that any future economic relationship between the EU and the UK will have more hurdles than the status quo,” Mahklouf said at the European Financial Forum.
He added that the economic impact of the coronavirus in China “adds to already existing uncertainties” worldwide.
“While it is premature to reach any conclusions, there is the potential for a negative shock to the growth of the international economy in the short-term,” he said.

THE EU AND the UK have said that “significant gaps” remain before a Brexit deal can be reached, with negotiators now expected to “work intensively” to try to reach an agreement.
In a statement released this afternoon following talks between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both sides said that the two leaders “agreed on the importance of finding an agreement, if at all possible, as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future”.
Both have “instructed their Chief Negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps” and promised to “speak regularly” about the issue.
No 10 issued an identical statement on behalf of Boris Johnson.
In atweet this afternoon, von der Leyen said it was a “good phone call”.

Before the meeting both Johnson and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister overseeing the Brexit process, struck a positive tone when asked about the prospects of a trade deal.
‘The tunnel’
Von der Leyen’s recent remarks that talks need to “intensify” sparked speculation an agreement could be reached before Johnson’s deadline of the EU Council meeting on 15 October.

According to the Financial Times, both sides are set to agree to further last-ditch discussions – dubbed “the tunnel” – in London as they look to finalise an agreement.
Johnson, speaking to reporters on a construction site visit in west London this morning, made the case for a Canada-style deal with the EU.
Canada’s agreement with Brussels eliminated most, yet not all, trade tariffs but offered little on financial services – one of the UK’s key sectors.
Johnson said: “I think there’s a good deal to be done and everybody knows what we want to do.
“The EU has done a deal with Canada which is a long way away, big country but some way away.
“Here we are, we’re the biggest trading partner of the EU, their biggest export market, plus we’ve been a member for 45 years – we want a deal like Canada’s, we want that one.”
But in a pre-warning of the blame game with Brussels that could come if there is no agreement, he said an Australian-style trading arrangement – a Downing Street code term for a no-deal arrangement – would be “their call”.
He added: “If that’s not possible (a Canada-style deal), and that wouldn’t be our call that would be their call, then the alternative is to have a deal like Australia, which is another big country, further away, but it would work well and we could make it work very well.”
Speaking at the Conservative Party’s virtual conference, Gove said the EU had found the process of the UK shifting to “become good neighbours rather than uncomfortable lodgers” to be “difficult”.
But the Vote Leave campaigner said he is “optimistic” about the prospects of a deal.
He said: “I suspect there will be one or two ups and downs along the way but I am optimistic that we will get a deal.

“But if we don’t, we have been making extensive preparations to be ready for anything.
“The British people voted for us to leave, we are determined to honour that.
“But obviously if we can secure a negotiated outcome and a free trade agreement, that would be hugely helpful for sectors of the economy.”
Von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in the Belgian capital on Friday, said she believes a deal is still possible but warned time is running out.
She said the “most difficult issues” – including fisheries and state aid rules – still have to be resolved if they are to get an agreement in place by the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December.
She said: “We are running out of time – around 100 days to the end of the year – so it is worth stepping up now.”
The UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost, in a statement issued after his meeting with EU counterpart Michel Barnier on Friday, said while the “outlines” of an agreement are “visible”, there are still “familiar differences” to be overcome.
“I am concerned that there is very little time now to resolve these issues ahead of the European Council on 15 October,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/whats-in-the-brexit-deal-5310613-Dec2020/,"THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF a post-Brexit trade deal being struck has been welcomed by politicians in the UK, EU and Ireland with much fanfare.
But what’s in it?
Although the full Agreement in Principle has not been published yet, the European Commissionhas published documentsgiving some details on what is in the trade deal, whilethe UK has published a summaryof the deal.
Among the issues that trade experts and stakeholders had been most concerned about were: rules of origin, customs arrangements, and whether there will be cooperation on security – on things like data and the European Arrest Warrant.
Here’s a broad-stroke glance at what is in the so-called ‘Trade and Cooperation Agreement’.
A general overview
At first glance, this is a hard Brexit deal – the UK is leaving the Single Market and Customs Union. After the 1 January:
Despite the customs checks, this trade deal means that there will be no tariffs or quotas on British goods going between the UK and the EU – the first time the EU has agreed to a zero-tariff, zero-quota deal.
From what has been published so far, the UK appears to have conceded on both fisheries and the level playing field, while the EU conceded on the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to decide on whether the trade deal has been breached in the future.
In the foreword of the UK’s summary document, which UK chief negotiator David Frost urged people to read, it states that there is “no role for EU law and no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice”.
European CommissionEuropean Commission

The level playing field
It appears that the UK has agreed to adhere to the EU’s request for a baseline of standards in relation to workers’ rights, the environment, and State aid.
The European Commission said that both parties signed up to “a robust” level playing field by maintaining high levels of protection in areas such as environmental protection, the fight against climate change and carbon pricing, social and labour rights, tax transparency and State aid.
There will also be “effective, domestic enforcement, a binding dispute settlement mechanism and the possibility for both parties to take remedial measures”.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said earlier that if the UK doesn’t adhere to these rules, they can enforce tariffs and quotas, adding “there will be a price to pay for that”.
The UK said it had committed to “high labour environment and climate standards without giving the EU any say over our rules”.
Fisheries
The UK conceded on fisheries. While the UK wanted a 35% reduction phased in over 3 years, and the EU wanted a 25% reduction over 6 years, what has been agreed is much closer to the EU’s requests.
In the UK documentation: “The Agreement provides for a significant uplift in quota for UK fishers, equal to25% of the value the EU catchin UK waters. This is worth £146m for the UK fleet phased inover five years.”
There will be also be an “adjustment period” which provide stable access for 5 ½ years.
Rules of origin
This will be a hotly-examined topic, and based on the documents published so far, we still don’t really know what’s involved.
The most important line published today is in the European Commission document, which says that in order “to facilitate compliance and cut red tape, the Agreement allows traders toself-certifythe origin of goods”.
It also states that it provides for ”full cumulation“, meaning traders can account not only for the originating materials used, but also if processing took place in the UK or EU.
Related ReadsBrexit trade deal agreed between EU and UK
This allows EU inputs and processing in UK products to be counted as UK input when exported to the EU, and vice versa.
According to UK documents: “The ambitious arrangements include facilitations on average pricing, accounting segregation for certain products, as well as all materials, and tolerance by value.
“The rules are also supported by predictable and low-cost administrative arrangements for proving origin.”
European Arrest Warrant
This is a key issue, particularly for Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK will be leaving the arrangement,as has been flagged perviously, but a different arrangement will replace it.
The UK document states that the deal provides for “streamlined extradition arrangements”, similar to those the EU has with Norway and Iceland, but with“appropriate further safeguards” beyond those in the European Arrest Warrant.
Elaborating on the benefits, it states:
“To streamline cooperation, the Agreement provides for direct transmission between judicial authorities, limited grounds for refusal and timelimited processes.
“Where extradition of own nationals from certain EU Member States is not possible due to their constitutional principles, we have ensured there is nevertheless a path to justice in every case, for example, by obliging EU Member States to refer cases to their own prosecution authorities.”
The Erasmus programme
UK citizens will no longer have access to that programme. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that this was the UK’s request.
Boris Johnson said the programme would be replaced by a worldwide scheme named after Bletchley Park code breaker Alan Turing.
The Irish government has ensured that citizens in Northern Irelandcan still take partin the Erasmus+ programme.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-verona-murphy-dara-murphy-election-4940600-Dec2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has admitted recent controversies involving Verona Murphy and Dara Murphy have caused “reputational damage” to Fine Gael.
However, he said he has made “tough decisions” to “clean things up”.
It was today confirmed that Verona Murphy has been dropped from Fine Gael’s general election ticket in Wexford.
She was criticised during the recent Wexford by-election campaign after linking asylum seekers to ISIS and calling for them to be “deprogrammed“.
Meanwhile, questions have been raised about Dara Murphy claiming expenses while primarily working in Brussels before his resignation as a TD earlier this month.

In an interview onVirgin Media One, Pat Kenny asked Varadkar if Fine Gael had been “tarnished” by the recent developments.
“The controversies around both of them and others have caused reputational damage for the party and I feel that very intensely and I know our party members and activists around the country feel that very intensely as well,” Varadkar said.
“Neither of the people you mentioned are going to be candidates for us in the next general election and I think that should say something,” he stated, adding that Fianna Fáil TDs involved in the recent ‘votegate‘ controversy in the Dáil are set to run for reelection.

“I’ve had to take tough decisions, and the right decisions, to clean things up.”
‘Very wrong and very hurtful’
Varadkar said Verona Murphy’s comments were “very wrong and very hurtful to some of our migrant communities”. He noted that she made a “full apology and retraction”, adding that Fine Gael “gave her more leeway that we would have others” because she was a first-time candidate.
The Taoiseach said his view of the situation changed when Murphy released a video claiming to be the victim of “a media conspiracy or a Dublin elite conspiracy”.
When asked if her views resonate with some people in Ireland, Varadkar said: ”I fear that may be the case but I hope not enough that we could see the emergence of a far-right party in Ireland.”
In relation to Dara Murphy, Varadkar claimed that the former Cork North Central TD was present for more Dáil votes in this calendar year than Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin.
However, Varadkar admitted that the current system around travel and accommodation expenses is “far too lax” and should be changed. He said Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe will carry out a “thorough review” of how that allowance works.
Varadkar added that Dara Murphy has questions to answer and the government is “trying to find a mechanism” under which an inquiry could be carried out. Under current rules an inquiry can only happen if Murphy agrees topresent himself for investigation.
Housing and health
Varadkar said he remains of the view that May 2020 would be the best time for a general election in Ireland but that it may happen sooner. “When that day comes we’ll be ready for it and we intend to win it,” he added.
The Taoiseach said he thinks the current government has achieved a lot but could do more “with a strong majority government” rather than the current Confidence and Supply Agreement with Fianna Fáil.

Varadkar said housing and health are “very much at the top of our agenda”.
“Housing is an issue of enormous concern to me, the fact that we haven’t been able to bring down homelessness is very distressing to me,” he said, adding that he knows many people are “offended” by the number of people – over 10,000 – who are homeless.
He said the government is building more social housing in a bid to address the issue, saying that 11,000 units will be delivered in 2020 and 12,000 in 2021.
He said he is also committed to reducing waiting lists and improving services in the health sector.

In terms of Brexit, Varadkar said it’s “very good” for Ireland that Phil Hogan, current European Commissioner for Trade and former Fine Gael minister, will be involved in trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union and he understands Irish needs.
Varadkar said the outcome of such talks will be crucial for the Irish economy and jobs, given the importance of our trading relationship with Britain.
The Taoiseach added that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is “bright” and “witty” but “a bit eccentric”.
He added that another areas of focus for the Irish government will be to get power-sharing up and running in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-house-of-lords-internal-market-bill-5261610-Nov2020/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Nov 2020
BORIS JOHNSON HAS suffered a major defeat over his controversial Brexit legislation, as peers staged votes to strip out powers that would enable ministers to break international law.
Conservative former leader Lord Howard of Lympne led the calls for the Prime Minister to “think again” and remove the contentious parts of the UK Internal Market Bill, warning that the Government is using the language of “law breakers” everywhere.
Cross-party amendments were tabled to strike out clauses linked to the most contentious part of the Bill, namely part five, which gives ministers the power to breach the Brexit divorce deal – known as the Withdrawal Agreement – brokered with Brussels last year.
The House of Lords voted 433 to 165, majority 268, to remove section 42 – one of the disputed clauses – and section 43 was removed without a vote.
This was the first of two expected votes to remove the relevant sections that make up part five.
Ministers have insisted powers to override the Withdrawal Agreement are needed to protect the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but critics argue the powers are not necessary.
Baroness Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, said in a statement: “I am sure some in Government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight’s historic votes in the Lords.
“To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law.
Peers went on to inflict a further defeat on the Government by 407 votes to 148, majority 259, stripping out a further contentious clause relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
All the other controversial provisions were removed without votes.
Legislation
The legislation aims to make changes to how trade will operate within the UK after it leaves the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union. This includes making decisions on Northern Ireland that are contrary to the Withdrawal Agreement it ratified this year.
Cross-party amendments were tabled to strike out clauses linked to the most contentious part of the Bill,‘Part Five’which gives a British minister the power to breach the Withdrawal Agreement and make unilateral decisions in relation to Northern Ireland without consulting the EU.
Peers were expected to take the unusual step of holding votes at committee stage (marked by a ‘C’ on this graphic) to remove these sections of the Bill, rather than waiting for report stage at the end of the process, signalling the level of opposition to the measures.
Ministers have insisted powers to override the Withdrawal Agreement are needed to protect the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but critics argue the powers are not necessary.
Speaking ahead of the expected votes, Howard said “nothing has changed” since Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted the Bill breaks international law in a “very specific and limited way”.

He said: “Since then, as far as I’m aware, no government minister has sought to resile from his words.
“Instead, what ministers have done, both in your Lordships’ House and elsewhere, is to seek to make the case that circumstances make it expedient to break international law.
Brexit-backer Howard went on: “There have been some suggestions that opposition to this part of the Bill is in some way the last charge of the Remainers.
“That suggestion has a very dangerous implication for those who advance it.
“It implies that only those who voted for us to remain in the European Union care about the rule of law, or the importance of keeping one’s words, or the sanctity of international treaties.
“Fortunately, I am in a position which enables me confidently to contradict that implication. I voted and campaigned for Brexit and I do not for one moment regret or resile from that vote.
“But I want the independent sovereign state that I voted for to be a country which holds its head up high in the world, that keeps its word, that upholds the rule of law and that honours its treaty obligations.”
Other contributions
Many unionists feel “deeply frustrated” about the proposed trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain at the end of the transition period, Nigel Dodds said.
The DUP’s former Westminster leader told the Lords: “Just as it is unacceptable to nationalists to have that border on the island of Ireland, it is equally unacceptable to create barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
“That is why we feel strongly that some of the emphasis on the Belfast Agreement that has been made in this House and other places has I think erred somewhat to emphasise one side of the situation.
“We must come to sensible, pragmatic arrangements.”
Independent crossbench peer Igor Judge, a former head of the judiciary, advised the House of Lords should be “neither complicit nor supine” and should vote against clauses in the Bill.
Richard Newby, Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, added: “If we can’t take a view on a matter of deliberate law-breaking by the government we may as well pack up our bags now.”
Tory Baroness Noakes said the Bill was a “responsible approach by the Government to protect the interests of the UK but particularly the interests of Northern Ireland”.
Tory former lord chancellor Lord Mackay spoke of his “shock” over the British government’s move and insisted the rule of law was a fundamental part of the UK’s constitutional arrangements.
Tory Lord Cormack said the law-breaking clauses in the Bill must go and threatened to vote against them “again and again” if necessary.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-david-frost-5157679-Jul2020/,"THE EU’S CHIEF Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost have said there was little-to-no progress made on the main stumbling blocks of post-Brexit trade talks – the level playing field provisions, and fisheries.
“It is unfortunately clear that we will not reach in July the ‘early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement’,” Frost saidin a statementafter the latest round of negotiations ended in London.
“The UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” Barnier saidin a press conferencethis afternoon, saying that the UK was refusing to commit to conditions on open and fair competition, and to a balanced agreement on fisheries.
This is the fifth bout of negotiations about the post-Brexit trading relationship between the EU and the UK. These negotiations also cover the Northern Ireland Protocol, security arrangements, and what body will oversee how any new deal would be implemented.
The level-playing field and fisheries
The largest stumbling blocks in post-Brexit trade talks, which began in the spring of this year, have been the level-playing field provisions and fisheries. On these issues, Barnier said today that the UK “did not show a willingness to break the deadlock”.

“On State aid, we have made no progress at all,” he said, adding that this was more worrying because they have no visibility on the UK’s future intentions. “The EU refuses to foot the bill for the UK’s choices.”
On fisheries, Barnier said that the UK was “effectively asking for near-total exclusion of EU vessels from UK waters”, which he said was “simply unacceptable” – though acknowledged that an agreement would likely mean “a change to the benefit of UK fishermen”.
Common stocks need to be managed jointly according to international law, Barnier said, adding that any agreement cannot lead to the “partial destruction” of the EU’s fishing industries.
“We have to agree to a balanced sustainable solution to fisheries,” he said.

Frost reiterated that the UK is looking for a trade deal similar to Canada – which he described as “an agreement based on existing precedents” – but the EU dismissed this before as not possible/comparable because of the UK’s proximity to the EU.
Frost said today: “We remain unclear why this is so difficult for the EU, but we will continue to negotiate with this in mind.
Related ReadsUK backtracking on key Brexit commitments, says Michel BarnierSo, about Brexit... Where are we now with it?
A tight timeline and uncertainty
Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month said he wanted British business to know by the end of July whether a deal was within striking distance or if they should start preparing for a messy no-deal split when the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December.
Barnier said today that he understood the urge for clarity in the short-term, but added that this wouldn’t be at the long-term cost of EU businesses.
Barnier and other EU figures have said that an agreement needs to be reached by October, in order to leave enough time to ratify the agreement in both Westminster and the European Parliament before the deadline of 31 December.
Frost said that “Despite all the difficulties, on the basis of the work we have done in July, my assessment is that agreement can still be reached in September, and that we should continue to negotiate with this aim in mind”.
Barnier concluded today:
This was the fifth round of talks, held in Brussels, the next round is being held in London and begins on 17 August.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-centenary-plans-events-shared-island-5248049-Nov2020/,"THE FIRST MAJOR announcement on what Northern Ireland’s centenary commemorations will look like could happen in the next couple of weeks, with millions of pounds in funding set to be provided to local groups and councils to prepare for a calendar of events.
Details of the commemorations, which are being led by the Northern Ireland Office, could be revealed as soon as the end of November, although some question why it’s taken so long for key plans to be organised.
TheJournal.ieunderstands that significant progress has been made on a ‘Shared History Fund’ – first mooted in the New Decade, New Approach deal thatrestored power-sharingin January – which will see millions of pounds in funding provided to projects seeking to explore and commemorate the creation of Northern Ireland next year.
It’s also understood that the first event may take place in December, to mark the date that theGovernment of Ireland Act– which formally created two parliaments on the island – gained royal assent.
Discussion over the centenary of Northern Ireland has proved somewhat muted so far, overshadowed by Covid-19, Brexit and the constitutional uncertainty facing Northern Ireland into the future. However, some aspects have already proven contentious.
Neither Sinn Féin or the SDLP are taking part in the Centenary Forum – a body convened by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonthat will lead discussionsover plans for the centenary celebrations.
And while early indications from the Centenary Forum – made up figures from politics, civil society and business –suggest that a special anniversary coinand an event at Belfast City Hall may be in the works, some members have expressed concern about the pace of planning as 2021 approaches.
“We have lost so much time,” DUP MP and the party’s forum representative Gavin Robinson toldTheJournal.ie.
“Without question. I’m frustrated we had the commitment from early January and didn’t have the first meeting until September,” he said.
Reflecting an anxiety among some members for faster progress as the centenary approaches, Robinson said that meetings have been moved from every two months to meeting every four weeks.
Robinson wasn’t alone in hoping that a calendar or preview of events is published sooner rather than later.
Ulster Unionist Party MLA Doug Beattie sits on the forum and said he personally believed it would make sense for the plans for 2021 to be published as soon as possible – either late this year or in early January.
One of the concerns, echoed in conversations with members of the forum, is that their role is essentially consultative – meetings consist of listening to officials from the Northern Ireland Office and considering their plans. Robinson said that the forum needed to be “more participative”.
“You get members who are keen to energise the process,” he said.
We have members who are keen to engage more regularly than the set piece meetings.”
Ian Marshall, a former unionist member of the Seanad, acknowledged similar concerns. “When you set up a forum, there is no point in setting up a talking shop,” he said.
Not everyone shared these concerns.
John McGrillen, the chief executive of Tourism NI, toldTheJournal.iethat the Northern Ireland Office was doing its best to ensure that voices from across society were heard.
“There will be a process where concepts and ideas of what could be done will be brought to the table and we’ll look at which ones have the greatest potential,” he said of the work of the forum.
Irish government
Concerns over the sensitivity of the anniversary are partly the reason two senior civil servants from the Department of Foreign Affairs have been given ‘observer status’ at the two meetings so far of the Centenary Forum.
The officials have been given this role alongside Elizabeth Trudeau, the US Consul General in Belfast.
Members of the forum said that the civil servants have proved useful in sharing insights and best practice on handling sensitive commemorations, although it’s understood that the officials – who are not part of the Shared Island Unit staff – largely answer questions and give guidance only where necessary.
“Officials from the Department have attended meetings of the Forum on an ad-hoc basis at the invitation of its Chairperson, to ensure good communication and sharing of experience, and remain available to attend future meetings if invited to do so,” a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Members of the forum toldTheJournal.iethat there could be a cross-border element to commemorations, although it remains unclear if theShared Island Unit– formally launched by Taoiseach Micheál Martin in October – would play any role in this.
Beattie said it was important that the plans for 2021 are handled carefully and in a way that avoids a “jingoistic, Rule Britannia approach”.
He said it would be “lovely to have all nationalists involved”.
Advertisement
“I guess the forum is not balanced, because it doesn’t have anyone from the SDLP or Sinn Féin. No one from that nationalist voice is there,” he said. He indicated that the Northern Ireland Office was still trying to persuade the two parties to get involved in the process.
“We understand it’s contentious for some,” he said. “We all get and we all understand that.”
But he stressed that for many people it will be a moment to celebrate. The aim, he said, was to recognise the role played by Northern Ireland as part of the UK.
He said events will be “aimed at spreading this beyond these shores, beyond Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom – so people understand it’s an integral part of the UK”.
Marshall echoed these comments.
“We have come through the 1916 commemoration, which for one section of society was difficult to deal with. This is another one of these events that we need to demonstrate that we’re a mature society.”
The DUP's Gavin Robinson believes that the SDLP and Sinn Féin should take part in the body planning centenary events.Liam McBurneyLiam McBurney
“We have one history, but two narratives,” he added.
Robinson said it was a missed opportunity for the nationalist parties.
“I think if they were to think about it properly, they should be engaged in the discussions.
“If they’re going to step back and say ‘it’s not for us but work away’, that’s great,” he added.
There is still time for nationalist representatives to join the forum. The body, which will only have met on a handful of occasions by the end of 2020, will remain active throughout 2021 – in part, members say, to ensure that events remain adaptable to the vagaries of the pandemic.
Tourism
For the tourism sector in Northern Ireland, which has been ravaged by Covid-19 and restrictions on travel, the centenary is an opportunity to “rebuild”, says McGrillen.
And if case numbers can be suppressed for a significant part of 2021, he hopes that the North can attract visitors from across the UK and Ireland.
“We want to take the opportunity to showcase Northern Ireland in other parts of the UK,” he said.
“We want to present what Northern Ireland is really like, as opposed to how people perceived Northern Ireland in the past.”
For this reason, McGrillen is stressing that the events should be forward-looking and not focused on the sectarian divides that dominated the last century in Northern Ireland.
“We have to give a nod to the past, but it’s more about the future,” he said.
One idea he’d like to see, Covid-19 permitting, would be a major concert of musicians from Northern Ireland – possibly in collaboration with Tourism Ireland.
And with thousands of Irish people travelling across the border for a holiday for the first time this year, McGrillen has hopes that the tourism market – aided by the focus on the centenary – may receive a much-needed boost.
Locally led
Most members of the Centenary Forum agreed that the Northern Ireland Office’s programme would act as an “umbrella” under which local groups and councils would be free to organise their own events.
“I think it’s kind of like putting an umbrella over the events that are going to happen,” Marshall said. “It’s an information-gathering exercise.”
In October, the Orange Orderannounced plansto celebrate the centenary – with a raft of events including a parade from Stormont and a fireworks display.
And while Northern Ireland Executive departments are expected to organise some events for 2021, the key role councils will play could lead to a patchwork of events and activity dependent on whether councils are unionist or nationalist-dominated.
This wasclearly demonstrated only last weekwhen Derry and Strabane City Council voted against marking the centenary of Northern Ireland.
“It isn’t for the Northern Ireland Office to do it all. They don’t control and wouldn’t seek to control events that will take place nest year,” Robinson said.

Other members agreed that the Northern Ireland Office was, by its very nature, somewhat aloof from the mood on the ground.
“I don’t think anyone is fully happy with the proposals,” said Luke Patterson, a member of the UK Youth Parliament.
“They are one-step removed,” he said. But he said he was hopeful that some planned events – like a tree-planting project – could help unite people from all backgrounds next year.
He said it was particularly important that young people, many of whom were born after the Troubles ended, are “given a chance to have their voices heard”.
“There are a number of events built into the programme about young entrepreneurs, young scientists, young politicians,” he said.
No one is under any illusion that the process of commemorating the creation of Northern Ireland could prove controversial.PAPA
Academics
In the same way that an expert advisory group was configured by the Irish government ahead of the Decades of Centenaries events, the Northern Ireland Office has created a Centenary Historical Advisory Panel populated by UK-based academics to provide guidance on the plans for the year ahead.
Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Robin Walker, described their role in early October as “bringing strong and independent academic rigour to our approach to marking this important anniversary”.
There have been some hopes that there might be co-operation and discussion between the bodies on both sides of the border.
The panel is chaired by Professor Paul Bew, an esteemed historian, member of the House of Lords, as well as aprominent unionistintellectual and commentator on Brexit.
A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office said: “A number of historians and academics from across the Republic of Ireland and the UK were approached although not all were able to commit to joining.”
The current panel represents a balance of perspectives and research interests. They are also exploring how they can collaborate more widely with historians and researchers across these islands.”
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Bew said that he already been in contact with Maurice Manning, who chairs the Irish expert advisory group. “We want as close an involvement with the Republic of Ireland as possible,” he said.
“The objective here is quite simply to have as liberal and broad ranging a view so people know, who are interested, what actually happened,” Bew said. “It’s not to gloss over the hard side of partition.”
“It is meant to be objective history and scholarly and not brush things under the carpet.”
The group’s primary focus will be to organise academic events to run during 2021. And while some cross-border events are likely to happen, none have so far been organised.
Bew also foresees a focus not just on the events around 1921, but a broader look at the history of Northern Ireland over the last century.
But he stressed that “the first thing you have got to get right is the circumstances of 1921″.
But not everyone believes the forum can be entirely inclusive.
Sinn Féin MP John Finucane said that his party had declined to take part in the forum when told by the UK government that the focus would be on celebrating the centenary of Northern Ireland.
“Where we would have difficulty is in framing this around a celebration. We really can’t see anything to celebrate at all,” Finucane said.
“We didn’t turn our backs and say no to this without getting clarity,” he said. “I don’t think being absent from the panel prevents us from recognising that people have a different narrative.”
While he understands and respects that unionists and others will want to mark the centenary in their own way, Finucane said that Sinn Féin would be recognising the creation of Northern Ireland with its own events.
To treat it purely as a celebration, he said, “ignores the reality of how partition came about and ignores the lived experience of people who grew up and lived and tried to survive here”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/helen-mcentee-brexit-withdrawal-bill-5225789-Oct2020/,"IRELAND WOULD FIND itself in a “very challenging situation” if the UK were to breach international law, the Justice Minister has said.
Helen McEntee made the comments when asked about the UK Government’s Internal Market Bill, which has overruled certain parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed with the EU last year.
This month the European Commission began legal action against the UK over elements of the legislation which it says undermined the “good faith” provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement.
Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the Bill and would be “in full contradiction” of and “flagrantly violate” the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Speaking at the Justice Committee this afternoon, McEntee said the UK had made commitments to additional checks with Northern Ireland under the protocol, which would protect the EU’s Single Market.
She said people would be “shocked and surprised” if the UK were to breach those commitments.
The minister told the committee: “Obviously we know that the first stage of the Internal Market Bill has been progressed and if it is implemented and we do find ourselves in that situation – it’s not something that’s being prepared for within my own department – but I do think we would find ourselves in a very challenging situation if the UK were to breach international law and if they were to breach an international agreement.

“We know that there are already checks on a certain amount of goods coming from in from the UK through Northern Ireland and into the south. That would not change even if this were to be implemented.”
She said the NI Protocol requires additional checks to “ensure the integrity of the single market”.
“It’s unfortunately not legislation that I’m working on within our department but it’s something that we would have to look at I’m sure, absolutely.”
The Justice Minister added that everyone would be “very shocked and surprised” if the UK breached its commitment.
The Northern Ireland Protocol, which forms part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Part of its solution to this problem is to keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK, creating new checks for trade across the Irish sea.
How these checks are implemented is still being negotiated at a joint committee between the UK and the EU.
While the UK has not stated its intention not to comply with these checks, the Internal Market Bill – if implemented – would give their ministers the power to overrule them, which would breach the internationally binding agreement reached last year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-boris-johnson-5200406-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2020
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has expressed his concern to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the UK government’s attempts to undermine the withdrawal agreement it agreed with the EU.
In a phone call this evening, the Taoiseach set out “in forthright terms his concerns about the latest developments in London on Brexit, including the breach of an international treaty, the absence of bilateral engagement and the serious implications for Northern Ireland,” a spokesperson said.
Martin also stressed to Johnson that the British government should re-engage with EU negotiators urgently.
It emerged earlier this week that the UK is planning to renege on elements of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that it agreed last year with the EU.
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis admitted yesterday the move would breach international law, and the move has caused alarm in Ireland and Europe.

Today, the British governmentpublished the proposed legislationthat would, if passed into law, unpick key parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
A spokesperson for Johnson defended the bill this afternoon, saying the deal reached in 2019 was written “at pace” in “the most challenging” circumstances. During the successful election campaign for the Conservatives in late 2019, Johnson had described the deal as “oven ready”.
In an interview with Sky News this evening, Martin said the move from the British had left Irish parliamentarians “aghast” and added he’d expressed his “deep disappointment” to Johnson during their phone call.
He also said there was a particular sense of anger over the comments from NI Secretary Brandon Lewis.
In the context of Northern Ireland, he said the move from the British government could “become very divisive” there at a time when “politics is settling down”.
Martin added that the move had “eroded trust” for negotiators and that “real political will” is needed to reach a deal between the EU and the UK.  At this time, he said he wasn’t optimistic a trade deal could be reached.
The Taoiseach had also expressed his concern about the move earlier today.

Martin said “meaningful negotiations can only proceed on the basis on mutual trust”.
“Unilateral actions which seek to change the operation of measures already agreed included in an International treaty and incorporated in domestic law do not build trust,” he said.
“Trust is fundamental in the conduct of any negotiations,” said the Taoiseach, conveying that he is “extremely concerned about the unilateral nature of the UK government’s actions”.
The government has also said amassive national effort will be neededto prepare for Brexit – regardless of whether or not there is a trade deal – with the transition period due to end at the beginning of 2021.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-government-approach-to-northern-ireland-protocol-5149465-Jul2020/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S lack of understanding and overly political approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland has left businesses in the dark, a Westminster committee has claimed.
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee condemned the government for leaving businesses ill-prepared for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December.
The committee’s findings come after members conducted an inquiry into theNorthern Ireland protocol– the element of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement that will see Northern Ireland operate under different trading rules to the rest of the UK.
Under the terms of the protocol, which is designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland, NI will be a part of the UK’s customs territory but will still follow EU customs law and administer the bloc’s customs rules at its ports.
The region will also follow EU single market regulations on goods.
The British government has acknowledged this will mean more regulatory checks on some goods entering NI from the rest of the UK, with the expansion of infrastructure to carry out sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) screening of animals and food products.
But the government has insisted there will be no new physical customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
Details on the report
A report by the committee, which is made up of Conservative, Labour, SDLP, Alliance and DUP MPs, criticised the government’s plans and questioned its claim that NI companies will have unfettered access to the Great Britain market from 2021 onwards.
The MPs called on ministers to provide more detail to businesses on trading arrangements by 1 October.
The committee report said businesses should also be reimbursed for the cost of protocol compliance.
It also called on the British government to lay out a “plan B” for ensuring unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the event the UK and EU fail to strike a comprehensive trade deal ahead of the end of the transition period.
Committee chairman Simon Hoare said: “Political process must not trump the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.
“The Government may be able to wait until the wire for clarity on customs arrangements, but business cannot.
“It’s now time for them to get that clarity, and they must have it by October 1.

“If not, business will not have time to prepare for the realistic prospect of friction and delays to products moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
“This will increase their costs, with an accompanying increase in the cost of living.
“Such frictions would be incompatible with the notion of ‘unfettered access’ touted by Government ministers.
“It would put Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage compared with the rest of the UK and would damage business confidence at a time when it has seldom been lower.
“If this happens, business must be reimbursed for the cost of complying with the Northern Ireland Protocol.”
Struggle
Hoare highlighted that many businesses were already struggling as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
“There is no need, and no reason, to add insult to injury for political gain,” he said.
“The government needs to stop gambling with the future of business and of the people of Northern Ireland.
“Instead, it must set out detailed and realistic proposals on how customs processes will work and which goods will be affected.
“Unfettered access was promised, but it looks less and less likely that it will be delivered.
“Northern Ireland is part of the UK, and it must not experience particular disadvantage because of Brexit.”
Responding to the report, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “We are engaging intensively with businesses and the Executive in Northern Ireland and will set out further guidance later this month.
“We have set out our clear approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol which will uphold the gains of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, protects the place of Northern Ireland in the UK’s customs territory and ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland.
“This would guarantee unfettered access for Northern Ireland’s goods across the UK, no tariffs on goods moving within the UK, and no new physical customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
“We will formally respond to the Committee’s report in due course.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-negotiations-5237247-Oct2020/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Oct 2020
BREXIT NEGOTIATORS DAVID Frost and Michel Barnier spoke today in an effort to revive trade talks, even as the British side hardens its rhetoric with discussions still ongoing.
The negotiations are in limbo after a summit of European Union leaders last week failed to produce a breakthrough and Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the UK on notice to prepare for a no-deal outcome.
Downing Street stressed that if no deal is in place by the end of the year – when the current transition arrangements end – the UK will not return to the negotiating table in 2021.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “If the EU change their position then we will be willing to talk to them.
“But they must be ready to discuss the detailed legal text of a treaty in all areas.”
EU leaders must also be committed to a resolution that “respects UK sovereignty and independence”.
“If not, we will end the transition period on Australian terms,” the spokesman said.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that the difference between a no-trade deal outcome and “Australian terms” is a matter of “semantics”.
He told LBC: “The Australia deal is the deal that you have with countries where you are predominantly working on a WTO (World Trade Organisation) basis.”
Asked if the “Australia deal” is another term for a no-deal situation, Sharma said: “It depends – you can use the phrase ‘no deal’, but the point is there is a deal.”
He added: “It’s a question of semantics at the end of the day, sure.
“There are two very clear approaches to this: we can either go down the route of doing the sort of arrangement that the EU has with Australia, the other is that we can do it down the Canada route.”
Sharma said: “We have always been very clear that we want to leave on a Canada-style trade deal.”
Meanwhile, face-to-face talks took place in London this morning between Cabinet minister Michael Gove and his opposite number on the UK-EU joint committee, Maros Sefcovic, to discuss issues around the Brexit divorce deal.
Sefcovic said it was a “very constructive meeting” and that the EU would work until “the last minute” to get a trade deal.
The major stumbling blocks remain access for EU boats to UK fishing grounds and the “level playing field” to ensure fair competition – including any state subsidies that the Government might seek to give firms.

The developments came as the British government launched a “time is running out” campaign urging businesses to get ready for the end of the transition period on 31 December, regardless of whether a trade deal is in place.
Businesses, increasingly concerned about the high tariffs of a no-deal exit, called on both sides to find a compromise for a deal.
Confederation of British Industry deputy director-general Josh Hardie warned of a “hat-trick of unprecedented challenges” from the first wave of coronavirus, its resurgence and “uncertainty over the UK’s trading relationship with the EU”.
Meanwhile, the UK’s five Anglican archbishops intervened to criticise the Government’s controversial new Brexit legislation as setting a “disastrous precedent”, in a letter to the Financial Times ahead of a Lords debate.
Led by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, they said the UK Internal Market Bill has “enormous moral, as well as political and legal, consequences” by paving the way for a breach of international law by overriding parts of the Withdrawal Agreement with Brussels.
Number 10 urged peers – including Church of England bishops sitting in the Lords – to back the UK Internal Market Bill.
“We consider the UKIM Bill to be vital,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.
“It was passed with the support of the House of Commons and we believe it is a necessary legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-5223304-Oct2020/,"THE UK PRIME Minister Boris Johnson has said a UK-EU trade deal is “there to be done” but said the UK could “prosper mightily” if no deal is reached, as the two sides agreed to intensify talks.
Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference yesterday to take stock of progress in the negotiations following the final scheduled round of talks between Brussels and the UK this week.
Following their conversation on Saturday, the pair have tasked their chief negotiators with working “intensively” to resolve the remaining differences in the post-Brexit trade talks.
Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Johnson said: “I think it’s there to be done. Alas, there are some difficult issues that need to be fixed.
“There is no question that the EU needs to understand that we’re utterly serious about needing to control our own laws and our own regulations.
“And similarly they need to understand that the repatriation of the UK’s fisheries which were lost in 1973 is very important.”

Fishing rights, state aid and governance continue to be vexed issues between the two sides as they look to ratify a new trading relationship before the transition period ends on 31 December.
Responding to a comment made by Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte that a UK-EU trade deal is a “geopolitical necessity,” Johnson told the BBC: “Good for Mark, in which case I hope that they’ll agree to the deal that we’ve set out.
“I hope that they’ll agree to the deal that we’ve set out because it’s a very good deal for the EU.
“All we’re asking our friends and partners to offer is terms that they’ve already offered to Canada which is you know a long way away from here.
“We’re very close to our European friends and partners, we’ve been members of the EU for 45 years, I see no reason why we shouldn’t get those sorts of terms.”
He added: “I don’t want the Australian-WTO type outcome, particularly, but we can more than live with it.”
UK negotiatorLord Frost tweetedfollowing the leader’s statement to confirm that discussions with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier would “begin as soon as we can next week”.

But in the weekend’s joint statement between Downing Street and the European Commission, there was no mention of a target date for a resolution.
“The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, spoke today about the state of play in the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” they said.
“They agreed on the importance of finding an agreement, if at all possible, as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future.
“They endorsed the assessment of both chief negotiators that progress had been made in recent weeks but that significant gaps remained, notably but not only in the areas of fisheries, the level playing field, and governance.
“They instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps.
“They agreed to speak on a regular basis on this issue.”
The shared decision by Johnson and von der Leyen to intensify the talks could pave the way for what is dubbed “the tunnel”, where the negotiating teams enter a media and briefing-free blackout in a bid to work out compromises on the outstanding differences.

His comments came as Downing Street disclosed that the government isto legislateto prevent MPs extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020.

Ministers are re-working the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) – due to come before the Commons this week – to “legally prohibit” any further extension while talks on a free trade agreement continue.
Opposition parties said the move was putting the UK on course for a “cliff-edge” no-deal break with the EU in just 12 months’ time.
Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: “This Tory Government’s reckless approach to Brexit will send the country straight off the no-deal cliff.
“The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU.”
Addressing Cabinet, Johnson sought to drive home his message that the government must now repay the trust of the voters who returned the Tories to power – many of them having voted Conservative for the first time in their lives.

“That’s what they want us to do and we must recognise that people lent us their votes at this election.
“It was quite a seismic election but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out, to deliver on this,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-1-brexit-bounce-5001044-Feb2020/,"OVER THE COURSE of the election campaign, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his Fine Gael party placed Brexit front and centre as a reason why people should reelect the government.
Varadkar argued that his team was best placed to negotiate a good deal for Ireland in the second phase of Brexit negotiations, which will be trade talks, beginning either this or next month.
In the run-up to polling day, Varadkar had questioned Fianna Fáil’s front-bench ability and experience to be able to handle those trade negotiations. He also suggested that switching over to a different government in the middle of negotiations could cause instability.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin hit back at this by saying that there was no shortage of experience within his party – Martin himself is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.
He also argued that the entire European Commission is comprised of new members, and the British government has also been shaken up numerous times, meaning that a change of team shouldn’t disrupt negotiations.
So how did that argument play out with voters?
In the Ipsos/MRBI poll commissioned by RTÉ, TG4, the Irish Times and UCD, just 1% said that Brexit was the most important issue in deciding how they voted.
Among voters aged over 50, in Dublin, and male voters, this percentage share increased to 2%, but still bottom of a long list of other issues including childcare, the pension age, and climate change.
Among Fine Gael voters, Brexit was the most important issue in deciding their vote in 5% of cases.
The Brexit leadership
The Taoiseach became the first in the history of the State not to top the poll in his own constituency. He’s also the first Taoiseach since the ’80s not to bring his running mate over the line.

In the end, it took until the fifth count for Varadkar to get elected.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was elected on the eighth count, taking the third of four seats in Cork South-Central.
Helen McEntee
The Minister of State for European Affairs has been a prominent figure within the European Union’s institutions, particularly during Brexit negotiations.
Over the years, she’s appeared alongside Varadkar and Coveney on the world stage, giving updates on the various stages of Brexit, stressing the importance of the backstop, and explaining the inner workings of the EU.
This would have raised McEntee’s profile considerably and helped her get reelected; after the third count in Meath East, junior minister McEntee had double the votes of Cabinet minister Regina Doherty.
In 2019,Politico wrote a profile pieceon McEntee, calling her Varadkar’s “secret weapon”, saying she was “extremely level-headed,” and “a very very good negotiator”.
In November, McEntee was elected as Vice-President of the European party that Fine Gael is a member of in the European Parliament – the European People’s Party (EPP).
The President of that party is former European Council President Donald Tusk, who tweeted out his support for McEntee during the election campaign – calling her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”.

Neale Richmond
Former senator Neale Richmond has been incredibly vocal on Brexit issues at home and abroad. As chair of the Seanad Select Committee on the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, which published a report based on the committee appearances of various stakeholders, he was very well versed on Brexit issues.
He has appeared many times on UK and other international media to explain Ireland’s stance at various key points along the Brexit timeline.

Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers, one of the most prominent frontbenchers the party has. Chambers had been very prominent on national media on various Brexit issues.
Despite this, she lost her seat in Mayo today, partly because of the Sinn Féin surge. After Michael Ring topped the poll in the Fine Gael heartland, Sinn Féin senator Rose Conway-Walsh came second – an unexpected result.
Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary won the third seat, and Fine Gael’s Alan Dillon beat chambers to the fourth and final seat.
As the opposition’s Brexit spokesperson, her profile wouldn’t have benefitted as much as those who are in government.
Where are we with Brexit anyway?
The first phase of Brexit negotiations involved agreeing the conditions upon which the UK would leave the EU.
The agreement that was struck at the end of this first phase, the Withdrawal Agreement, includes the transition period and Irish protocol.
The transition period is the stage we are in at the moment – this keeps the UK in the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market until the end of this year.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hoping that a trade deal can be done between now and then; that trade deal would then come into effect after the transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020 but can be extended for one year or two.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-drivers-licences-trade-brexit-5227452-Oct2020/,"AROUND 17,000 HOLDERS of British driving licences resident in Ireland are being asked to exchange their driver licences for Irish ones as soon as possible, as they expect a last-minute surge in applications in the next two and a half months.
At 11pm on 31 December, the Brexit transition period ends and the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. After this period a number of changes come into force, including British driver licences no longer being legally recognised by Irish authorities.
There are an estimated 70,000 UK licence holders resident in Ireland.
In response to a Parliamentary Question posed by Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond, the Minister for Transport said that they expect that 10,000-17,000 people will exchange their British licences to an Irish one by the end of December.
Since 2018, the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) said that around 53,000 UK licences have been exchanged for the Irish version.
In a statement, the Rathdown TD said that “a potential 17,000 UK licence holders [are] vulnerable to losing their driving privileges come January”.

This will not impact on those visiting Ireland, Richmond said.
How to exchange your licence
Drivers do not have to resit their test in order to exchange their UK licence.
To exchange your licence, you need to fill out a licence application form and present this, a €55 fee and your UK licence at any of the 36 NDLS centre. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, you mustbook an appointmentwith an NDLS centre.
The NDLShas saidthat it is important to take steps now to exchange your UK/NI licence as there may be further delays caused by a last-minute increase in applications, plus extra demand on the service caused by Covid-19.
“Exchanging your UK licence is an easy and straightforward way to protect yourself from the impact of Brexit come January,” Richmond said.
The Road Safety Authority is running a public information campaign in a last-minute attempt to encourage those who need to exchange their licence to do so soon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-this-week-16-november-5268634-Nov2020/,"WE’RE A MONTH on from the initial deadline that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid down, and two weeks on from the deadline the European Union had set.
And from the outside, we’re no closer to a post-Brexit trade deal.
ThevirtualEuropean Council meeting on Thursday of this week is seen as the latest deadline for an outcome to the trade talks – but many take the view that there is too much work left to have it all agreed in a neat package by the end of the week.
Talks have been crawling forward since the summer, and though there has been somevague talkfrom the UK side of “progress in a positive direction in recent days”, not all that much has changed in the last few months.
British chief negotiator David Frost still says the deal must respect “the sovereignty of the UK”, while the EU’s Michel Barnier is calling for one that respects the EU’s autonomy and protects its Single Market and Customs Union.

The three main stumbling blocks that have ground talks to a halt have been:
The reason they cannot agree on these issues comes down to the same issue, mentioned above: the UK’s pursuit of sovereignty,versusthe EU’s attempt to protect its Single Market and Customs Union,versusconcerns for Northern Ireland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney said at the weekend that this was “move week”, where some action needed to be taken, if progress were to be made at all.
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said that there are still “large gaps” between the two sides on the level-playing field and fisheries.
“The UK isn’t happy with the level of access that the EU wants, but 70% of the value of its catch and 50% of its quantity is sold into the Single Market,” he toldTheJournal.ie.

Richmond said that one area where progress has been made is the legal drafting that has been done.
Where are talks at now?
Twitter / Michel BarnierTwitter / Michel Barnier/ Michel Barnier
The UKleft the EUon 31 January of this year. Its MEPs left the European Parliament, the UK has no Commissioner in the European Commission, and it isn’t a part of, for example, the EU’s initiative to buy Covid-19 vaccine doses and distribute them.
The UKis still inthe Customs Union and Single Market, meaning citizens and businesses are still availing of the four freedoms of the European Union (movement, capital, goods and services).
This period from 31 January-31 December 2020 is known as the transition period.
During this time, the EU and UK were to strike a trade deal that would replace the UK’s membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, and importantly, figure out how trade would work for Northern Ireland without the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The transition period would also give businesses time to prepare themselves for whatever changes would come down the track, it was planned.
When asked about the government’s campaign to make people aware of those Brexit changes, Richmond said the message was a difficult sell at this stage.
The Leavers have left
After it emerged that Dominic Cummings – credited with being the architect behind the Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum – and his Brexit colleague Lee Cain would be leaving No 10 Downing Street, many political commentators are claiming that this paves the way for Boris Johnson to soften his negotiation stance and agree a trade deal with the EU.
This cohort of commentators includes Nigel Farage.
“The Leavers are leaving Downing Street,” the arch Brexiteer and former leader of both UKIP and the Brexit Partytold talkRADIO.

After saying that it was “very likely” that there would be a “pro-Brussels, pro-Dublin” president of the United States (referring to Joe Biden’s election win), Farage said: “I had this terrible sinking feeling over the weekend that Boris is very close to selling out on Brexit.”
There had been some suggestions that if Donald Trump had been reelected, Johnson would continue a hard line on post-Brexit trade talks. But without the man who referred to him as “Britain Trump” in office, Johnson would be less inclined to be so brave.
Though US president-elect Joe Biden may not be as close to the EU as some may hope, he and the Democrats have voiced support for the Good Friday Agreement; Taoiseach Micheál Martin even said that he mentioned it in their first phone call since the election.
Richmond says that Cummings and Cain are “less important” to Brexit talks than people may think, as they were “internal operators”.
The Internal Market Bill
Then there’s the tricky Internal Market Bill.
The UK has proposed a Bill that would give a British minister control to give State aid to Northern Ireland businesses without consulting the EU, as well as decide what goods travelling from GB to NI would need custom declaration forms.
This is contrary to the Withdrawal Agreement that was struck between the EU and UK, and ratified by Westminster in January of this year.
As it stands, the UK House of Lords havevotedto remove two clauses from the Bill that relate to Northern Ireland.
Coveneytold Sky Newsat the weekend:
“Even if we do get a new trade deal negotiated by both sides, if the British Government is determined to continue with their Internal Market Bill – to reintroduce parts of that Bill that were removed by the House of Lords this week – then, I think this is a deal that won’t be ratified by the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ibec-covid-supports-5205495-Sep2020/,"EMPLOYERS GROUP Ibec has called on the Government to introduce measures to tackle youth unemployment, as well as preparing for the fallout of a possible no-deal Brexit, in its pre-Budget 2021 submission.
The group outlined a number of measures it sees as central to supporting businesses and the economy over the coming year, including the establishment of Covid-19 employment supports beyond April 2020 when the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is due to finish.
It specifically called for tax measures to encourage investment in and by SMEs and improvements to the existing Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) “so that firms avoid a ‘cliff-edge’ effect once they hit 70% of normal turnover”.
As the Brexit saga rumbles on this week with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson trying to renege on the Withdrawal Agreement he signed off on last year, Ibec has insisted the Government must further Brexit proof Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
In its submission, it called for “a suite of measures including expanding the EWSS to Brexit impacted companies, introducing State-backed export credit insurance, and direct supports for export promotion and critical investment”.
In terms of the recent increase in employment as a result of the public health crisis, Ibec is asking for “supports focused  on youth unemployment and severely impacted regions” and “funding for activation and hiring schemes, such as JobsPlus, untilunemployment falls below 6% and €400m to increase funding for, and recapitalise, higher education”.
The total cost of the measures proposed is thought to be around €6 billion, Ibec said.

Ibec Director of Policy and Public Affairs, Fergal O’Brien said: “The scale of the challenge facing us from both Covid-19 and Brexit means that the economy will need ongoing support in 2021.
“The significant, but temporary, income supports currently in place are providing life support to many sectors and jobs across the economy.
“The Government has provided €20 billion in direct support to the economy in 2020. As those supports are withdrawn, in the first half of 2021, it is important that they are not all withdrawn at once. The economy is not yet ready to carry itself.”
Many sectors are continuing to struggle back to their feet following the prolonged national lockdown earlier this year.
The hospitality sector has been one of those worst-hit and yesterday expressed concern after the reopening of so-called wet pubs in Dublin was postponed once again.
O’Brien added: “This new set of economic supports should be based around a comprehensive and targeted Covid recovery package for the worst impacted sectors and a clear plan to help protect sectors worst exposed to a difficult Brexit.
“The domestic unemployment crisis will require significant further measures to incentivise hiring and investment to get people back to work along with a policy package to ensure our export model is primed to deliver strong export growth in the years ahead.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-theresa-may-security-post-brexit-5238160-Oct2020/,"FORMER BRITISH PRIME Minister Theresa May poured scorn on her successor Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit security commitments as she warned of the dangers of a no-trade deal scenario to anti-terrorism attempts.
The former Tory leader repeatedly said “what?” in disbelief at senior Tory minister Michael Gove’s response to her question about how the UK will be expected to boost its security measures when outside the EU.
Gove claimed there are “many, many areas” in which the UK can co-operate “more effectively” to protect its borders outside the EU “than we ever could inside”.
It was at this part of his response that promptedMay’s reaction of disbelief, where she appeared to mouth “utter rubbish” at his reply.
Speaking in the Commons, May warned: “The government appears resigned to the prospect of no deal, yet one area which they should not be resigned to the prospect of no deal is in security.”
May said neither Gove nor Johnson had mentioned security in recent statements.

Addressing Gove in the House of Commons today, she added:
Gove said “significant progress” has been made over security co-operation, and made three main points, the second of which prompted the reaction from May:
“The second thing I’d say is there are many, many areas in which we can co-operate more effectively to safeguard our borders outside the European Union than we ever could inside, through a variety of methods and arrangements open to us, open to Border Force and open to our security and intelligence services – we can intensify the security that we give to the British people.
“The third thing I’d say to [May] is that I agree with her: when it comes to everything, security and other matters, no deal is better than a bad deal.”
‘No deal is better than a bad deal’ had been one of Theresa May’s mantras during her turbulent tenure as British Prime Minister.
Once used as a threat to force the EU’s hand into giving in to some of the UK’s demands, May later ended up as a proponent of a Brexit draft deal, which contained the controversial ‘backstop’, that was rejected by the House of Commons three times.
After Boris Johnson won a majority for the Tories in a general election last year, the draft bill, with some changes, was passed and ratified by Westminster, allowing Brexit to officially happen on 31 January this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-ports-north-boris-johnson-uk-5115324-Jun2020/,"A SENIOR OFFICIAL has warned that there are just three weeks to finalise plans for post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports.
Measures must be in place to carry out checks on goods moving between the North and Great Britain after the UK leaves the EU to comply with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Northern Ireland’s chief vet Robert Huey told Stormont’s agriculture committee that in order to secure approvals for border check processes by the end of the transition period, the application needs to be completed by 24 June, 2020.
He told MLAs he wanted to set expectations, adding that “a smooth end to transition is no longer possible – that can’t be delivered”.
“Let’s start with that realisation. What we are trying to deliver is a minimal viable product to keep product moving, to keep food on shelves on January 1, 2021 – that’s how serious it is,” he said.
“The last date to go to the European Commission to expect them to do the work they need to do to designate border control posts was 31 March, but they’ve given us an extension through to the end of June. That work has to be done in effect by 23/24 June.”
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Permanent Secretary Denis McMahon told MLAs there are around 200 lorries entering Northern Ireland from the UK every day.
He explained officials are working on plans to extend current facilities at ports into EU approved border control posts.

McMahon said officials have met with Larne, Belfast, Warrenpoint, Foyle sea ports and the two main airports, and are working seven days a week on the application.
“We have a lot of work to do and a very short amount of time to do it in,” he said.
He said a paper was published by the UK government on 20 May was the first “clear mandate” and “clarity of the UK government’s position”.
“We’re now moving from information gathering to active delivery planning in anticipation we will need to move quickly,” he said.
McMahon said officials need support from both the UK government and EU to “make this work”.
“The UK government has confirmed it will provide the Northern Ireland Executive with support and expertise to deliver the project but this is not the only support we need,” he said.
“Importantly the success of this project is not entirely within our control. We will need the help of both the UK government and the EU to make this work, and they will need to help us work through these issues over the coming weeks and months.
“Basically the simpler the processes while maintaining biosecurity, promoting public health and complying with the law, the more likely we will be able to succeed in our aim of reducing trade friction.”
McMahon said 60% of UK food imports are from the EU and 70% of the retail food supply to Northern Ireland comes from Great Britain, adding “to put it bluntly, we all need to make this work”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/big-ben-brexit-4969196-Jan2020/,"AN ONLINE FUNDRAISING campaign seeking to have Big Ben chime to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on 31 January has raised more than £160,000.
Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £164,000 (€192,497) of its £500,000 target fromalmost 11,000 donors on the GoFundMewebsite by Friday afternoon.
The campaign has been shared more than 27,000 times online, according to the page.
Those who wish to celebrate the UK leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament confirmed that the Union flag which flies above the building will be lowered after Britain’s exit and sent to the House of European History.
However, a spokesman said there would not be a flag-lowering ceremony to mark the occasion.
“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but, because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and MP Mark Francois said.
“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”
Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell – which has been silent since 2017 – back into operation.
The House of Commons authorities have also seemed to reject the idea that the fundraising would make a difference.
The House of Commons Commission said it would be an “unprecedented approach” to fund the cost through public donations and “any novel form of funding would need to be consistent with principles of propriety and proper oversight of public expenditure”.
Parliamentary sources said the commission would not consider any request for the bell to be sounded unless MPs had voted on it in the Commons – and the Government controls the business in the House.

In a video posted on the fundraising site, Francois said he is “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.
He added that the campaign hopes to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom – what the Prime Minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.
Francois said it is “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.
He finished his appeal by saying: “Please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again.”

When the fundraiser passed £100,000, Ryan and Francois posted a message on the site saying they were “very pleased to hear the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, state this morning – in relation to our campaign – that Parliament ‘shouldn’t look gift horses in the mouth’”.
They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.
Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Francois, while Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.
There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow”, but these were all thought likely to be fake names.
Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.
Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”
Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside Parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on 31 January.
“It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nicola-sturgeon-brexit-scotland-wrong-direction-5311011-Dec2020/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT is “forcing” Scotland in the “wrong direction” with Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon has said.
The Scottish First Minister, speaking as the deal on the future relationship between the UK and the European Union (EU) waspublished, complained that promises made to the country’s fishing sector had been “broken”.
She insisted it was “extraordinary” that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had decided to “inflict a hard Brexit” on the UK in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession.
Sturgeon spoke out on the issue after the Scottish Government warned the agreement reached by the Prime Minister could cost Scotland £9 billion by 2030.
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK Government had struck a “fantastic deal”, as he added that coastal communities would be able to “thrive outside the EU’s unfair Common Fisheries Policy”.
His comments came after analysis by the Scottish Government indicated GDP could be reduced by about 6.1%, compared to staying in the EU.
With Scotland having voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum, Sturgeon stressed that Brexit was happening “against the wishes of most people in Scotland” and said it would “hit jobs and living standards at the worst possible time”.
Writing in The Times newspaper, she said: “An extension to the present arrangements with the EU was on offer earlier this year but the UK Government refused it.
“And while no deal would have been worse, Mr Johnson’s deal spells short-term disruption and long-term barriers.”
The Scottish First Minister claimed that as a result of the new arrangements “our people will be less safe and they will lose their right to work, study and live elsewhere in Europe”.
She continued: “We are to be taken out of the EU’s single market. Promises made to our fishing communities have been broken.”

Sturgeon said that leaving the EU was “yet another example of Tory governments forcing Scotland in the wrong direction”.
But she said if Scotland became independent and was able to rejoin the trading block it could be a “bridge-builder between the UK and the EU”.
The Scottish Government fears that lamb and beef exports will be hard hit by the extra costs of exporting to the EU after December – when the current transition period ends.
Meanwhile businesses trying to access EU markets will face additional bureaucracy and costs, with the Scottish seafood sector requiring new certificates and changes to business practices to continue to export to the EU.
On the key Scottish fishing industry, the Scottish Government fears the fleet north of the border will only see a fraction of the additional quota promised.
Another concern raised by Scottish ministers is that justice and security co-operation could be seriously impacted.
But Alister Jack said that after “a long and tough negotiation” with the EU, the UK had “secured a fantastic deal”.
Writing in The Times, he said: “This is great news for Scottish businesses and families.
“Having delivered a deal for the whole of the UK in record time, there are opportunities ahead. It is the first time the EU has ever agreed a zero-tariff, zero-quota deal, giving Scotland’s businesses exceptional access to the EU.”
The UK Government minister continued: “Our agreement will ensure that our coastal communities will thrive outside the EU’s unfair Common Fisheries Policy.
“We will invest in our fishing communities and restore the fleet so our fishermen can catch more fish. The Scottish fish processing sector will benefit from tariff-free access to EU markets.
“Products from Scotch whisky to Orkney cheddar will be protected in the EU. And the deal meets the UK’s commitment to high standards, reflecting the importance that we place on being a leader in quality and standards.”
He said: “This is a historic moment for all of the UK. It’s time for us to come together and make the most of the new opportunities.”

THE FINE GAEL MEP who went viral after cutting off Nigel Farage’s microphone in the European Parliament has said some of his colleagues disagreed with his actions.
Mairead McGuinness, who is First Vice-President of the European Parliament, turned off Farage’s mic mid-sentence during a speech about Britain leaving the EU on Wednesday, fordisobeying parliament rulesby waving a Union flag.
In the clip McGuinness can be heard saying: “Please sit down, resume your seats, put your flags away, you’re leaving.
“And take them with you if you’re leaving now. Goodbye.”
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
The video immediately went viral on social media with both criticism and praise for McGuinness, who said she was duty bound by the rules of the chamber to cut off the Brexit Party leader.
“The reason I cut the mic off was to stop a circus, it’s a parliament, not a circus,” she said.

“Politics is a serious business and Nigel Farage has used the platform of our parliament to destroy the European Union.
“If by doing what I did reinforces the dignity of the parliament, that’s my job.
“I would say that afterwards, some of the people in his grouping came over and said that they disliked what he did and that he did it.
“When you’re not in the chamber it can be hard to judge the moment, but I have to judge the moment carefully, and we have a rule in the house that no flags are to be shown except the two behind the podium, and the president insists on that, and I’m under orders.”
Not the last of Farage
On whether she would miss Farage in the parliament, McGuinness said Europe should be worried that this is not the end of Farage.
“I don’t think I’ve seen the back of him. Because I think he’s going to continue, just not in the European Parliament,” she said.
“If you listen to what Nigel Farage says, he’s not going to stop now, he’s not retiring, he’s going to keep going not just in the UK but right throughout the European Union, so the challenge we face might be greater from a European perspective.
“I’m sure Nigel doesn’t care whether I miss him or not. On the wider level I think we’ll miss the UK colleagues hugely, particularly those who are from the pro-European parties.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-northern-ireland-5120868-Jun2020/,"MINISTER FOR EUROPEAN Affairs Helen McEntee has said the detail in the Northern Ireland protocol is vague and does not provide enough information around customs and tariffs, as Brexit negotiations continue.
The protocol contained in the Withdrawal Treaty is the arrangement by which Northern Ireland continues to follow single market rules for goods and administers the EU’s customs code at its ports.
The British government has acknowledged that regulatory checks will be needed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, with the expansion of infrastructure to carry out screening of animals and food products.
It has also insisted there will be no new physical customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
McEntee told the Dáil yesterday that the Irish government welcomed the UK publishing its own approach to implementing the protocol but said concerns remain.
“In terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, I am not saying there has been backsliding on it so far. However, what has been presented so far, is not adequate and does not provide enough information,” McEntee stated.
“It is very welcome that the UK has provided a paper because it now recognises the need for some form of checks going from the UK into Northern Ireland particular on animal products and SPS. However around customs, tariffs and VAT – there is not much detail.

“The paper has some positive elements to it and I welcome the clear recognition for the need for checks on agri-foods entering Northern Ireland and for the new border control infrastructure.”
McEntee called on the UK government to “provide the technical detail necessary to make the protocol fully operational by the end of the year”.
The Irish government will be intensifying Brexit preparedness work given the limited progress in Brexit talks to date, she added.
“Whatever the outcome of these talks, Ireland’s trading relationship with the UK will change. Given the limited progress in negotiations to date and the uncertainty due to Covid-19, Ireland will intensify its Brexit preparedness work.
“This is not about admitting defeat, this is about risk management. Ireland still supports the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK but we must be prepared.”
Conference call next week
EU chiefs and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have agreed to assess progress on their talks for a post-Brexit trading relationship next week, an EU spokesman yesterday.
Johnson will talk to the heads of the three main EU institutions — the commission, parliament and council — to take stock of their negotiations, according to the spokesman for European Council chief Charles Michel.
The conference call, the first to be held at such a high level, comes as negotiations on a new trade agreement between the two sides have stalled with just six months to go before Britain leaves the EU single market and customs union.

The so-called transition period ends for Britain — which left the EU on 31 January after 47 years inside the European project — on 31 December.
And if the two sides have not reached a free trade agreement by then, the economic consequences could be potentially devastating, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
A British government spokesman said the two sides had agreed an “intensified timetable” for trade negotiations in July.
The new process would involve “a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings, both in London and Brussels”, the spokesman said, explaining that discussions would be held every week between 29 June and 27 July.
In addition to British PM Johnson and Charles Michel, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Parliament President David Sassoli will also join the call on Monday.

DIFFERENCES REMAIN BETWEEN the EU and UK, both leaders said, after talks between negotiators and political leaders took place today.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have agreed that “significant differences remain” between the two sides after a phone call scheduled for 4pm this afternoon.
The two chief negotiators in trade talks have been instructed by Johnson and von der Leyen to prepare an overview of the remaining differences, which will be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days,a statement said.
On RTÉ’s Six One News, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that new problems rather than solutions had appeared in relation to fisheries.
Despite progress made in the past few weeks on the most of the contentious issues, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said today the talks remain “very challenging”, and added that it would be a “significant failure” if no trade agreement is reached.
Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Penny Mordaunt has told the House of Commons that EU-UK negotiations had reached “a critical moment”.
Mordaunt said that she wasn’t hopeful that a deal would be done by the end of today.
“I am not hinting at that, although that would be jolly nice. In my opening answer in response to the question I outlined what I am expecting to happen this afternoon in terms of the Prime Minister speaking to the commission president – so I am not raising that hope.
“But these negotiations are continuing because a deal is still possible and we will continue to negotiate until that ceases to be the case.”
Trade deal discussions are entering their final days, with both sides hoping to overcome the final significant differences.

Speaking to reporters in Cork this morning, the Taoiseach said “the issues that remain to be resolved will not easily be resolved”.
“The situation is serious and the issues are ones that have bedeviled the process from the beginning in terms of level playing field, in terms of fisheries and of course the dispute resolution mechanism to deal with the level playing field issues,” Martin said.
Overall I think it’s in the best interest of all concerned that a proper trade deal is agreed.
“Our respective economies across Europe and within the UK would suffer unnecessarily in my view in the event of a no-deal… I think it would be a significant failure if we were to end up with a no-deal.”
The current situation
The trade talks between the EU and the UK remain deadlocked with the risk of a no-deal scenario still a possibility.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost worked late into last night on talks in Brussels as they sought to close out a deal after eight months of intense talks.
Barnier briefed ambassadors from EU member states at a pre-dawn meeting, after talks with Frost broke up last night.
Negotiations resumed in Brussels yesterday after Johnson and von der Leyen gave the green light for talks to resume during a phone call on Saturday.
Both sides hope to establish a trade relationship with zero tariffs and zero quotas in the hopes of avoiding major disruptions from 1 January.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told RTÉ News this morning that Barnier had indicated that the current situation was “very downbeat”.
“I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today,” he said.
EU Commissioner Mairéad McGuinness echoed Coveney’s remarks, saying that the possibility for a deal to be agreed was “not looking good”.
“I think the reason it’s not looking good is because the UK are failing to understand the significance of the three outstanding issues and the need for the UK to compromise,” she also told RTÉ.
The core stumbling blocks have remained the same over the last number of months: the ‘level-playing field’ provisions, a dispute mechanism and fisheries.
Reports last night that there had been an agreement between the two sides about fisheries later emerged to be untrue.
The UK’s two domestic bills
The House of Commons tonight voted to reject the Lords’ amendments to the Internal Market Bill; essentially rejecting to remove clauses that contravene the Northern Ireland Protocol contained in the Withdrawal Agreement.
This was expected to happen: the UK government said earlier today that if a trade deal is struck, it would remove the clauses in the bill that relate to State aid.
This morning, the UK government announced that Cabinet minister Michael Gove would travel to Brussels to discuss issues relating to Northern Ireland trade post-Brexit.
Gove was to engage in discussions with European Commission vice president Maroš Šefčovič: both men are co-chairs of the EU-UK Joint Committee, which is examining how the Withdrawal Agreement should be implemented, including the NI Protocol.
Following those discussions, the UK government has said it is prepared to remove or “deactivate” three controversial clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill.
In a statement released this afternoon, the British government said: “Discussions continue to progress and final decisions are expected in the coming days.
“Good progress continues to be made regarding the decision as to which goods are ‘at risk’ of entering the EU market. Talks continue this afternoon.

“In the light of those discussions, the Government will keep under review the content of the forthcoming Taxation Bill.”
The Taxation Bill, which hasn’t been published yet, is a money bill meaning peers cannot amend it.
The UK had previously accepted that provisions in the Internal Market Bill violated the Withdrawal Agreement, but said it needed a “legal safety net” for a no-deal Brexit.
The House of Lords has voted to remove the offending clauses, but the British government says it will restore them when the bill is re-submitted in the House of Commons later today.
The EU says the clauses are a fundamental breach of trust and imperil the wider trade negotiation and has taken Britain to court over the issue.
EU Summit
Negotiations are continuing ahead of an EU summit on Thursday, when any deal – or the failure to find one – will be put to the leaders of the 27 member states.
The Taoiseach will be travel to Brussels on Wednesday evening to attend this summit.
Any one of the leaders of the EU member states can veto a final trade deal.
A source close to the talks told the AFP news agency that the situation was “very difficult” and that negotiations are in their “last useful days”.
“We are on a very narrow path and it is impossible to predict the outcome,” the source said.
Others indicated that the hardest issue was how to guarantee fair trade in future ties and establish a quick penalty mechanism if either side were to backtrack on environmental or health standards.
Britain is reluctant to accept a broad and binding arrangement, seeing it as an infringement on its sovereignty after 47 years of EU membership.
“In essence, if the talks fail now, the two sides didn’t manage to agree what constitutes foul play and what to do about it,” an EU diplomat said.
Without a deal, tariffs would be levied on the huge volumes of trade passing between the UK and Europe from 2021.
Travellers between both sides would also be affected with further passport delays and red tape for foreign residents and businesses.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-deal-negotiations-pig-in-a-poke-5123360-Jun2020/,"THE UK HAS urged the European Union to reach a post-Brexit free trade agreement “by the end of the summer” as Boris Johnson held talks with Brussels chiefs.
Johnson and the European Union’s leaders have agreed that “new momentum” is required to revive trade talks between the UK and the bloc.
However, European Council chief Charles Michel said the EU would not be pressured into buying a “pig in a poke”.
Four rounds of negotiations have so far made little progress, but the two sides have agreed to an “intensified” negotiating timetable as the clock counts down to the end of the current transition period at the end of year.
Prime minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said: “You can expect the Prime Minister to welcome the fact that the European Commission president has agreed to an intensified timetable for FTA negotiations in July and also expect the Prime Minister to urge renewed energy and commitment to reach an agreement by the end of the summer.
“We are looking to agree a high quality FTA based on the agreements the EU has already reached with other countries, but whatever happens we will be ready for January 1 when we will take back control of our laws, border and money.”
The EU has formally accepted that the UK would not seek any extension to the transition which allows Britain continued access to the single market while talks continue.

In a joint statement, the two sides said: “The parties welcomed the constructive discussions on the future relationship that had taken place under the leadership of chief negotiators David Frost and Michel Barnier, allowing both sides to clarify and further understand positions.
“They noted that four rounds had been completed and texts exchanged despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“This should include, if possible, finding an early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement.”
The EU side were represented in the summit by Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament president David Sassoli.
Michel underlined the EU’s commitment to the “level playing field” – a key demand aimed at ensuring fair competition by preventing the UK straying too far from Brussels’ rules on workers’ rights, environmental protections and state subsidies.
The UK government has resisted the demand, arguing that it limits the UK’s sovereignty and goes further than conditions imposed on other countries the EU has signed trade deals with.
Michel said a “broad and ambitious” agreement was in both sides’ interests but the level playing field was “essential”.
The EU was “ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-happens-northern-ireland-protocol-new-years-eve-5313621-Dec2020/,"THE NORTHERN IRELAND Protocol governing trade between Great Britain and the region comes into effect when the Brexit transition period ends at 11pm this evening.
Here are answers to some of the main questions about the protocol, its origins and how it will work.
Why was the protocol needed?
It was the resolution to the main sticking point in the Brexit divorce talks – the Irish border.
In order to avoid disrupting cross-border trade and a return of checkpoints along the politically sensitive frontier, the EU and UK essentially agreed to move new regulatory and customs processes to the Irish Sea.
That means the checks are now focused on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Is this different to the trade deal?
Yes, the protocol was part of the Withdrawal Agreement struck by the UK and EU in 2019.
It would have come into operation regardless of whether a wider trade deal had been agreed.
The trade agreement struck earlier this month does, however, mean that some of the consequences flowing from the protocol will be reduced, primarily in respect of customs.
The operation of the protocol was hammered out by a joint UK/EU committee and not as part of the future relationship negotiations.

What is in the protocol?
Under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods. Northern Ireland will also apply EU customs rules at its ports, even though the region is still part of the UK customs territory.
The protocol will also see Northern Ireland follow certain EU rules on state aid and VAT on goods.
What will single market rules mean for trade from Great Britain?
As part of the single market, Northern Ireland will have to adhere to strict EU regulations on food standards and plant and animal health.
This will result in additional SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) checks on certain produce entering the region from Great Britain.
The island of Ireland has long been treated as a single unit in respect of the movement of livestock, so checks on live animals arriving from GB already took place at Larne port.
The number of checks will increase significantly as there is now a requirement to check agri-food products.
Suppliers exporting food to Northern Ireland will have to pay for vets to complete Export Health Certificates in Great Britain and a proportion of lorries will be selected for physical checks on arrival in Northern Ireland.
The vast bulk of GB goods arrive at either Larne or Belfast ports, though some consignments will land at Warrenpoint and Foyle.
A proportion of lorries disembarking ferries from GB will be subject to physical inspections.Liam McBurney / PALiam McBurney / PA / PA
Currently 16 ferries arrive in Northern Ireland from GB every day. Between them they usually carry 175 roll on/roll off lorries and 275 unaccompanied freight units.
The latter units do not usually transport agri-food products, so the focus of the SPS checks will be on the roll on/roll off lorries.
While all hauliers will have to complete required online processes to alert the authorities of produce being shipped to NI, it is anticipated that around 20-25% of the lorries will be selected for physical inspection on arrival.
Permanent ‘Point of Entry’ checking facilities are due to be completed by the middle of 2021. In the interim, temporary structures will be used from 1 January.
The UK government has established a Movement Assistance Scheme to help traders comply with the new rules.
Does everything come into effect on 1 January?
While the protocol starts operating at 11pm on 31 December, the EU and UK have agreed to two grace periods to give traders time to adjust.
Supermarkets and other food retailers have been given three months to adjust to the requirements of the new SPS checks.
From 1 April, they will need to produce Export Health Certificates for every different animal-based food product they ship to Northern Ireland.
For the first three months only one all-encompassing certificate will be required per consignment of goods.
These products will also need to be labelled as destined for consumption in Northern Ireland. Lorry doors will also need to be sealed on departure with an inventory of contents listed on it.
Amazon had warned that delivery times to Northern Ireland could be affected by the new arrangements.Aaron Chown / PAAaron Chown / PA / PA
Some products are to be prohibited from entering Northern Ireland at all under single market rules.
Sausages and other chilled meats, which are on that banned list, have been granted a specific six-month grace period to enable their import from GB to continue until June, using temporary Export Health Certificates.
At the end of the six months, those products will no longer be permitted into Northern Ireland, unless the UK and EU agree a longer term solution in the interim.
There is no such grace period for other banned products, including seed potatoes, and their import will be prohibited from 1 January.

And what about customs?
This is the part of the protocol affected by the wider trade deal.
The EU had been concerned about traders using Northern Ireland as a backdoor to avoid paying tariffs on goods entering the bloc.
Brussels was wary that goods could have been moved from GB to NI and then across the frictionless Irish border without being subjected to customs controls.
The protocol addressed this by requiring Northern Ireland to apply the EU customs code at its ports.
Under this measure, goods deemed “at risk” of onward transportation into the EU via the Irish border would have been liable to pay tariffs upon entry into Northern Ireland from GB.
This would have been collected by UK authorities. If it could have then been established that the goods stayed in Northern Ireland, the traders would be have eligible for a rebate.
Much of the controversy around the implementation of the protocol focused on what proportion of Irish Sea trade would be deemed “at risk” and therefore be hit with added bureaucracy and up-front costs.
The introduction of a form of trusted trader scheme, agreed by the UK/EU joint committee at the start of December, was already set to dramatically reduce the number of businesses liable for tariffs.
However, the zero tariff/zero quota trade deal has since gone a long way to resolving the issue entirely, as GB goods moving into the EU will no longer have to pay tariffs.
Goods that originate outside the UK that are subsequently moved from GB to the EU would still be potentially liable for tariffs, so the “at risk” aspect of the protocol is not completely redundant, but it will undoubtedly affect far fewer businesses.
While the prospect of having to stump up tariffs has receded, traders moving goods from GB to NI will still face added paperwork and processes from 1 January.
The UK government has set up a Trader Support Scheme (TSS) to assist businesses in completing the required customs declarations.
There are differing estimates on how many declarations will be anticipated each year on GB to NI trade.
The HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in the UK has estimated around 11 million but the TSS put the figure at around 30 million.
What about parcels?
New customs administration is not just limited to freight. There had been a lot of uncertainty on whether declarations would be required for commercial goods being sent by GB-based online retailers directly to Northern Ireland consumers.
Internet sellers and dispatch companies had warned of potential disruption, with some having suspended services to Northern Ireland until clarity was provided.
On Thursday morning, the UK government published guidance on the issue and announced a three-month grace period on the introduction of new requirements for most parcels.
From 1 January, the only parcels requiring declarations will be those containing goods valued at more than £135 (€150) sent by GB businesses to NI businesses. Those businesses will also have three months to submit those declarations.
What about NI to GB trade?
This will remain largely unaffected. There had been the prospect of goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB requiring export declarations.
However, the joint committee agreement on the operation of the protocol has all but eliminated this requirement.
Such declarations will now only be needed in very limited circumstances, such as for trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds.
Are there potential advantages to the protocol to NI businesses?
Notwithstanding the added red tape and cost of bringing products into Northern Ireland from GB, the region will find itself in a unique regulatory position in the new EU/UK trading landscape.
NI businesses will have unfettered access into the UK internal market while at the same time remaining in the EU single market for goods – so they will face fewer regulatory hurdles to export to both the EU and GB markets.
In theory, Northern Ireland could be a good place for exporters to base themselves in the post-Brexit era.
DUP First Minister Arlene Foster has voiced opposition to the protocol.David Young / PADavid Young / PA / PA
But there are political concerns, right?
Yes. Unionists in Northern Ireland are very unhappy about the protocol.
They believe it creates an economic barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and has the potential to undermine the constitutional integrity of the Union.
Will the EU be monitoring the application of the protocol?
Yes. EU officials do have the right to accompany Northern Ireland officials as they implement the new processes and checks.
The prospect of the EU retaining an office in Northern Ireland was strongly opposed by the UK.
A number of officials will still be based in the region (essentially hot-desking in Stormont buildings) to oversee the trading arrangements.
Is the protocol permanent?
No. The Northern Ireland Assembly will vote periodically on whether to continue with the arrangements. The first vote will be after four years.
Stormont decisions on contentious issues usually require both a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists to support them.
However, it is envisaged that the vote on extending the protocol will be conducted on a straight majority basis. While a majority of the MLAs currently support the protocol, it is worth highlighting that there will be an Assembly election in 2022 that could potentially change the complexion of the chamber.
If a majority does vote to extend the operation of the protocol then the next vote would be held after another four years.
However, in the unlikely event that there was sufficient cross-community support for an extension, MLAs would not vote again on the protocol for a further eight years.","12.18pm, 31 Dec 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-australia-deal-5238549-Oct2020/,"OVER THE PAST few days, we have heard numerous British politicians, starting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saying that they are now preparing to leave the EU on “Australian style terms”.
It sounds nice and many people in the UK have an understandable affection for Australia but what does it mean?
In short, not very much.
Australia does not have a free trade deal with the EU. Indeed, Australia and the EU are currently entering into the ninth round of negotiations in order to try to agree on a free trade deal.
Both the EU and Australia recognise that the current situation is sub-optimal and needs to be improved.
What is in existence is simply a framework agreement that was finalised in 2017, building on an agreement in 2007 that established a general principle of co-operation on areas such as trade, foreign policy, security, development and humanitarian issues.

A little too complex
While they work towards a deal, the EU and Australia operate mainly on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, with large tariffs on imports and exports.
When it comes to customs, Australia and the EU have pledged to “examine possibilities to simplify customs procedures”.
On trade, the agreement commits both sides to try to reduce the “technical barriers to trade” – but with tariffs.
They have a specific wine trade agreement, which came into force in 2010, which safeguards the EU’s wine labelling regime and gives full protection to EU geographical indications so Australian wine producers cannot use names such as Champagne, port and sherry.
There are minor agreements such as allowing Australia to participate in EU crisis management operations while EU passenger name records are transferred to Australian border authorities to help combat crime and terrorism.
There are very few countries in the world who trade with the EU solely on WTO terms, beyond Australia there is also Afghanistan, Somalia and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
Any of these would be an accurate description of what a No-Deal Brexit would look like in January but we won’t hear that from those who push Brexit at whatever cost.
What next?
WTO rules would mean tariffs would be imposed on goods coming into the UK from the EU and vice versa. The last tariff schedule runs to about 326 pages of items ranging from beef to medicines to computer parts. Irish milk, for example, would cost 30% more in the UK from 1 January.

In addition, the UK has a large services market and under an Australia-style deal, it would lose any preferential access to EU markets. It is also worth noting the volume of trade.
The EU is the UK’s largest market, Australia is a very small market for the EU. Geography matters when it comes to trade and Sydney is nearly 17,000 kilometres from Brussels.
There is a Brexit deal to be had between the EU and the UK, it is in everyone’s interests to agree one and the time is running out.
That is where the focus should be. A No-Deal Brexit, whatever it is called, will be bad for everyone but the country that will suffer the most will, of course, be the UK.

UK CHIEF NEGOTIATOR David Frost has told his EU counterpart Michel Barnier that there is “no basis for negotiations” following the European Council summit conclusions this week.
It comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the UK earlier to “get ready” for a no-deal outcome to the trade talks with the European Union.
A Number 10 spokesman said: “Frost has spoken to Michel Barnier to update the EU on the Prime Minister’s statement.
“There was accordingly no basis for negotiations in London as of Monday.
Earlier, Frost had said the UK was “disappointed” by the outcome of the EU summit in which the bloc signalled it was willing to continue trade negotiations but called on Britain to make the next move.
Johnson said his judgment was that the UK should prepare for an Australia-style deal in the EU trade talks.
Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “From the outset we were totally clear that we wanted nothing more complicated than a Canada-style relationship based on friendship and free trade.
“To judge by the latest EU summit in Brussels, that won’t work for our EU partners.
“And since we have only 10 weeks until the end of the transition period on January 1, I have to make judgment about the likely outcome and get us ready.
“And given that they have refused to negotiate seriously for much of the last few months and given that this summit appears explicitly to rule out a Canada-style deal, I’ve concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia’s based on simple principles of global free trade.”

In a statement given just before 3pm this afternoon, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he wasn’t going to engage in a “negotiation process via the megaphone or in a public way”.
“Suffice to say I think Britain has an enormous amount to gain through access to the European Single Market,” he said.
“And I think to be fair to the European side they have taken that into account because essentially Britain has been offered zero-tariff, zero-quota access to the single market and to me a good deal is there to be done if you look at the big picture, in terms of jobs and protection of the economy and access to a huge market.
He added: “A lot of substance has been negotiated already, it’s not a simple matter of taking some deal off the table and handing it to somebody.
“This is a deal that will have to sustain long into the future, will have to represent the underpinning of a strong relationship geo-politically into the future between Britain and the EU.

“Britain and Europe have a lot in common and I think there is a desire on all sides for a constructive close relationship with the UK – and that’s what I picked up from the meeting last evening.”
Earlier
Johnson last month proposed that both sides should walk away from the talks and prepare for a no-deal outcome if there was no agreement by the European Council meeting on 15 October.
But, in a text adopted by the summit of EU leaders on the day of the deadline, they “invited” Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier to continue his discussions while urging the UK to “make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”.
Frost branded the response “unusual” in a statement released later. He tweeted: “Disappointed by the European Council conclusions on UK/EU negotiations.
“(I’m) surprised the EU is no longer committed to working ‘intensively’ to reach a future partnership as agreed with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on 3 October.
“Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out UK reactions and approach tomorrow in the light of his statement of September 7.”
In his call with von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel, Johnson expressed “disappointment” that the talks had not made more progress.
However, there is scepticism in Brussels that Downing Street would be prepared to pull the plug on the negotiations.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: “Britain has already imposed so many deadlines that came and went.”
Meanwhile, Michel told a press conference that Brussels would decide in the coming days, based on the UK’s next proposals, whether it should continue with trade talks.
“We are clear that we are determined to negotiate, we are determined to reach an agreement but we know there are some difficult topics,” he said.
“It is the case for fisheries, certainly, and also for level playing field and also governance.”
All sides have acknowledged that the question of future fishing rights once the current Brexit transition period ends at the end of the year remains among the most difficult issues to be resolved.
French president Emmanuel Macron, who is under pressure from fishermen in his country who fear losing access to British waters, indicated that he was prepared to take a hard line.
“Under any circumstance, our fishermen should not be sacrificed for Brexit,” he said.
“If these conditions are not met, it’s possible we won’t have a deal. If the right terms can’t be found at the end of these discussions, we’re ready for a no-deal for our future relations.”
Meanwhile, von der Leyen announced that she had to pull out of the summit to self-isolate after a member of her staff tested positive for coronavirus, even though the German politician tested negative.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-von-der-leyen-johnson-to-meet-5291951-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Dec 2020
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is to travel to Brussels tomorrow for an evening meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about progressing the EU-UK trade talks.
A spokesman for Johnson said: “The Prime Minister will travel to Brussels tomorrow for dinner with Ursula von der Leyen to continue discussions on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.”
EC president von der Leyen tweeted: “I look forward to welcoming UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tomorrow evening. We will continue our discussion on the Partnership Agreement.”
Trade talks between the UK’s David Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier paused after both teams moved as close towards a deal as political red lines would allow. Though a deal is reportedly 97% agreed, political leaders must make decisions on the final issues.
According to political statements, the confidential trade talks have faltered on the same issues that have plagued negotiations from the start: fishing rights; the level playing field measures aimed at preventing the UK undercutting the EU on standards and state subsidies; and the way for trade disputes to be discussed and resolved.
The two leaders agreed to meet in Brussels this week after their second phone call in 48 hours. The meeting is scheduled a day before a crucial EU summit on Thursday, when the leaders of the 27 member states will vote on a deal if it is agreed by then.
The meeting will be the first time Johnson has met von der Leyen in person since January, in a sign that talks are being stepped up ahead of the legal deadline for the UK to leave the Single Market and Customs Union on 31 December.
What has happened in the last few days?
Earlier, Johnson warned that reaching a Brexit deal was proving “very, very difficult” after two days of intense negotiations with the EU on the final details. But he added that he hoped the “power of sweet reason” would triumph, and a deal could still be done.
“Our friends have just got to understand the UK has left the EU in order to be able to exercise democratic control over the way we do things,” Johnson said in a message this morning.
Last night, a joint statement from Johnson and von der Leyen indicated that there are still three outstanding issues: and that despite additional efforts at the weekend, a face-to-face meeting between the political leaders was needed to resolve them.

A statement from a UK government source issued last night to several British political correspondents said that “no tangible progress” had been made during the negotiations between the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost.
The same source described the process as “looking very tricky”, adding that it “must now continue politically” with a warning that the talks could still collapse.
Barnier tweeted this afternoon that the EU would “never sacrifice our future for the present” as the deadlock continued.
London also insisted that talks on a UK-EU trade deal would not continue next year after Brussels appeared to leave the door open to further negotiations.
However, a spokesman for Johnson did not rule out MPs being made to sit over the Christmas period to vote on any deal if one was passed this week.
Problems and solutions
Both sides are hoping to establish a trade relationship with zero tariffs and zero quotas, which would avoid further disruptions from 1 January.
On fisheries, the Times reported that negotiations have continued to stall over how long any transition period would be for European fishermen to adjust to agreed changes to fishing rights. The newspaper said that the EU wants a 10-year grace period, while the UK wants that scaled back to three years.
On RTÉ’s Six One News yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that new problems rather than solutions had appeared in relation to fisheries.
On the level-playing field, the UK feels the level playing-field would impact on its post-Brexit sovereignty, while the EU believes it is required to protect the standards of its Single Market.
However, news emerged this afternoon that suggests the sides are on the same page with regards to the State aid issue.
The UK and the EU announced that theyhave reached an agreement “in principle”on issues relating to how the Withdrawal Agreement can be implemented in practice – including the Northern Ireland Protocol.
It follows a meeting between Cabinet minister Micheal Gove and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič – co-chairs of the joint committee examining how the Brexit divorce deal could be implemented.

As part of this, the UK agreed that it would remove controversial clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would have denied the EU a say in future trading arrangements between the North and Ireland.
The statementsaid:
Von der Leyenwelcomedthe news.
The news came despite MPs voting in the House of Commons yesterday to re-insert the clauses back into the Bill after they were taken out by the House of Lords.
By the way – when is theactualdeadline?
Despite progress made in the past few weeks on the most of the contentious issues, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said today the talks remain “very challenging”, and added that it would be a “significant failure” if no trade agreement is reached.
British Health Minister Matt Hancock said this morning that the UK was ready to proceed without a deal – if a no-deal scenario was what the EU decided.
Barnier has reportedly told MEPs the deadline for the talks succeeding is tomorrow, but Downing Street said it was prepared to continue talks for “as long as we have time available” – allowing the possibility for an agreement to be reached by Thursday.
The Taoiseach will travel to Brussels tomorrow evening to attend the European Council summit on Thursday – a gathering of the 27 EU leaders.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sammy-wilson-dup-brexit-arlene-foster-north-ni-5197062-Sep2020/,"A SENIOR DUP MP has insisted his party will not accept the Brexit withdrawal deal, in comments apparently at odds with his leader’s stance.
Sammy Wilson said the deal that contains the contentious Northern Ireland protocol must be “scrapped” or at least significantly changed.
The DUP consistently opposed the deal at Westminster, arguing that it creates an economic border between Northern Ireland and the UK.
On Friday, party leader and Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster reiterated that opposition but said she has to “recognise the reality” that it is now law and she has to be part of the process that saw it implemented.
In an interview with Sky News, she said: “I mean, there are some who would continue to fight against the protocol; I have to recognise that that is the reality now.”
The protocol in the withdrawal treaty is the arrangement by which Northern Ireland continues to follow single market rules for goods and administers the EU’s customs code at its ports.
The UK government has acknowledged that extra regulatory checks will be needed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the UK, with the expansion of infrastructure to screen animals and food products.
But it has insisted there will be no new physical customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
Foster said her focus as a unionist leader is now to mitigate against the potential damage the protocol could cause to the integrity of the UK.
“So instead of saying ‘I wish that hadn’t happened’ – and I do – how to mitigate against that, and also take steps to make sure that we have a shared prosperity in the future for the whole of the UK,” she said.
Wilson struck a different note today in a statement titled “DUP will not accept Withdrawal Agreement”, which was not issued through the party’s press office.
“The DUP on three occasions helped to stop Theresa’s May’s version of the Withdrawal Agreement and we spoke against, argued against and voted against Boris Johnson’s anti-Unionist Brexit,” he said.
“We are still arguing that, in these negotiations, the Withdrawal Agreement must be scrapped or, at the very least, significantly changed.
“We have sought to persuade Conservative MPs that it is not only bad for Northern Ireland but ties the UK as a whole in to the influence of EU institutions. That remains our position.
“It is impossible to implement the Withdrawal Agreement when we don’t even know the level and depth of checks which will be required because some of that is to be decided by the Joint Committee, which was set up to look at a wide range of the details required to reflect the high-level decisions in the Agreement.

“The UK Government still doesn’t know what its relationship with the EU will be after the 31 December. It is impossible to put into place any arrangements for Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK and which will be affected by the final outcome of the negotiations.
“If, as the press and others are speculating, there is no deal, will the British Government honour the Withdrawal Agreement?
“Will it pay £34 billion to the EU and a further £180 billion which it will be required to pay in future years? I suspect not, and if that is the case, why would the NI Protocol portion of the agreement stay intact?”

‘There for the taking’
This morning, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that a trade deal with Brussels is “there for the taking”.
Raab said the negotiations had been “boiled down to two outstanding bones of contention” – control of UK fishing waters and taxpayer support for businesses – and urged the EU to come to an agreement.
His comments followed an interview in theMail on Sunday with David Frostin which he said that the UK government was not “scared” of walking away from the talks without a deal – sentiments echoed by Raab.
Raab, speaking to Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, said the UK could not accept being controlled by the EU’s state aid rules after Brexit, and accused the EU of “double standards” in its attempt to have Britain agree to terms beyond those in free trade agreements it has ratified in the past.
“There is a good deal there for the EU; we’d love to do that free trade agreement – and if not, we’ll fall back on Australian-style rules,” Raab said.
‘Utterly misleading’
Responding this afternoon, Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond called Raab’s comments a “remarkable intervention”.
“This is utterly misleading as the EU and Australia have an extremely narrow trading relationship akin to No Deal terms,” Richmond said.
“We are entering another extremely important week of Brexit talks and it is vital that this sort of fantasy Brexit rhetoric is challenged.
“Unfortunately for some in the UK, winning the blame game is far more important than minimising the massive economic damage of Brexit by agreeing some form of deal based on the agreed terms of the Political Declaration,” Richmond said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-negative-impact-irish-economy-5078351-Apr2020/,"THE MAJORITY OF business leaders don’t believe that the EU and UK can achieve a trade deal by the December 2020 deadline, according to a new survey.
Almost nine in 10 (87%) of business leaders believe that Brexit’s impact on the Irish economy will be negative in the short-term.
This is according to the latest quarterly survey carried out by the Institute of Directors in Ireland (IoD), which was published today.
The survey was carried out between 18 and 26 March among its 3,000 members, comprising CEOs and company directors.
When asked ‘Do you think the EU and the UK can reach a trade deal before the end of the transition period in 2020?’, a total of 74% of business leaders said no. Just under 13% said yes, while 14 said they don’t know.

When those surveyed were asked about Ireland’s status in the EU post-Brexit, 30% believe it will be ‘enhanced’, which is a 9% decrease on the previous quarter.
30% of those surveyed say it is ‘difficult to judge’ and 22% believe it will be ‘diminished’. A total of 19% say it will be ‘unchanged’.
Today’s survey comes in advance of the resumption of the EU-UK trade deal talks.
With discussions disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the EU and UK agreed a new timetable for three further rounds of post-Brexit trade negotiations, including today, 11 May and 1 June.
“These are immensely challenging times for us all, for society as a whole, for employees and their families, and businesses. We are all concerned about matters of life and deaths, as a priority,” IoD chief executive Maura Quinn said.
“That said, while Brexit and the EU-UK trade talks have been sidelined as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, business leaders are acutely aware of the potential Brexit fallout and the importance of these negotiations on our open economy,” Quinn said.
“This is crucial as we have a context where many are forecasting tough times ahead for the global economy. Business confidence needs a boost.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-radio-5-live-4892847-Nov2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has attacked Jeremy Corbyn for “siding with the IRA” during an hour-long live radio phone-in this morning.
Johnson was appearing on a BBC Radio 5 Live and answered a range of questions from callers about a range of topics including VAT, the NHS, Nigel Farage, Russia, mental health spending, childcare, broadband, Northern Ireland and his own children’s education.
During the programme, Emma from Belfast asked about Johnson’s “commitment to maintaining the union with Northern Ireland” and said that many unionists regard his deal with the EU as “a betrayal”.
Johnson went on to repeatedly defend the deal, saying that while Northern Ireland will remain in alignment with the EU Custom Union it will still remain part of the UK’s customs territory.
Johnson said NI business-owners will not have to pay tariffs to trade with Britain and that they will also benefit from any future trade deals negotiated by future UK governments.
This point is one of the key issues of debate on the deal and Johnson’sunderstanding of the arrangements has been questionedin recent weeks.

“There will be no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK to GB, absolutely not we won’t be doing that at all,”Johnson said.
Corbyn’s past meetings with Sinn Féin leaders has repeatedly been raised by journalists and political opponents and during the 2017general election he condemned IRA bombings.
Speaking more with Emma from Belfast, Johnson said that Stormont could in the future decide to leave the proposed arrangement,referred to as the consent vote.
“Mr Prime Minister, we haven’t had a Stormont for 1,033 days,” Emma responded.

On Corbyn and Scotland, Johnson claimed that if Labour entered government with the support of the SNP Corbyn “wouldn’t have the power to resist” another referendum on Scottish independence.
“Their plan is to take Scotland back into the EU, independent of the UK, and that would mean taking the Euro and entering Schengen,” Johnson said of the SNP’s plan.

Asked further about the free movement of EU workers after Brexit, Johnson said it’s unfair that they get preferential treatment of non-EU workers.
“I think they’ve been wonderful for our country, speaking as someone who used to run London it was absolutely incredible to see the contributions made be for people from all over the world.

The Brexit Party’sdecision not to challenge Conservative MPsin their constituencies has been the major talking point during this week of election campaigning and it has prompted questions about whether a deal has been done between the two parties.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has claimed thathe was offered a peerage by the Conservativesas a way of convincing his party not to challenge them.
Asked about this claim during today’s interview, Johnson emphatically denied this was the case.
“No, no, nein, nein, what is this nonsense?,” Johnson said. “I know it’s on the front page of The Daily Telegraph, isn’t it? Normally unimpeachable.”
Asked whether there have been any conversations between the two parties, Johnson said it would be impossible for him to know this.
“Well, look I mean, that would be a big thing to for me to investigate. I’m sure that there are conversations taking place between politicians of all parties. But certainly nobody has been offered a peerage I can tell you that,” he said.
Russian interference
Johnson’s government has been criticised for delaying the publication of a report into the threat posed by Russia to Britain’s democracy until after the election.
Ina Twitter question, Georgie asked Johnson why he won’t publish the documents.

The Prime Minister said it wouldn’t be “normal procedure” to publish the report and that he won’t change this “just because there’s an election”.
The UK’s security services are understood to have cleared the documents but Johnson said this is still not a reason to publish them.
Related ReadsWhat are the Brexit stances of the main British parties?
“They’re not normally published at that pace. And there’s no reason to change the procedures,” he said.
Asked how many Russian oligarchs have donated to his Conservative Party, Johnson said he wouldn’t put a number on it but that all donations “are there in the public domain”.
“I think that you’ve got to be very careful before you simply cast aspersions on everybody who comes from a certain country just because of their nationality,” he said.
Pushed again for a number amid reports that nine oligarchs had donated, Johnson said he simply didn’t know.
“They’ve all been properly vetted, they all, it’s open, all these donations are all open to challenge. If people think that they’re not fit and proper persons then they’re not, they’re not, allowed to donate. That’s the rule,” he said.
Children
During the interview, Johnson was also asked about childcare and education
“It’s spending on education across the country that will give everybody a chance to express their talents,” Johnson said before being challenged on Conservative cuts to education spending
Johnson was then asked by host Rachel Burden about his own children’s education, and then about his children in general
“None of your children have gone to State school is that right,” she said.
“I don’t comment on my children if that’s alright,” Johnson responded before being pushed on the topic.
In response, Johnson said: “Sure, sure. Your assertion that none of my children have gone to State schools is wrong, is wrong. That’s all I will say. ”
Asked about how he plans for Christmas, Johnson joked that he hasn’t had time to think about that.
“I have, alas, not had time to plan for Christmas because I’m so focused on getting Brexit done and unleashing the potential of this country. I’m afraid I literally haven’t had the chance to think about it,” Johnson said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eu-trade-talks-3-4996925-Feb2020/,"
LAST SATURDAY, THE day after Britain finally left the EU, was the first anniversary of the EU-Japan trade deal coming into force.
According to the European Commission, in its first year the economic pact has led to boosts in exports of wine, dairy, meat and machinery. In Ireland, Bord Bia has been the EU’s partner in promoting EU beef in Japan.
When the Japan deal was signed, after years of negotiations, European officials were quick to herald the agreement as a significant victory while Brexit rumbled on in London and Brussels.
The deal with Japan may have taken years of negotiation, meanwhile the EU’s agreement in principle last year with the Mercosur – the trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay – took two decades.
Even after such a long negotiation period, the deal was met with fierce criticism as Irish farmers have protested that the deal will see cheaper South American beef products undercutting them.
This is the reality of trade talks and deal-making. They’re long, laborious and contentious with many variables at play. With Britain now out of the EU, the clock is ticking to get a post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the end of the year, before WTO rules kick in bringing significant tariffs for Ireland with them.
Hard graft
For every step forward like the EU-Canada agreement, there’s a knockback – such as the Belgian region of Wallonia wielding its opposition to that agreement.
This is the environment that the UK is entering now as a third country, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant that a deal with the EU can be struck by the end of 2020.
For critics of Johnson, this is fanciful. For Johnson, it’s an ambitious play to prove Brexit was worth it.
EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said that the EU will set out its mandate for the talks by the end of February. Then the hard graft will begin.
Phil HoganFlickr / Arno MikkorFlickr / Arno Mikkor / Arno Mikkor
The EU-UK talks have a unique bent as both sides are entering from positions where there are no pre-existing trade barriers and they are now about to put ones up.
Everything will be on the table from custom checks to fisheries, data transfers to police cooperation, meat and dairy to financial services and every nugget in between.
An early tiff has already emerged in Europe seeking access to British territorial waters for fishing.
The UK will be out of the single market and customs union so unlike non-EU members like Norway, it will not be beholden to any EU rules and foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said that the UK will not align with EU rules, which throws a spanner in the works from the off.

Michel Barnier has said that a deal for the UK where there are zero tariffs and quotas “won’t happen for nothing and without conditions”.
The UK is keen to secure a “Canada-style” deal which would see most tariffs dropped. That would be ideal for Johnson and co but what will the EU want in return?
Each member state can veto a deal and Ireland’s position on certain issues could change between now and when talks fully kick off. With Fine Gael trailing in the opinion polls ahead of this Saturday’s general election, Varadkar may not be the Taoiseach to helm Ireland into this tricky time.
Standards
There will be plenty of talk of a “level playing field” where the EU will expect the UK to share certain standards, such as policy on state aid, workers’ rights and environmental standards.
For Ireland, the risks are acute. Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, toldForathat the agri-food sector is particularly at risk.
“There is a great fear that if the UK diverges away from the European Union on standards then what type of foodstuffs will it allow into the market? And what kind of a competitive threat is that for Ireland?” McKeever said.

Another issue relates to standards around state aid and foreign direct investment. When the UK is completely independent of the EU, it could alter standards to become more attractive to foreign direct investment and “that would be a threat to us as well”.
If a deal emerges from these talks, it will also have some influence on the trade deals the UK strikes elsewhere, especially with countries that already have existing deals or engagements with the EU.
“I think that a country that sits in some part of the world that is trying to do business with both the EU and the UK will want to see some kind of equivalence across standards and I think that will be challenging for the UK,” McKeever explained.
He added that the tight timeline for getting a deal done limits the scope of what can be achieved.
The EU will set its mandate at the end of this month and a deal will need to be reached by October to be ratified by the European Parliament by December. The reality is that the timeline is about eight months and Johnson has been resolute in saying he would not seek an extension.
“It’s condensed into a very short period and all the threats haven’t gone away,” McKeever said. “People will still need to be getting themselves ready for customs and all the paperwork that is going to take place. You can’t let up on this in any way, shape or form.”
If no arrangement is made by year’s end, the dreaded cliff-edge Brexit that we’ve heard so much about since 2016 will effectively come to pass.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-michel-barnier-few-hours-left-trade-deal-5304434-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|18 Dec 2020
EU CHIEF NEGOTIATOR Michel Barnier has warned there are “just a few hours” left to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK as talks resumed today.
Barnier said that there is a chance of getting a deal in time for the end of the transition period on 31 December, but said that the path to a breakthrough is “very narrow”.
His warning came after Boris Johnson told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that the EU must “significantly” shift its stance on fishing for an agreement.
Today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “very significant difficulties” remain in the Brexit trade deal talks between the EU and UK, particularly in relation to fisheries.
His analysis came as leaders north and south of the Irish border voiced support for a trade deal.
The issue was discussed at Friday’s virtual meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.
Martin said: “If we get a substantive future relationship agreement between the UK and the EU that would make life much, much easier for all of us and particularly would give certainty and clarity to businesses and for workers north and south.”
The Taoiseach said a deal would present opportunities for everyone on the island of Ireland.
“Above all, it would give certainty and clarity to businesses on the island of Ireland, for workers on the island of Ireland in terms of their future and without question a deal would reduce very significantly any damage and disruption that would clearly arise from a no deal,” he added.
Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster said: “We all agree that the best way forward is to have an agreement on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
“I think that’s very important. That is the one point of unanimity on Brexit I would say, but it’s something that I think you can take as very clear.”
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “We’re all agreed that a free trade agreement between the UK and EU is to our advantage and is in the interests of business and workers and farmers and fishermen north and south.
“So we will be using any influence we have to try to secure that agreement over the next couple of days.”
Varadkar warned port queues at Holyhead were likely due to stockpiling.
However, the Tanaiste warned that delays were likely on ferry travel between Ireland and Britain regardless of whether a UK/EU trade deal is struck or not.
“I think it’s likely that any delays at the ports that are happening at the moment are related to stockpiling, a lot of businesses are going to want to fill their warehouses in advance of there being a deal or no deal as the case may be when it comes to Brexit,” he told a press conference after Friday’s meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.

Earlier today
The EU set the latest deadline that an agreement must be ready by Sunday night in order to have enough time for MEPs to ratify it, while the House of Commons has been warned it may need to to hastily return from Christmas recess to vote on a deal.
“It’s the moment of truth,” Barnier told the European Parliament in Brussels.
“We have very little time remaining, just a few hours, to work through these negotiations in useful fashion if we want this agreement to enter into force on 1 January.
“There is a chance of getting an agreement but the path to such an agreement is very narrow.”
He said he was being “frank with you and open and sincere” when he said that he was unable to say what the result will be from the “last home straight of negotiations”.
Johnson and von der Leyen took stock of negotiations in a call yesterday evening.
The EU chief acknowledged “big differences” remained between the two sides and stressed that “bridging them will be very challenging”.
Johnson tweeted after the call to say he told von der Leyen that “time is short and the EU position needed to change substantially”.
Downing Street said the British Prime Minister warned it looked “very likely” a deal would not be agreed unless the bloc shifted its stance.
Agreement was getting closer on the “level playing field” to ensure neither side could unfairly compete by eroding environmental standards, workers’ rights or state subsidies, but fishing policy remained a major sticking point.
Johnson warned that the UK “could not accept a situation” where it was unable to control access to its waters and would have fishing quotas that “hugely disadvantaged its own industry”, according to a No 10 spokeswoman.
“The EU’s position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly,” she added.
Barnier’s counterpart at No 10, David Frost, warned that progress “seems blocked” ahead of talks resuming in Brussels.
“The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out,” he tweeted yesterday.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who has been in charge of the Government’s no-deal planning, said on Thursday that the chances of an agreement remained “less than 50%”.
He told the Commons Brexit committee the “most likely outcome” was that the transition period would end on 31 December without a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/december-elections-4871898-Oct2019/,"WE MAY NOTbe having one in Ireland, but the UK is to hold a winter election six weeks from today.
The nationwide vote will be the first December election since 1923 and the first one held in winter since 1974.
Holding an election during winter, andespecially so close to Christmas, is often seen as a bad idea for a number of reasons.
There’s the problem of politicians canvassing on dark winter evenings, there’s the cold and rain and even the general feeling that people would rather be thinking festive thoughts and not about who to vote for.
There’s also the argument that it actually makes holding the election more difficult and leads to a lower turnout. So what is the reality?
Is the weather a factor?
Anyone who pays any attention to election days in Ireland will hear reference to the weather affecting turnout. If the numbers at polling stations are low during a rainy polling day we will hear it being blamed as the cause.
While this may be a factor, it is often just one of many. For example, a low turnout in Ireland’s presidential election in 1997 has been put down as much to anexpected win for Mary McAleese as poor weather on the day.
In the UK, general elections have been in either April, May or June on every occasion since 1979 following two winter elections in 1974.
The first of those in February 1974 achieved the highest turnout in the last 50 years despite conditions close to freezing in some parts.

Polling guru Professor John Curtice has been speaking about the influence of an election’s timing this week and pointed out that the UK’s record turnout of 83.9% was in 1950 when it was held in February.
He told the BBC this week that he suspects the importance of Brexit to people will mean that “a spot of bad weather will not keep them away”.
“We have a level of commitment to Remain or Leave of kind we have not seen in party politics since the 1960s. This has become an issue which deeply exercises the public. One would anticipate they will turn out,” Curtice said.
Pollster from the University of Strathclyde John Curtice.PA ImagesPA Images
Researchers at Oxford University have similarly said that there isno correlation between weather and turnouts.
There is one exception to this: snow.
While rain may not affect the ability of people to vote, snow could literally make it impossible.
Severe snowfalls could not only make it impossible for people to vote but it could even stop staff at polling centres and count centres to get where they need to be.
Already, the confirmation of a December election has led to wild speculation in British tabloids thata return of the Beast from the East couldhit preparations.
Despite this, most meteorologists agree that predicting severe weather six weeks out is impossible, and even then it’s worth remembering that the previous ‘Beast’ in 2017hit in early March, not December.
One issue that will certainly be a factor is the number of hours of daylight being fewer in winter than in summer.
Related ReadsMPs vote to hold general election in the UK on 12 December
Swathes of the UK will also only have around eight hours of light between sunrise and sunset and the issues is particularlyacute in parts of northern Scotland like Shetland.
What about Christmas parties?
There are practical concerns about having an election in December, however, with people having less spare time and public spaces being already booked out.
Councils often book polling stations and count venues months or even years in advance of an election but this causes problems during the festive period.
Nativity plays, Christmas markets and pantomimes will be booked in for many village halls, sports centres and theatres. So finding free venues – particularly in small communities – is likely to be very tricky.
Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the UK’s Association of Electoral Administrators, accepted as much when speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week.
“We have issues getting polling stations generally,” she said ahead of the confirmation of the election date.
“For May polls, they’re expecting us on the first Thursday in May. Here, we’re not even convinced all of the time that the election will take place on a Thursday. So, this morning I’m sure that our 2,000 members will be getting on the phones trying to book polling stations provisionally for 12 December.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/pandemic-economic-recovery-5301524-Dec2020/,"JANUARY’S CHANGING OF the guard in the White House is likely to have a “significant impact” on the Irish economy over the coming years, both positive and negative.
That’s according to the latest Quarterly Economic Commentary, published by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) this morning.
Remarkably, despite declines in employment and domestic consumption that were unprecedented in their scale and speed, the ESRI forecasts the Irish economy to expand by 3.4% this year.
That could be followed by further growth in 2021 of between 1.5% and 4.9%, depending on whether a post-Brexit trade deal is reached in the coming days and weeks.
In both of these scenarios, ESRI researchers also factored in a six-week national lockdown in January.
But Brexit and Covid aren’t the only potential risks to the economy.
During the last six years, Irish corporation tax revenues have been a major source of exchequer funds, outstripping forecasts by over €7 billion, according to the report.
In the past three years, this has been fuelled by the Trump administration’s 2017 overhaul of corporate tax, moving the country to “territorial based” system.
Effectively, this means that the US government stopped taxing the profits of American companies earned in a foreign country.
Simultaneously, US Republicans introduced a new system called the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).
Aimed at saving American jobs and disincentivising corporations from off-shoring business to low tax countries like Ireland or Switzerland, it means that income earned over a certain threshold by an American company’s foreign subsidiaries is taxed at 10.5%.
There is evidence, the ESRI says, to suggest that this 10.5% rate was too low and that US companies continued to offshore business during the Trump administration.
“Amongst the evidence presented for this is the continued increase in the level of trade in pharmaceutical products between Ireland the United States in recent years,” the report argues.
Consequently, Irish corporation tax receipts have ballooned since 2017.

But the ESRI highlights that “any changes to this legislation which sees a movement away from the territorial approach or witnesses an increase in the GILTI tax rate may result in lower domestic corporation tax increases for the Irish Exchequer in the future”.
US President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to more than double the effective rate of GILTI during his term of office.

This, the report, argues, “underscores the potential vulnerability of future corporation tax receipts” and why the government can’t rely on them to fund current expenditure.
On the upside, the report highlights the “likelihood of re-engagement” by the US on international efforts related to climate change and Brexit as “clear positives for the Irish economy”.
A remarkable year
In its final quarterly commentary year, the ESRI paints as full a picture as it can of the impact of the pandemic year on the Irish economy.
With GDP expected to grow by 3.8% for the full year, the outlook might seem relatively rosy.
Irish exports are still leading the charge.
Buoyed by booming pharma and computer services/tech sales — two sectors dominated by foreign companies based in Ireland — exports have actually increased year-on-year by 4.6%.
But the 2020 crisis has also laid bare the duality of the Irish economy.
While multinational-dominated sectors with a higher incidence of high-paid jobs have boomed, sectors of the domestic economy that produce lower-paid jobs (hospitality, retail, construction etc.) have suffered greatly.
Stripping out businesses that export altogether, domestic private consumption has collapsed by 9% and investment by a whopping 13.6% although there has been some recovery over the course of the year.

Ireland’s labour market has also been devastated.
Overall, the ESRI expects the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate to hit 18.4% of the total labour force for the full year. This is an upward revision from October when it was forecast to be just 16.8% and a stark increase on last year when unemployment was as low as 5%.
It’s too early to speculate about scarring effects — persistent, permanent negative impacts — on the labour market, however.
As public health restrictions have tightened and loosened, the unemployment rate has shifted down and up and back again over the course of the year.
That will be the case next year as well but economists will be watching these motions closely.
“Obviously, if we see [the unemployment rate] consistently fail to drop as low each time there’s a loosening of restrictions, then that’s kind of an indication that there’s some scarring,” explains Conor O’Toole, a senior research officer with the ESRI.
If we see unemployment rates, “get more stubborn on the downside”, it’s evidence that jobs are being lost on a more permanent basis.
The ESRI also expects consumer expenditure to increase by around 11% next year, as households unwind excess savings built up over the course of the pandemic year.

THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Britain will pursue outside the European Union remain uncertain and can only be guessed by peering behind the political curtain.
However, it is the EU’s wish to have as close a relationship as possible with the United Kingdom.
One issue that has flown under the radar since the conclusion of the revised Withdrawal Agreement has been the complete removal of the level playing field provisions from the agreement.
The level playing field (or LPF) was sought by the EU to limit the UK’s ability to gain what it saw as an unfair competitive advantage if the UK decided to lower standards on environmental protection, consumer policy, labour safeguards, state aid or taxation.
Instead, the LPF provisions have been replaced by less specific and non-binding commitments in the political declaration.
A scenario of a highly deregulated UK has been dubbed as a Singapore-upon-Thames.
Dr Charles Woolfson, of Linköping University in Sweden has described this as “an ultra-business-friendly environment with low or zero corporation tax, low wages, weak trade unions, [and] vestigial welfare provisions”.
Conservative MP Owen Paterson, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who was a leading voice in the Leave.EU campaign in 2016, believes that a Singapore-upon-Thames would be a “low-tax, low-spend, low regulation” Britain.
With the UK’s close geographical proximity to the EU, such a scenario does raise concerns, particularly for Ireland due to our shared border with the UK.
Let’s unpack what a Singapore-upon-Thames actually is. Is it fact or fiction?
How does Singapore-upon-Thames actually relate to Singapore?
Since gaining independence from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore, a small city-state, has focused on a policy of free trade, allowing it to become of the richest countries in the world.

While promoting new industries, it also participates actively in regional organisations and was a founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
In terms of welfare distribution, the Central Provident Fund has existed as Singapore’s compulsory savings plan.
It funds retirement, healthcare and housing requirements, where employers must contribute 17% until they reach the age of 55. For employees, the rate is 20%, with different declining rates after this.
The Singapore economy does not rely exclusively on banking. Finance and insurance account for 13% of GDP (7% in the UK), with manufacturing at 22% (compared to 10% in the UK).
While it has no capital gains tax, its corporation tax is at 17%, only slightly behind the 19% applied in the UK.
However, the People’s Action Party has been the only party to form a government in Singapore since 1959.
Timothy Besley and Masayuki Kudamatsu, of the London School of Economics, have stated that an autocratic style of government is applied here.
In terms of the Democracy Index, the country is ranked 66thout of 167 countries, and 151stout of 180 in thePress Freedom Index.
Why did Singapore want a free trade deal with the EU?
Accessing the EU’s single market was a key factor for Singapore when completingtrade talkswith the EU and came into effect in November.
The EU is the country’s third largest trading partner in goods and the largest in services.
It is also the case that with the ASEAN market consisting of 600 million consumers and expected to become the fourth largest economic bloc by 2030.
This deal is anticipated to be a critical signpost to indicate how an eventual EU-ASEAN trade agreement might be reached.
One aspect of the trade deal is that over 80% of all imports from Singapore will enter the EU duty-free – these include products from pharmaceuticals to footwear.
However, the agreement protects certain sensitive sectors (like TV, radio and film, public health and education, social services and water distribution) in which no commitments were made.

Does the Brexiter idea of Singapore-upon-Thames add up?
The short answer is no.
The Singapore presented by Brexiters is more of a mirage than a creditable course of economic policy planning.
As outlined, Singapore is far from the laissez-faire free-for-all that some Brexiters wish for it to be.
It is unlikely that the UK, as a parliamentary democracy, with a European-style social model could chart the same route that Singapore has.
It is also the case that the Conservative party, once a champion for a smaller state, won the recent British general election on a platform of “getting Brexit done” in order to focus on delivering increased public spending and public services.
Additionally, the new European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan told theIrish Worldthat a Singapore-upon-Thames “is a nice soundbite but I don’t think there’s any reality to it”.
On this island, it was the common EU standards and rules both North and South that allowed for the political curtain to be pulled aside.
The border went from being an ingrained daily existence for those who live alongside it, to being as gentle a presence as the current of the River Blackwater that flows between counties Tyrone and Monaghan.
“I think the United Kingdom will find out, rather negatively, in the future in relation to independent trade deals that they will find it difficult to get better deals than they have already been part of in the European Union,” said Hogan.
Noelle O Connell is Executive Director of the European Movement Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-happens-prime-minister-boris-johnson-lose-seat-4928987-Dec2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON IS defending a majority of 5,034 in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in Thursday’s election, the smallest of any sitting UK Prime Minister since 1924.
Pollsters have suggested the race could be close, so what happens if the Prime Minister fails to win a spot in the House of Commons?
According to one academic, Johnson could remain in charge without a place in the Commons or the Lords because “there’s no constitutional bar to the PM not being a member of either House of Parliament”.
Robert Hazell, professor of politics at University College London, used the example of Sir Alec Douglas Home, who led the country from 1963-1964.
Sir Alec was a member of the House of Lords when he became prime minister but then relinquished his earldom.
In the 20 days between him leaving the Lords, and winning a by-election to gain his seat in the Commons, he was not a member of either House.
Prof Hazell said it is “harder to answer the question how politically acceptable that might be nowadays”.
If the Prime Minister does not win in his west London constituency, Prof Hazell thinks it likely that a Tory in a safe seat will be persuaded to stand down to allow Johnson to stand in a by-election.
He explained: “I’m sure there would be loyal Tory MPs willing to stand aside if that enabled Boris Johnson then to swiftly get re-elected to the House of Commons.
“He might have to offer some inducement like a seat in the Lords.”

Hung parliament
This scenario would become more complicated, however, in the case of a hung Parliament, as the Prime Minister would take on a caretaker role and would not be in a position to hand out public roles.

Prof Hazell continued: “The caretaker business complicates it further because there’s a caretaker convention which requires the caretaker PM not to initiate any new policy or make any major public appointments.”
Polling released on Monday projected that Johnson will retain his Commons place.
YouGov’s MRP modelled that the Conservatives would win 49% of the vote in Uxbridge, compared to Labour on 40%.

However, the same data suggests that the Labour vote could be as high as 48%, and the Tory vote share as low as 41%.
Chris Curtis, political research manager at YouGov, told the PA news agency: “Our MRP model shows it’s unlikely we’ll see the Prime Minister lose his seat in the forthcoming General Election with Boris Johnson currently nine points ahead of his Labour rival in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.
“Even if Labour manage to aggressively squeeze what’s left of the Lib Dem vote, the Prime Minister should still be returned to his seat on 13 December.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-recovery-fund-ireland-5155487-Jul2020/,"AFTER FOUR DAYS of contentious talks in Brussels — which even had French President Emmanuel Macronthreatening to jump in his helicopterand fly away — EU leaders have agreed on the broad contours of a €750 billion pandemic recovery fund as part of its €1.8 trillion seven-year Budget.
The main beneficiaries of the fund will be southern member states like Italy and Spain.
Ravaged by the virus, those two countries have limited room to borrow money because of their high levels of historic debt.
Ireland, on the other hand, is reportedly set to receive about €3 billion from the fund itself and more through various EU Budget instruments over the next seven years.
Questions have been asked in recent days about whether or not Ireland will be paying into the fund and what exactly our contribution will be.
Over the weekend, Taoiseach Micheál went as far as to assert that Ireland would be a “net contributor”, comments which wererepeated by his party colleague, Europe minister Thomas Byrne, this morning.
So what’s the story and how does it all work?
Is Ireland a ‘net contributor’ to the €750 billion recovery fund?
No, not for the moment anyway.
The Republic’s and, indeed, every member state’s contribution to the €750 billion recovery fund will be exactly €0 at the outset.
Why?
Because the entire point of the fund is that it will give the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, unprecedented elbow room to borrow money on capital markets and distribute it to member states.
There’s no central pot into which countries are paying — the funds will be raised by the Commission issuing debt.
This has never really been done before, or certainly not on this scale.
Not even in the depths of the last major crash did EU leaders agree to issue joint debt in this fashion and if the deal is ‘historic’ or ‘unprecedented’ or any of the things European politicians are saying about it, it’s in the precedent that it sets in that particular area.
The Commission’s legal powers to borrow on behalf of the EU27 and dish out funds are grounded Article 122 of the EU Treaty.
Already this year, it has borrowed about €100 billion for an initiative called SURE, the EU Council’s jobs safety net programme unveiled in March in response to the pandemic.
But this is a significant ramping up of the Commission’s activity in debt markets.
What’s all this about grants?
Under the plan, around €390 billion of the €750 billion will be carved up and served to the EU27 in the form of grants, €312.5 billion of which will form the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Fund.
The rest will be set available to EU countries as loans, which have to be paid back eventually.
Advertisement
On the other hand, member states do not have to directly pay back grant funding under the scheme, which is why some EU leaders fought so hard to reduce the total amount doled out under this heading and attach conditions to its distribution.
Member states will have to produce national recovery plans in order to access these funds, which will be handed out between 2021 and 2023.
Four northern countries, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria succeeded in reducing the grant portion from the €500 billion that was originally proposed to €390 billion in the final agreement.
But will Ireland and other member states have to back the money?
Yes, eventually.
The Commission will have to pay back the €750 billion that it plans to borrow from institutional investors. The deadline it has set itself is 2058.
Member states, the ultimate guarantors of the borrowed funds, will also eventually have the Commission back for the loans but potentially over a longer period and under more generous conditions.
Overall, the plan is for the Commission to cover the €750 billion tab through revenue-generating ‘own resources’.
This could mean new bloc-wide taxes and levies and could well put the controversial (at least in Ireland) digital sales tax issue to the top of the European political agenda as the Commission hammers out the detail over the next few years.
If the executive fails to get some of these policies over the line in the next two to three years, it could mean that member states end up increasing their payment contributions in future EU budgets.
So technically, over time, Ireland could become a net contributor to the repayment effort but only if the EU does not reach consensus on new revenue-generating policies.
What’s the story with the EU Budget anyway?
Alongside the emergency recovery fund, European leaders were also negotiating a seven-year Budget framework for the EU.
Basically it means that EU leaders worked out how much money will be given to various bloc-wide programmes like, for example, the Common Agricultural Policy.
Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU since 2013 and will remain so over the next seven years.
Contributions to the EU Budget are based on financial capacity so Ireland paying the EU more than it receives each year is, so the argument goes, a reflection of the State’s economic health.
These contributions fluctuate because they’re based on the member states’ gross national income for a particular financial year so it’s impossible to predict exactly what Ireland will be paying over the seven years.
And what does the new Budget look like?
A decidedly mixed bag.
In order to get the recovery fund deal across the line, compromises had to be made, which meant hacking budgets for certain EU programmes to pieces.
The Commission’s Just Transition Fund, a key part of the EU’s plan to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050, was slashed from a proposed €50 billion to just €10 billion.
The bloc’s medical research programme Horizon, slated to receive an extra €13.5 billion over the next seven years, will now only get €5 billion.
On the plus side domestically, Ireland will benefit from a €5 billion Brexit reserve fund, set aside to help countries and businesses that have been impacted and an extra €300 million under the Common Agricultural Policy.

Tánaiste, Simon Coveney, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe and Minister for EU Affairs, Helen McEntee are due to go to Dublin Port at 5am tomorrow to get a tour of the purpose-built Brexit facilities and to see the first ships of the day dock and unload.
The media and photographers have also been invited along.
Speaking about the press event, Martin said Fine Gael are politicising Brexit, calling it “desperate stuff”.
“Fine Gael were a great party for photo ops for the past four years. I mean they are always about spin… Leo himself created the unit that was going to cost €5 million to promote themselves and here now, the last great photo-op, they are getting up at 5am in the morning to go to a port to be photographed – that is just pathetic stuff,” he said.

Martin also hit out against the Fine Gael’s Phil Hogan, who is now the EU’s chief trade negotiator.
In an interview withRTÉ Newsyesterday, Hogan warned against complacency and urged people in Ireland to “come out of their slumber” and wake up to that reality of Brexit.
“I’m very concerned at what I see in Ireland the moment. There’s a lot of complacency in the system. Commentators and the media and the public generally don’t seem to realise we’re starting the most difficult part of the negotiations,” he said.
When asked about Hogan’s intervention, Martin said:

“I think Phil Hogan should stay out of domestic Irish politics for the next week.
“That to me was a coded partisan intervention.”
Hogan told RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke today that he has “never interfered in domestic politics since becoming EU Commissioner”.
He said comments he made this week were made in the context of it being the eve of Brexit. When questioned by Sean O’Rourke, he said he was sure it is the case that an alternative government could do just as well as the previous Fine Gael government with regard to Brexit, adding: “I’m sure that that is the case and I never said otherwise.”

“I know people are sensitive at election time but I’m not sensitive about telling the truth about the position and alerting people out of their complacency,” he said.In recent days, Coveney has come out with a strong warning that Brexit is not done.
While he said yesterday that is not trying to scare people during an election campaign, he said also said Varadkar is the best man for the job in dealing with the next phase of Brexit. He has also questioned Martin’s experience in dealing with such matters.
Martin said today that Fine Gael’s Brexit message has changed since December.
“I remember before Christmas this was a great [Brexit] deal and now in the last 48 hours there is a freight train coming down the tracks. Big Phil is telling the Irish people they are in a slumber and so there is a new story and a new narrative being created that things are desperate altogether. People are going to see through that as an election creation to frighten people into voting in certain direction and I don’t think it will work,” he said.
Speaking at an Irish Institute of International and European Affairs earlier today, Martin added:

During his speech, he also addressed the issue of a united Ireland, stating:
Martin said a referendum on a united Ireland will happen “when the time is right and when sectarian issues have been reduced, and when we are able to do more than just offer a swapping of roles, and when we don’t just talk about reconciliation but actually practice it.”
Say no Sinn Féin
While Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael focused on Brexit this morning, People Before Profit were in the Grand Canal area urging Sinn Féin not to go into coalition with Martin or Varadkar after the election.
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Bríd Smith said that while of course, they would like voters to vote number one for their candidates, they could see the surge in support for Sinn Féin.
Smith said Sinn Féin needs to “categorically rule out” going into government with either big party, and voters need to know their position before election day.
She said history shows that any left party that goes into government with the “larger right-wing parties” are “ate up and spat out by the conservative blocs” due to their agenda “to maintain the status quo”.
“It is not about whether Mary Lou” is strong enough to resist Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil’s agenda-setting, if Sinn Féin goes into government, said Smith, acknowledging that McDonald is a “formidable” leader.
She will be a junior partner in government, with a conservative party, said Smith, adding that the larger party in government will “gobble up and spit out the politics of the left parties”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-minister-chlorinated-chicken-5018777-Feb2020/,"BRITAIN’S ENVIRONMENT minister has refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal.
George Eustice also defended the Government’s new immigration system, after businesses raised fears of a shortage of workers.
His predecessor before the recent reshuffle had insisted the controversial products from the States would not be imported amid animal welfare and environmental fears.
But Eustice, while saying there are “no plans” to change the law, did not explicitly rule it out when pressed three times on the subject.
With the Government expected to publish its negotiating position for a free trade deal with Washington within two weeks, he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday that the Government would not “take risks” on standards of welfare.
But he said “lactic acid washes” are now more commonly used in the US than chlorine, which is unlikely to allay fears over animal welfare because concerns centre on treatment before the washes themselves.
“What I’m saying is we won’t make any moves on our standards, we’ve got a clear position in this country that it is illegal to sell chlorine-washed chicken, illegal to sell beef treated with hormones, we have no plans to change those things,” he said.
Eustice was appointed environment secretary this month.PAPA
Consumer group Which? was highly-critical of the comments and demanded that ministers legislate to “ensure current high principles are preserved and reinforced in future trade deals”.
Sue Davies, its head of consumer protection and food policy, said: “It is astonishing that instead of improved food safety and health, chemical washing techniques for chicken and hormone-treated beef are still being left on the negotiating table when the debate has to be firmly focused on the food standards consumers want.”
National Farmers Union president Minette Batters called for the Government to add protections into law to prevent imports “that fails to meet our food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards”.
“If it doesn’t, it will not only fail our farmers but the public too, who quite rightly demand and expect these standards from our own farmers,” she added.

Labour’s shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard called for the Tories to introduce a ban on trade deals lowering welfare and environmental standards.
“Chlorinated chicken being sold in Britain is a genuine risk, unless this backdoor to lower standard US goods imports is closed and a ban is put into law,” he said.
Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats’ food and rural affairs spokesman, accused the Conservatives of having backed down on their commitment.
“With the Tories’ desperation for a trade deal with Donald Trump, it would appear they are rolling back on their promises,” he said.
Theresa Villiers, who was relegated from leading the environment department to the backbenches in Boris Johnson’s reshuffle, had been explicit in January that the EU laws banning chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef would be adopted here.
“There are legal barriers to their import and those are going to stay in place,” she added.
After his major speech setting out his post-Brexit vision, Boris Johnson criticised “hysterical” coverage that described US food as “inferior”.
“I totally understand the concerns about chlorinated chicken because it’s not a hygiene issue it’s an animal welfare issue,” he added.
“And what we will do is use our negotiations to persuade our partners if they want to trade freely with us then they have to accept our approach to animal welfare.”
The Government’s immigration plans set out this week are designed to cut the number of low-skilled migrants entering the UK.
The plans have drawn criticism from businesses for choking off a supply of workers that they need to operate.
Eustice, who used to run a strawberry farm, stressed a seasonal agricultural workers scheme will be an “important part of immigration policy in the future”.
He said there would be a quadrupling of the size of the scheme to 10,000 initially this year, but this still falls short of National Farmers’ Union calls for 70,000.
Eustice said ministers would be working out a “fully fledged” programme for the future.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-election-things-to-watch-4927758-Dec2019/,"TODAY IS ELECTION day in the UK, with the two largest parties both declaring it as the most important election in a generation.
With Brexit the dominant issue and the potentially even the future of the UK on the table, it’s difficult to argue with that claim.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured the holding of the election at the fourth time of asking so he’s very much staked his leadership on winning.
For Jeremy Corbyn, the election could very well be his final shot at becoming prime minister.
There’s so much more going on too, so here’s some specific things you should keep an eye out for.
Is the dreaded ‘Christmas election’ really to be feared?
Holding an election near Christmas is usually seen as a bad idea, with politicians always saying that the public don’t want to vote during the festive period.
This very argument was made repeatedly during the recent Dáil confidence votein Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy.
Whether this is actually true though is an open question. The UK’s last winter election in 1974 had a turnout of 78.8%, thehighest in the last 50 years.
It’s therefore worth looking out for to see what the turnout is like today and to see if the time of year has had an effect.
Turnout has increased in each of the last four UK elections with 68.8% voting in 2017.

One thing that’s not a question though is that snow or other severe weather could cause issues at polling stations. No such problems are being predicted, however.
There are two ice warnings in place in Scotland but no snow warnings and the UK’s Met Office has said that it is not expecting anything that “will cause any real disruption”.
The magic numbers
Johnson called the general election hoping to win a parliamentary majority that his predecessor Theresa May failed to win.
The all-important number for Johnson to win an absolute majority is 326, eight more that his party won two years ago.
In reality though, he will likely need a couple less depending on how many seats Sinn Féin win.
With Sinn Féin abstaining from taking their seats, it reduces the majority in parliament.
For example, when the Conservatives under David Cameron won 331 seats in 2015 the party had an absolute majority of 12, given that the remainder of seats in parliament was 319.
When Sinn Féin’s five seats were taken out, however, Cameron’s working majority increased to 17.

Johnson will be hoping for a similar return when the votes are counted and a poll released onTuesday night suggested that 339 seats is possible.
For Labour, it’s worth remembering that the party doesn’t necessarily need to win a majority, only prevent the Conservatives from doing so.
If the party were to increase their seat count by just a few, Corbyn could perhaps form a minority government with the support or abstention of the SNP and possibly the Liberal Democrats.
Will the ‘Red Wall’ hold?

Labour heartland areas across the north of the England are seen as key to this election because of the potential they go Conservative and grant Johnson the extra seats he needs to win a majority.
Many of these constituencies voted Leave in the Brexit referendum and Johnson has been frantically campaigning across them in the final few days in a bid to win over Leave voters.
Yougov’s finalconstituency-by-constituencyprediction forecast that Labour could lose as many as 29 seats, having earlier said 43 could go.
The pollster said Labour appeared to be “patching over the cracks” in the red wall as the campaign has progressed, so one of the big questions tomorrow is how many of these seats Labour manages to hold.
How many women will be elected to parliament?
A record number of women MPs are expected to be elected when the votes are counted, with predictions that at least 220 could be returned.
The previous election saw 208 women elected and more women are standing this time around, many of whom are in safe seats.
BBC has reported that there are a total of 1,124 women standing for election, about a third of all candidates.
Who will be this year’s Nick Clegg?
The Telegraph/ YouTube
Former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg lost his seat in a shock defeat in the last general election. Even thewinning candidate was surprised.
Such is the unforgiving nature of the UK electoral system wherethere is no room for second place, we’re usually treated to images of some ‘big beasts’ losing their seats.
Michael Portillo is perhaps the most famous example when losing his seat in 1997. So much so that‘Portillo moment’has become part of British political lexicon.
This time around, there are a few of notable names who might be at risk.
Perhaps most of Irish interest given his prominence in the Brexit negotiations, there have been suggestions that Dominic Raab could be in danger on foot of a strong challenge from the Liberal Democrats.
Raab had a huge majority of over 23,000 votes in the last election butpolls in the past couple of weeks have shown his challengeris creeping to within a few percentage points.
Others on the Conservative side who are said to be at risk are former leader Iain Duncan Smith and former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers.
Chuka Umunna, who left Labour to join Change UK and is now with the Liberal Democrats, also has some way to go to keep his seat.

There is also one other potential bombshell defeat…
Could Boris Johnson lose his seat?
It might seem unlikely but it’s not beyond the realm of possibility either.
Johnson’s seat in the West London constituency of Uxbridge & Ruislip South has a majority of just 5,034, the smallest of any sitting prime minister for 100 years.
It would mean that a swing of about 5% of the votes from him to his Labour challenger could see him lose the seat. If it were to happen, it would be the first time ever than an incumbent prime minister has lost their seats.

Labour’s Ali Milani is the man hoping to cause the upset andBBC News has reported that “thousands” of activistsfrom the pro-Jeremy Corbyn Momentum group have been dispatched to help him.
Even if it does happen though, theConservatives are reportedly planning a backup planthat would see a Conservative MP from a safe seat standing aside to instead go to the House of Lords, allowing Johnson to contest a by-election to become an MP again.
TheInstitute for Government also explains that there is precedentthat would allow Johnson remain as prime minister even if he had lost his seat.
‘The Brexit election’?

The dominant social and political question of the time has still not been answered three-and-half years after the Brexit vote in June 2016.
While some may argue that the question has been answered but that politicians haven’t listened, the fact is thatmost of the parties running in the electionare either opposed to Brexit or want another referendum.
Labour are in the latter camp and want another referendum, with Corbyn nowstating he’d take a ‘neutral stance’ if such a votecame around.
The party has been keen to campaign on other issues and wasreportedly unhappy that Sky News decided to brandits coverage as ‘The Brexit Election’.
Conversely, Brexit has been the central point of the Conservatives’ campaign with Johnson using every opportunity possible to speak about it.
Similarly, the Liberal Democrats are campaigning with Brexit squarely at the centre, albeit from a Remain standpoint.
Elections are traditionally fought along ideological lines with voters choosing between left and right policies, but Brexit has changed the game somewhat.
The results will go a long way to showing us how much this is the case.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-uk-brexit-2-5240808-Oct2020/,"UK AND EU Brexit negotiators will embark on an “intensified phase of talks” today after Brussels said both sides needed to compromise on trade issues.
The EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier made conciliatory signals to his UK counterpart David Frost as the deadline for a deal looms.
Number 10 acknowledged that “significant gaps” remain between the two sides and it was “entirely possible that negotiations will not succeed”.
But there were some upbeat reports that a deal could be done within two weeks, with the Daily Telegraph reporting that Frost believed Brussels was applying a “fundamental” change of approach to the talks.
The negotiations had been in limbo after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s previous deadline for a deal passed last week.
The key issues of contention remain fishing rights, the governance of any deal and the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition, which includes state subsidies.
With the Brexit transition period set to end on 31 December, time is short to reach an agreement.
Both sides had previously said a deal would need to be reached by mid-October in order to allow time for ratification.

Barnier told the European Parliament: “Our door remains open.
“It will remain open right up until the last day when we can work together.”
But he said “it takes two to make a deal”, adding: “We are not sure that’s the outcome we will obtain and that’s why we need to be ready to deal with the consequences of a possible no-deal scenario.”
Extending an olive branch to the UK, Barnier indicated the EU was willing to make compromises – but only if Johnson also agreed to give ground.
“We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides in order to do our utmost to reach an agreement and we will do so right up until the last day which it’s possible to do so.”
Downing Street said the UK’s position had been set out by Johnson and Michael Gove, who had been clear the EU had to be serious about talking intensively, on all issues, and bringing the negotiation to a conclusion, as well as accepting that it was dealing with an “independent and sovereign country”.
A Number 10 spokesman said: “We welcome the fact that Barnier acknowledged both points…  and additionally that movement would be needed from both sides in the talks if agreement was to be reached.
“As he made clear, ‘any future agreement will be made in respect of the decision-making autonomy of the European Union and with respect for British sovereignty’.”
If a deal is not possible, the UK will end the transition period “on Australia terms” – without a deal with its largest trading partner.
The spokesman said: “It is clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas, but we are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-germany-boris-johnson-5230257-Oct2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON HELD telephone talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the countdown to a Brexit deal deadline continues.
The two leaders spoke today, a day after Johnson held similar discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The intensive diplomacy comes with seemingly just days to go for an agreement on a future trade settlement to be struck between Britain and Brussels.

Johnson told the German leader a deal was the desirable outcome, but he was prepared to leave the Brexit transition period at the end of the year on Australian-style terms with the EU if necessary.
Both sides have said an agreement needs to be struck in October to ensure sufficient time for ratification.
Johnson has previously said he wants agreement on a free-trade deal by the time of next week’s EU summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday.
Referring to the Prime Minister, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “He outlined the current situation with respect to negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, emphasising the UK’s desire to reach an agreement.
“The Prime Minister stressed that, while achieving a deal in the coming days would be beneficial for both sides, the UK was also prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if a deal was not possible.

“The Prime Minister emphasised that progress must be made in the coming days to bridge the significant gaps, in particular in the areas of fisheries and the level playing field, through the process of intensive talks between chief negotiators.”
The telephone talks came ahead of UK and EU negotiators resuming informal negotiations next week in Brussels, with time running out for agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal.
Lead negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost met on Friday for face-to-face discussions in London.
Johnson and Merkel also discussed the coronavirus crisis in their bilateral discussions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-next-steps-4865485-Oct2019/,"WHAT ARE WE waiting for?
As it stands, a Brexit deal has been agreed between the EU and UK at official level. That deal has to pass through both parliaments – the UK’s House of Commons and the European Parliament – before it can be enacted.
We have had several votes on a version of the Withdrawal Agreement in the past year, as well as indicative votes to narrow down what parliament wants – all leading to a dead-end result.
So although a Brexit deal has been struck between the EU and UK, until it passes through the House of Commons it counts for naught.
As it stands, the current Brexit deadline is Thursday, 31 October. If there is no extension, and as it’s incredibly unlikely that a deal will be passed in the House of Commons, a no-deal Brexit next Thursday is the current position.
Extension Rebellion
However – it’s very likely that the EU will grant an extension.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Wednesday that a meeting of the European Council could be called “possibly next Monday, maybe even on Friday (today)” if unanimity wasn’t reached.
Varadkar also repeated the government’s position, that it would support the UK’s request for an extension in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit “by consequence or by accident”.
If all 27 EU leaders agree that an extension should be granted, and agree to the length and nature of the extension, then it can be granted in written form without a summit. If there isn’t unanimity, an EU Council summit will have to be called to iron out a position.
“Essentially what Tusk is doing is ringing heads of government and asking their views on it. If there is consensus we can do this by written procedure,” Varadkar explained to the Dáil.

The EU has said that it would grant an extension if it was requested for a good reason – after the previous extension was granted, it gave room for a Tory leadership contest to take place. Another extension of the Brexit timeline could be granted by the EU so that the UK could hold a general election, a second referendum, or reverse the whole Brexit process entirely by revoking Article 50, which it can do unilaterally.

Last night, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that if parliament wants time to scrutinise his Brexit legislation, it would get it, but in exchange he wants a general election on 12 December.
“It is our duty to end this nightmare and provide the country with a solution as soon as we reasonably can,” he wrote.
It comes after MPs voted to back a process of scrutinising the legislation implementing the new withdrawal deal on Tuesday night, but then voted down the government’s timetable to ram that legislation through by the end of the week.
Johnson then told the Commons he would be “pausing” the legislation for the moment, having earlier threatened to immediately go for an election if things didn’t go his way on the truncated timetable vote.
This meant that there was support for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, but not for his timeframe for turning it into British law.
So now, instead of proposing another schedule to pass his deal, Johnson has said that he will table a motion on Monday to call for a general election. If two-thirds of MPs vote for it (the magic number is 434) then we get a general election on 12 December.
If Labour agree to back his call for an election – but Labour will want to see the EU grant an extension before they do so.
The question is for how long. Johnson wrote in his letter that he would prefer a short extension until the 15 or 30 November. The date contained in the legislation that compelled him to request an extension was 31 January 2020.
“The UK has formally applied for an extension until the end of January, although the Prime Minister is keen to leave at the end of October,” Varadkar said on Wednesday.
“As of yet, there is no extension agreed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-mick-mulvaney-brexit-washington-us-5216538-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|28 Sep 2020
THE UNITED STATES will “protect and defend” the Good Friday Agreement, the US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland has said.
Mick Mulvaney said the agreement could be “at risk” because of the UK Government’s controversial Internal Market Bill, but that it was something the United States was “very interested in seeing not happen”.
He made the comments on a visit to Dublin today where he met with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
His visit comes as the British government rebuffed a fresh demand from the EU to withdraw the Internal Market Bill, which could see the UK unilaterally tear up elements of the Brexit divorce deal.
Mulvaney said the US was watching the EU-UK negotiations closely.
“I think it’s fair to say we are aware and cautious and watching the situation,” he said.
“Concern would imply that we’re worried and I don’t think we’re at that point yet but we certainly understand the interplay between the EU/UK trade deal and the Internal Market Bill and the Good Friday agreement.
“That’s mostly while I’m here. I have not been able to be here previously because of Covid.”
He told RTÉ News that the Good Friday Agreement could be “at risk”.
He said: “I don’t think it necessarily follows that just because the UK introduced the Internal Markets Bill that automatically means the Good Friday Agreement is at risk.

“But I think anyone who looks at the situation understands there could be a series of events that could put the Good Friday Agreement at risk.
“Again something we’re very interested in seeing not happen in the United States.
“We’re here to protect, defend that Good Friday Agreement that was so hard fought and won.”
Mulvaney met with Simon Coveney earlier today.
This is his first visit to Ireland, due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In July, he said that he was“chomping at the bit”to visit Northern Ireland.
Mulvaney met with Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis in Belfast yesterday.
Coveney isset to travel toWashingtonthis week to discuss“the unbreakable bond between Ireland and the USA”.
“I emphasised our real concern at the current approach of the UK Government and the vital importance of the full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, for the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the peace process,” Coveney said in a statement.
The UK government faced anger and criticism in Europe and the US over the Internal Markets Bill, which would allow ministers to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement regarding trade with Northern Ireland.
Mulvaney yesterdaysaid that he believesthat a trade deal can still be reached
“What the attitude of my government is – is that we are confident the EU and UK will be able to work this out in a way that’s acceptable to everybody,” he told the BBC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/london-protest-fines-brexit-fishing-deal-5328583-Jan2021/,"SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE been issued with fixed penalty notices (FPN) after a protest over the Brexit fishing deal in London.
Metropolitan Police confirmed that 14 people had been issued with fines after a protest this morning.
Seafood hauliers descended on roads near 10 Downing Street in response to the issues they have faced in exporting seafood to the EU, saying they were being “tied in knots with paperwork” by the Brexit fishing deal.
Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by delays since the UK’s transition period ended on 31 December.
The new checks and paperwork has been causing massive delays for the industry since the UK left the European Union, with seafood producers growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of government action.
Lorries transporting freshly-caught produce have been held up at distribution hubs and many have struggled to enter into France.
A spokesman for the force said: “Police are aware of a protest in Westminster relating to the UK fishing industry – an appropriate policing plan is in place.
“We would remind those involved that London remains in Tier 4 for Covid restrictions and anyone breaching the regulation will be reported.
“No arrests occurred, but a number of lorries have been stopped and 14 people, who were either drivers or passengers in those vehicles, have been reported via FPN for Covid-related offences.”

Yesterday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed the delays were just “teething problems”, adding: “I’m not convinced that that is the result of the agreement.”
Some Scottish fishermen have taken to landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the “bureaucratic system” that exports to Europe now involve.
A spokesperson from Eyemouth-based DR Collin & Son, who were taking part in the protest, said: “The industry is being tied in knots with paperwork requirements which would be easy enough to navigate, given that companies have put in the time and training in order to have all the relevant procedures in place for 1st January 2021.
“However, all the training is going to waste as the technology is outdated and cannot cope with the demands being placed on it – which in turn is resulting in no produce being able to leave the UK.
“These are not ‘teething issues’ as reported by the government and the consequences of these problems will be catastrophic on the lives of fishermen, fishing towns and the shellfish industry as a whole.
Alasdair Hughson, Scottish Creel Fisherman’s Federation chairman, said: “It is inevitable that the UK Shellfish industry would want to make its voice heard loud and clear on this matter.
“After the year that all of these businesses have had, struggling to survive against the odds, now faced with this situation, to now find themselves being blamed for not completing forms correctly when they are all just trying to follow Government guidelines which are unclear and changing all of the time.
“If this debacle does not improve very soon we are looking at many established businesses coming to the end of the line.”
Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the government of trying to blame fishing communities for the issues caused by Brexit.
Keir said: “They are beyond frustrated, they are pretty angry about what’s gone on because the Government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years.
“It didn’t prepare for it and now it is doing the classic thing of the Government, which is trying to blame the fishing communities rather than accepting it’s their failure to prepare.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-driving-licence-ireland-brexit-5286264-Dec2020/,"ANYONE WHO HOLDS a UK driving licence but lives in Ireland has been warned they may not be covered by their insurance from the start of 2021.
At 11pm on 31 December, the Brexit transition period ends and the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. After this period a number of changes come into force, including British driver licences no longer being legally recognised by Irish authorities.
As of October, an estimated 10,000-17,000 were expected to make an application at the last minute to exchange their British driving licence for an Irish one.
Since 2018, the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) said that around 53,000 UK licences have been exchanged for the Irish version.
In response to a recent parliamentary question, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said those who possess UK driving licences and reside in this jurisdiction “will not be entitled to drive here on those licences after [31 December]“.
He said: “However, as holders of UK licences who are resident in the jurisdiction will not be able to drive legally on UK licences after the end of the transition period at the end of this year, it is understandable that insurance companies would not cover them to drive on those licences.
Advertisement
“The solution for people in this situation is therefore to exchange their licences as soon as possible.”
To exchange your licence, you need to fill out a licence application form and present this, a €55 fee and your UK licence at any of the 36 NDLS centre. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, you mustbook an appointmentwith an NDLS centre.
Back in October, the NDLSsaidthat it was important to take steps now to exchange your UK/NI licence as there may be further delays caused by a last-minute increase in applications, plus extra demand on the service caused by Covid-19.
However, junior minister Hildegarde Naughton has also said there is potential in the future for a reciprocal arrangement with the UK over the use of foreign driving licences.
She said, in response to a separate parliamentary question: “However, legislation exists to allow for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes in the Road Traffic Acts.
“There is a distinction between motorists with a UK driving licence visiting Ireland and those living in Ireland. This means that motorists who are not resident in Ireland but driving in Ireland with a UK driving licence while visiting are not affected by Brexit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-cabinet-eu-ambassadors-deal-5311821-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|28 Dec 2020
THE 27 EU member states have given the green light for the post-Brexit trade deal to come into effect on 1 January, a spokesman has said.
Ambassadors from EU capitals met in Brussels to nod through the accord, using a procedure which will take effect at 2pm tomorrow.
This will provisionally allow tariff-free trade with Britain to continue after it leaves the EU single market at the New Year.
Sebastian Fischer, spokesman for the German presidency of the EU, said: “EU Ambassadors have unanimously approved the provisional application of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.”
The member states’ adoption of the plan allows it to come into effect in time to head off disruption of cross-Channel trade.
But the deal must still be ratified retrospectively by the European Parliament, probably in late February.
Meanwhile, Cabinet members are meeting here later today to discuss the deal.
The meeting was originally scheduled for tomorrow but has been brought forward by 24 hours to today,RTÉreported.
Speaking to RTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said he thinks there will be “some disruption” in ports as a result of Brexit.
“We think there will be some disruption in the ports, obviously our own ports but also in Holyhead and Dover. But this time of the year is not a very busy time of year in terms of freight, so we think we’ll be able to manage,” Varadkar said.
The Tánaiste also confirmed he will be launching a €100 million scheme today for people in the food sector affected by Brexit.

UK
In the UK, Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has been urging UK citizens to take out comprehensive travel insurance to cover health costs and check their mobile roaming policies to avoid charges if they are travelling to the EU.
He also warned businesses that the time is “very short” to make the final preparations before the UK begins trading with its biggest trading partner and minimise what he said would amount to “some disruption”.
“In just three days’ time the Brexit transition period will end and we will have finally regained our independence,” he added.
Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine urged MPs and peers to abstain when voting on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s trade deal, warning it will inflict “lasting damage” on the UK.
The former deputy prime minister said he will “in no way share the endorsement of the legislation”, but that he will not vote against it because the consequences of a no-deal would be even graver.
But it is likely to pass through both Houses, with Labour ordering its MPs to vote for the “thin” treaty because the only other option is a chaotic departure without a trade deal.
The IPPR think tank warned that the “weaker than expected” protections in the treaty leaves workers’ rights and environmental protections at risk of erosion.
But the Prime Minister denied the UK would regress on workers’ rights and environmental standards, two issues both sides have committed to uphold in the deal.
“All that’s really saying is the UK won’t immediately send children up chimneys or pour raw sewage all over its beaches. We’re not going to regress, and you’d expect that,” he told the Sunday Telegraph.
The Prime Minister did acknowledge that the treaty “perhaps does not go as far as we would like” over access to EU markets for financial services.
But he said that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is “doing a big exercise” on business taxes and regulation alongside a “great Government effort” for change in the new year.
Sunak said the nation will be able to “do things a bit differently” now, referencing new opportunities for the financial sector, and said the deal should leave those anxious about the financial impact “enormously reassured”.

“I actually think this deal can represent an enormously unifying moment for our country and bring people together after the divisions of the past few years,” he told broadcasters.
Fishing
The chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation (NFFO), Barrie Deas, accused Johnson of having “bottled it” on fishing quotas to secure only “a fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law”.
Deas said the Prime Minister had “sacrificed” fishing to other priorities, with the subject proving to be an enduring sticking point during negotiations.
A hasty analysis of the treaty secured on Christmas Eve began in earnest when it was published in full on St Stephen’s Day – less than a week before its implementation.
The self-styled “star chamber” of lawyers led by veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash and assembled by the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers was expected to reveal its verdict on tomorrow.
But there were indications Brexit hardliners were preparing to support the deal, despite being angered by the little time they have to debate it.
Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, said his party would vote against the “unforgivable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity” which he argued is a “very bad deal for Scotland”.
Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she expects to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week, a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck because Ankara is in a customs union with the bloc.

https://www.thejournal.ie/will-brexit-happen-meps-4956504-Jan2020/,"AFTER THREE YEARS of uncertainty, we’re just three weeks away from the UK’s exit from the EU. This is after three Brexit secretaries, two prime ministers, and various suggestions for how the border would operate post-Brexit.
The UK’s Brexit legislation has passed through the House of Commons this week, and although the House of Lords and European Parliament are still due a vote each, it’s all but certain Brexit will happen on 31 January.
But we’re not out of the woods yet, according to six of Ireland’s 11 MEPs who answered questions sent byTheJournal.ieon Brexit. Irish MEP Mairéad McGuinness said that the Withdrawal Agreement was “the easy part”, with the trade talks still to go.
Two other Irish MEPs said that Johnson was “unreliable” and that his refusal to extend the timeline to strike a trade deal was “bluster” and will lead to more “last-minute turmoil”.
Here are more of those MEPs’ thoughts on the upcoming trade talks, on whether it’s a good thing that the UK is finally leaving the EU after months of to-ing and fro-ing, and on the custom arrangements for Northern Ireland, where there’s a lot left to decide on.
“As with so much of Brexit, these are uncharted waters,” the Green Party’s Ciaran Cuffe toldTheJournal.ie. “Ever since the UK government indicated Brexit is about diverging from standards, leaving the customs union and the Single Market, solving the border issue has been like trying to square a circle.
Fine Gael MEP for Ireland South, Seán Kelly said: “The island of Ireland is unique, and therefore unique and unconventional arrangements were always going to be required.
“I believe that the strong political will on both sides to honour the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts will ensure that these arrangements will be made work.”
Mairéad McGuinness, who is a Fine Gael MEP for the Midlands-North West and the First Vice-President of the European Parliament since 2017, said there is still “work to do” on the custom proposals for Northern Ireland.
“I think this arrangement has the potential to work very well for Northern Ireland, giving it the best of both worlds in terms of access to the single market and the rest of the UK. But there is still work to do.”
Green Party MEP for Ireland South, Grace O’Sullivan said: “I do have concerns that some of the technical aspects will be difficult to operate initially, but I think a few months of operations should see most of the problems ironed out. The economic realities in cross border trade will add to the pressure to find workable arrangements on most aspects.”
Sinn Féin’s only MEP Matt Carthy was more emphatic in his views: “There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal for Ireland, and especially not for the north.”
He said that the provisions within the Withdrawal Agreement in relation to Northern Ireland are about “minimising the damage” that Brexit will cause.
“It is my view that the customs arrangements will offer some protections. However, the economic challenges caused by the partition of our country are likely to become even more evident and therefore it would be preferable for all of Ireland to be in the EU.

“The only mechanism for delivering on that is through a United Ireland and therefore we need the Irish government and civic society, north and south, to start planning for the scenario of a referendum on Irish Unity,” he said.
“Naturally, further clarity on what the UK wants has always been welcome these past three years,” Ciarán Cuffe responded.
“But of course I deeply regret the UK’s departure. I regret what Brexit means for UK-Ireland relations, for cooperation across this continent on important issues like climate change, workers’ rights, transport, and so much more. What we have to hope for now is that Boris Johnson’s plan to diverge from EU standards is softened.”
Seán Kelly said: “I firmly believe that the UK leaving the EU is not a good thing for the UK or for Europe. Ireland will miss the UK more than any other Member State, they are a great ally of ours at EU level and won’t be easily replaced.
McGuinness responded that she still “regrets the outcome of the referendum”.
“But it is a UK decision. Given that decision, I am glad that the UK will leave in an orderly fashion, with a Withdrawal Agreement that provides certainty on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU, on the financial settlement and, crucially, on special arrangements for Northern Ireland.
“That said, there is still uncertainty on the future EU-UK relationship. We have a Political Declaration that provides a general direction of travel – but all the detail needs to be worked out, by a deadline that is currently 31 December 2020.
Grace O’Sullivan: “I can understand that feeling, and indeed for some in the EU apparatus, there seems to be relief that finally we can move on to other things.
“The very existence of the UK itself seems more uncertain than ever, which threatens further instability in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, and of course, there is still the trade agreement to negotiate, within the unrealistic time frame of one year.
“So in a way we’re in the worst of all worlds – Brexit is now a certainty, but also not over with. The Irish government and EU are also left dealing with the most unreliable prime minister imaginable, a man who’s word we clearly cannot trust. This will make negotiations on market access, transport, residency, fisheries, trade and everything in between a daunting prospect.”
In response to the question of whether it’s a good thing that Brexit is happening, Matt Carthy said: “No, because the north of Ireland is being dragged out as well against the democratic wishes of the people who live there.
“Although the Withdrawal Agreement includes protections for the North which Sinn Féin campaigned for the fact remains that from 1 February our country will operate with one part within the EU and the other outside.
“This will cause issues economically (even with the bespoke customs arrangements) and politically. For example after Brexit the north will no longer have representatives in the European Parliament and other citizens rights will be undermined.”
Firstly, a reminder of where we are.
The UK parliament has passed British legislation that would enact the Withdrawal Agreement 2.0 that Boris Johnson struck with the European Union in September.
The legislation is now to pass through the House of Lords, where Johnson doesn’t have a majority, but is still likely to passed by the unelected members of the upper chamber.
Related ReadsOpinion: There will be no Singapore-upon-Thames. The UK cannot strike the same trade deal with the EU
After that, the European Parliament will have to vote on the deal, and then the UK will leave the EU on 31 January.
The UK will then enter a transition period where it will remain a member of the customs union and single market. The transition period ends at the end of 2020, but the UK will have the option of extending it for two years – which Johnson has said he wouldn’t do.
It’s during this 11-month timeframe the UK and EU are meant to negotiate a trade deal, which has been labelled as unrealistic since other trade negotiations have taken at least several years.
Ciarán Cuffe said that the success of these trade talks will “depend on the Conservative government’s approach to Brexit”.
Seán Kelly said that the EU’s Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan will take “a constructive approach and work hard” to secure a future relationship, adding: “If the same will is present on the UK side, it should be possible to reach a deal.”
Mairéad McGuinness said that the Withdrawal Agreement “was the easy part”.
“To take just one area: fishing. There has been a lot of talk in the UK about ‘Taking Back Control’ of UK waters, and it was a key theme in the Brexit campaign. That would cause problems for Irish and other EU fishermen.
“But as most UK fish and seafood is sold into the EU market, the EU will insist on access to UK waters in return for UK-product access to the EU market. Reaching a fair arrangement for both the UK and the EU will require careful negotiations.”
“Negotiating all of that in 11 months is a challenge,” she said.
“There is a huge amount still to be agreed,” Grace O’Sullivan said.
“Some, like reciprocal access to Irish and UK fisheries waters have nominal agreement, but could still unravel over the coming year.
“The timeline of one year I think is quite unrealistic, but then it’s important that all parties in Ireland do what we can to ensure the success of these talks, in the interest of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the EU itself.”
Matt Carthy said: “My guess is that they won’t collapse, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be several complications along the way.
“The trade talks are going to be crucial from an Irish perspective. We need them to work in order to ensure that the real economic catastrophe that Brexit presents doesn’t materialise. Therefore we need to be vigilant in our monitoring of the position of the British government but also of the EU.
“Recent EU trade deals have prioritised large corporate interests above those of citizens and smaller companies – Mercosur is an example. Ireland needs to make sure that the free trade deal is also a fair trade deal that protects workers, the environment and our national interests.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/independent-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-rejoining-eu-4906104-Nov2019/,"SCOTLAND WOULD BE able to rejoin the European Union relatively quickly if it were independent, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.
The Scottish National Party (SNP) leader said that Scotland would be “seeking a way back in” to the EU if Brexit goes ahead.
Scotland voted by 62% to remain in the European Union in 2016, and the SNP is keen to halt Brexit.
Sturgeon has already said she wants afresh balloton independence to take place in the second half of 2020.
In a BBC interview with Andrew Neil, Sturgeon said that if Scotland becomes independent she believes the timescale for rejoining the EU would be quite fast.
She said: “I’m not going to give you a specific timescale for that.
“In all of my experience of discussions with different interests in the European Union I think that could be relatively quick but that will depend on the discussions we have.
“We understand the conditions we would require to meet and the discussions that would require to take place but if we’re in a position of Scotland being taken out of the European Union then we will be seeking a way back in.”
Asked whether Scotland could join the EU while using the currency of a non-member state, she told the BBC: “We would be setting up a central bank, we would be setting up the infrastructure that is required for that, that is part of the discussion we would have about the European Union, but it is not true to say we would have had to have established an independent currency before joining the European Union.”
Advertisement
She added: “We would have a discussion with the EU about the journey an independent Scotland was on in terms of currency, and the accession if Scotland was already out of the EU to the point where we rejoined the EU.
“Scotland faces right now the uncertainty of being ripped out of the EU against our own will. It’s not of our making.
“And we need to plot the best way forward for our country where we are in charge of the decision that we make.”
Ms Sturgeon also said that if there was a hung parliament after the General Election on 12 December, any party wanting SNP support would need to allow a second independence referendum.
She told The Andrew Neil Interviews on BBC One: “Fundamental to this for me is that any party that is looking to the SNP for support has to be prepared to respect the right of the people of Scotland to choose their own future. And that means respecting the right of the Scottish Parliament to choose to have an independence referendum.”
Labour has been repeatedly forced to clarify its stance on permitting a second independence referendum, with leader Jeremy Corbyn initially saying such a ballot could not take place in the first five-year parliamentary term if he was prime minister, before saying this would not take place in the “early years” and “certainly not” in the first two years.
Sturgeon said she did not think it “credible” that Corbyn would quibble over the timing of an independence referendum.
She said: “It doesn’t appear to be the principle of a second independence referendum that Jeremy Corbyn is quibbling about now, it’s the timing. So for the sake of a year he’s going to turn his back on his chance to govern with a Labour government and do all of these other things he says he wants to do? I don’t find that credible.”
She also said that she would never do anything to support a Conservative government in office.
Paul Masterton, Scottish Conservative candidate for East Renfrewshire, said: “The reason the First Minister can’t give a timetable on what might happen to Scotland after independence is because the SNP doesn’t know what will happen. Yet still she insists we must have another referendum next year.”

TALKS ON A post-Brexit trade deal look set to go to the wire as Taoiseach Micheál Martin warned that failure to reach an agreement would be “ruinous” for the UK.
Negotiations are expected to continue next week but the European Union believes a deal must be concluded by mid-November in order for it to be ratified by the end of the year, when the current transition arrangements expire.
Downing Street acknowledged that “significant gaps” still remain between the two sides and “time is in short supply”.
Martin said failure to reach a deal would be “very damaging all around”, with Ireland and the UK particularly affected.
Without a deal being struck, trade between the UK and EU will be subject to tariffs set out by the World Trade Organisation.
Speaking to the BBC, the Taoiseach said: “We’ve all had a very significant shock to our economic system because of Covid-19 – the last thing we need now across all of our respective economies is a second major shock.”
Martin also said the UK needs to be “very careful that they do not do anything that could destabilise the politics of Northern Ireland”, and that no deal past the transition period could lead to “tensions that are unnecessary”.
Teams led by the EU’s Michel Barnier and the the UK’s David Frost have been taking place in London this week.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Talks are continuing in London and the negotiators are working hard to bridge the still significant gaps that remain.

Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he is prepared to walk away without a deal – something the government refers to as “Australian terms”.
In response to Martin, the spokesman said: “We have been working hard throughout to get a deal but we’ve always said that it needs to be a deal that fully respects UK sovereignty, and that’s what we’re continuing to pursue.

The main stumbling blocks between the UK and EU are thought to include the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing unfair competition on issues including state subsidies, the ongoing row over fishing rights, and how any UK-EU deal will be governed.
Johnson would “like to get a deal” but the transition period will definitely end on 31 December and “we will be ready to leave either on Australian-style terms or with a free-trade agreement if that can be reached with the EU”.
The Prime Minister is “fully confident we will prosper in all circumstances”.Stefaan de Rynck, an aide to MBarnier, called for the UK to sign up to “fair competition standards”.
“A whit of courage for signing up to fair competition standards in the mutual interest of EU and UK would be good,” he said.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told MPs: “The UK has already shown a great degree of flexibility in these negotiations, but it is important also that the European Union shows flexibility too.
He was unable to say how many of the estimated 50,000 customs agents needed to cope with the new trading arrangements were in place.
“It is the case there has been a significant increase in the number of customs agents who are being employed both by companies themselves with in-house capacity and also through intermediaries who have been scaling up their own activities as well,” he said.
Gove was meeting business chiefs to help prepare for the new arrangements which come into effect on January 1, outside the EU’s single market and customs union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-meeting-london-5200605-Sep2020/,"HASTILY ARRANGED TALKS will take place in London today after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
Concerns have been raised in particular around the commitment to State aid rules and the UK’s commitments to Northern Ireland made in the Withdrawal Agreement, which has been ratified in the House of Commons and European Parliament.
An “extraordinary meeting” of the Joint Committee between the UK and EU was called after the Prime Minister unveiled proposed legislation to alter three key elements of the Brexit deal with Brussels, all concerning Northern Ireland.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove will meet senior EU official Maroš Šefčovič to discuss the situation, as talks between the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost and his Brussels counterpart Michel Barnier continue.

The meeting between Gove and Šefčovič comes as Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosiinsisted there was“absolutely no chance” of Congress passing an American trade deal with the UK if the Northern Ireland peace process was “imperilled”.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was “very concerned” following the tabling in Parliament of the UK Internal Market Bill, which ministers have admitted will breach international law.
She said such actions would “undermine trust” and called on the Prime Minister to honour his past commitments.
The European Commission’s chief spokesperson Eric Mamertweetedlate on Wednesday: “Following today’s announcement by the UK, Maros Sefcovic will travel to London tomorrow to meet Michael Gove for an extraordinary meeting of the Joint Committee.
“The EU seeks clarifications from the UK on the full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.”
Ministers argue the new proposed legislation is necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if London and Brussels are unable to agree a free trade deal before the current Brexit transition period runs out at the end of the year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-5197729-Sep2020/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said that there is “no sense” in EU-UK trade talks continuing beyond 15 October, in a statement given amidst reports that the UK plans to abandon commitments given in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
The reportsindicate that sections of the UK’s Internal Market Bill are expected to “eliminate” the legal force of the Withdrawal Agreement in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs.
This has caused some concern in Ireland and abroad, though Tánaiste Leo Varadkartold reporters todaythat a certain amount of “sabre-rattling” is to be expected.
In a statementtweeted out today, Johnson said bluntly:
“There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on 15 October if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year.
The European Union negotiating team had already signalled the end of October as a deadline for securing a trade deal with the UK, leaving enough time to ratify any prospective agreement before the current arrangement expires on 31 December.
Last week, Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said that the level-playing field provisions, fisheries, and the issue of finding a dispute mechanism were the three main issues left to resolve – and emphasised that without an agreement on the first two, there would be no EU-UK trade deal.
Johnson’s statement continued:

“We will then have a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s. I want to be absolutely clear that, as we have said right from the start, that would be a good outcome for the UK. As a government we are preparing, at our borders and at our ports, to be ready for it.
The EU has said repeatedly that a trade deal similar to Canada or Australia isn’t possible due to the UK’s proximity to the EU, and due to the complexities of what arrangement to put in place for the North.
“There is still an agreement to be had,” Johnson’s statement concludes.
“We will continue to work hard in September to achieve it. It is one based on our reasonable proposal for a standard free trade agreement like the one the EU has agreed with Canada and so many others.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said if the UK introduces a piece of legislation which will undermine the commitments they’ve made in the withdrawal agreements to the EU “it would have very negative impact on the negotiations that are currently underway”.
He said the agreement is an international legal obligation, and if there is any suggestion the “are not going to implement the legal obligations… that would in my view fundamentally undermine trust between the two parties”.
”I think would be a very serious breach of trust,” said Coveney.
“I hope that it is a false story, and that it’s not actually going to be as serious and as negative as some people are suggesting,” he said.

Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, confirmed this morning that he had signed the Withdrawal Agreement.
The document, agreed between the UK and the EU after years of back-and-forth negotiations, was also signed by the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.
Queen Elizabeth II gave royal assent to the legislation for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, paving the way for the UK to leave the European Union with an agreement at the end of January – almost four years after 2016’s Leave vote.

Johnson said the country would “move forwards as one United Kingdom”, adding that “at times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it.”
“Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future – with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country.”
The UK is set to enter a transition period in February, during which the relationship with Brussels will remain the same while trade talks are finalised before the tight 31 December deadline.

Trade experts have warned that negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with the EU could prove difficult, especially in such a short time frame. Critics of Brexit have also said that the UK could still end up facing a no-deal scenario if an agreement isn’t reached before the deadline.
With the general election campaign ongoing in Ireland, it’s expected that the next taoiseach – whether Leo Varadkar or Micheál Martin – will play a key role in navigating trade talks with the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-cummings-legally-responsibly-integrity-5106465-May2020/,"LAST UPDATE|24 May 2020
UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has backed his senior aide Dominic Cummings, amid claims that he broke lockdown restrictions several times.
It has since emerged that a member of the British public reported Cummings to the Durham Police for breaking the restrictions,according to the UK Mirror.
Cummings drove 260 miles from London to Durham at the end of March with his wife and child after his spouse developed coronavirus symptoms.
A lockdown was in place by then, and there have been calls from a number of politicians, including First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, for Cummings to resign.
In a press conference this evening ahead of announcing an update of the UK’s coronavirus figures, Johnson said that Cummings acted “legally, responsibly and with integrity”, and that his movements were ”sensible and defensible”.
“I looked at [the allegations] carefully and am content… that he took measures to stop the spread of the virus at all times,” Johnson said repeatedly.
During the Downing Street press conference, Johnson said that some of the allegations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour during self-isolation were “palpably false”.
The British Prime Minister went on to say that it was a situation that “any father, any parent” would understand.
“As far as I can see, he stuck to the rules to stop the spread of the virus,” Johnson said, despite it being pointed out that it’s possible he contracted the virus during the car trip.
When asked if Cummings’ approved actions meant that the public health advice had changed, Johnson said it hadn’t. He said that if both Cummings and his wife had succumbed to the virus, they would have needed childcare needs that made the journey necessary.
In the aftermath of the press conference,two expertson the UK government’s Sage subgroup ‘SPI-B’, (or Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours) have said that Johnson had “trashed all the advice we have given”.
Conservative MPs have beenramping up pressureon Johnson to fire his top aide after new allegations emerged that Cummings broke lockdown rules more than once.
Johnsonand other senior British ministers have staunchly defended Cummings thus far. Today, Cummings attended a meeting at 10 Downing Street four hours before a press conference was held at 4pm.

According to reports in the Observer and Sunday Mirror, the former Vote Leave campaign co-ordinator made a second trip to Durham and was seen there on 19 April – five days after being photographed on his return to Westminster.
A second witness told the papers they saw him a week earlier in Barnard Castle on Easter Sunday, a popular tourist location 30 miles from Durham, during the period he was believed to be self-isolating.
Cummings, who is credited with being a driving force behind the UK’s EU referendum result in favour of Brexit, has come under severe criticism for hiscontempt for politicians and acid-tongued remarks.

“The Prime Minister’s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time.
“Millions were watching for answers and they got nothing. That’s why the Cabinet Secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry.”
Westminster leader for the SNP, Ian Blackford – who has been vocal in his criticism of Cummings today, said the Government’s response was a “failure of leadership”.
Labour MP Jess Phillips questioned the claims that Cummings “followed the instincts of every father”.
She tweeted: “The instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home. Bad fathering guys.”
David Warburton, the Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, said he was “unconvinced” by Boris Johnson’s defence of Dominic Cummings.
“As much as I despise any baying pitchfork-led trials by social media, I’m unconvinced by the PM’s defence of Cummings,” he tweeted.

A community room in the Glen Tower flats in Motherwell was due to be used as a polling station.The local authorityannounced at 6.30am that it was to be moved to Knowetop Primary School on Knowetop Avenue because of “an ongoing police incident”.
Local media are reporting that a man has been arrested this afternoon in connection with the incident.
Chief Inspector Mark Leonard said that officers responded to reports of a suspicious device on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats, Motherwell around 1am today.
“A cordon was placed around the building and residents within the cordon were evacuated for safety reasons. Police liaised with Explosive Ordnance Device staff to examine the item and a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution.
“It was to found to be a non-viable device,” he said. The evacuation has also ended.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-no-brexit-deal-if-uk-break-international-law-5267612-Nov2020/,"MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has warned there will be no EU-UK trade agreement if UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushes ahead with legislation that would allow Britain to break international law.
As Brexit negotiations come down to the wire, Coveney again expressed concern at the Internal Market Bill being championed by Johnson in the UK’s parliament.
Johnson has insisted that he will press on in the Commons with elements of the proposed legislation that would allow the Government to break international law despite opposition from the House of Lords in recent days.
The move comes as London and Brussels are set to continue talks this week ahead of the Brexit transition period coming to a close at the end of the year.
Coveney, who said things need to “move” this week, told Sky News: “Even if we do get a new trade deal negotiated by both sides, if the British Government is determined to continue with their Internal Market Bill – to reintroduce parts of that Bill that were removed by the House of Lords this week – then, I think this is a deal that won’t be ratified by the EU.
“Because there is no way the EU will agree to ratify a new agreement if the British Government is breaking the existing agreement that is not even 12 months old, and breaking international law by doing that.”
Coveney also called for a cooling of rhetoric in trade talks, especially in the contentious area of fishing rights.

“We really have to try and find a way of coming up with a compromise on fish that both sides can live with,” he said.
“And we need to try and dial down the language on this because it is very easy to become emotive.”
Coveney insisted a deal was “doable”.
He said: “I think I would sum it up by saying this is very difficult, but, it’s also very doable.
“And I think the consequences of not getting a trade deal and a future relationship deal… before the end of the year, I think is very significant.”
Environment Secretary George Eustice said next week is “a week when things need to move” for the UK and EU to agree to a trade deal.
Eustice said: “Both sides recognise that time is very, very short. It’s not long ago we were saying we needed to get some kind of conclusion by the middle of October.
“People have persevered with these talks. There does come a point frankly where businesses need to know what they are preparing for.”
He added: “You can always squeeze out extra time if you need to, if you’re nearly there.”
“But, I agree with Simon Coveney, perhaps we can agree on this much… this needs to be a week when things move, when we break through some of these difficult issues and get resolution and at least have some sort of headlines – if you like – of an agreement,” he said.
“Otherwise, it gets quite difficult and we do start to run out of time to implement it.”

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT Ursula von der Leyen has said that British and European negotiators have made progress towards agreeing fair trade rules after the Brexit transition period but remain far apart on access to fishing.
She told the European Parliament this morning that “the next days are going to be decisive” with intense talks on a post-Brexit trade deal set to continue in Brussels.
“The good news is that we have found a way forward on most issues,” she said, adding that she and EU negotiator Michel Barnier can now see a “narrow path to an agreement”.

“But this is now a case of us being so close, and yet being so far away from each other, because two issues still remain outstanding, you know them: a level playing field and the fisheries.”
Von der Leyen said that Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost had made progress towards resolving rules for state aid to businesses and that the ways the deal will be governed “by now are largely being resolved”.
But she was pessimistic on the issue of fish. Britain is insisting that when it leaves the EU single market at the end of the year it will resume full control over access to its waters.
EU member states are holding out to preserve quotas for their crews fishing in UK waters and they want a long-term arrangement to provide stability.
Britain has so far only offered reduced access and annual quota renegotiations.

“On fisheries, the discussion is still very difficult,” von der Leyen said.
“We do not question the UK sovereignty on its own waters, but we asked for predictability and stability for our fishermen and our fisherwomen.
“And in all honesty, I sometimes feel that we will not be able to resolve this question.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mps-pass-bill-to-end-free-movement-of-people-5102363-May2020/,"MPS HAVE PASSED a bill to repeal EU freedom of movement rules in the UK.
The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill cleared its first hurdle after receiving a second reading by 351 votes to 252 – a majority of 99.
The legislation is part of the move towards the British government’s new points-based immigration system, to be introduced from 2021, although it does not set out the details on this.
These will be fleshed out in the immigration rules, which will explain the future system for EU and non-EU nationals who move to the UK after the Brexit transition period ends on December 2020.
Opening the second reading debate, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Bill will create a “firmer, fairer and simpler system” that will “play a vital role” in the country’s recovery from coronavirus.
NHS staff, she said, were the “very best of Britain”, adding: “That is why we are introducing a new fast-track NHS visa to prioritise the qualified staff needed to provide high quality and compassionate professional care.

Labour criticised the new immigration policy by saying that ministers who clap for key workers are “only too happy” to back immigration reforms which suggest thousands are “unwelcome in our country”.
Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said that the Tory government was proposing a new immigration system in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic which “sends a signal” that anyone earning below £25,600 is “unskilled”.
He dismissed this prospect as he launched a defence of shop workers, refuse collectors and local government staff from overseas for playing their part in the coronavirus response.

Priti Patel also said of the Bill: “It delivers on the promise we made to the British people. It ends free movement. It takes back control of our borders.
“It gives the government the powers needed to deliver an immigration system that is firm, fair and fit for the future, the points-based system the public voted for, a system that will support our economic recovery by prioritising jobs for people here in the UK while continuing to attract the brightest and the best in terms of global talent.”

But Thomas-Symonds said: “In the midst of this crisis the Government is putting forward an immigration system containing a salary threshold of £25,600 – it sends a signal and tells people that anyone earning less than that is unskilled and unwelcome in our country.”
Thomas-Symonds said the earnings of frontline workers do not reflect their contribution to society, adding: “Those who clapped (for carers) on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a Bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people – that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers.
SNP immigration spokesman Stuart McDonald criticised the “dreadful” Bill, saying:
Yvette Cooper, Labour chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, said she believes the Bill is “flawed”, but that immigration legislation is needed and she will put forward amendments which she hopes will receive cross-party support.
She went on: “In that cross-party spirit I will not vote against the Bill tonight, although if the government’s approach does not change, I would expect to oppose it when it returns to the House.”

Labour’s Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said the Bill is “bad in principle, bad in practice” and described it as a “slap in the face for the thousands of migrants, including EU migrants, working so hard for the NHS and care sector in this time of Covid crisis”.
In February, the government announced proposals for the new system, with points awarded for specific requirements such as being able to speak English to a certain level, having a job offer from an approved employer and meeting a salary threshold of £25,600.
Other points could be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation. A visa allowing doctors, nurses and health professionals from overseas to work in the NHS was introduced in March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-stormont-paramilitary-ira-4878174-Nov2019/,"PARAMILITARY ACTIVITY REMAINS a “stark reality” in Northern Ireland and has been fuelled by the lack of a government, a study by a cross-border taskforce has warned.
A report, published by the paramilitary watchdog the Independent Reporting Commission, warns that paramilitarism has not yet ended in the region – despite the joint commitment by the Irish, UK and Northern Irish governments in November 2015.
“The political vacuum…. makes the task of bringing paramilitarism to an end immeasurably more difficult,” the report warns.
“This uncertainty is serving to add fuel to the fire of continued paramilitarism,” the commission warns.
In January 2017, the Assembly collapsed following the resignation of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness as a protest against the DUP’s involvement in the RHI scandal.
Despite repeated attempts at talks, Stormont and power-sharing in Northern Ireland has still not been restored.

One of the most notorious incidents of paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland was the murder in April of 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed in Derry by the New IRA.
The commission suggests that the time is right for Northern Ireland to consider a “dedicated transition process” for members of paramilitary organisations.
While acknowledging that such a suggestion is controversial, the commission suggests that it can’t be ruled out as an option.
Most members, the commission reports, are what it calls ‘dormant’ – not involved in criminal activity on a day-to-day basis.
The report finds that while the frequency of paramilitary attacks has generally been decreasing since 2009/10, the number of paramilitary-style attacks increased between October 2018 and September 2019.
The commission found that there were 12 paramilitary-style attacks in June and nine in August, calling the continuing threat of paramilitary violence from dissident republicans and loyalists an “issue of profound concern”.

The commission, which was formed to report on the steps Northern Ireland is making to end paramilitary activity, warns that Brexit has “exposed and highlighted” the threat of dissident and paramilitary violence.

“The real issue about the dangers for peace in Northern Ireland, therefore, is not that Brexit itself could be the direct cause of a renewal of violence, but rather that it has the potential to add fuel to the fire of continued paramilitarism,” the report found.
The commission, which published its first report inOctober 2018, makes a number of recommendations.
It recommends that “serious consideration” should be given to the creation of an agency that will focus on the civil recovery of the proceeds of crime, as well as increasing the funding for neighbourhood policing teams.
However, it also warns that a cross-government approach should be taken to tackling the root causes of paramilitarism that includes a broader look at the progress the peace process has made since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
“Too often, the issue of paramilitarism is reduced to a series of throw-away comments or regarded purely as a matter of criminality entirely for the police to deal with. It is, however, much deeper and more complex than that,” the report states.
“It is very clear that paramilitarism is not the only issue of unfinished business of the peace process.”

IRISH MEP MAIREAD McGuinness and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage went head to head in the European Parliament this afternoon as MEPs debated the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
MEPs sitting in Brusselsvoted by 621 to 49in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, paving the way for Britain to leave on Friday with a deal in place.
Prior to the vote, while debating the withdrawal deal, Nigel Farage declared that the UK “is never coming back”.
The Brexit Party leader and his allies cheered and waved Union flags as he finished his address.

“If we want trade, friendship, cooperation, reciprocity, we don’t need a European Commission, we don’t need a European court, we don’t need these institutions and all of this power.”
Farage was cut off as he told EU Parliament that “we look forward to working in the future to working with you as sovereign”.
McGuiness, who is First Vice-President of the European Parliament, turned off Farage’s mic mid-sentence for disobeying parliament rules.
“If you disobey the rules, you get cut off,” McGuinness told Farage.
“Please sit down, resume your seats, put your flags away. You’re leaving, and take them with you if you are leaving now,” McGuinness said as the cheering Brexit Party MEPs walked out.
In contrast, there were emotional scenes in the parliament as the result was announced with MEPs linking hands to sing a final chorus of Auld Lang Syne.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-canada-trade-brexit-5274550-Nov2020/,"THE UK AND Canada have reached a deal to continue trading under the same terms as the current European Union agreement after the Brexit transition period ends.
The UK has said the agreement paves the way for negotiations to begin next year on a new comprehensive deal with Canada, which has been touted as one of the benefits of leaving the EU.
Boris Johnson and Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau sealed the “agreement in principle” in a video call today, the Department for International Trade (DIT) said.
The agreement does not give any new benefits to businesses but rolls over the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement reached by the EU and Canada after seven years of negotiations.
Welcoming the continuity deal, Trudeau suggested a new comprehensive trade agreement with the UK would take several years to negotiate.
‘Maximise trade opportunities’
Industry groups expressed relief that businesses will not face higher trade tariffs with Canada next month but warned that similar deals were urgently needed.

Johnson said the extension was “a fantastic agreement for Britain”, adding: “Our negotiators have been working flat out to secure trade deals for the UK and from as early next year we have agreed to start work on a new, bespoke trade deal with Canada that will go even further in meeting the needs of our economy.”
Speaking during the video call, which also included International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and her counterpart Mary NG, Trudeau said the deal meant that “now we get to continue to work on a bespoke agreement, a comprehensive agreement over the coming years that will really maximise our trade opportunities and boost things for everyone”.
British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said the deal “will be warmly welcomed” but warned that similar continuity deals were urgently needed with other key markets, including Turkey and Singapore, to avoid “a damaging cliff edge for both importers and exporters”.
And he repeated his call for a deal to be struck with the EU , describing that as the “single most critical trade agreement our business communities need”.
Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “There was always a danger that the end of the transition period would mean losing wider international market access that we enjoyed as part of EU membership.
“The fact that this new agreement upholds the small business chapter that was previously in place is very welcome. We look forward to such chapters being at the centre of all future UK trade deals.”
Confederation of British Industry director-general Josh Hardie said it was “great news for businesses” and that the agreement can “lay the foundations for an even deeper trade agreement”.
Before it is formally signed, the UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement will be subject to final legal checks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-port-brexit-5313981-Jan2021/,"THE FIRST FERRY has arrived at Dublin Port under new trade rules following the end of the Brexit transition period.
Irish Ferries’ ship Ulysses docked at 5.55am with about a dozen trucks on board, having travelled from Holyhead in Wales.
There were no delays as the freight trailers cleared customs checks for the first time under the new rules.
After 47 years as an EU member state, the UK left the bloc at 11pm on New Year’s Eve, becoming a third country for trade purposes and customs declarations.
New documentation and red tape is now required between EU member states and Britain, which is anticipated to cause massive delays at ports in the coming weeks.
A small number of ships arrived after 11pm on Thursday night, but they were covered by the previous arrangements.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne programme, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said that he did not believe the additional red tape would mean shortages on supermarket shelves.
Despite the minister’s confidence, Irish hauliers have warned of “mayhem” at ports in the coming weeks.
Eugene Drennan, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA), said on New Year’s Eve that hauliers are bracing themselves for “trouble and chaos”.
“The systems have not been tested, they have not been tried,” he said.
Drennan predicted issues at ports across the island for the foreseeable future.
“It will be a big issue,” he said. “Four boats arriving in at the same time in the morning. All this regulation. There’s no space for a driver to pull up at Dublin Port. There’s no facilities and all the money that has been spent. It’s outrageous.”
He questioned why all the paperwork is necessary when a deal has been reached.
“That’s the burning question: why do we need all this regulation if there are no tariffs?” he asked.
“There was bureaucracy up to this because they were leaving the EU.
Advertisement
“Now that they’re leaving with a deal and agreement, why is all that needed? Why are we putting the cost on business? Why are we going through all these hoops?”
He said many businesses had stockpiled goods in advance of Brexit because “they feared tariffs, they feared cost and they feared supply”.
Aidan Flynn, general manager of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland (FTAI), said there will be a period of “unprecedented change” for the movement of goods and delays are “inevitable”.
“There’s no tariffs but there are obligations for red tape, administrative burdens such as import/export declarations and additional checks for products of animal origin,” he said.
“Whilst industry has done its best to prepare for it, there’s nothing like dealing with it in real time and there has not been much time to prepare.”
Flynn added that New Year is traditionally a quiet time for freight but he predicted that once goods start moving next week there will be delays.
“The reality is that having to input information into systems that haven’t been robustly tested is going to deliver inevitable problems for industry,” he said.
“What we are really hoping for is that a pragmatic approach is taken by key stakeholders like Revenue and the Department of Agriculture.
He warned there would be a knock-on effect on supply caused by delays.
“If we’re in the realm of 40% to 70% of non-compliance, that means those vehicles aren’t able to board ships and there’s only limited space for these guys to go.”
He said it would make “practical sense” for ports like Dublin to stagger ferry arrivals to “reduce stress and strain”, but to date that has not happened.
“We would definitely support a review by shipping operators in terms of staggering ferry times,” he said.
“The busiest time of the day in Dublin is between 5am and 7am and between 5pm and 7pm. That just intensifies the situation.
In response to the suggestion of more staggered arrival times, Minister Eamon Ryan said the timings are down to the needs of exporters.
“What the ferry companies say in response to that is that they’re meeting the demand of the actual exporters, that it’s actually exporters that are looking for these particular times. A lot of the just-in-time delivery systems we have now from the UK are actually coming in early in the morning to be able to put things on our shelves that morning, so that you’re in before the traffic, so you’re in time.”

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has said “we are in the endgame” of Brexit talks as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson proceeds with his controversial Brexit bill.
Despite US president-elect Joe Biden having previously warned the UK over the draft legislation, Johnson told broadcasters that he intended to push ahead with the Internal Market Bill, with peers due to vote on it this week.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Coveney described Biden as a “real friend to Ireland” who has made clear his position on the Good Friday Agreement in any Brexit negotiations.
Coveney also said that Biden’s election could give the UK government “pause for thought” as Brexit talks near an end.
“The US is a close ally of the UK, we know that, but I think the relationship between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson was a close one,” said Coveney.
“There was a lot of talk about a US-UK trade deal happening quickly. I think that the statements that have come, not only from Joe Biden, but from many on Capitol Hill that if the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland isn’t protected through Brexit that securing a trade deal between the US and the UK would be very, very problematic,” said Coveney.

Biden, who has Irish heritage, in September warned that the Good Friday Agreement cannot be “a casualty of Brexit” and said a UK-US trade deal would be dependent on the peace terms being upheld.
Johnson, asked yesterday, whether he was determined to pass the bill in the face of Biden’s criticisms, said: “Yes, as I told Ursula (von der Leyen, European Commission president) the parliamentary timetable goes ahead.
“The whole point of that bill, and indeed the Finance Bill, is to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland.
“And again, that’s one of the things that we’re united on with our friends in the White House.”
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain had listened “very carefully to our American friends”, including those in the powerful Irish lobby in Washington, about their concerns regarding Brexit’s impact on Northern Ireland.
But Raab told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show he remained “confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively, correctly”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer, however, has called on Downing Street to scrap the Brexit bill if it wants to build a world-leading alliance with the Biden administration, which is due to be inaugurated in January.
“We will soon have a president in the Oval Office who has been a passionate advocate for the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement,” he wrote in an article for The Guardian.
“He, like governments across the world, will take a dim view if our Prime Minister ploughs ahead with proposals to undermine that agreement.
“If the Government is serious about a reset in its relationship with the United States, then it should take an early first step and drop these proposals.”

Thousands of students from all over Europe, including hundreds from the Republic of Ireland, also go to the UK as part of the programme each year.

The amendment was rejected by 344 votes to 254, leading to concerns that the UK could exit the programme, impacting students across the UK as well as those who wish to travel to the UK.
Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher described the “empathic” defeat of the vote as “heartbreaking”, saying he was particularly concerned about students in Northern Ireland being “shut out” of future Erasmus opportunities.
“You have to say that the vote not only undermines the importance of the programme, it undermines citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland, many of whom consider themselves Irish and European and want to be part of Europe.
“It’s just heartbreaking. We don’t want society to be individualistic, we want people to be outward looking, to challenge themselves, to see how other countries’ education systems work.
“[The vote] diminishes not just the opportunities of those in college, but the wider society and the whole educational ecosystem,” Kelleher toldTheJournal.ie.
After criticism of the vote, the British Department of Education said the government remained “committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so”.
Chris Skidmore, Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, said the vote amounted to “game playing by opposition parties” and “does not end or prevent the UK participating in Erasmus+”.

Kelleher said he would take the British government “at their word” but had serious concerns about the future of the programme.
The Fianna Fáil MEP said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party are “so focused on ‘getting Brexit done’ that they may not realise the long-term consequences of some of their actions”.
“They are so ideologically driven by the pursuit of the holy grail of Brexit, they don’t seem to be looking at the bigger picture.”
Kelleher said he and other Irish MEPs “have a duty” to raise issues such as this which could result in citizens in Northern Ireland being “denied their rights”.
Students plan to lobby government
Robert Murtagh, president of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), said the union will continue to lobby the UK government in relation to the programme.
“We regret the British government’s decision not to support this clause, but it does not mean the Erasmus+ is over for students [in Northern Ireland]. We will continue lobbying the UK government to urge them to commit to maintaining UK involvement in all parts of the Erasmus+ programme.
“Earlier this year the Irish government stated that they were keen to ensure that students in Northern Ireland would be able to continue to engage with the Erasmus+ programme.
“We are eager to work with them closely in the following months, so that future students continue to have the opportunities that so many have already enjoyed,” Murtagh said.
He added that students in Northern Ireland have many concerns on “a plethora of different issues” over Brexit and the NUS-USI “will be lobbying and campaigning for a Brexit that protects the Good Friday Agreement, citizenship rights, ensures cross-border mobility and continued access to EU programmes such as Erasmus+”.
‘Regrettable’
The Erasmus+ programme has strong links to Ireland and was founded by a former Irish Attorney General,the late Peter Sutherland, when he was an EU Commissioner in the 1980s.

In the Republic of Ireland, Erasmus+ is run by the Higher Education Authority and Léargas, a non-profit organisation owned by the Department of Education and Skills.
Gerry O’Sullivan, head of the Erasmus+ National Agency at the HEA, described the vote in the House of Commons as “a regrettable move”.
He noted that negotiations on the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU are at a “very early” stage, but the vote highlights an issue that “goes to the heart of a lot of the British concern” in relation to membership of the EU.
“Freedom of movement is a key principle of higher education, it is a key principle of Erasmus+. Freedom of movement (between the UK and EU) is one of the issues that will have to be resolved during the negotiations, how they square that circle will be a challenge,” O’Sullivan toldTheJournal.ie.
He noted that about 800 students from Northern Ireland engage with the Erasmus+ programme every year, some of whom study or do work experience in the Republic of Ireland.
Thousands of students from the Republic also take part in the programme each year, more than 400 of whom go to the UK – primarily to London to undertake placements is sectors such as finance, hospitality and construction.
O’Sullivan said this experience is invaluable to students, helping them make contacts and get jobs after college.
A spokesperson for Léargas reiterated the importance of Erasmus+ , saying the programme “funds people from all walks of life to connect with their peers in Europe, from young people organising international youth exchanges to school teachers job-shadowing with their European colleagues”.
The spokesperson said Léargas supports more than 10,000 people from Ireland to take part in Erasmus+ projects each year, many of which involve exchange and partnership with the UK.
“We believe that programmes like Erasmus+ that strengthen understanding and cooperation between people in Europe are a benefit to all our communities.
“We welcome the statement from the UK Department of Education that the UK remains committed to maintaining exchanges with the EU, including potentially through the 2021-2027 Erasmus+ programme.”
“We would like to reiterate the European Commission’s advice that the UK can continue to take part in the current Erasmus+ programme until its close, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified before its departure from the EU,” they said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/frances-fitzgerald-european-arrest-warrant-5036596-Mar2020/,"FORMER JUSTICE MINISTER and current Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald has said that she’s “very concerned” by the UK’s decision to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant arrangement.
European Arrest Warrants (EAWs), which were enacted in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, are used to arrest suspects in different participating EU countries.
It has been described as faster and more effective than the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, and ends “political involvement” compared to those extradition orders.
But last week, as part of its guidelines on trade negotiations with the EU, the British government said that itwants to leavethe European Arrest Warrant scheme.
Instead, it wanted to agree a separate fast-track extradition arrangement with Brussels.

How this affects Ireland
It was feared that Ireland would have to rely on the older, slower extradition system if there was a no-deal Brexit, which was of particular concern asaround 75% of all of Ireland’s EAW requestsare sent to the UK.
Because of Northern Ireland, there would be a particular concern that without close cooperation post-Brexit, that criminals in the Republic could flee across the border to escape arrest by Irish authorities.
The Irish Council of Civil Libertiessaid previouslythat a return to the old extradition system is also complicated by the history of extradition between the UK and Ireland.
“Extradition between Ireland and United Kingdom was a very complex, bilateral system and it wasn’t straightforward,” it said, adding that even before Brexit, the UK was pulling back from the European Arrest Warrant system.
Some European countries, including Germany, have laws which forbid the extradition of their nationals to non-EU countries.
The former Justice Minister’s concerns
In response to a question fromTheJournal.ie, Fitzgerald said that the European Arrest Warrant “is a key instrument, in terms of making sure that justice is seen to be done and that there’s cooperation”.
“So it would be very important to have very quick agreement in relation to that as we go forward and to make sure that there are protocols regulations and so on in place to deal with it and that there isn’t any gap.”
Related ReadsPhil Hogan insists no-deal Brexit threat won't 'cut the ice' in trade talksUK to withdraw from European arrest warrant schemeWhat will happen to prisoners held under European Arrest Warrants in a no-deal Brexit?
When asked whether it could affect prisoners incarcerated here under an EAW, Fitzgerald said that “depending on what the arrangements were in a particular moment in time of course it could”.
She said that “if there was a gap” or if alternative arrangements weren’t made, it could “of course” have an affect. “The smooth transitioning between all EU countries is very important.”
“And of course, there will be a lot of contact between the UK and ourselves in relation to prison transfers, European Arrest Warrant, and so on.”
The European Arrest Warrantannual report for 2017showed that 207 EAW requests were received from the UK, with 60 sent by the Irish State.A total of 478 surrendershave been made to Ireland since the EAW legislation came into force in 2004.
The UK wants law enforcement covered by separate arrangements from the main trade deal, but the EU wants a single partnership agreement covering all aspects of the future relationship, with a single “overall governance framework” to monitor it.

Dutch TV network NPO filmed customs patrols explaining to arrivals that they cannot take meat or dairy products into the EU.
One driver who arrived by ferry at the Hook of Holland sea port was left bemused after being told he would lose his ham sandwiches.

The man asked whether he can “take off the meat and you leave me the bread?”
But a border guard responded: “No, everything will be confiscated. Welcome to the Brexit, sir. I’m sorry.”
New arrangements for UK travellers in the EU came into force when the Brexit transition period ended on December 31.
So far, there hasn’t beena huge issue with Brexit-related delays and traffic build-up at Irish ports.
Last week, Dublin Port confirmed that only an “extremely small” number of Irish trucks travelling to the UK had been rejected for having incorrect documentation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-gove-says-eu-not-serious-about-securing-brexit-deal-5236823-Oct2020/,"CABINET OFFICE MINISTER Michael Gove has insisted that the door is “ajar” for post-Brexit trade talks to continue with the EU after Downing Street declared negotiations as “over”.
Gove accused EU officials of not being serious about making compromises and said they would have to back down if chief negotiator Michel Barnier is to resume negotiations in London this week.
His warning today came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused European leaders of having “abandoned the idea of a free trade deal” and told the country to “get ready” for leaving without a trade deal.
And Downing Street negotiator Lord Frost told his EU counterpart not to travel for planned talks.
But Gove left room for talks to get a trade deal in order to prevent the high trade tariffs the UK faces from December 31 when the transition period ends.
Asked if the door is still open to talks, he said: “It is ajar; we hope the EU will change their position, we’re certainly not saying that if they do change their position we can’t talk to them.”
But, he added on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, that “we are ready if required” to leave without a trade deal, which he admitted would not “be a picnic”.

He earlier told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the chances of getting a deal are “less” than the 66% he had previously predicted.
“It’s less. I can’t be precise, but one of the reasons why it’s less is the position that’s been taken in the last couple of weeks by European Union leaders,” he added.
He said the EU has refused to work on a detailed legal draft text during negotiations and of not being “willing to intensify the talks”, while making unacceptable demands on fishing waters.
“And so that seems to me to be the behaviour of an organisation and an institution that is not serious about making the compromises necessary to secure a deal,” Gove said.
Asked if talks could resume with Barnier, he replied: “The ball is in his court. We’ve made clear that we need to see a change in approach from the European Union.
“I know that he’ll be calling David Frost over the course of the next few days; let’s see if the European Union appreciate the importance of reaching a deal and the importance of making ground.”
On Friday, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said there was “no point” in Barnier travelling to London unless the 27 EU member states were willing to alter their position or wanted to discuss sector by sector arrangements to prepare for no deal.
“The trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position,” the spokesman said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-park-5235021-Oct2020/,"THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE are calling for a huge new Brexit “lorry park” in Kent to be named after Nigel Farage.
A tongue-in-cheek petition wants the Brexit Party leader to be recognised for his contribution to the UK leaving the EU.
Up to 1,700 lorries will be able to park at the new facility, which is under construction next to the M20 in Ashford.
But while the British government refers to it as an “inland border facility”, the online campaign prefers to describe it as a “diesel-soaked Valhalla”.
As the UK approaches the end of the Brexit transition period, a number of measures are being put in place to try to avoid friction after 31 December.
Hauliers will need special permits to gain access to Kent in order to help avoid queues of 7,000 trucks heading for the border.
Meanwhile, portable toilets could be installed alongside roads in the Garden of England in case lorry drivers get stuck in congestion.

The petition, launched on Thursday, calls on Kent County Council to name the controversial new facility “Nigel’s Folly”, after the longtime Brexit campaigner.
It says: “It is fitting that every lorry driver, every commuter and every local resident has a chance to link this fine example of civil engineering to its true hero.
“It may be that Mr Farage will be unable or unwilling to attend the unveiling of this great honour that we do him, but that shouldn’t get in the way of seeing his name and huge gurn plastered all over the boundary fence at regular intervals, topped by a coil of razor wire no doubt festooned with the shreds of black farmers’ plastic known as witches’ knickers.
“For the foreseeable future everyone should genuinely be able to refer to this diesel-soaked Valhalla as Nigel’s Folly.”
Set up on Thursday afternoon, the petition has so far garnered more than 2,000 signatures.
As signatures mounted on Friday morning, others left comments endorsing the plan, with some suggesting the “Farage Garage” as an alternative name.
Kent County Council was trending along with Nigel Farage on Twitter on Friday morning.

https://www.thejournal.ie/five-more-irish-ports-fishing-vessels-5328359-Jan2021/,"UK REGISTERED NORTHERN Ireland fishing vessels will be allowed to land in five additional Irish ports from next month.
The five new ports designated are Ros a Mhíl, Greencastle, Howth, Rathmullen and Burtonport. They join Killybegs and Castletownbere which continue to be designated for landings from vessels of any third country origin.
Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has confirmed he is working to make sure the necessary notifications and requirements are in place to have these ports operations from Monday, 1 February.

Under the new designations Ros a Mhíl and Howth will be able to accommodate landings of demersal fish from vessels under 24 metres and will operate Monday to Friday from 10am to 10pm.
Greencastle, Rathmullen and Burtonport will be designated for non-quota species landings from vessels under 18 metres and will operate from 2pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday.
Since 1 January, the UK has been considered a third country and as a result it is subject to Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) legislation and North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) requirements.
This means that any UK, including Northern Ireland, registered vessels must comply with third country landing requirements when landing in the EU, including Irish port.
This is a direct result of Brexit and is included in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.
Related ReadsHow has trade between Ireland and Great Britain been affected in the first two weeks of Brexit?
Up until a conclusion of an agreement on the future relationship between the UK and the EU on Christmas Eve, it remained unclear whether Northern Ireland vessels that had access to Irish waters would continue to do so.
“This is an important decision which will allow fishers in small vessels to continue their livelihoods in a safe manner,” McConalogue said.
“Following Brexit, it is important, now more than ever, to support our fishers and fishing communities and to do all we can do to help them continue their livelihoods,” he said.
“I thank the SFPA for its work to putting in place the arrangements necessary to provide for these additional port designations and I am glad that the outcome will mean that many of those fishers who were unable to operate following the outcome of Brexit will now have the capacity to access a number of extra ports.”

LABOUR LEADER JEREMY Corbyn has offered students a vision for “hope” as he unveiled a youth manifesto pledging £1 billion investment and votes at 16.
The Labour leader received huge applause when he told supporters at Loughborough University on Saturday of plans to end pay “discrimination” and give a £10 minimum wage to all.
In an attempt to energise his campaign, he encouraged the crowd to hit the streets campaigning ahead of the December 12 election in order to bring a “red Christmas”.
Addressing a packed student union club lined with red neon lights, he said: “This election is all about the future and hope for young people in our society.
“A Labour government that will deliver for all people in the future is a prize within our grasp, but it’s not going to be handed to us on a plate.
“You’ve seen the attacks we are getting in some of the billionaire-owned media at the moment.
“But I tell you what, don’t do personal, don’t reply, just relentlessly go out there with the policies we’ve got, the determination we’ve got to put them into operation, and then, in the cold misery of a wet November and December, we will get a red Christmas and a great spring with a Labour government.”

Earlier, Corbyn defended his decision to remain “neutral” in a second EU referendum, saying it is a sign of “strength and maturity”.
The Labour leader came under fire after disclosing he would not take sides in the proposed public vote on a new Brexit deal which the party intends to negotiate with Brussels if it leads the next government.
On an election campaign stop in Sheffield, Corbyn insisted he is offering a “sensible way forward” which can finally bring the country together.
“I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity,” he said.
“My role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that is carried out in a fair way, that the offers put are fair, and that I will carry out the result of that referendum.
‘Absence of leadership’
But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Labour leader’s stance “won’t wash” with the electorate.
“He has actively decided to be indecisive on the biggest issue of the day. It won’t wash with voters,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Saturday programme.
“I think it is an absolute disaster. You can’t ask this country to be its prime minister while not having a view on the biggest issue of the day.”

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson branded Corbyn a “bystander”, accusing him of  “an absence of leadership” on what she said was the biggest issue facing the UK in generations.
“I think it is quite astonishing that Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to say… not even just refusing to say now where he stands on remaining or leaving the European Union, but is basically saying that he is never going to tell people what he thinks about that,” she said during a campaign visit to the Design Museum in west London this morning.

But Corbyn was not the only leader to endure a rough ride from the audience for the Question Time special in Sheffield.
Boris Johnson was challenged over his trustworthiness and “racist rhetoric” while Swinson came under pressure for her pledge to stop Brexit if the Lib Dems win the election.
However, Swinson insisted she was not disappointed with how the TV event went.
She said: “I’m very proud of standing up for what I believe in. I think it’s important to have that authenticity in politics. And I have had a lot of good feedback and I look forward to future opportunities to discuss issues with the public.”
Asked if she thought she had faced a tougher time than the other leaders, Ms Swinson said: “People can make up their own minds about that.”

THE TAOISEACH HAD his first face-to-face meeting with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today in Co Down.
Micheál Martin met Johnson at Hillsborough Castle just after noon today, following the Prime Minister’s meeting with Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill.
The government said today’s meeting would be an opportunity for discussion of a number of issues of mutual concern such as the management of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit negotiations.
Following the meeting, the UK government said the two leaders discussed the “importance of working together as neighbours to defeat coronavirus, including through close collaboration between Ireland, the UK Government and the Northern Irish Executive”.

“They agreed on the need for the international community to work together on developing rapid tests, therapeutics and vaccines.
“The Prime Minister and Taoiseach also agreed on the importance of a sustainable, green recovery from the economic impact of coronavirus. The Prime Minister stressed the opportunity that lies ahead for international governments, including the UK and Ireland, to promote free trade and invest in environmentally friendly technology.”
Johnson also updated the Taoiseach on his assessment of the UK/EU negotiations.
“He stressed that the UK would continue to take pride in high environmental, animal welfare and labour standards outside the European Union. He underlined however that the UK was not willing to make level playing field commitments that went beyond those normally found in a Free Trade Agreement, such as the EU’s agreement with Canada.
“The leaders looked forward to working together over the coming years to improve the connectivity between our countries, strengthen our relationship outside of the EU and promote the UK and Ireland’s shared values alongside likeminded democracies.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-replacement-5187561-Aug2020/,"LAST UPDATE|27 Aug 2020
URSULA VON DER Leyen has invited the Irish government to propose “suitable candidates” for the EU commissioner vacancy vacated by Phil Hogan.
In a brief statement this morning, the European Commission President thanked Hogan for his contribution to the EU, but acknowledged the anger his actions had caused.
“As Europe fights to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, and Europeans make sacrifices,” she said, “I expect the members of the college to be particularly vigilant about compliance with applicable national or regional rules and regulations”.
“It is now up to the Irish government to present suitable candidates for the commissioner of Irish nationality,” she said. The government will be asked to propose a woman and a man, von der Leyen said.
She said she would then decide on whether there would be a new allocation of portfolios.
Reaction
Since Hogan’s resignation last night, attention has turned to who may take his place. The European Commission may just slot in another Trade Commissioner, rather than do a full reshuffle, an Irish MEP has said.
Seán Kelly, a member of the European Parliament for Ireland South, said he hopes Ireland will retain the role after Phil Hogan’sresignation last night.
Kelly toldMorning Irelandhe believes Hogan’s decision to resign was the right course of action.
When asked if he thought an Irish person would replace Hogan, he said: “I would hope so.”

There are fears Ireland will lose the trade portfolio at a crucial time in Brexit negotiations.
The process to appoint a new commissioner could take weeks and Kelly said von der Leyen “may not want a reshuffle”, particularly as trade talks continue between the EU and the UK.
However, he added that von der Leyen may see this week’s events as an opportunity to reshuffle if she believes some commissioners are underperforming in their current roles.
While there is no guarantee Ireland will keep the trade portfolio, there is speculation over who will be nominated.
The names being mentioned include Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveney; Tánaiste Leo Varadkar; Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe; former Taoiseach Enda Kenny; David O’Sullivan, former EU Ambassador to the US; current MEP and former minister Frances Fitzgerald; Mairead McGuinness, a vice president of the European Parliament; and former minister Richard Bruton.
Coveney is tipped as the favourite to replace Hogan as Ireland’s EU Commissioner. While some have mentioned Varadkar’s name in the mix, due to him taking over the post of Taoiseach in 2022 it is unlikely he would give that up to go to Brussels.
Due to Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe taking on the presidency of the Eurogroup, he is unlikely to get the role.
Enda Kenny is highly regarded in Europe, and has been previouslytipped for some top jobs in the past.
A spokesperson for the Commission president told a press conference today that Hogan took the step himself to tender his resignation, and explained the reasons why in his statement last night.
She said the president has an objective of achieving gender balance in the commission college, which is why she invited the Irish government to put forward two names for the job.
The spokesperson confirmed that von der Leyen conveyed the message in person to Taoiseach this morning that it is important to start the process and put forward the names.

Hogan resigned from his role as EU Commissioner for Trade last night amid widespread criticism over his attendance at an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Co Galway, as well as his movements in Ireland in recent weeks – which were in breach of Covid-19 guidelines.
Hogan on Tuesday daypublished a lengthy statementandtimelineattempting to explain his movements in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the controversial event in Clifden on 19 August.
The leaders of the coalition – Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánasite Leo Varadkar and Minister Eamon Ryan – had called on Hogan but reflect on his position, but ultimately his fate was up to von der Leyen.
In a statement published just before 9pm yesterday, Hogan confirmed his resignation.
“It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead.
“I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland – the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life – caused such concern, unease and upset,” he said.

MICHEL BARNIER AND David Frost have held a video conference where a timetable for Brexit discussions was agreed.
Both men, the EU and British chief Brexit negotiators respectively, are back at work after testing positive for Covid-19 in March.
It had been planned that the UK and EU would engage in trade talks until 30 June, the date by which the UK will have to decide whether it is extending the period within which trade talks can take place.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had vehemently denied any suggestion that this timeframe would be extended; despite a global pandemic engulfing the first half of 2020, there is no sign that that approach is to change.

In a joint statement released this afternoon, the UK and EU has confirmed a timetable of dates in which talks will take place.
These talks will take place on the weeks commencing:20 April, 11 May and 1 June.

Today’s call was expected to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the process.
Draft legal texts were exchanged on 18 March, with the UK proposing a free trade agreement and other mini-deals on aviation safety, air transport and civil nuclear industries as its basis for negotiation.
In a statement releasedthis afternoon, the two sides said that they have taken stock of the technical work that has taken place, and described it as “useful to identify all major areas of divergence and convergence”.
Frost and Barnier also discussed the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.

“They agreed that the proper and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement was a key priority for both sides and noted that the Specialised Committees provided for by the Agreement, including on the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland and on citizens’ rights, would meet soon,” the statement said.
The UK government’s attention has in recent weeks turned to dealing with the pandemic rather than Brexit; more than 93,000 cases of Covid-19 and over 12,000 deaths have beenrecorded in the UK to date.
Johnson was released from hospital over the weekend after being treated for the virus in intensive care.

https://www.thejournal.ie/crucial-european-council-summit-5233373-Oct2020/,"A CRUCIAL BRUSSELS summit in Brexit trade talks begins today.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earmarked today as a deadline by which a post-Brexit trade deal must be reached.
The EU had prepared time during this summit for a discussion among the EU’s 27 leaders about a trade deal – but a draft deal hasn’t been created yet, with wide gaps remaining between the two sides on State aid and fisheries.
Johnson is currently deciding whether to pursue further negotiations to clinch a last-minute post-Brexit trade deal, after a phone call last night with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Von der Leyen and EU Council president Charles Michel represented Brussels and EU members on the call with Johnson, scheduled for 7.30pm Irish time.
“There are still differences, with fisheries being the starkest. We need to get substance settled and not having a common text to work from has made progress doubly difficult,” a UK spokesman said, referring to the drawn out effort to agree new trading rules.
In a statement issued after the phone call, Downing Street said:
“The Prime Minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council and would reflect before setting out the UK’s next steps in the light of his statement of 7 September.”

Rumours from inside the EUEuropean diplomats said Brussels was ready for a deal, but not at any price, and would be looking for a sign from Johnson that he was serious about compromise.
“We need to lower the landing gear, we’re approaching the runway. Is he thinking about landing or is he still at 10,000 metres?” one asked.
The 27 EU leaders – including Taoiseach Micheál Martin – will gather in Brussels for a meetingat 3pmtoday, with the log-jam in the post-Brexit trade talks as the first item on their summit programme.
Covid-19, climate change, and external relations are also to be discussed.
According to initial draft conclusions seen by AFP, the EU will express concern “that progress on key issues of interest to the Union is still not sufficient for an agreement to be reached” and invite EU negotiator Michel Barnier to “intensify negotiations”.
European diplomats said there had been some positive movement from Britain on rules of fair trade in recent days, but not enough to warrant locking the negotiators into a so-called “diplomatic tunnel” to force the talks over the finish line.
Some member states are pushing for the sides to an agree on a “toolbox” of retaliatory measures that Brussels could take in response if it feels that Britain has broken its word on maintain a level-playing field.
The British government and the EU have been locked in trade negotiations since 31 January, the date that Brexit officially happened. On 31 December, the UK officially leaves the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union.
If no deal is reached, trade rules will revert to the bare bones of World Trade Organisation regulations, meaning high tariffs on goods going between Ireland and the UK.

Some of the details in the deal
In her statement at the European Commission, von der Leyen thanked UK chief negotiator David Frost and his team for being “tough but fair” in negotiations.
Von der Leyen said that there would be a review four years from now to ensure that the level playing field provisions are being adhered to.
She said that if the UK does not follow the rules then there will be quotas and tariffs, “so there is a price to pay for that”.
“This agreement will write history,” von der Leyen said.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said “The clock is no longer ticking.”
Barnier said that one of his greatest regrets was that the UK decided not to participate in the Erasmus programme, but that it was a decision of the British negotiating team.
A Downing Street source said: “We have taken back control of our money, borders, laws, trade and our fishing waters.
“The deal is the biggest bilateral trade deal signed by either side, covering trade worth £668 billion in 2019.”
The deal takes the UK out of the “lunar pull of the EU”, no longer bound by Brussels’ rules or the judgments of the European Court of Justice.
“All of our key red lines about returning sovereignty have been achieved,” the source said.

The trade deal in context
On 31 January this year the UK officially left the European Union, resulting in its MEPs leaving the European Parliament and the UK no longer having an EU Commissioner.
Between that date and 31 December, known as the “transition period”, it remained part of the Single Market and Customs Union.
Trade talks have been ongoing since March in London and Brussels.
Over 97%of the issues had been agreed upon and drafted into a legal text weeks ago; the remaining obstacles that held up a final deal related to level-playing-field rules, a dispute resolution mechanism, and fisheries.
Trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, being researched and discussed by a separate committee, had been agreedon 8 December.
A political decision was needed in the final weeks of the year to secure a trade deal; ratification by the European Parliament and House of Commons is still needed before the new trading arrangements can come into effect.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-parliament-votes-to-approve-withdrawal-deal-bill-4959950-Jan2020/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons has approved legislation to allow Britain to leave the European Union on 31 January.
The deal covers areas including EU citizen’s rights, customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and a transition period.
The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill was given a third reading by 330 votes to 231, majority 99.
The comfortable victory for Prime Minister Boris Johnson followed the influx of new Tory MPs and is in marked contrast to the tortuous attempts to steer a Brexit bill through the Commons before the December general election.
The Bill, which paves the way for Brexit on 31 January, will now go to the Lords, where it could face a more difficult passage as Johnson does not have a majority in the upper chamber.

European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee described the vote on Twitter as a bitter sweet moment.
McEntee, along with Tánaiste Simon Coveney, was involved with negotiations which resulted in the latest version of a Withdrawal Agreement.

In apost on Twitter, she said: “This should feel like a monumental moment but knowing the difficult task that lies ahead, it’s another milestone on what has been a long and difficult journey. Many more miles still to go #Brexit.”
The bill will still have to go before the Lords for approval.
The UK Government faced continued criticism over the issue of allowing unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after exit day.
The previous government had accepted an amendment from Labour peer Lord Alf Dubs seeking continued protections for child refugees after Brexit but, following his election victory, Johnson re-drafted the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and withdrew his commitment.
A new Conservative MP used his maiden speech to defend the Government’s decision.
Tory David Simmonds said, while it is clear that issues around the resettlement of vulnerable children are “very much in the minds of many members”, it is “absolutely right” that these issues are for the Immigration Bill, rather than the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (Wab).
He added that young refugees in the EU are “already within countries that have child protection systems that are very similar, equivalent and in some cases better to our own”.
Earlier in the debate, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour can still “win the moral argument” after its bid to enshrine protections for child refugees in the Government’s Brexit agreement failed.
He urged the Government to “reconsider” its opposition to his party’s plans, adding that Labour “may not win many votes in this Parliament, but we can win the moral argument”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-stockpiling-irish-sea-5263216-Nov2020/,"IRISH SEA SHIPPING services are experiencing a surge in demand as businesses stockpile amid continuing uncertainty around post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Stena Line, which transports 65% of the freight moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, has chartered an extra ship to meet the capacity requirements.
Despite a year that has seen overall demand for freight services hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, dipping by as much as 30% in April, the volume of stock Stena Line moved across the Irish Sea last week was up 6% on the same week in 2019.
Paul Grant, Stena Line’s Irish Sea trade director, told the PA news agency: “We’re seeing big demand pre-Brexit.
“I think you can see people are anxious to get their stuff across and make sure they’ve got enough stock ahead of 1 January.”
That date marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the commencement of trading arrangements governed by the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Under the protocol, which is contained in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods.
That will require additional SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) checks on animal-based products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
The UK and EU have yet to agree a practical framework which could potentially minimise the number of new regulatory checks required.
The major supermarket chains are among those warning about potential disruption to supply lines in the new year if an agreement does not emerge.
Grant said it is “amazing” that there is still uncertainty over the level of checks which will be required with only seven weeks to go before the protocol comes into force.

“We can’t afford for there to be hold-ups and bottlenecks so we’re working with the authorities and the port operators and so forth to make sure that we can make it as seamless as it can possibly be,” he said.
“The challenge for everybody is the fact that there’s so much uncertainty and so much infrastructure is yet to be built.
“We’ve done our part in terms of putting on the ferry capacity and I think the hauliers for their part have done their part in making sure that their supply lines work, but it’s actually making sure that all these checks and processes are in place for the hauliers.”
Grant said most of the stockpiling involves goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, through Cairnryan and Liverpool, but he said there is evidence of the same trend going the other way.
“The Northern Ireland Protocol question – that is the big question and no-one can answer that one yet,” he said.
“And we’re seven weeks away, it’s amazing.”
Stena Line this week marks the 25th anniversary of the Swedish-owned company setting up operations in Belfast after moving from Larne Port.
In that period it has transported 33 million passengers, seven million cars and seven million freight units across the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Grant said 2020 has undoubtedly been the most challenging year of the last 25, with the company having to deal with the impact of both Brexit and coronavirus.
Passenger numbers are down 50% on last year due to the pandemic.
However, Grant expressed confidence that demand will return and that ferry travel may emerge more popular than ever, given the ability to socially distance and access fresh air during journeys.
Looking to the future, Grant said Stena Line’s key focus is on sustainability and efforts to increase fuel efficiency and develop new eco-friendly technologies.

https://www.the42.ie/brexit-uk-football-clubs-4984997-Jan2020/,"FOOTBALL CLUBS IN Britain are bracing themselves for the ‘calamitous’ effects of Brexit on their ability to sign Irish players under the age of 18.
The42 can exclusively reveal how one leading club across the water now fear they must fundamentally alter the way in which their youth system operates.
In correspondence seen by the The42, the club admit that the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union this Friday will “significantly impact in the most calamitous manner” how they are able to do their business.
The letter was made available to The42 and one high-ranking academy official in England confirmed within it that “the football industry will undoubtedly have to change its recruitment strategy with regards to young players”.
The British club describe themselves as “disenchanted with the situation” after they were compelled to pull out of a deal for one of the League of Ireland’s most talented teenagers, as he does not turn 16 until next year.

While Fifa have granted English clubs a ‘transition period’ until 31 December of this year to get their houses in order, the growing belief across the water is that no Irish teenager under the age of 18 will be able to leave.
As per Article 19 of Fifa’s statues relating to the transfer of minors, it states: “International transfers of players are only permitted if the player is over the age of 18.
“The following three exceptions to this rule apply:
a) The player’s parents move to the country in which the new club is located for reasons not linked to football;
b) The transfer takes place within the territory of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) and the player is aged between 16 and 18.
In the letter seen by The 42, the English club state: “If the UK does not remain in the European Economic Area after leaving the EU then British clubs could lose this exemption as it is extremely unlikely that FIFA would create an exception in the Article 19 for UK clubs…
“The EU withdrawal bill rules out any form of extension to the transition period…”

As a result, the English official admits that Fifa regulations then “prevent the transfer of players under the age of 18”.
Consequently, the letter from the English club continues citing their belief that “in terms of transfer of Under-18 EU nationals to UK clubs, the January transfer window and possibly the summer transfer window could be the final time players between the age of 16 and 18 years will be able to be signed”.
Despite the fact that “uncertainty prevails” surrounding the exact consequences, a statement released to the The42 by the English FA last week on the matter stressed that they were working on a solution.
“We are continuing to work with the Premier League, EFL and a range of government departments, including: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS); Home Office; and Treasury during this consultation period.”
Privately, there were concerns among clubs in Britain that their ability to sign Irish teens would be limited, as this letter clearly states.

The UK’s representation in the European Parliament – its 73 MEPs – will be retracted meaning other countries will get now get a few new MEP in their place.
27 of the UK’s seats will be redistributed among 14 EU member states, increasing Ireland’s representation from 11 MEPs to 13.
The remaining 46 UK seats have been set aside for future allocations should new member states join the EU.
Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews were elected in the European elections on 24 May last year, but haven’t taken their seats, as they were waiting for Brexit to officially happen. They haven’t been paid as MEPs since being elected.
Clune, as a former MEP, was entitled to ‘transitional’ pay for 6 months after the last parliament dissolved which she says made the interim period easier.
She’s looking forward to returning to Brussels and seeing the back of the ‘see-saw’ that was the UK’s exit from the EU.
On taking up a seat on the back of the UK leaving Clune said she’s “kind of sad they’re going. It’s a pity they’re leaving, it’s Europe’s loss as well”.

Barry Andrews toldTheJournal.iethat while he’s excited to take up his seat he’d rather it was under different circumstances.
Since May’s election, Andrews said he’s spent his time been minding his children and coaching an under-15s soccer team which has been “brilliant for obvious reasons”.
He said he would have enjoyed the down-time a lot more if there hadn’t been so much uncertainty around the UK’s departure date.
A spokesperson for the European Parliament said member states have been notifying those who are waiting to take their seats for the last number of weeks.
“There is no such a state like ‘waiting MEPs’ or ‘frozen MEPs’, either a person is an MEP or not. Therefore, if notified by the MS before the 1st of February, they will become MEPs only then,” the parliament spokesperson said.
They added that while there is no deadline, most member states will have notified Parliament by 1 February adding that “those who have been already notified by 1 February will become MEPs only then”.

On Thursday MEPs, sitting in Brussels, voted by 621 to 49 in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, paving the way for Britain to leave today with a deal in place.
To mark the occasion, the Brexit Party will hold a celebration in Trafalgar Square later tonight on the foot of Boris Johnson’sfailed attemptto get Big Ben to bong at 11pm.
As of 11pm tonight, the UK will have officially left the EU and will then enter the transition period, where the UK remains in the Single Market and the Customs Union to give people, government and businesses time to prepare for the new trading rules and standards that will come in after the transition period (what exactly these are has yet to be decided).

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told EuroParl radio that the EU is willing to prolong the transition, the time during which the UK is still a member of the Customs Union and Single Market, for one or two more years.
“If we have no agreement that day, we could have to face the risk of a cliff edge for trade between the EU and the UK.
“Obviously, it is an emotional moment, a sad day for most of us because we regret Brexit but my job, my mandate for the last three years was and still is to organise an orderly Brexit for everybody.”
Ibec, the group that represents Irish business, has said that a new economic order awaits Ireland following the UK’s departure.
“Immediate challenges remain on the horizon for Irish business. The new arrangements for Northern Ireland are complex, and many of the specific details of how they will work in practice still need to be worked out,” Ibec CEO Danny McCoy said.
McCoy warned that Johnson’s deal does not deliver the same economic benefits for Irish business as the previous all-UK ‘backstop’ proposal which he says could have “significant negative economic implications for Ireland in due course”.
“We have also been left with short, overly ambitious timelines to agree a future trade deal, which do not reflect business realities.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-2020-5198056-Sep2020/,"MOST PARENTS AGREE that, when a small child throws a tantrum, they should do two things. They should retain their composure, contributing a sense of calm rather than injecting further anxiety into the situation; and they should at the same time be firm with the child about any aspect of its behaviour that is unacceptable.
The recent report in the Financial Times that the Johnson Government is considering reneging on aspects of the legally-binding Brexit Withdrawal Agreement would, if confirmed, corroborate growing fears that the adults are no longer in charge in Downing Street.
It is noteworthy but not surprising that, according to the report, the British civil service is divided at the highest levels about an apparent willingness to walk away from the UK’s international legal obligations.
Adults need not apply
The strange behaviour at the heart of British Brexit policy is not a figment of some fevered EU imagination. It was Johnson’s right-hand man, Dominic Cummings, who called for the appointment of “weirdos and misfits” to the heart of Government.
I expect that, despite the latest reported provocation, the EU’s negotiator Michel Barnier, when he meets his British counterparts today, will demonstrate both aspects of the wisdom required of parents when faced by a tantrum.
He will maintain the admirable courtesy and calmness he has demonstrated throughout the Brexit negotiations, combining the wisdom of Solomon with the patience of Job. At the same time, he will be very firm about any behaviour that is unacceptable.
There are now two major Brexit challenges to be resolved within less than two months. First, to agree on a deal on the future EU/UK relationship; and, second, to ensure the full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement including the Northern Ireland Protocol that governs the complex arrangements necessary to avoid a hard border on this island.

Even if the UK has insisted on aiming for a future relationship with the EU with minimal ambition in terms of breadth or depth, any agreement would be preferable to “no deal” for all concerned, notwithstanding a level of British insouciance about impending danger probably not witnessed since the Charge of the Light Brigade.
There are few reasons for optimism. As Michel Barnier recalled in his recent address to the Institute for International and European Affairs in Dublin, there are still three major issues to be resolved: credible guarantees on open and fair competition, a balanced deal on fisheries and meaningful dispute settlement mechanisms.
The give and take
The EU wants a deal and has shown significant flexibility, including on the sensitive state aid issue. As Barnier recently pointed out, the EU is doing no more than asking to translate agreements already reached with the UK into legal text.
The UK negotiators, on the other hand, have become transfixed by their particular notion of British sovereignty which, they argue, does not allow them to budge an inch. Whether they will budge in the end is beyond rational analysis, but it seems timely to recall six flaws in their understanding of sovereignty.
First, the very idea of Brexit from the outset was based on a false narrative about national sovereignty. For Brexiteers, sovereignty was something to be hoarded in an attic like a long-forgotten Farage family heirloom, or a dusty and delicate treasure to be buried under the Dominic Cummings seat in the Downing Street garden.
Sovereignty, according to the Brexit world view, was not the sovereignty most countries value in modern times, namely something to be used creatively and confidently in our necessarily interdependent world, as indeed the UK itself used it for so long with striking success.
Second, UK negotiators wave the flag of sovereignty without understanding that the EU Member States are equally sovereign, both individually and, where they have pooled sovereignty, collectively.
Thus the UK bases its approach on the strange notion that the UK can insist that it alone and in isolation will determine its state aid policy but that the EU has no sovereign right to determine for itself balanced rules under which products and services will enter its market.
The third flaw is indifference to the complexity of sovereignty. As Barnier reiterated recently on the fisheries issue, the EU respects that the UK will become an independent coastal state.
But fish do not carry passports. Fishermen and fish have always travelled between the waters of different countries; and, if there is a Brexit deal, most of the fish caught in British waters will continue to end up on plates in Paris and Bratislava.
Related ReadsWhy is the UK threatening to roll back on the 'Northern Ireland Protocol' and what does it mean for Brexit trade talks?Tánaiste says no date agreed for 'wet pubs' reopening, but new roadmap will provide certainty to the public
Fourth, the much-proclaimed attachment to sovereignty does not stop British Brexit negotiators, in areas where it suits them, from seeking significant continuity with EU rules, for example on transport or energy trading.
Your word is your bond
Fifth, there is no point talking up sovereignty if one is, at the same time, intent on undermining it. Few acts of sovereignty are as solemn as signing and ratifying an international treaty.
A Treaty engages the state by proclaiming to the world that “this is our word and we will stand by it”. If the UK were, as reported, to default unilaterally on parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, it would not only be disrespecting the EU and international law but also insulting its own sovereignty.
Sixth, while I respect British sovereignty, and some of the great things done in its name along of course with some bad stuff, the truth is that the sovereignty for which Brexit Britain would apparently be willing to do itself immense self-harm has a very distinctly English ring to it. Complex issues of sovereignty are understood quite differently in Scotland, Northern Ireland and increasingly in Wales.
If reports are true that some aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol are now to be called into question, that would risk unravelling a sensitive and very hard-won agreement which minimises Brexit damage to a uniquely complex issue of sovereignty.
Agreement between the UK and EU over the coming weeks will only be possible if the real nature of sovereignty is understood.

They haven’t been paid as MEPs since being elected. Clune, as a former MEP, was entitled to ‘transitional’ pay for 6 months after the last parliament dissolved.
Because of their election on 24 May last year, but the uncertainty of Brexit, it’s lead to the nickname ‘cold-storage- MEPs – meaning their tenure as a political representative had been put on hold until the UK agreed on the conditions under which it would leave.

This week
One of the first debates that Clune and Andrews will take part in is a resolution on the proposed mandate for trade negotiations between the EU and UK tomorrow.
Other issues up for discussion this week include the coronavirus, pet trafficking and threats posed by artificial intelligence.
In his first address to parliament, Andrews asked EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to “continue to talk about the UK as a trading partner, and not a trading competitor, and not to imagine that the UK has to be punished in order for the EU to thrive”.
‘Brexit’ officially happened on 31 January this year; nothing much has changed because the UK is still a part of the EU’s Custom Union and Single Market.
The UK’s representation in the European Parliament – its 73 MEPs – was retracted after this, meaning other countries will get now get a few new MEP in their place.

27 of the UK’s seats will be redistributed among 14 EU member states, increasing Ireland’s representation from 11 MEPs to 13.
The remaining 46 UK seats have been set aside for future allocations should new member states join the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-extension-customs-5121461-Jun2020/,"FOLLOWING MONTHS OF proclamations that the UK would not be seeking an extension to the transition period, senior minister Michael Gove seemed toofficially confirm yesterdaythat this was its final answer.
Although Gove said that he was ‘formally’declaring the UK’s decision, there is still time to do a u-turn – in fact Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner Gove declared the UK position to,tweetedthat ”the EU remains open” in relation to the extension.
The UK government also simultaneously announced that it was going to stagger introducing custom checks from 1 January next year, in an effort to give businesses a break amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and as figures showed that the UK economy shrank by a fifth between March and April.
What this means in practice is that UK companies will have the option of delaying submitting customs declarations and making tariff payments on their exports to EU nations for up to six months, until July 2021.
Thenew, staggered timelineannounced by the UK government yesterday looks like this:
British officials said they would consider extending this arrangement beyond that again – but only if a second wave of the pandemic paralysed UK economic activity into next year.
EU officials, meanwhile, have announced no reciprocal reprieve for exports from the 27 member states to Britain.

But – crucially – this option to delay post-Brexit custom checks doesn’t apply to Northern Irelan:
So from 1 January, custom and SPS checks will be in place for products coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland (but they will beas ‘light-touch’ as possible).
“It’s like for people in Northern Ireland when they watch TV and there’s an ad for insurance,” says Seamus Leheny of the Freight Transport Association.
He said that he confirmed with the Border Delivery Group that this would not apply to Northern Ireland.

“So the Protocol on the UK Command Paper stands, so from 1 January, Northern Ireland is the first to dip its toes in the water with regards to import formalities with goods leaving GB for NI,” he said.
This effectively means that Northern Ireland will experience the first custom checks implemented as part of the EU-UK trade deal (if we get one).
Leheny says that Northern Ireland businesses will be under more intense pressure because of this, and has called for targeted funding for businesses in the North because of it.
“We’re going to be the pilot project.
He said that the custom system the UK is going to use in Dover-Calais is pretty much identical to what they’ve proposed for GB-NI, so the UK needs to get it right in the North by allocating the right resources to make it work.
“It will look badly, and I think it would lead to anxiety in GB if they see that the systems don’t work in Northern Ireland.
Remind me about the extension?
After the UK formally left the EU on the 31 January, it entered what is called ‘the transition period’ – which kept the UK in the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union from the time of its exit until 31 December 2020.
The aim of this period was to give businesses and citizens time to prepare for the UK’s exit from these EU arrangements, which tightly connect it to other EU countries. It also allowed time for a Free Trade Deal to be negotiated.
As the UK was originally meantto leave the EU on 29 March 2019– three years after Article 50 was revoked – there had originally been a longer transition period for a trade deal to be negotiated.
The UK had an option of extending the transition period by one or two years, but UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government have been emphatic about not requesting that extension and prolonging the Brexit process any further.
Despite scepticism about this staunch refusal (remember he said the UK would leave on 31 October 2019, and it didn’t), the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove seems to have officially confirmed this – although there’s still time for a change of mind.
With 6 months to go until end of transition, lots of work remains. Glad we've agreed to speed up the WA implementation.

Fundamental divide
Now that the extension issue can be put aside, the focus will be on getting a trade deal, which needs to be ratified by both sides, by 31 December.
This week, UK chief negotiator David Frostpublished a documentthat showed the next negotiating rounds would take place inJuly, AugustandSeptember.
London and Brussels have reported making some progress on less divisive issues such as security cooperation and data protection rules.
But much more sensitive subjects such as fishing rights – an issue the pro-Brexit camp rallied around four years ago, and that needs to be agreed on by July – and Britain’s acceptance of EU environmental, health, safety and State Aid rules remain largely unresolved.
The bloc worries that Britain’s rejection of basic EU standards and regulations would create unfair competition, allowing UK exporters to undercut their European competitors.
Johnson’s government counters that such freedom was the whole point of Brexit, and that it is ready to walk away if Brussels does not want a basic deal removing barriers to trade.
It also says that asking for more time would not help bridge this fundamental divide, since the sides are not negotiating the finer details of tariffs on specific goods.

Johnson will get personally involved in the negotiations for the first time on Monday, when he is due to speak to EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.
Šefčovič, EU commissioner for Interinstitutional Relations, said Brussels was “pleading” for work to be accelerated to secure a “very close and cordial relationship” by the start of 2021.
In a last-gasp bid to extend the talks, the heads of the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales wrote a joint letter telling Johnson that setting a December 31 deadline during a pandemic was “extraordinarily reckless”.
Without an extension, “at very best there will only be a damaging ‘bare bones’ trade deal or even worse, a disastrous no-deal outcome,” they warned.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-talks-north-4951087-Jan2020/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has urged Stormont’s parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.
Coveney said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again.
Negotiations formally resume on tomorrow after a pause for the festive period.
Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith were in Belfast today for pre-talks discussions ahead of the resumption of exchanges with the political parties tomorrow morning.

The parties have until a January 13 deadline to strike a deal to revive devolution.
On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland’s public services expires and Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.
On the journey up to Belfast ahead of the new round of talks, Coveney reflected on the importance of the coming fortnight.
He tweeted: “2020 can be a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership & generosity from all sides – we’ve got less than 2 weeks – let’s not disappoint again! NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING!”
In a subsequent New Year’s Day video posted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining his government’s priorities for 2020, Coveney added: “We are determined to work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to get the devolved government back up and running again, to get the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement functioning again, to bring communities together and to ensure that Northern Ireland can make decisions for itself.”
The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.

Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Féin agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.
The other three main parties – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance – are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish governments.
While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.

https://www.thejournal.ie/at-risk-goods-northern-ireland-5286679-Dec2020/,"IMPORTS TO NORTHERN Ireland may be made more expensive after 31 December, due to the ‘goods at risk’ provisions of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
As part of the Withdrawal Agreement struck last year, Northern Ireland remains in the UK’s custom territory, but aligned to the European Union’s Custom Union.
This means that goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will avoid tariffs if they remain in the region, but if they are deemed ‘at risk’ of being sent to the European Union, ie across the NI border to Ireland, they will have to pay a tariff.
It’s not yet certain how a product will be deemed ‘at-risk’ of leaving Northern Ireland, which is part of the problem for Northern Irish businesses.
The way this will work in practice is that Northern Ireland businesses receiving goods from Great Britain will pay the tariffs upfront, and will be rebated the cost of tariffs if they can prove they are not at risk of going to the EU.
If the goods are consumed or used in Northern Ireland, they will receive a rebate on that tariff; but if they are sent on from Northern Ireland to Ireland to be processed, they automatically pay a charge (though it is possible that this may be rebated).
If a product is likely to be sent from Northern Ireland to Ireland, then a tariff will apply that isn’t in place now.
Declan Billington, former chair of the Confederation of British Industry Northern Ireland and board member of Northern Ireland’s Food & Drink Association, gave an example of how imports to Northern Ireland could be adversely impacted.

He toldTheJournal.iethat his animal-feed business imports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of maize in from the Ukraine and Canada each year.
“We make feed and we sell that feed in Northern Ireland and across the border to farmers in Donegal, farmers in Meath, and all sorts of places.
“The EU has a Free Trade Agreement [FTA] with Canada, currently there’s a duty on maize of about €5 a tonne. But the EU FTA with Canada means Canadian maize imported into Dublin will be tariff-free under the European FTA, and Canadian maize imported into Liverpool will be free under the UK rolling over the Canadian FTA.
“You have the same problem with maize from Ukraine.”
“So when it comes to Northern Ireland: is it coming in under a European tariff quota – no,” he said. “Has the European customs tariff schedule got a tax on it? Yeah, it’s a fiver. So effectively you’re paying a fiver even though you don’t pay a fiver on it in Dublin.”
The committee
A Specialised Committee on the Implementation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland is one of six committees set up to oversee how the Withdrawal Agreement can be implemented (it had its third meeting in October).
It focuses on how customs procedures, health, regulatory and other checks will be implemented on goods goingfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
A crucial part of checks on trade from GB to NI has centred on what goods will be ‘at risk’ of entering the EU’s Single Market from Northern Ireland.
The emphasis placed on GB to NI procedures is to ensure that the EU’s Single Market is protected, without the need for a border on the island of Ireland. The UK has said that it would apply“light-touch”checks on goods going in the opposite direction.
Related Reads'Northern Ireland is a pilot project': About the UK's staggered custom checks plan
“Common sense would say if it’s not taxed in Dublin, it can be trade distorting so shouldn’t be taxed in Belfast,” Billington said.
‘Trade distorting’ is where trade is changed from how it should normally be – smuggling is one consequence of a trade distortion.
“While we’re waiting for those decisions, where do we buy our maize from?” said Billington.
The committee may eventually agree not to tax maize, but other goods from third countries that should be taxed under EU rules may not be exempt even if both the UK and EU have a trade agreement, or ‘no tariff quota’ agreement, with that country.
In short: from 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland will have access to UK free trade agreements, but not EU ones, and the EU’s customs schedule will still apply in Northern Ireland.
“We have access to Europe in the way the rest of the UK don’t, that’s great. But we don’t have access, directly or indirectly, to those export agreements and therefore, that is something different, a lesser outcome, than where we are today,” said Billington.
Meanwhile. negotiators will meet today tocontinue to hash out the Brexit deal.
Von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke yesterday after talks werepausedon Friday night when negotiators for the EU and UK said that the conditions for reaching an agreement had not been met.
The three key issues which remain to be solved between the negotiating teams – fishing, governance, and the level playing field – have been the focus on post-Brexit talks in recent days.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-tiger-in-the-tank-5126840-Jun2020/,"ALTHOUGH NO GREAT rows broke into the mainstream news agenda this week, bits of post-Brexit trade deal nuggets burst forth at a number of interesting events this week.
Firstly, we had the hour-long meeting of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Although both sides agreed that because there would be no extension to the transition period at the end of this year that talks needed more “momentum”, even on this, there was some disagreement.
Then, the Duchy of Lancaster with responsibilities for Brexit Michael Govegave evidenceto the Northern Ireland Affairs committee – which was illuminating in showing how little we still don’t know.
And on that same day, the European Commission announced a report into its aims for the second phase of Brexit talks and its future with the UK after that; EU officials said they were happy it didn’t look like “a Christmas tree,” ie, that it didn’t have too many bells and whistles to it, but was coherent in what it was asking for.
At this briefing, it was said that a “ready, legal text [for a trade deal] was needed by 31 October” – which was a previous date for the UK to formally leave the EU (this instead happened on 31 January this year).

Gove in committee
“What does the government mean by ‘unfettered access’?” was the first question Gove was asked by the Northern Ireland Affairs committee this week. His answer was a clear reaffirmation that there would be no checks from NI to GB – but what happens in the other direction is still unclear.
“Goods from Northern Ireland businesses should be able to [be] circulated freely in the rest of the United Kingdom’s internal market,” said Gove.
He continued:
“No import declarations, no entry summary declarations, no tariffs, no customs checks, no regulatory checks, no additional approvals,” Gove said definitively, with his secretary of state adding that Northern Ireland businesses should see no changes.
Gove said that this would not threaten the integrity of the EU’s market – but was less clear on his own country’s internal customs market.
An oversimplification of where we are with checks makes sense, as the UK looks to press on with talks. Boris Johnson told the European Parliament earlier in the week that they needed to put an “oomph” into trade talks, and put “a tiger in the tank” – or, as he actually phrased it,“un tigre dans le moteur”.
European Council President Charles Michel agreed to put a tiger in the tank, but added they wouldn’t do this if it meant they would be buying “a pig in a poke”.
At a press briefing announcing the EU’s report on the future relationship, Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the UK Coordination GroupDavid McAllisterasked what the point was of putting a tiger in the tank: “Let’s put some tigers in the tank, but indeed we need to know in which direction the car should drive”.

Johnson had also suggested that with this “tiger” in tow, the EU and UK could conclude talks by July – a mere month away.
The European Union has brushed this suggestion aside.
“Beyond the commendable use of idioms,” Kati Piri, co-rapporteur and member of the UK Coordination Group said, “the UK Prime Minister failed to explain how he wants to reach a deal in six weeks. So we are very much looking forward to that, to those details… the ball is in the court of the United Kingdom.”
The EU’s UK ambassador told a London conference that “the negotiating table was empty” and an October deadline was more realistic to avoid an economically damaging no-deal split at the end of year.
“The United Kingdom has confirmed that they do not want to extend the transition,” Joao Vale de Almeida said by video link from Brussels.
Skinny and sticky issues
This might sound familiar, but any trade agreement would have to be ratified by the 27 EU member nations and the European and UK parliaments before entering into force.
The EU ambassador said Britain’s desire to reach a bare-bones agreement that focused on trade and avoided broader issues made the talks even harder.
“Sometimes skinny deals are more difficult to negotiate than larger deals,” Vale de Almeida said.
Johnson personally joined the talks for the first time last week in a self-professed effort to give more “oomph” to the stalled process.
Four rounds of negotiations have made little headway.
Britain wants to stay as distant from the bloc as possible while still preserving favourable trade ties.
Brussels says it will only grant the UK beneficial trade terms if it abides by EU rules on environmental standards and other issues that make up a “level playing field”.
Britain’s environment minister George Eustice confirmed on Thursday that London was looking to set its own regulations once the post-Brexit transition period ends.
“It does give us an opportunity – once we will get over the shock of leaving the European Union – the opportunity to start to think about doing things in a different way, innovate in policy in different ways,” Eustice told parliament.
“We will have an opportunity to do things a bit differently and I think better, and we can demonstrate that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-fears-arlene-foster-5116797-Jun2020/,"THE FIRST MINISTER of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, has voiced her concern that the Brexit negotiations “don’t appear to be going particularly well”.
With just months to go until the extension period runs out at the end of the year, Arlene Foster said she wants to see a trade deal agreed.
“We need to make sure that both sides understand that it’s to both sides benefit, and that’s something I think the European Union often didn’t get in the negotiations from 2016 onwards,” she told the BBC Radio 4’sPolitical Thinking With Nick Robinsonpodcast.
“And for both our sakes, I hope that we do get to a situation where we get a deal because that’s what we need in Northern Ireland.”
Foster pledged to work to keep post-Brexit checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea minimal.
“In term of Northern Ireland to Great Britain, unfettered access has very much been stated again in the command paper. I suppose the concern we are focused on is the transport of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because the whole issue is about the risk of those goods going into the Republic of Ireland and into the single market,” she said.
“Of course we have had checks for many years in terms of live animals, SPS checks, to make sure there is no disease coming into the island of Ireland and those will continue but we need to make sure the rest of the administrative checks are kept to a minimal.”
Foster insisted she has a very good relationship with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

“But we have to make sure we protect Northern Ireland. He knows that,” she said.
Asked if she worried about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, Foster said she thinks most would prefer to remain in the UK.

“After this crisis abates we will see the impact that being part of the European Union will have on the Republic of Ireland. They have borrowed very heavily in terms of what they have been able to do over Covid so the implications of that will come home,” she said.
“In the past the Republic of Ireland was a gainer of being part of the European Union, they were always getting money for roads and all of those kind of things that has brought the Republic of Ireland up to be a modern democratic state.
“They are now net contributors to the European Union and that will have an impact.
“But we have a very good relationship with our neighbours, I think that that is a mature way to be.”
Turning to the pandemic, Foster said she hopes to be in a position by the end of the summer “where things are moving in the right direction and we are coming out” of lockdown.
“I suppose the worry then is, and the worry for us all, is the threat of a second wave of the pandemic, and that will be devastating if we don’t manage that because of course the economy is the main concern there,” she said.
Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill.PA ImagesPA Images
She said that she and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill found the shared experience of both their mothers being ill “brought out their humanity”.
“Neither of our mothers thankfully had Covid-19, but both were admitted in or around the same time bizarrely, and so as well as dealing with everything that we have to deal with in government, we have to deal with the pressure of our mothers being in hospital … that of course brings out the humanity in both of us,” she said.
Foster said she has had moments when she wonders if the right thing is being done with regards to the pandemic after introducing strict social distancing measures, which she described as “some of the most draconian steps that have ever been taken in this country since World War Two”.
“It’s a huge responsibility so of course we have those moments, I have those moments, when you think about are you doing the right thing and you do lean heavily on our medical advisers at this time and then try to take the decisions based on what they tell us,” she said.
“And I’m pleased to say that in terms of the number of deaths in Northern Ireland, we have managed to keep them as low as we possibly could and that has worked well.”","10.23am, 7 Jun 2020",

Michel Barnier met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee in government buildings this morning.
Barnier thanked politicians and civil servants for their work, days ahead the UK formally leaving the EU on Friday.
“And I wanted to make one point about this today. It certainly wouldn’t have been possible to reach this [withdrawal] agreement without the hard work, passions and unity of everybody here in Ireland,” Barnier said in Dublin today.
“And I want to thank you, Leo [Varadkar], for the leadership, for the courage you have shown throughout this negotiation, in particular in the last few months at the end of last year.
Varadkar said it was important that the remaining member states continue to be united as “Team 27” in the next phase of negotiations with the UK.
“On Friday, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, we’ll say goodbye to an old friend embarking on an adventure,” he said.
“We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table.”
Varadkar said he was “ambitious” about the future EU/UK relationship but warned there was also a need for “realism”.
“We need to start a new relationship between the EU and the UK on a firm and honest footing,” he said.
“And that means a level playing field. This is very much in Ireland’s interests, as well as that of the European Union as a whole.”

He said achieving a trade deal by the end of 2020 would be “very challenging”.
Barnier said the EU is not ready to ask for concessions nor ready to give concessions.
“The UK is leaving. It is their choice, it is not our choice. We have to first of all organise this orderly Brexit,” he added.
He added that if no agreement is reached by the end of the year it “cannot be business as usual”.
“We are to face a risk of a cliff edge, in particular for trade,” he added.
‘Brexit is not going to go away’
Varadkar said the second phase of negotiations will be different as “there isn’t a separate objective related to Ireland.”
“But I think our influence will remain strong, relationships have been built up over the past two or three years.”
Barnier said he would present a draft negotiating mandate to the EU member states next Monday.
“Brexit is not going to go away,” he said.
“We have some important work ahead of us. The protocol of Ireland/Northern Ireland now needs to be implemented in all its dimensions – we will watch over its implementation very closely.
Barnier said a possible change in government after the general election in two weeks’ time would not impact his working relationship with Ireland.
The negotiator will be travelling to Belfast later today to meet with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the DUP’s Diane Dodds.

The Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group has penned a report outlining concerns and takeaways from the British government’s proposals for operating the Northern Ireland protocol.
The protocol contained in the Withdrawal Treaty is the arrangement by which Northern Ireland continues to follow single market rules for goods and administers the EU’s customs code at its ports.
The government has acknowledged that regulatory checks will be needed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, with the expansion of infrastructure to carry out screening of animals and food products.
But the government has insisted there will be no new physical customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
The working group said more details were needed to help businesses prepare for the scheduled end of the transition period at the end of 2020.

Its report poses more than 60 questions that business wants answered as soon as possible on areas including VAT, labour, customs and business engagement.
On Monday, the EU committee in the British House of Lordssaid businesses in Northern Irelandwere not sufficiently addressed in the UK’s protocol plan for trade within the island of Ireland and the UK after the Brexit transition period.
NIBBWG convenor Aodhan Connolly, from the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said recent meetings with politicians at home, in Britain and in the EU had proved useful.
But he added: “Given the impending ending of the transition period in six months and the level of preparations that will need to be made we must be able to voice our concerns with the Westminster Government and our political leaders in the Executive.
“We said in January to have everything in place that business needs to trade successfully will be a Herculean task and it has only gotten harder since then. We need the government officials in Whitehall to sit down and talk with our technical experts to ensure that solutions work.
“If we get this wrong this is not just an economic issue for business but a standard of life issue for households across Northern Ireland.
“We desperately need technical detail from the UK Government. We also need a generosity of spirit from the EU to allows derogations to facilitate mitigations. This is going to take movement from both side to make this work.
“We have proven ourselves willing and able to work with the UK Government and the EU on tangible meaningful solutions over the past three years and with the crunch time approaching, we are committed to play our part but we need both sides to work with us.”","7.06am, 5 Jun 2020",

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has warned there is a “strong possibility” that the UK will fail to broker a trade deal with the EU as he urged the public to prepare for the end of the transition period.
Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had set out a deadline of Sunday for a decision on the future of Brexit negotiations.
The decision follows a three-hour dinner between the two leaders in Brussels last night, with both sides still far from agreeing a post-Brexit trade deal.
They also asked chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost to reconvene in the city today.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin flew to Brussels last night to take part in a tw0-day EU summit, where it had originally been expected that the 27 member states would vote on a prospective deal.
However, such a vote will now not take place after negotiations stalled in recent days.
Von der Leyen is now expected to debrief Europe’s leaders on the state of play with the negotiations.
Speaking today, Martin said he doesn’t expect a ‘lengthy discussion’ on Brexit today but is looking forward to hearing an assessment from the president.
“There can be no winners or losers in these negotiations from here on,” he told reportrs. “There has to be a common purpose in terms of getting a deal over the line, in my view, because it makes sense to get a trading deal.
“In my view one final effort is required here and there will obviously be a need for compromise in the end of the day.”
Talks have faltered on fishing rights, among other issues, the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing the UK undercutting the EU on standards and state subsidies, and the way that any deal would be governed.

Following last night’s meeting, a senior Downing Street source said that it was “unclear” whether differences between the two sides could be bridged.
A Downing Street spokesman also said that “any agreement must respect the independence and sovereignty of the UK”.
In a statement, Von der Leyen said both sides should “immediately reconvene” to try to resolve the “essential issues” but stressed the positions remained “far apart”.
She added that the UK and EU would “come to a decision by the end of the weekend”.
It was hoped that progress at a political level between Johnson and von der Leyen could pave the way for more talks between Frost and Barnier.
But the statements from both sides suggested that while further discussions would be held, substantial movement on the key issues had not been made.
The outcome of the dinner came as no surprise as both sides had expressed pessimism ahead of the encounter.
European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said that the statements issued by Johnson and von der Leyen after a “lively and interesting” dinner last night provided a “glimmer of hope” because both sides appeared to understand each other’s positions.
In an interview with RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme, she also said the issue of the level playing field had become “emotive” and that there was “a deal to be done”.
“I think that if you take some of the heat out of this discussion and look at the practical implications for businesses and individuals of our failure to reach an agreement, I think – on balance – a deal and agreement is much more important,” she said.
Also this morning, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News that Johnson would “leave no stone unturned” in the search for a deal but said there had not been “enough pragmatism and flexibility on the EU side”.
“We are not going to sacrifice the basic points of democratic principle on fisheries, on control over our laws as we leave the transition period,” he said.
“I think it’s important that is recognised on the EU side and if they do I think the scope for a deal is still there to be done.”

Integrity of common market
Before leaving London, Johnson told MPs that no prime minister could accept the demands the EU was making, although he insisted a trade deal was still possible.
That followed remarks by Barnier to EU foreign ministers that he now believed a no-deal Brexit was more likely than a trade agreement being reached by 31 December.
In Berlin, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was still a chance for a deal. But she warned: “We must not endanger the integrity of the common market.”
Just three weeks remain until the current transitional arrangements expire.
Failure to reach agreement would see tariffs imposed on UK exports to the EU, the country’s biggest trading partner, and could also increase bureaucracy.
European sources said the two men and their teams would return to talks this morning.
However, a deal agreed on Tuesday means the Northern Ireland Protocol – which would mean goods travelling from Britain to Ireland via the North will be checked after they cross the Irish Sea – can be implemented in practice.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland yesterday that Tuesday’s announcement was a “historic day” that would ensure the protocol would be respected regardless of the outcome of trade talks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-uk-election-4869137-Oct2019/,"THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS and the Scottish National Party (SNP) are preparing to give Boris Johnson the snap December election he has been demanding.
The Prime Minister has used an article in the Sunday papers to accuse MPs of holding the country “hostage” by so far refusing to agree to a general election.
He is looking to pile pressure on parliamentarians to give him the two-thirds backing he needs on Monday to secure a trip to the polls.
But in a move that circumvents Labour’s indecision, the Lib Dems and SNP will reportedly offer the Conservative Party leader an even easier route to an election, requiring just a simple majority in the Commons.
If the European Union gives the UK a Brexit delay until 31 January, as requested in Johnson’s letter to Brussels last week, the two pro-Remain parties are prepared to give the PM the opportunity to have an election on new terms.
Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, confirmed he had co-signed a letter with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to European Council president Donald Tusk in which they sought an extension until at least 31 January so that the “risk of a devastating no-deal Brexit” could be removed.
He added: “If that meaningful extension is secured we will then work together to bring forward an election this year, but on Parliament’s terms, not on the Prime Minister’s.”

Opposition split
According to The Observer, the parties’ MPs have drawn up a bill that would allow Johnson to secure a December election with a simple majority of MPs, by-passing the need for two-thirds support.
The draft law would grant an election on 9 December – three days before the PM’s proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.
The move indicates a split between opposition leaders on whether to go for a December campaign, with Labour putting off their decision on how to vote on Monday.
Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to wait until EU ambassadors had finalised their decision, expected on Monday or Tuesday, over the length of an extension for Article 50.
Speaking on a campaign visit to Motherwell on Saturday, Corbyn said: “We will be very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table.”

But the Government reiterated it had no intention of ruling out a cliff-edge divorce, with Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “No-deal can’t be taken off the table.”
Ramped-up rhetoric
The PM ramped-up the rhetoric on Sunday as he looks to encourage MPs to grant him a trip to the polls when Parliament returns on Monday.
He wants an election on 12 December but requires two-thirds of MPs — 434 out of 650 — to back the move under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.
The PM said any Brexit delay granted by the EU would be “wasted” by the House of Commons and that, should Labour and other opposition parties reject his request for a trip to the polls, they would be guilty of holding the country “hostage”.

“Parliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer,” he said.
“Millions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage and the country must move on in 2020.”
Johnson said that the current Parliament had “run its course”, adding: “For more than three years Parliament has consistently told the country what it doesn’t want – but it has never been willing or able to say what it does want.
“This has left our country unable to move on and do what is needed to get Brexit done.
“My worry is this Parliament will just waste the next three months like it’s wasted the last three years.”
MPs have already dismissed an election request twice, calling for the option of a no-deal Brexit to be removed first.
Conservative Campaign Headquarters said the party saw its biggest online fundraising month on record in September as members get behind Johnson’s desire for a new Tory majority.
Tory chairman James Cleverly said: “If this Parliament won’t get Brexit done, it needs to let the people choose another one that will.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-irish-government-4869398-Oct2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said the relationship between her party and the Irish government is currently ‘not very good’.
In an interview withRTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Foster said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s comments on unionist fears about the Withdrawal Agreement were a “trite definition of unionism” and her birthright to be a British citizen.
Speaking in Brussels a week ago about the new deal agreed between the UK and EU, Varadkar had said: “The queen will still be the queen, the point will still be the pound, people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letter post boxes”.

“Northern Ireland will still be part of the United Kingdom and because of the Good Friday [Belfast] Agreement. That is protected until such a time, should that time ever arise, when the majority of the people in Northern Ireland vote otherwise,” he said.
Speaking to RTÉ at her party’s conference this weekend, Foster said these comments had been “detrimental to unionist-Fine Gael relationships”.
She said: “I don’t think relationships are very good at the moment and I regret that.”
Foster said unionism was more fundamental than simply posting letters in a red post box, adding that there is a “naive and trite” understanding of unionist concerns and there is a feeling they are being dismissed.
She said the Taoiseach and Tánaiste should be aware of the fact that the DUP are not the only ones who are opposed to the Withdrawal Agreement and the Irish government needs to try to understand where people are coming from.

“Over 40% of people in Northern Ireland voted for Brexit so I think we need to remember that is the case as well,” she said.
Foster said people want to “get on with their lives” and they want to see political leaders “concentrating on the things that matter to them”.
“There’s a lot to be done on Brexit, but we also need to get back to doing the normal everyday things because politics is essentially paused here in Northern Ireland and I think that’s wrong. We need to find a pathway back to devolution.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-calls-for-realism-in-brexit-trade-talks-5198522-Sep2020/,"PROGRESS MUST BE made in crunch negotiations this week in order to broker a deal in time for the end of the Brexit transition period, the UK’s chief negotiator has warned his EU counterpart.
Lord Frost called for “more realism” from Brussels as he said the two sides “can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground” in the deadlocked talks.
The negotiator’s firm words came ahead of him meeting his EU counterpart Michel Barnier for the eighth round of talks beginning in London today.
Downing Street has sought to increase pressure on Brussels, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson setting a five-week deadline for trade talks to succeed in time for the transition’s end on 31 December.
But talks were set for a collision course over new Brexit legislation which has dismayed senior EU figures who are concerned it couldoverride key elements of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Lord Frost said: “Today, I will sit down with Michel Barnier and drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time.
“We have now been talking for six months and can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground.

“We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country.”
He said the UK’s position derives from the “fundamentals of being a sovereign state” and called for the EU to “fully recognise this reality”.
“If they can’t do that in the very limited time, we have left then we will be trading on terms like those the EU has with Australia, and we are ramping up our preparations for the end of the year,” Lord Frost added.
Senior EU figures reacted angrily after it was reported the UK government was set to table new legislation which could override key elements of the Withdrawal Agreement that sealed the UK’s departure from the bloc in January.
Good Friday Agreement
Johnson’s official spokesman said the government was proposing “limited clarifications” to the law to ensure ministers can preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement in the event of no deal.
The Internal Market Bill, to be tabled tomorrow, will ensure goods from Northern Ireland continue to have unfettered access to the UK market while making clear EU state aid rules, which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, will not apply in the rest of the UK.
In addition, an amendment to the Finance Bill will give ministers the power to designate which goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are considered “at risk” of entering the EU single market and are therefore liable to EU tariffs.
The prime minister’s spokesman said discussions were continuing with the EU to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border with the Republic once the transition is over.
Related ReadsWhy is the UK threatening to roll back on the 'Northern Ireland Protocol' and what does it mean for Brexit trade talks?
He said the legislative changes were a necessary “safety net” in the event that they were unable to come to an agreement.
But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned there could be no backtracking by the UK on its previous commitments if it wanted to reach a free trade agreement.
“I trust the British Government to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law and prerequisite for any future partnership,” she said.
“(The) protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland is essential to protect peace and stability on the island and integrity of the single market.”
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney warned that abandoning the agreement would be “a very unwise way to proceed”. Conveyed is bringing what is described as a “significant paper” on Brexit trade preparations to Cabinet today.
Barnier said he would be seeking clarification about the UK’s plans.
He told French radio that honouring the Withdrawal Agreement was “a precondition for confidence between us because everything that has been signed in the past must be respected”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/outcomes-of-uk-election-4929725-Dec2019/,"
PEOPLE IN THE United Kingdom are casting their votes in a crucial general election today, with latest opinion polls showing Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a tight battle to win a majority and deliver his Brexit plans.
However, nothing can be truly determined until the polls close at 10pm tonight. Exit polls will then give a more accurate indication of what to expect.
The results are mostly due to be announced in the early hours of tomorrow morning.
So far today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson broke from tradition by not voting in his own constituency.
There have also beenphotos postedon social media of queues outside polling stations today in the hours since doors opened at 7am.
Here are the possible outcomes for parliament after all the votes have been cast tonight.
Conservative majority
The Conservatives winning back the majority they lost in 2017 is the most likely result from the election, according to bookmakers and pollsters at the moment.
This appeared to be a comfortable lead a few days ago, but now looks to be more precarious following the release of a major new survey on Tuesday.
TheYouGov pollindicated the expected Conservative majority would be slashed from 68 seats to 28 since the last survey at the end of November, with a hung parliament now within the margin of error.

There are 650 seats in the House of Commons. The poll takes 326 as the magic number for a majority, predicting the Tories will win 339 seats.
Due to Sinn Féin’s policy of not sending MPs to the British parliament, and with the speakers not normally involved in parliamentary votes, a working majority can actually be obtained with fewer seats.
In 2017, the Conservatives won 317 seats and went on to govern after striking a deal with the 10 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs.
Any kind of majority should allow Johnson to get his Brexit deal approved and agreed with Brussels, putting the UK on course to leave the European Union by 31 January.

Labour majority
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could defy the odds and secure a majority for his party.
In this scenario, the UK would vote again on whether to leave the EU with the options being a softer Brexit deal negotiated by the Labour Party or remaining in the union.
A Labour victory would represent a major breakthrough on the global stage for the left-leaning movement backed by younger voters.
Hung parliament
If no party achieves a working majority, then Britain would have another hung parliament, as in 2010 and 2017.
The Conservatives are still expected to win the most seats and, as incumbent, Johnson would remain prime minister and try to strike a deal with opposition parties, either to join a formal coalition or for them to agree to back him on crucial votes in an informal pact.

But he has few friends outside his own party and is unlikely to win the support of the DUP this time round as they are unhappy with his Brexit deal.
Johnson could then quit or try to go it alone in a minority government, which would require him to win key votes when parliament returns.
He would be obliged to resign if his attempts failed.
Corbyn would likely then try to form a government, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) indicating they would back him if he agreed to a second Scottish independence referendum.
The Liberal Democrats could also be tempted by Labour’s commitment to a second Brexit referendum, but have so far “absolutely categorically” ruled out backing Corbyn, citing his radical economic agenda and allegations of anti-Semitism within the party.
Without them, Corbyn would probably fall short of forming a government or securing the backing needed to sustain a minority government.
Another election would be the only way to break the deadlock.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-in-the-eyes-of-the-eu-5211097-Sep2020/,"BREXIT; IT NEVER really went away, but developments over the last number of weeks have certainly seen it come back with a bang.
Despite having negotiated and then ensured that the Withdrawal Agreement was approved by UK parliament earlier in January of this year, now, eight months later, the UK government seems to have embarked on a course where it appears to be going back or breaking some of its international treaty commitments to the Northern Ireland Protocol in a ‘very specific and limited way,’ to quote Brandan Lewis, Northern Ireland Secretary of State.
It’s fair to say that the publication of the ‘United Kingdom Internal Market Bill’ has been met with shock, disappointment and no small amount of anger by many in Ireland and indeed across the EU.
‘Extraordinary’ behaviour
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said that it “undermines trust” in Brexit talks with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, commenting that the UK government was behaving in an “extraordinary way.”
As we count down to October’s crucial Council Summit of EU leaders, the Brexit clock continues to tick in terms of finding a landing zone for agreement between both sides.
However, Brexit is not the only issue that the EU is dealing with it at the moment. In fact, it is competing on a crowded field, with many other challenges on the EU agenda at present; namely, responding to the Covid-19 crisis, managing trade relations with China and the US, engaging with Russia, monitoring the situation in Belarus and calming the ongoing maritime dispute involving Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean, to name just a few.
Despite all of the above, the latest in the Brexit saga is, of course, being followed closely across the EU by those who are anxious to see a resolution and a trade agreement reached, whilst crucially not undermining the Northern Ireland protocol.
This is something to bear in mind as Ireland’s focus narrows to the parliamentary goings-on in London.

Support for Ireland
Take, for example, one of Germany’s largest industrial representative groups, the Federation of German Industries, which represents more than 100,000 companies with around eight million employees.
In response to the publication of the bill, the Federation’s representatives have said that “there is no getting around the fact that the United Kingdom must fulfil its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement”, and that, “a trade agreement can only be reached with a functioning border regime on the island of Ireland.”
Another organisation to comment on Brexit is the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), stating that unless the UK maintains the same levels of labour rights that exist in the EU, it “could trigger a race to the bottom with devastating consequences for workers’ rights and their livelihoods in the EU27, especially in Ireland.”
ETUC, representing 45 million members in 38 European countries, has said that “the Good Friday Agreement contains a commitment not to undermine the economic and social fabric of Northern Ireland and a regression on workers’ rights would breach that commitment.”
The EU institutions themselves have not remained silent in response to the UK government’s publication of the bill this past fortnight. An extraordinary, (in every sense of the word) meeting of the Joint Committee, which monitors the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, was called for by the European Commissioner from Slovakia, Maroš Šefčovič with his UK counterparts.
The Commissioner co-chaired the meeting with Michael Gove, representing the UK government. He repeated to Gove that the Protocol is there “to protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland”.
Šefčovičemphasisedthat the EU will not hesitate to act in response to the bill, stating that the Withdrawal Agreement contains a number of legal routes “to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text [...] which the European Union will not be shy in using.”
Another actor whose role in the process is not always recognised or fully appreciated in the UK, or indeed, perhaps also here in Ireland, is the European Parliament itself. It plays a vital role in that it must approve any final EU – UK trade agreement, as it does with all EU negotiated trade deals.
The leaders of the largest political groups, who account for roughly 600 MEPs out of the full cohort of 705, issued a joint statement demanding “nothing less than the full implementation [of] the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland” as it “is essential to protect the Good Friday Agreement and peace and stability on the island of Ireland.”
A lot can happen
As another Brexit ‘winter of discontent’ looms ahead and we all tune in to the live feed once again from the House of Commons, it is important to remember that our friends in the EU will be tuning in too, just as keenly and, crucially from an Irish perspective, in solidarity.
Related ReadsNeale Richmond: Brexit was no one hit wonder - the Tory party fostered this toxic sentiment over many yearsCovid-19 pandemic means hard Brexit 'could impact Irish economy even worse than feared'Brexit: Senior US politicians write to Boris Johnson over his efforts to 'flout the Northern Ireland protocol'
Italy’s Minister for European affairs, Vincenzo Amendola, in reaction to the publication of the bill, said, “our friends in London must realise that Europe is united” and that “there will be no disruption to this unity.”
Our cousins on the far side of the Atlantic will be watching proceedings in London closely too. As Democratic Party US presidential candidate, Joe Biden stated, “We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,’ in direct response to the publication of the bill on Twitter, sentiments re-iterated by House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi amongst others.
With the next meeting of the Joint Committee due to take place this coming Monday, 28 September and the EU deadline for the UK government to withdraw the bill on Wednesday, the next couple of weeks will be crucial in defining the shape of the new relationship between the EU and the UK.
Reaching a deal is imperative for Ireland on many levels. This was again highlighted by recent news from the UK that there could be queues of up to 7,000 lorries at the port of Dover seeking to sail to France in a no-deal Brexit situation.
A2018 report by the Irish Maritime Transport Authorityhighlights how important the land bridge is for Irish trade. It found that some 150,000 Irish lorries use the land bridge every year, carrying about 40% of Irish exports in terms of value.
As it loses access to CAP, the Common Agricultural Policy, the UK will instead have to implement KAP (Kent Access Permits). We, in Ireland, are fortunate that we will have continued access to CAP and can only hope that we won’t be greatly affected by KAP.

https://www.thejournal.ie/three-month-grace-period-brexit-5293745-Dec2020/,"SUPERMARKETS are to get a three month ‘grace period’ from some Brexit-related checks on food and other goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland after 31 December, it has been confirmed.
This exemption will mean that health export certificates, which should be required on GB-to-NI agri-foods from 1 January, are not needed for “trusted” traders in NI.
Yesterday, an agreement was reached between British minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič about how the Withdrawal Agreement could be implemented in practice.
Though the details of this deal have not been published yet, a statement by Michael Gove to the House of Commons this afternoon has given us some insight into what’s in store.
As part of that agreement “in principle”, the two sides decided on how Northern Ireland trade between Ireland and between Great Britain would work under the NI Protocol, which will come into effect from 31 December – deal or no deal.
In the House of Commons, Gove confirmed that there would be a “grace period” for supermarkets and traders “in order to make sure that they are ready for any health export certificate requirements”.
This was a major concern for politicians and retailers in Northern Ireland: last month, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neillwrote toŠefčovič to raise concerns about the SPS checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland.
The leaders feared that post-Brexit checks on agri-foods coming from GB to NI would lead to “price increases and/or reduced choice” for customers.
The NI leaders said that representatives of the main supermarkets said there was a “real threat” to the “supply of existing food and other products” in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.
A corporate affairs manager for Asda NI said last month that the rules of trade for ‘mixed’ consignments, or trucks with a few different products in them, were complex and ”a special arrangement to avoid drowning in bureaucracy” was needed.
As the island of Ireland is viewed as one single epidemiological zone post-Brexit, SPS checks need to be carried out on animals and agriculture products travelling between the island of Ireland and Great Britain (meat and dairy, for example).

Key quotes from Michael Gove explaining this in the House of Commons
1. Chilled meats
Labour chair of the Westminster committee on the Future Relationship with the EU Hilary Benn said Gove’s announcement represents “a series of grace periods”.
Benn said: “It has been reported that food products coming from Great Britian to Northern Ireland will be exempt from export health certificates for a period of at least three months and chilled meats – sausages he referred to – will be allowed for a period of time, pending a review, after which they might be prevented any more from moving to Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
So what is going to happen after those dates, Benn asked. Michael Gove replied:
“We’ve been talking to traders, supermarkets in particular, in order to make sure that they are ready for any health export certificate requirements and we know that some supermarkets are already ready, one or two others need time in order to get ready.
Michael Gove told MPs that the agreement prevents any disruption at the end of the transition period on the movement of chilled meats.
2. Free of alltariffs
Michael Gove said that businesses in Northern Ireland will be free of all tariffs.
He told MPs: “The deal safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK customs territory. As recently as July, the commission had envisaged a default tariff scenario in which, and I quote, ‘all goods brought into Northern Ireland would be considered to be at risk are as such subject to the common customs tariff’.
“As we’ve repeatedly made clear, this could never have been an acceptable outcome. So, I’m pleased to say that under the agreement that we’ve reached, Northern Ireland businesses selling to consumers or using goods in Northern Ireland will be free of all tariffs.
“Whether that’s Nissan cars from Sunderland or lamb from Montgomeryshire, internal UK trade will be protected as we promised whether we have a free trade agreement with the EU or not.”
3. No ‘mini’ EU embassy in the North
Related ReadsBrexit: 'Large gaps' remain after tonight's talks end between Johnson and von der Leyen
Gove also stressed again that the EU will not get a ‘mini embassy’ in Northern Ireland post-Brexit – a bone of contention between the two sides during trade talks.
He told MPs: “There’ll be no Belfast mini embassy or mission, as some in the EU originally sought, and the EU officials will not have any powers to carry out checks themselves.
“There will, instead, be sensible, practical arrangements – co-operation, reciprocal data-sharing – so that both sides can have confidence in these unique arrangements.”
Gove said the package means the Northern Ireland Protocol can be implemented in a “pragmatic and proportionate way” before confirming clauses of the UK Internal Market Bill which would have enabled UK ministers to over-ride the divorce deal would be dropped.
He said: “Having put beyond doubt the primacy of the sovereignty of this place as we leave the EU, we rest safe in the knowledge that such provisions are no longer required.”
Trade talks rumble on
Gove and Šefčovič – co-chairs of the Joint-Committee that is examining how the divorce deal would be implemented – announced the breakthrough on the Protocol as trade talks reached a critical moment this week.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenare to meet for dinner this eveningto discuss trade negotiations.
The protocol is due to come into effect from the start of next year and is set to keep Northern Ireland in line with some EU regulations on the single market to allow an open border and free flow of goods and services across the island.
The debate over the protocol’s implementation has caused acrimony between the two sides, with the EU starting legal action over clauses in the Internal Market Bill which would have overridden parts of the Brexit agreement relating to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But Gove told the Commons today that “such provisions are no longer required” and that they would be removed from the Bill.
He said the accord would spare the region from damaging tariffs that could have hiked supermarket prices, and said there would be no additional red tape applied on businesses in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cabinet-meeting-brexit-5198290-Sep2020/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney is bringing what is described as a “significant paper” on Brexit trade preparations to Cabinet.
Yesterday, there was a fallout after reports that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was planning new legislation that would override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement – the treaty that sealed Britain’s exit from the EU in January.
In a move that could risk collapsing the UK-EU trade talks, Downing Street said new Brexit legislation is necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if Britain is unable to secure a free trade deal with the EU.
The Irish Government conveyed its concerns through its diplomatic and official channels.
Today’s Cabinet meeting is set to be dominated by Brexit.
“We all want to get this completed by the middle of October, so that we can move on and work with businesses to ensure that they are prepared for the new realities of trading between Britain and Ireland and Britain and the EU next year,” said Coveney.
He added that the suggestion that the UK may introduce domestic legislation, which would undermine the commitments made in the withdrawal agreement would be “a very serious breach of trust”.
“I think the British government will be in no doubt as to the Irish government’s position in relation to this story. And I hope they take notice,” he said.

Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she is very concerned about recent developments.
“The message is very clear that the withdrawal agreement has been signed, sealed and delivered, that the Irish protocol is part and parcel of that. And there is no plan B there is no rolling back from that position, and it’s essential that the government is absolutely crystal clear on that.
“We have agreed that there could be no damage to the Good Friday Agreement, that there can be no hardening of the border on the island of Ireland, and Ireland cannot be the collateral damage for this Tory Brexit,” she said.
Coveney will bring the final Brexit preparedness memo to Cabinet tomorrow. This is a cross-government plan involving multiple departments to prepare the country for the end of the transition period and a new way of trading with the UK.
The document will be launched on Wednesday by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Green Party Leader as well as Minister Coveney.
The plan outlines two possible scenarios at the end of this year:
Or:
The plan says that either outcome will involve fundamental change for any business that trades goods “to, from or through” the UK.
The layout of each chapter in the plan concludes with what government is doing and then what an individual business must do to prepare.
Ministers will also discuss at Cabinet the recent controversy over pubs having to keep receipts as proof that food was served with alcohol. Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris will additionally seek Government approval to develop a new 10-year strategy to improve literacy and digital skills among adults.

Thousands of UK websites with the ‘eu’ domain were suspended after the transition period ended at 11pm on 31 December.
ButThe Guardian reportedthat the company has partly registered in Co Waterford in order to retain the ‘.eu’ domain, though its site says it is still registered in Bristol.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, the organisation EURid said:
It said that it is constantly checking the eligibility criteria for ‘.eu’ domains are met, and the same is the case for Leave.EU.
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmondhas writtento Ireland’s communications watchdog ComReg on the issue, and referred it to EURid. It’s understood that the matter is under the EU’s jurisdiction.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-parliament-sunday-breadit-deal-deadline-5303258-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|17 Dec 2020
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT Ursula von der Leyen has said that “substantial progress” has been made on many issues in post-Brexit trade deal negotiations – but “big differences remain” and “bridging them will be very challenging”.
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that negotiations were “now in a serious situation”.
He said that an agreement wouldn’t be reached unless the EU position “changed substantially” – with this understood to be referring to fisheries issues.
“[Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level-playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult.”
The spokesperson said that the EU position on fisheries was “simply not reasonable”, and it needed to “shift significantly” if there is to be a deal.
These statementwas given after the two leaders spoke by phone at 7pm Irish time about the ongoing trade talks ahead of the legal deadline of 31 December for the UK to leave the Single Market and Customs Union.
Earlier, the European Parliament said it will not ratify any post-Brexit trade deal by the end of the year if they cannot access its textby Sunday.
The declaration from the Conference of Presidents, initiated by Spanish member Iratxe Garcia Perez, states they are ready to hold an extraordinary session at the end of December if an agreement is reached by midnight on Sunday 21 December.
It also calls for a provisional text of the Brexit agreement to be made available to European Parliament members as soon as possible.
The declaration acknowledges the “exceptional nature” of the proceedings and commends the “dedicated and professional work” of Brexit negotiators in the UK and EU.
It also welcomes efforts to avoid a no-deal scenario and “the huge negative impact it would have on citizens and businesses”.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was asked on RTÉ’s Prime Time tonight whether there was ‘grandstanding’ by the British side over the state of negotiations.
He said that “there’s always a little bit of brinkmanship, there’s always a certain degree of political theatre” in trade talks.

The European Union’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier said today that good progress had been made in talks, but the “last stumbling blocks remain”.
Barnier has been holding talks with the UK team led by David Frost in an effort to reach a late deal before the current arrangements expire at the end of the year.
He briefed European Parliament leaders this morning about the state of the talks, which he said were in the “final stretch”.
The talks were given the green light to continue on Sunday following a meeting between Johnson and von der Leyen.
But time is running short for a deal to be reached by negotiators, backed by national leaders and then approved by MPs and MEPs.
Meanwhile, in the UK…
MPs have been put on standby to be recalled if a trade deal is secured as they prepare to finish up for Christmas.
UK minister for the cabinet office Michael Gove told MPs: “Intensive talks are ongoing with both negotiating teams working day and night to reach a deal.
“We’re going the extra mile in continuing the negotiations to see whether or not an agreement can be reached and we will continue to keep Parliament informed on our progress.”
He added: “Even if sometimes results are coming later than we might have wanted, I know we will be doing everything in order to secure a good free trade agreement in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.”
Gove said if there is a deal “we will request that the House returns in order to make sure that we can legislate effectively, and we believe we can pass the necessary legislation before 31 December to give businesses legal certainty for the future”.

THE UK AND the EU resumed Brexit talks yesterday evening over dinner between the two chief negotiators, with the two sides still far apart on key issues including fishing rights and competition rules.
The EU’s Michel Barnier sat down with his UK counterpart David Frost in Brussels to kick off a seventh round of talks aimed at forging a deal on relations following the UK’s exit from the bloc.
Officials from the two sides will enter into detailed haggling today and tomorrow before Barnier and Frost meet again on Friday.
The last round of talks, held last month in London, broke up with both sides ruling out a quick deal but voicing hope for agreement in the coming months.
Frost accused Brussels of failing to recognise Britain’s economic and political independence and described the gulf between the sides on some points as “considerable”.

Barnier retorted that the UK’s unwillingness to compromise on its red lines was making a deal unlikely.
Germany’s European affairs minister Michael Roth earlier this month urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to be more “realistic and pragmatic” to break the deadlocked negotiations.
Britain left the EU on 31 January but remains bound by the bloc’s rules until the end of the year pending the outcome of the talks.
If no deal is struck, ties will default to minimum standards set by the World Trade Organization, bringing higher tariffs and making onerous demands on business, which could weaken trade and dampen investment.
Brussels says the UK’s proximity and past membership mean it must abide more closely to EU standards than other nations if it wants open market access.
London counters that it should get the same treatment the EU has given other independent states that signed up to trade deals.
According to reports, British officials see an EU summit planned for October 15-16 as the last moment a deal could be reached with enough time for it to be translated and ratified by the European Parliament.","7.06am, 19 Aug 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-and-united-ireland-5317571-Jan2021/,"YESTERDAY, IN THE UK, a former cabinet minister, Lord Blunkettpredictedthat Brexit would “accelerate the possibility of a united Ireland within the next 25 years”. He’s not the first to turn the spotlight onto that subject, nor will he be the last.
What will the future hold in 2021 for the island of Ireland, in this sense? As the Brexit question has only recently been answered politically, one prevailing issue that brought the Brexit talks to the chasm of the abyss and the eventual breakdown of the talks wasthe status of Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.
As the political and public landscape isincreasingly vestedin the discussion on the possibility of a united Ireland -especially against the background of Brexit- the question is: what are the stakes and the perspectives for the reunification of the island?
To this end, some lessons from theGerman reunificationwill be drawn upon to discuss to highlight the lessons learnt.
Lessons from Germany
As a young German, I remember the reunification of my country as a seven-year-old child. I remember the images of people hugging their relatives and friends. They cried tears of joy after decades of separation.
Shortly after, I made my first best friend at elementary school in 1990 who came from the East. I recall how his mother told me – long after they had moved to the western part of Germany – that there was a certain ‘Sehnsucht’ (yearning) for the reunification, and euphoria and hope were penetrating the political landscape – while others were cautious.

Willy Brandt, Germany’s legendary first social-democratic Chancellor of post-war Germany and former resistance fighter against the Hitler regime, called the reunification of Germany as:‘es wächst zusammen, was zusammen gehört (‘now what belongs together will grow together)’.

The cost of unification
The Chancellor who oversaw the reunification of Germany, Helmut Kohl, promised‘blühende Landschaften (blooming landscapes)’in East Germany.

TheGerman Unification Treatyset the stage for the legal and political changes to follow. It was in fact Germany’s Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Cold War due to the will topolitical comprise by the powerful statesthat had to cast their final vote on the reunification.
Last year, in the midst of the pandemic, Germans ‘celebrated’ the 30th anniversary of German reunification. Fittingly, the German government decidedto endthe so-called Soli-Zuschlag, the solidarity tax in 2021 for the majority of its tax-paying population (a tax, which generated approx. €18.9 billion in 2018; it was first introduced in 1991 to support the financial costs of the German reunification).
Media pundits, academics and politicians attempted to assess and take stock of the shortcomings and achievements of the German reunification, 30 years after. One voice has offered the nuanced and distinct view thatGermany is still an area of two countries: socially, economically and politically; she argues even the civic movements in Germany were elite-driven.
Despite the economic progress in many parts of the eastern part of Germany, one cannot ignore the blind spots.
Many citizens feelabandoned, lacking access to health, infrastructure and employment prospects. They are pessimistic and not convinced in the state’s institutions, while frustration and opinions towards minorities are low.
Exploiting the disenfranchised sentiments, thefar-right AfD’s successin this part of Germany is much higher than in the western part of Germany. The Germans in the eastern part feel likesecond-class citizensin a country that promised to give them blooming landscapes.
Northern Ireland & the legacy of colonialism
So, what are, if any, are the lessons for this island? One commentatorwrites: ‘The 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election showed unionists had lost their majority in Northern Ireland for the first time ever. By the hundredth anniversary of the division of Ireland in 2021, it’s entirely plausible we will have overturned that catastrophe entirely.’
The reality is that the existence of Northern Ireland is not only the remnant of colonialism on the island, it is the Trojan horse of the British Empire. It would go beyond the scope of this article to discuss every facet of the partition of the island in 1921, but the most pressing aspect to stress is that it was not about to happen that theIrish would become “British”, thecommon strategythe British in their various colonial endeavours.
In fact, the Good Friday Agreementstipulatesthat any consent for a united Ireland must be “freely and concurrently given” in both parts of the island. To this end, ‘this is widelyinterpretedto mean that future border polls must be held in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at the same time.’

There are opponents of the reunification of the island of Ireland, and the reasons are manifold. Some fear thefiscal consequences, others political. In fact, arecent pollconducted by Liverpool University and Britain’s Economic and Social Research Council found that a majority of the people in Northern Ireland are against the reunification of the island.
Against this backdrop, there has also been anincrease in paramilitary attacks. However,  economic stagnation, Brexit, a leadership vacuum and also theglobal pandemichave illustrated the need for a coherent and robust response to the challenges the island faces.
Where to from here?
So, quo vadis? As one who has lived seven years in Ireland now, there are concerns to be considered around a renewed conflict in the case of a reunification and a certain ‘Unbehagen’, a discomfort to foot the bill for Northern Ireland which is largely financially sustained by London.
Germany – like the island of Ireland – was a hotspot of violence and tensions. The disenfranchisement of large parts of the populace is still prevalent, while there is the necessity of financial aid to sustain the economy and, last but not least, the engagement of powerful actors who had their role to play in the creating peace.
In the Brexit referendum,an affirmation of false imperial grandeur,the voices of Northern Ireland spoke against ‘Empire’, but for a project of peace. And the European Union, to this end, is thecrucial guarantorof the Good Friday Agreement, a document which foresees populace-led decision-making to find a reflective and self-conscious decision in light of demographic changes.
Eventually it is the populace of the island which deserves its opportunity to make a decision on its own terms to formally end the vestiges of colonialism and decide: that a country can grow together, which was meant to belong together.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has warned against ‘a complacency’ among SMEs about the effect Brexit will have on trade and and the Irish economy.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin Port today, Martin said that whether there is a trade deal or not it will be “the most significant fundamental change in our economic narrative in over 50 years”.
“We will go from customs declarations of about 1.5 million up to about 20 million per annum,” he said, urging Irish exporters to “do you paperwork in advance”.
“You will speed up the process in terms of getting your goods to the market and onto the shelves. Without question there will be a very significant change, notwithstanding whether there’s a deal, or whether there’s a no deal. Even if we have a deal, the implications for businesses and companies will be significant,” he said.
Despite the warning, Martin sounded an optimistic note about the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU.
The Taoiseach said there have been “intensive” engagement for weeks and there is now “texts on all areas”. He added that it remained to be seen whether the text on the outstanding areas could be agreed.
Over 90% of topics have been agreed upon and drafted but three main obstacles have remained as a block to securing a final deal before the deadline:the level playing field, governance, and fisheries.

Martin said this morning that a deal is “in the best interest of the United Kingdom, of Ireland and of the European Union”.
“President von der Leyen did say to EU leaders last Thursday night at our virtual conference meeting that there were texts now on all areas. So I would be hopeful that by the end of this week we could see the outlines of a deal,” he said.
On a disputes mechanism that could be in place following a deal, Martin also said he was confident, noting that there is “a lot more in common between the United Kingdom and Europe than that which divides us.”.
Martin was visiting Dublin Port to inspect the Brexit-related infrastructure in place and said that he observed “tremendous interagency cooperation” at the port.

Trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, being researched and discussed by a separate committee, remain unclear ahead of 31 December when the UK will leave the Brexit transitionary period.
Addressing concerns that Northern Ireland consumers will be left with less choice on shelves and more expensive goods, the Taoiseach said:
“There are issues that people have genuinely raised on the UK side and within Northern Ireland. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister wrote jointly to us in relation to that and however it goes, the discussions on the protocol have gone well and so I would be confident we can resolve those as well.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-protocol-concerns-brexit-northern-ireland-5006052-Feb2020/,"THE IRISH PROTOCOL is expected to add an extra dimension of complexity in Brexit trade talks.
Described as being at the centre of a “very complicated” Venn diagram, Northern Ireland is caught in a Brexit bind – quite literally.
Even though Brexit has officially happened, the UK is still in the Customs Union and Single Market, so it’s still not clear how what the trading relationship for the North will be once they do leave the EU’s free-trade bloc.
When, or if, a customs arrangement is struck as part of the trade talks, Northern Ireland’s devolved government will have to vote on the proposals. If the vote is a simple majority, they’ll have to vote on the arrangements every several years – locking them into a permanent Brexit debate.
Here’s what we do know about the Irish protocol (formerly the backstop).
The Irish Protocol
First, a recap: The first phase of Brexit negotiations were about the UK leaving the EU; the next phase is about its ‘future relationship’ – which includes trade talks, security and data protection.
Although the Irish protocol was contained in the first phase of Brexit talks, what it means practically can only be answered in the second phase. What trading relationship the EU and UK have will massively decide what the Irish protocol needs to do.
The Irish protocol is essentially an agreement that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland as a result of Brexit – but it would only come into effect if trade talks found no other way to avoid a hard border.
Protecting peace in Northern Ireland was one of three red lines of Michel Barnier’s – the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator – during the first phase of Brexit talks, and its inclusion is seen as a diplomatic win by Ireland.
The Backstop
At one stage, the Irish protocol was the backstop. It drew criticism and caused debates over whether it was necessary to be included in the first phase of talks or not – this is because a hard border will be tied closely to what trade deal there will be.
The backstop would have kept Northern Ireland in the EU’s Custom Union. This would have limited the UK’s ability to strike up new trade deals, and Northern Ireland would have had to obey goods regulations and level-playing field provisions.
This would be the arrangement until the EU and UK agreed to a trading arrangement that wouldn’t require a hard border.
There was opposition to this in the House of Commons at the time, so the backstop was made UK-wide. This would mean the whole of the UK would have to abide by the EU’s tariffs with other countries indefinitely, until another arrangement was put in place.
Advertisement
This was then scrapped, in favour of a new version of the Irish Protocol that doesn’t have a name yet (it’s somewhat mockingly referred to as ‘the frontstop’).
The new arrangement
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson renegotiated his predecessor Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement in October 2019 by removing a version of the Irish protocol – nicknamed ‘the backstop’ – and replacing it with a new proposal.
This new protocol is Northern-Ireland specific, and would see Northern Ireland remain in the UK’s customs territory, but aligned with the EU’s Custom Union.
There’s a lot we still don’t know, but in practice it would probably mean there would be a customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
The general idea is that if goods are sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, tariffs would be paid on those goods, but would be rebated to businesses if they proved the goods stayed in Northern Ireland.
If goods are sent from Great Britain through Northern Ireland to Ireland, tariffs will apply as the goods have gone to the EU, but they will be collected at ports and airports along the Irish Sea – effectively enforcing a GB-NI customs border.
Northern Ireland would stay aligned with the EU on some standards to ensure food, animals and permitted industrial goods can more freely across the Irish border.
British authorities would have responsibility for the checks, but the EU has the right to have its officials present too to ensure the application of EU rules.
Concerns and a Stormont vote
An economic expert said that rebated tariffs for Northern Ireland could be worth £500 million a year, which could cripple Northern Ireland’s SME-driven business sector.
Concerns have also been expressed about businesses that would find it hard to prove where its goods end up and ‘remain’, and so might not be rebated appropriately.
The details of the Irish protocol need to be finalised by a specialised committee, based on the rules and regulations agreed to in EU-UK trade negotiations.
When a final proposal is agreed, the Stormont Assembly must vote on it. A simple majority would see the proposal continue for the next four years, or cross-community support would see the Irish protocol in place for eight years.
If the vote fails, the protocol would cease to be applied two years later, giving both sides time to try to come up with a workable alternative.
It’s not just you – it is very confusing

Jean-Francois BADIASJean-Francois BADIAS
This is very confusing, so if you don’t fully understand it – it’s not your fault.
Sylvia de Mars, a Senior Lecturer in Law at Newcastle University has examined the details of the Irish protocol – the various drafts and annexes – for three years and has said that it still doesn’t make sense to her how it would work in practice.
Colin Murray, a reader in Public Law at Newcastle University who works with de Mars, told a UK committee last week that Northern Ireland is “at the centre of a very complicated Venn diagram”.
“The UK has never had to arrange its own internal market,” he added.
He said that since the beginning of devolution rules under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the British government has “piggybacked” on the EU’s Single Market rules “to allow trade flows to be seamless throughout the UK”.
Now, because of Brexit, it’s going to have to pave its own way on how to trade in and out of Northern Ireland, but also free up the UK to strike new non-EU trade deals.
De Mars told the committee that there are over 300 pieces of legislation needed to keep conditions in Northern Ireland as they are – which is just a snapshot of how complicated the Irish protocol will be.
Addressing aHouse of Lords EU Select Committeethis week, de Mars said that she has been looking at drafts of the protocol for “what feels like three years now”.
“There are still aspects of all drafts of the protocol that I can honestly say I do not fully understand how they are going to work in practice and what their implications are. It’s a tremendously complicated piece of legislative work,” she said.
She said that from the EU’s side:
De Mars said that the EU is “agnostic” as to how the UK ensures this would remain as part of Northern Ireland’s law, and suggested it could be enacted through acts of parliament or regulations.
These laws either have to be implemented, or else they are “directly applicable”, meaning the EU regulations have affect in Northern Ireland as if it were a member state.
Where they are affective, citizens in Northern Ireland could go to court anywhere in the United Kingdom and raise cases concerning EU law in Northern Ireland, as enacted under the protocol, de Mars said.
This could be extremely trick as the UK does not want the EU’s Courts of Justice to have jurisdiction over the UK after Brexit.
She added:

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-negotiations-5011123-Feb2020/,"THE UK’S CHIEF Brexit negotiator has insisted that Britain must be able to set laws that suit itself when the country fully breaks away from the EU.
David Frost used a major speech in Brussels yesterday to state that Britain will not accept EU supervision to create a “level playing field”.
The speech came after France warned the two sides would “rip each other apart” in trade talks ahead of the UK’s scheduled exit from a Brexit transition period at the end of this year.
Frost, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Europe adviser, used a lecture to students and academics at the Universite libre de Bruxelles to say: “We bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country.
“It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us – to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.
“That’s also why we will not extend the transition beyond the end of this year.
“At that point we recover our political and economic independence in full – why would we want to postpone it?

“In short, we only want what other independent countries have.”
Frost said the UK is seeking an “open and fair” arrangement with the EU based on free trade agreement (FTA) precedents.
He said: “Boris Johnson’s speech in Greenwich two weeks ago set out a record of consistently high standards of regulation and behaviour in the UK, in many cases better than EU norms or practice.
“How would you feel if the UK demanded that, to protect ourselves, the EU dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in Westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts?
“The reason we expect, for example, open and fair competition provisions based on FTA precedent is not that we want a minimalist outcome on competition laws.
“It is that the model of an FTA and the precedents contained in actual agreed FTAs are the most appropriate ones for the relationship of sovereign entities in highly sensitive areas relating to how their jurisdictions are governed and how their populations give consent to that government.
“So if it is true, as we hear from our friends in the (European) Commission and the 27 (member states), that the EU wants a durable and sustainable relationship in this highly sensitive area, the only way forward is to build on this approach of a relationship of equals.”
The comments came after French foreign minister Jean-Yves le Drian predicted a bruising battle on a post-Brexit deal.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference, he made clear that Brussels will defend its interests when negotiations begin next month.

“I think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations, which we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart,” he said.
“But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests.”
Le Drian, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, is the latest senior EU figure to warn that the negotiations will be difficult.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and chief negotiator Michel Barnier have both cast doubt on Mr Johnson’s aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year when the Brexit transition period runs out.
The EU has repeatedly warned that Britain cannot expect to enjoy continued “high-quality” market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards.
There is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights, with the EU insisting continued access to UK waters must form part of any agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-ursula-von-der-leyen-meeting-brexit-deal-5289467-Dec2020/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will hold emergency talks today as negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal go down to the wire.
With time for an agreement rapidly running out, the two sides’ chief negotiators announced on Friday they were putting the talks on “pause” to allow political leaders to take stock.
In a joint statement following the latest round of negotiations in London, the UK’s Lord Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier said the conditions for an agreement had still not been met.
After months of circling round the same issues, they said “significant divergences” remained over fisheries, the “level playing field” rules on fair competition and the enforcement mechanism for any deal.
While a series of deadlines have come and gone, this weekend is being seen as crucial if there is to be an agreement before the current Brexit transition period comes to an end at the end of the month.
However, the UK side has accused Brussels of trying to introduce “new elements” into the talks at the 11th hour putting the chances of a deal in jeopardy.
They fear Barnier has been coming under pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron, as the leader of a group of nations concerned that he has given too much ground to the UK.
On Friday, France’s Europe minister Charles Beaune publicly warned his country could veto any agreement if they were not happy with the terms.
But in a sign of tensions within the bloc, Taoiesach Micheal Martin complained that some member states had been putting pressure on to gain “additional information”.
He pointedly called for the negotiators to be given the “space” they needed to conclude their discussions.

Johnson and Von der Leyen are expected to speak by telephone on Saturday afternoon.
EU leaders are due to meet on Thursday for a two-day summit in Brussels – their last scheduled gathering of the year – when they could sign-off on any agreement.
Time then has to be found for both Houses of Parliament in the UK and the European parliament to ratify it before the transition period expires.
If there is no agreement the UK will leave the European single market and customs union on 31 December and begin trading with the bloc on World Trade Organisation terms, with the imposition of tariffs and quotas.
Internal Market Bill
In a further complicating factor, the UK Government is bringing the Internal Market Bill back to the House of Commons legislation, enabling it to override elements of Johnson’s “divorce” settlement with Brussels in breach of international law.
On Monday, MPs will vote on whether to overturn amendments by the House of Lords which removed the provisions in the UK Internal Market Bill relating to the Northern Ireland border.
MPs will then go on later in the week to debate the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill which contains further similar provisions.
The legislation has infuriated the EU and – if it is passed – could further sour the mood in the negotiations making a deal harder to reach.
In their statement, Lord Frost and Mr Barnier said: “After one week of intense negotiation in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries.
“On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boy-on-hospital-floor-misinformation-uk-election-4925280-Dec2019/,"CONCERNS HAVE BEEN raised about the impact misinformation could have on the outcome of the UK election.
There is much debate online about the veracity of claims and images being shared in recent days.
One of the central stories in this conversation involves the image of a four-year-old boy lying on the floor of a hospital in Leeds. The photo of Jack Williment-Barr has sparked outrage – but it also provoked claims it was staged.
Many people said Jack’s story was symbolic of the cuts made by the Conservative Party to the health service in recent years. At the same time, a large number of accounts spread the notion that it was misinformation shared to damage the Tories ahead of tomorrow’s election.
https://t.co/zwzzeByjyM— Daniel Sheridan (@DSheridanYEP)December 9, 2019Daniel Sheridan/ Twitter
https://t.co/zwzzeByjyM
When Joe Pike attempted to show Prime Minister Boris Johnson the image on Monday, the Tory leader took the journalist’s phone andput it in his pocket.
Johnson initially refused to talk about it but, when pressed by Pike, took the phone out of his pocket, looked at the image and said: “It’s a terrible, terrible photo. And I apologise obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS.”
The journalist whobroke the story, Daniel Sheridan of the Yorkshire Evening Post, said the image is genuine and noted that the hospital has apologised.
Sheridan said he verified that the image was real before the story was published. He contacted Leeds General Infirmary about the photo, which was sent to him by Jack’s mother Sarah.
Jack was rushed to the hospital by ambulance on 3 December with suspected pneumonia. Sarah claimed that her son was left in a clinical treatment room for over four hours and laid down on a pile of coats on the floor for comfort.
Dr Yvette Oade, Chief Medical Officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, confirmed that Jack’s family hadreceived an apologyafter the incident.
“We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family,” Oade said in a statement.
Sheridan said Sarah had no issue with the treatment Jack was given by the doctors or nurses, but wanted to highlight that the NHS was “in crisis”.
‘I’m a former nurse’
Despite the hospital’s statement, rumours that the image was staged gained traction earlier this week.
Posts with the exact same wording, purported to be written by current or former nurses, claimed that the image was staged. Some of the posts were shared thousands of times on different accounts on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

Some people with large followings on social media – such as Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson (47,500 followers) and former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen (3.9 million followers) – shared the theory that the image was staged, as outlined by Professor Marc Owen Jones and others on Twitter.

Allegedlyhacked
Storyful has traced what appears to be the first Facebook post of this type to a woman in England. The post appeared on her account just after 8pm on Monday and quickly gained traction, being shared hundreds of times.
The original post said “I am a nurse myself” and mentioned a “good friend” at who worked at Leeds General Infirmary. It claimed the boy in the photo “was in fact put there by his mother who then took photos on her mobile phone and then uploaded it to media outlets”.
When contacted by Storyful, the woman claimed her account was hacked and that she didn’t share the post herself, something that has yet to be verified. The woman claims to have received death threats and said she has contacted the police about the situation.
“The woman was incredibly upset by this, she said her account was hacked, she said she has received death threats and contacted the Metropolitan Police – so there’s a human element to it.
“Her view is that her account was hacked and used in a malicious way,” Joe Galvin, Director of News at Storyful, toldTheJournal.ie.He said the woman in question didn’t have a large following and the fact the post “rapidly proliferated” would suggest “a coordinated effort”.
“It grew from that and ended up being shared hundreds of times, possibly over 1,000 times. There’s no evidence of bot accounts, it looks to be predominantly Conservative supporters who were really sharing it as a method of highlighting what they feel is inaccurate.
Galvin noted that in the past the Conservative Party has encouraged supporters to share specific messages on Facebook and other platforms. He said the sharing of posts about the image of young post “probably organic – yes organised, but organic”.
At the time of publication, Facebook had not responded to a request for comment about the alleged hacking or death threats.
The platform has a number of measures in place “to fight the spread of false news” and said it “building new products to curb the spread” of misinformation and “helping people make more informed decisions when they encounter false news”.
Aggressive enforcement
Galvin said dealing with misinformation is a huge challenge – even if a story is debunked, many people who saw posts containing false information won’t see a later clarification and the lie often continues to be shared.
“A piece of misinformation that goes viral is very hard to contain, no amount of debunking will prevent it from being shared – that’s the challenge,” he explained.
According to theReuters Digital News Report (Ireland) 2019, over one-third (37%) of people in Ireland said they use Facebook as a news source and 12% use Twitter for this reason. Six in 10 (61%) people questioned sad they are concerned about what is real and what is fake on the internet.
When asked about how it helps stop misinformation from spreading on its site, a Twitter spokesperson said: “We’re committed to improving the health of the public conversation on our service, particularly during elections.
“To this end, platform manipulation is strictly against the Twitter Rules. We will take aggressive enforcement action if we identify this behaviour on our service.”
The spokesperson added that Twitter has a number of measures in place to ensure a “healthy, open, and safe” online debate about the UK election.
The punch-that-wasn’t
The hospital photo wasn’t the only story making headlines this week in terms of false information being spread.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
On Monday a number of political journalists including the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg and ITV’s Robert Peston tweeted that a Labour activistallegedly punchedan advisor to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, citing Conservative sources.

Both Kuenssberg and Peston later corrected themselves, saying no punch was thrown, but the initial claims had already been shared thousands of times.

Galvin said given how easily false information can spread, regardless of the account from which it originates, it’s “dispiriting” to see respected journalists “who should know better, parroting a party line”.
When rumours of the punch-that-wasn’t started to circulate online, Galvin said Storyful rang West Yorkshire Police who said they were not aware of any such incident taking place. He said journalists always need to be rigorous when verifying a story but that this is particularly true ahead of an election or referendum.
He said, even after the story was debunked, the claim was still being shared on social media and had a “huge impact on the online debate” in recent days.
“It’s dispiriting to see mainstream journalists making such basic errors in their reporting at such a crucial time,” Galvin added.
International influence
Concerns have been raised in recent years about potential international interference in election and referendum campaigns in recent years after US intelligence agencies accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election which saw Donald Trump become president.
Galvin said there hasn’t been much evidence of international interference in the UK election campaign, bar Reddit accounts with links to Russia sharing alleged plans by the Conservative Party to privatise the NHS.
He said it’s “incredibly important” for social media platforms to have measures in place to stop the spread of misinformation, particularly given the impact it could have on the outcome of elections.
However, he said legislation is needed in this area as self-regulation “just doesn’t work”.
Galvin said the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum were likely somewhat influenced by misinformation. He said while the spread of misinformation is also a concern in Ireland, it’s “easier to influence the outcome” of an election or referendum when it’s a simple choice of yes or no, or one person over another.
“[Ireland] should be concerned about it, but I don’t think we’re as under threat as other countries. The PR-STV system offers a little bit more protection, it’s not as easy to undermine it as with a binary yes or no choice.”
A general election is expected to be held in Ireland next year. Galvin said “certainly we should expect to see some level of disinformation at play” during the campaign, but “because we’re a small country at the periphery of Europe, we possibly aren’t seen as a major target like the US or UK” in terms of international interference.
He said the far-right and alt-right are still “fringe” movements in Ireland, but they are growing, noting: “They do have an impact on our discourse, that was writ large during the debate on Direct Provision.”
He said certain accounts with large followings can help the spread of misinformation – something platforms are trying to address but are struggling to keep on top of.
“Platforms are making decisions without a total grasp of where we are. There is a need for Irish and EU law and regulations so platforms can’t have any excuse. As long as platforms have to self-regulate, they will continue to make mistakes, it’s a big challenge.”

Minister Michael Creed raised doubts that a Brexit trade deal can be done within a year but Michael Gove has said he's confident.Rollingnews.ie / SkyRollingnews.ie / Sky / Sky
MICHAEL GOVE SAID he is “confident” of reaching a Brexit trade deal by 2020, despite recent reports of EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier saying this timeframe is “unrealistic”.
In an interview with Sophy Ridge onSky Newsearlier today, the Conservative Cabinet Office minister said trade negotiations between the UK and the EU would be concluded by the end of next year.
“I’m confident that we will be able not just to leave the EU on 31 January, but also to conclude all the details of a new relationship in short order,” Gove said today.
This was flatly contradicted by Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, who told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics it is “wildly beyond credibility that we will conclude a trade agreement in 12 months”.

Creed said the Brexit debate will now focus on the “bread and butter of the economic issues” once it turns to the future trade arrangements.
Singling out Ireland’s fishing communities, the minister said failure to negotiate a trade deal which would result in a hard Brexit would “have a catastrophic impact for us”.
He said it had been made clear to Barnier’s taskforce that the “the outcome on fisheries is inextricably linked with the trade negotiations, not isolated on a silo basis”.
Similarly, Michel Barnier was recently recorded saying the UK’s 11-month timetable to complete trade talks by this date is “unrealistic” and suggests that negotiations will continue until long after.
“We will not get everything done in 11 months. We will do all we can – we won’t do it all,” Barnier said in a recording obtained by theIndependentnewspaper.
Speaking on this, Michael Gove said Simon Coveney, Ireland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, “takes a different view”.

He also said the government will be voting on Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement in a “short time period”, but did not confirm a specific date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-continue-5268351-Nov2020/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Nov 2020
THE UK HAS demanded “realism” from the European Union as crunch talks on a post-Brexit trade deal resumed in Brussels today.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc remains “determined” and “patient” but stressed the need for future competition between the 27 member states and the UK to be fair.
On the UK side, Downing Street said time is “very short” to reach a deal which could be implemented when transition arrangements expire at the end of the year.
Talks on a post-Brexit trading relationship between the UK and European Union continue this week as the clock continues to tick until the end of the transition period.
UK chief negotiator David Frost is in Brussels for another round of negotiations ahead of a European Council video summit on Thursday which has been touted as a deadline for a draft deal.
The UK formally left the European Union in January, but will continue to follow the bloc’s regulations until the end of the year — just over six weeks away.
If no agreement is in place at the end of December, goods travelling between the two areas will be subject to tariffs set out by the World Trade Organisation.
The two sides – led by Barnier and Frost – are now working on draft legal texts, but key parts of the documents have not been agreed.
The issues which are still to be ironed out are thought to include the ongoing row over fishing rights, how any deal between the two parties would be governed, and the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing unfair competition on issues including state subsidies.
Despite some signs of progress – not least the fact that talks are continuing – it is clear that major concessions will be needed if an agreement is to be reached.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said: “The discussions will be based on our largely common draft treaty texts.
“But significant differences do remain and key elements in the draft texts are not yet agreed. What we are working to do is seek solutions that fully respect UK sovereignty.
“Negotiators have been in contact almost every day since October 22 and they are continuing to work intensively to bridge the gaps that remain between us.
“But, although there has been some progress in recent days, there is much work to be done and time is now very short.
“So if we are to make further progress in the coming days, we need to see more realism from the EU on what it means for the UK to be an independent state.”

It came as a new YouGov pollsuggestedthat no region in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, was pro-Brexit.
‘Positive direction’
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland earlier, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the talks in relation to fishing were not in a good place.
“It’s not good, I mean that’s that’s the truth of it I mean the negotiations are not in a good place when it comes to fishing. There hasn’t really been any success in closing the gap between the positions of either side,” he said.
On the British side, Frost had attempted to sound optimistic, saying before today’s meeting that there had been progress in a “positive direction” in recent days.
However, he added the talks may not succeed and reiterated the point made by Boris Johnson that the country must be prepared for a departure with a deal or without.
Deadlines imposed on a future agreement have proven to be soft in the past, with Mr Johnson saying in September: “There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on October 15 if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year.
“If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.”

The mid-October deadline appeared to be scratched at the start of that month, when Downing Street and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed to intensify talks during a video conference call, acknowledging “significant gaps remained” between the UK and Brussels.
Any deal struck would be subject to ratification by EU member states, the European Parliament and the UK Parliament meaning time is tight.
Centre stage
The agenda for Thursday’s meeting of 27 European leaders does not mention Brexit, with the response to the Covid-19 pandemic instead taking centre stage.
But with only one other meeting – between 10-11 December – scheduled before the end date of the transition period, they could be seen as a key moment in the shaping of the UK’s departure.
Coveney yesterday told Sky News that a deal was “doable”.
“I think I would sum it up by saying this is very difficult, but, it’s also very doable.
“And I think the consequences of not getting a trade deal and a future relationship deal … before the end of the year, I think is very significant.”

The European Parliament voted last year in support of a proposal that would put an end to the twice-yearly changing of the clocks to accommodate extra daylight hours.
Under an EU directive, all 27 states currently switch to summer time hours on the last Sunday of March and back to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday of October – a pattern the UK follows.
But under a potential swap by Brussels to a “double summer time” arrangement, a House of Lords committee has warned that the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement could see Northern Ireland legally obliged to be one hour ahead for six months every year.
It would mean the 1.8 million people living in the six counties would follow summer time hours, even when those in Great Britain wind their clocks back by 60 minutes in the autumn.
The Irish government had been opposed to the EU’s proposal last year because at the time it could have resulted in different time zones on the island of Ireland.

However the Brexit deal signed Northern Ireland up to continuing to follow EU rules on goods and agriculture in order to prevent a hard border and Northern Ireland may have to follow suit with the time zone change.
“Were this proposal (for double summer time) to become EU law under its current single market legal basis, Northern Ireland may be obliged under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland to align with the EU and thus institute a time border with Great Britain,” said the Lords’ EU internal market sub-committee in its report, Clock changes: is it time for change?
The group of cross-party peers have called on the Government to “give urgent further consideration” to the impact the Brexit agreement could have if the EU does decide to make the summer time switch permanent – and criticised ministers’ lax approach to what could be a significant change for the UK.
“Our inquiry has demonstrated that any such decision at EU level would have implications for the UK, notwithstanding UK withdrawal from the EU,” wrote the peers.
“The nature and significance of such implications is not, however, well understood – not least by the Government.”
Baroness Donaghy, chair of the committee, said there was also the possibility that Ireland could face a situation where it has different time-zones on either side of the border.
“So far the government has stuck its head in the sand on the EU Commission’s proposal, hoping that it goes away,” she said.
“However, if it doesn’t, we could be caught unaware and unprepared to make a decision, leaving the island of Ireland with two time zones at different times of the year and causing difficulties for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.”

The report, published today praised ministers’ “informal engagement” with counterparts in Northern Ireland on the issue, but pushed for a more detailed review to take place.
Peers recommended reviewing research carried out in countries that have different time zones, and identify the possible implications of time zone changes for both domestic and international businesses.
Business minister Kelly Tolhurst, giving evidence to the committee last year, said: “Anything that would create a time border in Northern Ireland we are completely opposed to, and so is the Irish government.”
The proposal to scrap the bi-annual time-switch across the Continent derived from a citizens’ forum carried out by the EU.
The consultation, undertaken when the UK was still a member, received 4.6 million responses, 84% of which were in favour of abolishing the clock change practise.
But peers noted that the respondents accounted for less than 1% of the EU population, and 70% of those responses came from Germany alone.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-planning-to-legislation-to-prevent-brexit-transition-delays-4936663-Dec2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is to legislate to prevent MPs extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020, government sources have said.
Ministers are understood to have re-worked the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) – due to come before the Commons this week – to “legally prohibit” any further extension.
The move comes as MPs gather at Westminster for the first sitting of the new parliament today following last week’s general election.
The Tories return in buoyant mood after Johnson was swept to an unexpected 80-seat majority as a swathe of Labour strongholds fell to the Tories.
Under current plans, the government intends to end Britain’s EU membership on 31 January, with an implementation to run to the end of 2020 while it negotiates a free trade agreement with Brussels.
However key EU figures – including chief negotiator Michel Barnier – have expressedskepticisma deal can be agreed in time, raising the fresh prospect of a no-deal break unless there is an extension.

A No 10 source said: “Last week the public voted for a government that would get Brexit done and move this country forward – and that’s exactly what we intend to do starting this week.
“Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new Withdrawal Agreement Bill will legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension,” the source said.
The prime minister repeatedly promised during the election campaign that he would not seek any extension to the transition period.
The commitment was instrumental in persuading Nigel Farage not to stand Brexit Party candidates in Conservative-held seats.
However, after Johnson was returned with an unexpectedly large majority, there was speculation he could use his strengthened position to seek an extension if more time was needed to get a trade deal.
The latest move would appear to have put paid to that.
The WAB is due to be brought before the Commons on Friday – and could receive its first reading and be voted on at second reading in one day, if the Speaker agrees.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We plan to start the process before Christmas and will do so in the proper constitutional way in discussion with the Speaker.”

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been accused of showing “two fingers to democracy” after announcing Nicky Morgan will carry on as culture secretary, despite her quitting the Commons at the general election.
No 10 said the former MP for Loughborough would be made a life peer and would answer questions in the House of Lords.
There were signs that her appointment may only be temporary pending a full-scale Cabinet reshuffle expected in February.
However, it still drew a furious response from opposition MPs, with former shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant saying it “stinks”.
“You abandon your constituents, eschew the tough work of representing a constituency but remain in the Cabinet. That really is two fingers up to democracy,” he said.
The first business of the new House of Commons will be the election of the Speaker – with the return of Sir Lindsay Hoyle expected to be a formality.
The rest of today and tomorrow will be taken up with the swearing in of MPs, ahead of the State Opening and Queen’s Speech, setting out the Government’s legislative programme on Thursday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-mps-election-4865943-Oct2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has announced he will push for a general election on 12 December if the EU, as expected, grants an extension to the Brexit process.
He said this evening he wanted “to be reasonable with parliament” and that they could have more time to scrutinise the Brexit legislation if they submitted to a December general election.
It comes amid signs the EU is set to grant a fresh Brexit delay until the end of January after Johnson was forced – under the terms of the so-called Benn Act – to request a further extension at the weekend.
The Prime Minister told the BBC: “I’m afraid it looks as though our EU friends are going to respond to Parliament’s request by having an extension, which I really don’t want at all.
“So, the way to get this done, the way to get Brexit done, is, I think, to be reasonable with Parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal they can have it but they have to agree to a general election on December 12.”

In a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this evening, Johnson wrote: “If the EU offers the delay that Parliament has requested – that is, we must stay in until 31 January – then it is clear that there must be an election. We cannot risk further paralysis.
“This would mean that Parliament would dissolve just after midnight on 6 November.”

Johnson added if Parliament refuses to “take this chance and fails to ratify by the end of 6 November, as I fear it will, then the issue will have to be resolved by a new Parliament”.
The Prime Minister claimed an election on 12 December “will allow a new Parliament and government to be in place by Christmas”.
Johnson doesn’t have unilateral power to call an election, as he needs the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons, or at least 434 MPs. This is a requirement set out under the UK’s Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.

There would also need to be 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament following such a vote, and polling day, which is usually held on a Thursday.
In his letter to Corbyn, Johnson said that if he wins a majority in the election, government will “ratify the great new deal” that he has negotiated, “get Brexit done in January and the country will move on”.
“It is time for MPs finally to take responsibility. More people voted leave in 2016 than have ever voted for anything. Parliament promised to respect the referendum result. But Parliament has repeatedly avoided doing this,” Johnson said.
Since becoming Prime Minister, Johnson has already tried to call a general election, and although he won a majority, he failed to get the required two-thirds support.
This evening, MPs voted to pass the Queen’s Speech, which is Boris Johnson’s legislative agenda, by 310 votes to 298 – a majority of 16.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-talks-5216591-Sep2020/,"THE FINAL SCHEDULED round of post-Brexit trade talks begin today, with negotiators from the British and EU sides meeting in Brussels to try to hammer out the final details of a plan to get the bare bones of a trade deal agreed before the end of next month.
The schedule for talks this weekshows that the three main obstacles are still taking up the most time in negotiations: the level-playing field, governance issues and fisheries.
“There were small advances after the 6th or 7th Round, but still the ideological is absolutely at odds with what was agreed in the political declaration and that’s still a massive concern and it doesn’t seem to be shifting,” Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said.
Other topics to be discussed this week include energy, trade in goods and services, and law enforcement and judicial cooperation.
On the controversial Internal Market Bill, which threatens to overwrite elements of the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland, Neale Richmond refereed to a comparison of a “loaded revolver” on the negotiation table.
The UK had originally argued that the Bill protects the peace process in Northern Ireland. But after the Irish government came out to refute that claim, the UK government is arguing that it is only a last resort if the EU doesn’t act in good faith.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson argues it will provide a “safety net” against what he claimed are EU threats to impose tariffs on UK internal trade, and carry out customs checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (what Johnson calls a blockade).
Although the EU wants all three offending Clauses in the Bill removed by tomorrow, Richmond says that this hasn’t changed ongoing trade negotiations, which will continue all this week.
But he added that the EU will pursue “all legal options” if needs be.
Senior British minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič met in London yesterday as part of the Joint Implementation Committee – a group that aims to implement the Withdrawal Agreement.

European CommissionEuropean Commission
At a press conference following this meeting, Šefčovič said that “the window of opportunity” to put in place the operational measures needed for the Northern Ireland protocol to function “is rapidly closing”.
He said that the protocol on Northern Ireland is so important that the protocol – which it aims to protect – has been enshrined in international law.
“Northern Ireland shouldn’t be any chip in any negotiations between the EU and the UK,” he stressed.
Šefčovič said that the committee would reconvene either in the first or second week of October, but also expressed a wish that they would “pave the way” for another meeting by mid-October.
Among the outstanding issues that committee faces is deciding what goods can move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland without “risk” of moving to the EU, and so won’t have to face customs duties; what fishing products caught by Northern vessels will be exempt from EU duties; and what maximum level of support for Northern Ireland farmers can be given before being subjected to EU subsidy control.
This morning,RTÉ reportsthat the arrangement proposed by the European Commission in July was that EU goods with a higher tariff than UK goods will be most at risk, whereas goods with a lower tariff differential will be deemed at less risk of smuggling.
But RTÉ also reports that the UK is to propose another domestic bill which would give the UK unilateral control to decide what GB-to-NI goods face tariffs.
The European Council meeting will take place on 15-16 October, the date by which British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested some sort of trade agreement would have to be reached or else negotiations would end.
The European Union has insisted that trade negotiations could continue until the end of the month.
Richmond said that Brexit is “back on the agenda” at the European Council “for the first time in a long time, which is reflective of the difficult few weeks” we’ve had.

Thebill statedthat the US Congress “greatly values” the relationship shared between the US, the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
It said a trade deal between the UK and the US is based on the condition to preserve the peace agreement.

“The signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 was a momentous achievement that marked the official end of the Troubles,” Congressman Suozzi said. “But recent events have created uncertainty and put the agreement at risk.
“The uncertainty created by Brexit have led to fears of instability and even the introduction of a hard border.
“Next week the people of the United Kingdom will go to the polls in a crucial election which will determine the outcome of Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-eu-5234363-Oct2020/,"LAST UPDATE|15 Oct 2020
EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE demanded Britain give ground on far trade rules to unblock stalled post-Brexit negotiations, angering London and putting the fate of the talks in jeopardy.
The 27 bloc leaders arrived for a summit in Brussels expressing cautious optimism but, in their written conclusions, urged the EU and its member states to step up preparations for a chaotic “no deal” exit.
Their calls for urgency were balanced however by an invitation that Britain keep talking next week in London and in Brussels the week after that.
“As of tomorrow I will be speaking with my counterpart David Frost. On Monday, we’ll be in London for the full week, including the weekend if necessary,” the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said after addressing the leaders.
“That’s what I have proposed to the British team,” Barnier said.
The invite comes after a warning by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he could walk away from the negotiations unless the results of the summit pointed to a breakthrough.
The EU never recognised his deadline and in their conclusions put the onus on Johnson to rescue a deal as time runs out.
In an unusually testy tweet, the UK’s Frost said he was “disappointed” by the summit conclusions, underlining that they “no longer committed to working ‘intensively’ to reach a future partnership” as had been earlier promised.
Frost also scoffed at the EU’s charge that only Britain should budge, calling it “an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation”.
Johnson would decide his next move on Friday, he said.

‘Good compromise’
Tempers flared despite signals that the Europeans seemed to open to moving on one of their hard-held red lines, fishing.
President Emmanuel Macron of France hinted at possible compromise on the thorny issue of fishing rights, saying he was open to finding a “good compromise” that would ensure access for French fishermen to UK waters.
The insistence of France and other northern fishing nations on maintaining access to British waters has been a key stumbling block in the talks so far.
“We know that we will have to make an effort. This effort must be reasonable,” Barnier said.
Arriving at the summing this morning, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Brexit is a chief concern in the talks and that fisheries if of particular importance for Ireland.
“I’m looking forward to an assessment by Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator in relation to the state of play of those talks right now,” he said.
The European leaders have tried to keep Brexit off the agenda at their recent summits but, in a sign that the topic was heating up, were ordered to leave their phones out of the room during the discussion.
The official statement offers little to Johnson, dropping the line in an earlier draft that called for Barnier to “intensify” his discussions with Frost.
During the call to Johnson on the eve of the crunch talks, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen warned that there was “still a lot of work ahead of us”, adding that Brussels wants a deal but “not at any price”.
In a surprising twist, as the summit got under way she was forced to leave the venue and self-isolate after a member of her office tested positive for coronavirus.

‘Approaching the runway’
Barnier said the talks could go on until the end of the October, the rough date set by the EU side in order to leave enough parliamentary time to ratify the deal before the Brexit transition expires on 31 December.
But the British side has accused Brussels of trying to force concessions by running down the clock.
Diplomats in recent days said there had been some movement from Britain, but not enough to warrant locking the negotiators into a so-called “diplomatic tunnel” to force the talks over the finish line.
Rules of fair competition
Britain left the European Union on 31 January, but Barnier and Frost have been locked in moths of inconclusive talks on a follow-on trade arrangement.
If no deal is reached, trade rules will revert to the bare bones of World Trade Organization regulations.
Both sides insist they are ready for this – and would prefer it to having to accept a bad deal – but experts forecast severe economic disruption.
Europe’s three main concerns are agreeing on the rules of fair competition, how these rules will be policed and securing access to UK waters for EU fishing fleets.
Britain wants to reassert sovereignty over its waters and refuse EU legal oversight over the deal – insisting it wants a simple trade deal of the kind the EU signed with Canada.
Brussels in turn stresses that Britain’s economy is far more integrated with and closer to the EU’s than Canada’s, and that its single market must be protected from British backsliding.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-qnas-after-31-december-5250160-Oct2020/,"AS WE APPROACH the end of the transition period that was to prepare people for Brexit Part II, or the UK’s exit from the EU’s Single Market and the Customs Union, there are a few changes that are worth highlighting.
Last week,we took a general overviewof how Brexit ‘in practice’ would change things in Ireland: in short, it will mean a increased checks at ports and airports, new customs procedures for importers and exports, and additional costs when buying from the UK.
We had a few questions in from readers about what Brexit will mean for them, so here’s our attempt to answer some of them (we’re still working on answers for other queries).
I’m moving to the UK next year – will it be more difficult?
Irish citizens can continue to travel to the UK because of Common Travel Area rights and privileges, which pre-date Ireland and the UK’s membership of the European Union.
This is the same for British citizens moving here: both can continue to live, work, study and access services, including health and education services, as is the case now.
There are additional hurdles for other EU citizens arriving in the UK, however. The UK is introducinga points-based immigration systemfrom 1 January 2021.
Will Britishprofessional qualificationsbe recognised in Ireland?
Advertisement
PAPA
Existing EU professional qualificationswill continue to be recognisedin the UK, and likewise, existing UK qualifications will continue to be recognised in the EU.
This ‘grandfathering’ measure is contained in the Withdrawal Agreement.
But – any person applying to have their qualification recognised for the first time from 1 January 2021 will no longer be covered by the EU’s Professional Qualifications Directive.
The recognition ofnewUK qualifications in Ireland and the rest of the EU, and vice-versa, will be possible after 31 December, but will be based on national rules and processes “and will be more complex”, according to the Irish government.
On rules of origin for Northern Ireland
The Department of Foreign Affairs has emphasised that after 31 December, UK products and materials (this includes Northern Ireland goods) will no longer be considered as “of EU origin” for the purposes of international trade.
This could prove particularly difficult for farmers and producers of agri-foods on the island of Ireland, which operate on an all-island basis, dairy farmers in particular.
Though Northern Irish goods will continue to circulate freely in the EU Single Market, as Northern Ireland will abide by the rules of the EU’s Customs Code while remaining part of the UK’s customs territory.
When exporting outside of the EU, Northern Irish goods are considered ‘UK goods’ for the purposes of ‘rules of origin’ requirements.
On safety certs
From 1 January 2021, British regulators or ‘notified bodies’ will no longer be allowed to certify products as being compliant with EU rules and standards in respect of specific regulatory controls, public safety and health.
Related ReadsBrexit is coming: Here's what will change after 31 December 2020
This means that British notified bodies giving a safety approval on a product will now mean something different than the EU’s (though it’s possible the UK will maintain the same standards as the EU in most cases).
What are my consumer rights?
EU consumer protection legislation may no longer apply to items bought from the UK, meaning you may no longer be able to return a product after 14 days.
The advice is to check the terms and conditions on the website of a British retailer before purchasing.
A quick note on: The UK landbridge
Irish hauliers will be permitted to transport goodsthroughthe UK without undergoing full customs import and export formalities – whether that’s possible to do without getting stuck in a traffic jam is another question entirely.
But there will be new requirements (including new paperwork) and the need for each consignment to have a financial guarantee in place to cover the potential customs duties and other taxes at risk during the movement.
Hauliers have also been reminded by the Department of Foreign Affairs to be aware of the UK’s Border Operating Model.

“Securing these contracts ensures that irrespective of the outcome of the negotiations, life-saving medical supplies and other critical goods can continue to enter the UK from the moment we leave the EU.”

NIGEL FARAGE, THE Ozymandias of Britain, strutted around the stage flinging patriotic platitudes into the crowd with a gusto reminiscent of his buddy Donald Trump flinging paper towels to the stricken in Puerto Rico.
Just before the countdown to the UK’s sundering from the European Union kicked off, he informed his audience that it was the ”most significant moment in modern British history”.
The last surviving fighter pilot from the Battle of Britain had died the previous day, otherwise he would surely have begged to differ.
Undaunted, Farage concluded with a triumphant blare. “The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy!”
The hundreds of die-hard Brexiteers at the front of the stage all cheered and waved their union flags. Those at the far side of Parliament Square weren’t so lucky – the sound was dire and all that reached them was muffled shouty fragments.
A few roared in vain: “Turn it up Nigel!”

But most didn’t mind – he wasn’t saying anything they hadn’t heard before, and they were only there for the promised mega-party.
Except alas, there was none of the fun stuff – bands, fireworks and comedians which had been exultantly promised by the gurning Ground Zero of Brexit for the farewell knees-up.
The first two are prohibited on Parliament Square apart from a couple of annual exceptions, and there wasn’t a comedian in sight onstage. Jokers a-plenty to be sure, but then for many Brexit is no laughing matter.
Not for the first time in the last four years, London was a divided city. In June 2016 it had been an oasis of Remain amid a sea of Leave. And now once more the chasm yawned open in the heart of the capital.
For the most part, it all looked normal the city as a cloud-shrouded sun invisibly rose over London on Brexit Day. Union flags fluttered half-heartedly like a royal wave from a carriage along Pall Mall and atop public buildings. Around the streets of Soho, Oxford Circus and Covent Garden, it was business as usual, with locals weaving fast paths through crowds of wandering tourists and traffic dog-fights at every junction.
Only at the end of the broad boulevard of Whitehall which sweeps past 10 Downing Street and down to the Houses of Parliament was evidence that it was a day with a difference. From mid-afternoon a small group of Brexiteers festooned with flags and waving homemade banners proclaiming ‘FREE FROM EU’ and “EU NO MORE’ were kept entertained by a disc jockey on a small flatbed truck.
All strictly English bands of course: Madness, The Kinks, The Beatles, Oasis, The Jam.
Sheila Johnson – “no relation to Boris, sadly” – had travelled from Devon with some friends. “We wanted to be here when we took back our sovereignty, it’ll be something to tell our kids,” she said.
“We won’t be kicked around by the EU ever again.”
So what did she see in Britain’s future?
“More money, more jobs, less illegal foreigners.”

Down on a muddy square, an entertainer in a gold jacket was unsuccessfully channelling the spirit of Elvis and doing his best to lead a few people in a chorus of ‘Rule Britannia’, while a chap in a Boris wig and baggy suit capered for the cavalcade of cameras in search of a bit of colour.
There was a brief spike in patriotic fever when a Mini sped by hooting, a blue-and-yellow EU flag fluttering from the window, leaving in its wake a bitter torrent of invective.
But it was all a bit flat. The statue of Winston Churchill, surrounded by flags, wore a disgruntled expression. Perhaps he was contemplating the Brexiteers’ definition of ‘freedom’.
Maybe it needed the magic of darkness to fully bring the dream alive. After all, Brexit’s big moment suddenly had to compete for media and public attention with the arrival of the coronavirus to the country which has the bloody cheek to be no respecter of borders.
By 10pm, Parliament Square was full, but it was far from overflowing with the tens of thousands which had been touted to turn up to welcome the UK’s brave new dawn.
Nor were the portents of a mega-party particularly promising; an unenthusiastic light display of red, white and blue flickered languidly along buildings outside 10 Downing Street.
And where was Boris Johnson, lover of the spotlight and hooley aficionado? He was inside his residence hosting a soiree and reportedly marking the occasion with a flute of English sparkling white wine – none of those surrender bubbles, by God.
He didn’t even pop over the parapet with a live televised address to the nation, and instead released a speech on social media which gingerly walked the tightrope between rhetoric and reality.
“When I look at the potential of this country waiting to be unleashed I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success,” he boomed, before adding the small-print terms and conditions: “And whatever the bumps in the road ahead I know that we will succeed.”
The prime minister himself was bumped off the top of the tv coverage by the arrival onstage of Nigel Farage.

Never mind that it was a crappy sound system, and a crowd containing a fair few pissed-up hard boys longing for the hey-day of football rumbles, shouting “YEW CAN STICK YOUR FACKING EU UP YOUR ARSE” while trying to out-stare the phalanxes of vigilant police patrolling the area.
Never mind that the UK was exiting the EU at 11pm GMT, which is midnight in Brussels. Nevermind that it was a less-than stellar line-up which had all the vibes of an end-of-pier talent show.
Never mind that Big Ben couldn’t bong as it was enshrouded by scaffolding. Sure didn’t they have a cardboard ‘Little Ben’ affixed with a clanging ‘Liberty’ bell and union flags, fashioned Blue Peter style by a Brexiteer and trundled through the crowd.
Never mind that the whole show was taking place against the Palace of Westminster, much of it also covered in tarpaulin for its £4 billion restoration to save the iconic edifice from crumbling into the Thames.
Never mind that almost half of the UK wasn’t having a good night, but was mourning the estrangement from their EU family and harbouring fears of what might lie ahead.
Never mind that despite the jubilation in Parliament Square and elsewhere in the UK, Brexit isn’t done, not by a long chalk.
Never mind that despite Boris Johnson’s honeyed words of healing, deep bitterness didn’t dissipate at 11pm last night. Under the singing of ‘Rule Britannia’ – with the lyrics helpfully provided on the big screen – there was a nasty edge to the celebrations – joy shot through with jingoism.
“Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before,” exulted Nigel Farage.
The clock struck 11pm. Everyone cheered and sang a raggedy national anthem. And then everyone went home.
This is how empires end. Not with a bang but with a last burst of delusion and a long drawn-out profoundly sorrowful sigh.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-legislation-to-override-brexit-agreement-5197512-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|7 Sep 2020
OVERRIDING ELEMENTS OF the Brexit withdrawal deal would amount to a serious betrayal of an international treaty, Northern Ireland’s pro-Remain parties have warned.
Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance Party and Green Party NI have voiced concern at the prospect of the UK government introducing domestic legislation to supersede parts of the deal’s Northern Ireland protocol governing state aid and customs arrangements.
In response to a Financial Times report outlining Boris Johnson’s apparent intention, the parties have written a joint letter to the government and the EU demanding that the terms of the treaty are honoured.
Under the protocol negotiated in the withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland will continue to follow single market rules for goods and administer the EU’s customs code at its ports.

Downing Street today said new Brexit legislation is necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if Britain is unable to secure a free trade deal with the EU.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the government was proposing “limited clarifications” to the law to ensure ministers can preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement in the event of no deal.
The Internal Market Bill – to be tabled on Wednesday – will ensure goods from Northern Ireland continue to have unfettered access to the UK market while making clear EU state aid rules – which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland – will not apply in the rest of the UK.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said a certain amount of “sabre-rattling” is to be expected as Brexit trade negotiations are ongoing.
In reports a government spokesman appeared to confirm, the Financial Times said Boris Johnson was planning new legislation that would override key parts of the agreement – the treaty that sealed Britain’s exit from the EU in January – in a move that could risk collapsing the UK-EU trade talks.
The prime minister is expected to say today that collapsing the trade talks, should there be no agreement by the 15 October European Council, would still be a “good outcome for the UK”.
Johnson is expected to say: “We are now entering the final phase of our negotiations with the EU.
“The EU have been very clear about the timetable. I am too. There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on October 15 if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year.
In addition, an amendment to the UK’s Finance Bill will give ministers the power to designate which goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are considered “at risk” of entering the EU single market and are therefore liable to EU tariffs.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said discussions were continuing with the EU to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border with the Republic once the transition is over.
He said the legislative changes were a necessary “safety net” in the event that they were unable to come to an agreement.
“As a responsible Government, we cannot allow the peace process or the UK’s internal market to inadvertently be compromised by unintended consequences of the protocol,” the spokesman said.
“So we are taking limited and reasonable steps to clarify specific elements of the Northern Ireland protocol in domestic law to remove any ambiguity and to ensure the Government is always able to deliver on its commitments to the people of Northern Ireland.”
A UK official added: “If we don’t take these steps we face the prospect of legal confusion at the end of the year and potentially extremely damaging defaults, including tariffs on goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland.”
However, speaking to reporters in Dublin today, Varadkar said the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement is an international agreement and trumps any domestic legislation.
He said international agreements must be honoured.
A hard border on the island of Ireland “is something we all want to avoid”, said thee Tánaiste.
Varadkar said he “can’t speak for the British government or speculate on their motivations”. He said he is keen for an agreement to be reached by the end of the year.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she is very concerned about recent developments.
“The message is very clear that the withdrawal agreement has been signed, sealed and delivered, that the Irish protocol is part and parcel of that. And there is no plan B there is no rolling back from that position, and it’s essential that the government is absolutely crystal clear on that.
“We have agreed that there could be no damage to the Good Friday Agreement that there can be no hardening of the border on the island of Ireland and Ireland cannot be the collateral damage for this Tory Brexit,” she said.

‘Let’s get on with it!’
Ursula von der Leyen, who is President of the European Commission, the highest position within the EU’s institutions,saidin respose:
French President Emmanuel Macrontweetedsaying he had held a “very good discussion” with Boris Johnson on subjects including Brexit and steps to tackle migration across the English Channel.
He wrote: “We will step up our co-operation against migrant smugglers. We discussed steps to take following the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the situation in Lebanon and the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney described the EC president’s words as “clear and important”.
Reacting to the news also, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said that the Brexit terms that Britain agreed to before formally exiting the European Union “must be respected”.
“The important thing for me is what the prime minister says and does, and what the British government itself says and does,” Barnier told France Inter radio.
Former chancellor Philip Hammond has claimed that overriding the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with any UK legislation would be “an incredibly dangerous step”.
Hetweeted: “Let’s be clear on two points: 1) Leaving without a deal would not be a ‘good outcome for the UK’; nor would it be the outcome Boris and the Brexiteers promised.”
He added: “2) The UK is a rule-of-law state, and attempting to legislate domestically to override international law would be an incredibly dangerous step and bound to lead to conflict with the judiciary. It would also hugely damage our standing on the world stage.”
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaidthe move would constitute a repudiation by the UK government of a treaty “freely negotiated by it” and which was described as “oven ready” by Johnson.
“This will significantly increase likelihood of no deal, and the resulting damage to the economy will be entirely Tory inflicted. What charlatans.”
Coveney said the reported development would be “a very unwise way to proceed”.
The German ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis,gave a calmer reaction to the news:
The pre-briefed words from Johnson arrived as the Financial Times reported sections of the Internal Market Bill, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to “eliminate” the legal force of the Withdrawal Agreement in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs.
As part of the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the region is expected to continue to follow some EU rules after the transition period ends in 2021 to ensure there is no hard border.
Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrewssaidthat he raised this issue “on a number of occasions” last week in the European Parliament.
“If the British Government thinks that reneging on international treaty obligations makes them look more attractive to third countries for trade deals, then I worry for us all,” Andrews’ FF MEP colleague Billy Kelleher said.
‘Undermine the Good Friday Agreement’
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the government would be undermining the Good Friday Agreement, risking the future of the UK and destroying its own credibility on the world stage if it proceeded with one of the most “reckless” acts concerning Ireland by a British government “in a long long time”.
“It’s absolutely astonishing that any government who says they want to go and do trade deals around the world would just rip up an agreement that they made a few months ago with the European Union,” Eastwood told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour.
“And what they would be doing in that would be undermining the Good Friday Agreement which is an agreement voted for by the vast majority of people on the island of Ireland, they’d be risking a hard border in our country and they’d be threatening the peace and security that we’ve built up over decades.
“It would be the most reckless act that a British government, and they’ve made many reckless acts in Ireland … in a long, long time and if they do this their international credibility I think would be shot to pieces.”
Eastwood said he hoped the reported manoeuvrings by the UK government were “just posturing, because if they try to do this at the same time as trying to convince people in Scotland and Northern Ireland about the future of their Union, well they may as well forget about that as well, because people here will see this as a tremendous act of bad faith”.
Shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Labour MP Louise Haigh, said: “It beggars belief that the Government is – yet again – playing a dangerous game in Northern Ireland and sacrificing our international standing at the altar of the Prime Minister’s incompetence.”
The suggested move, along with Johnson’s comments about no-deal, is likely to pile the pressure on as negotiators prepare to meet tomorrow for another round of crunch talks in London.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-rules-of-origin-trade-5321296-Jan2021/,"
BUSINESSES IN BRITAIN are quickly discovering that many of them must now pay duties on exports bound for the European Union, despite the Brexit free trade deal clinched over Christmas.
The development is part of trade disruption that has become increasingly evident this year after Britain’s Brexit divorce was finalised on 31 December.
Trade has also been badly hampered by new Covid-19 border restrictions, with the roll-out of testing for lorry drivers as Britain races to curb a rampant variant of the deadly virus.
At the heart of the Brexit deal, which came into force on 1 January, is the so-called “rules of origin” condition applied to all goods crossing the border.
The rules of origin, a key aspect of all major trade deals, can rapidly turn into a costly headache for businesses.
Under the Brexit provision, any good will be subject to a customs levy if it arrives in Britain from abroad and is then exported back into the European Union.
For example, if a British clothing retailer imports Chinese-made textiles, then it would then have to pay a customs charge if it re-exports the items into a member nation of the EU’s single market and customs union.
Put simply, the rules therefore determine whether an export is considered British or not.
“It is clear that many UK businesses exporting to the EU are going to be hit by tariffs,” said Michelle Dale, senior manager at the Manchester office of chartered accountants UHY Hacker Young.
“Businesses have also been completely blindsided by the ‘rule of origin’ part of the deal, which leaves them at a major competitive disadvantage when selling in the EU.
“Unfortunately, not enough was done to prepare them for this. It takes years to build an effective supply chain — and using non-EU suppliers is often the best option both in terms of cost and quality.”

The Brexit agreement, which was sealed four and a half years after Britons voted to leave the European Union, grants zero customs duties if at least roughly 50 percent of an exported product is made in the UK.
That applies to the majority of UK exports — but certainly not all of them.
And the provision is all the more important because the EU accounts for more than half of Britain’s trade.
The London-based Institute of Government think tank argues however that the complexity of supply chains means that proof of origin can be difficult for businesses to ascertain — and hard for authorities to assess.
A raft of British retailers are reportedly rushing to assess the impact of critical deliveries to EU nations, including London’s top-end department store Fortnum and Mason.
Collapsed UK high-street department store Debenhams has already shut its online website in Ireland due to uncertainty over post-Brexit trade rules.
“At least 50 of our members face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU,” said William Bain, trade policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium industry organisation.
“We are working with members on short-term options and are seeking dialogue with the (UK) government and the EU on longer-term solutions to mitigate the effects of new tariffs,” he added.
High-street retail giant Marks & Spencer warned Friday that the trade deal would “significantly impact” business in the Czech Republic, Ireland and France.
The deal however removes tariffs for Britain’s largely foreign-owned carmaking industry, which avoids customs duties for cars manufactured with components made abroad.
Nissan has welcomed the agreement but has not yet indicated what will happen to the Japanese carmaker’s largest plant in Europe which is based in Sunderland, northeast England. It had previously warned that a no-deal departure would threaten the factory’s future.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government has yet to comment on the precise impact of the rules of origin on the business community in Britain.
“We continue to work closely with businesses to help them to adapt to any new trading requirements,” a government spokesman told AFP.","12.50pm, 10 Jan 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-ireland-meat-ban-5276890-Nov2020/,"AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHARLIE McConalogue has said his department is working closely with European Commission representatives to avoid the possibility of a ban on certain meat products between Ireland and the UK.
McConalogue’s comments come following reports that the UK and the EU are engaging in last-minute talks to prevent a ‘two-way ban’ on certain meat products between the UK and the island of Ireland.
RTÉ reportsthat the UK intends to replicate the EU’s food safety regime which restricts meat products from outside the union. The UK’s reciprocal ban would prohibit such products from entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
Speaking toMorning Ireland, McConalogue said the issue is concerning but very much reflective of Brexit.
“Obviously it is something which is concerning, it’s a reflection of the many issues which Brexit is causing,” he said.
“Also, the fact that we haven’t had an agreed trade deal yet and discussions are still ongoing despite the intention and the hope that this would have been resolved previously. This emphasises the importance of a deal being finalised promptly.
“Obviously there’s going to be significant work then required in the weeks ahead as well to ensure that the trade is as smooth, and as efficient as possible on the first of January.”

At 11pm on 31 December, Brexit in practice will kick in and the UK will be leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market, which will have a huge impact on people and business owners in Ireland who send goods to, from or through the UK.
This will mean that the EU – and by extension, Ireland – will treat Great Britain as a ‘third country’ for the purposes of trade.
Regardless of whether there is a trade deal done by then, McConalogue said documentation will have to be in place for all exports going to Britain, varying across a range of different products.
Speaking yesterday, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said there has been “intensive” engagement for weeks and there are now “texts on all areas”. He added that it remained to be seen whether the text on the outstanding areas could be agreed.
Over 90% of topics have been agreed upon and drafted but three main obstacles have remained as a block to securing a final deal before the deadline:the level playing field, governance, and fisheries.
Martin said that a deal is “in the best interest of the United Kingdom, of Ireland and of the European Union”.
Trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, being researched and discussed by a separate committee, remain unclear ahead of 31 December when the UK will leave the Brexit transitionary period.
Addressing concerns that Northern Ireland consumers will be left with less choice on shelves and more expensive goods, the Taoiseach said:
“There are issues that people have genuinely raised on the UK side and within Northern Ireland. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister wrote jointly to us in relation to that and however it goes, the discussions on the protocol have gone well and so I would be confident we can resolve those as well.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-headlines-summary-4899347-Dec2019/,"A LOT HAS happened in the past 12 months when it comes to Brexit.
We’ve seen a UK prime minister come and go. We’ve watched a general election on the other side of the Irish Sea. A new speaker in the House of Commons. Endless debate and negotiations.
However, in many ways not a lot has really changed in the past year either.
The UK isstillin the EU. Despite all the false dawns and new deals and fresh votes, they’re still in Europe.
The at-times partisan British press have covered every step along the way and, to sum up the chaotic Brexit year that was 2019, here’s that story told in 13 headlines.
January
The first month of the year was a busy one for then-Prime Minister Theresa May. She started the year with a Brexit deal, agreed with the EU.
That deal was absolutely crushed in the House of Commons by 432 MPs voting against her. The Sun ran a story of May mocked up as a dodo the following day with the headline “Brextinct” and said “May’s Brexit deal dead as a dodo”.
Less than two weeks later, it had all changed. MPs did vote forsomekind of Brexit deal, appearing to give May a mandate to go seek a new deal and further concessions from the EU.
There were a few good candidates here, but we’ve gone with the Daily Express headline to mark May’s small victory (of sorts) on 30 January.

February
Famed Brexit bogeyman Donald Tusk drew the ire of the diehards looking to leave the EU in February.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar quietly told Tusk that the British press would give him “terrible trouble” for his words on 6 February. He was right.
Here’s how City AM covered Tusk’s comments about whether there was a “special place in hell” for those whopushed for Brexit without a plan.

March
So here it was. 29 March 2019 had been set two years previously as the date the UK would leave the EU.
Only, it didn’t leave. It still hasn’t left.
When MPs rejected leaving the EU without a deal, the papers the next day all led with variations on the word “meltdown”.
MPs voted overwhelminglyto delay Brexit by three months. May kept trying to get her Brexit deal through the House of Commons. She failed, and failed, and failed again. The problem was that parliament could barely agree on any way forward.
With her grip on power loosening, May acknowledged that she wasn’t long for the job of prime minister by the end of the month.
The right-wing press cast it as a heroic sacrifice from May to get Brexit done, but the Guardian instead focused on the House of Commons impasse on 28 March.

April
May seemingly did the unthinkable at the start of April, offering to work with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to reach some kind of consensus on a way forward.
The Daily Telegraph rounded on the prime minister, saying: “Cabinet backs no-deal Brexit but May turns to Corbyn instead.” The Sun suggested May had “gone soft” and asked “Is that your bright idea?”
The more left-leaning papers also revelled in May’s travails. The Daily Mirror featured a sombre May with the headline: “Help Me, Jeremy”.
But it was the Metro that wins this round with this 3 April front page.

May
If a week is a long time in politics, how long does a few months feel? From the bullish May fresh from agreeing a deal with the EU at the beginning of the year, it all ended in tears.
The right-wing press had fully turned on her as it came into the month of May. When she eventually resigned, it was an emotional end as she made a closing speech outside Number 10.
In a flavour of what was to come, the Telegraph ran a photo of May with the headline “Boris makes Brexit vow in Push for No 10″.
The Daily Mail, meanwhile, kept it simple.

June
By now, the three-month delay to Brexit has been extended. The latest deadline is 31 October.
As Tory hopefuls were vying for the chance to be the next prime minister, Boris Johnson stood out as a clear favourite.
Despite the revelations contained in a Guardian scoop about police being called to the home he shared with his girlfriend, he appeared unassailable in his premiership bid.
Advertisement
He was also making bullish statements on the campaign trail.
Like this one, covered by the Guardian and everyone else on 26 June.

July
To no-one’s surprise, Johnson then became prime minister in July.
Where to start with this one? The papers were aspartisanas ever on this one.
The Scottish Sun mocked Johnson up as Buzz Lightyear with the headline “to insanity and beyond”. The Daily Mirror featured photos of Johnson in all sorts of situations with the headline “it’s really not funny any more”.
But it’s this effort from The Daily Telegraph that made one or both of Coen Brothers cry on 23 July wins the day here.

August
Johnson’s first few weeks in the jobs featured a number of tasks. First, he had to manoeuvre against parliament and also try to negotiate a new deal with the EU.
His decision to prorogue parliament to try to prevent it getting in his way would later prove to be unlawful, and it drew fury when it was announced in August.
Quite how bad a no deal Brexit would be, meanwhile, was laid bare in a scoop by the Sunday Times  on 17 August.

September
To try and get the mandate to push through the Brexit he wanted, Johnson tried and failed to call an election for mid-October in September.
Labour said they wouldn’t agree to an election unless a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table, and this is something Johnson refused to rule out.
In fact, this month he said he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than not leave the EU on 31 October.
More on that later.
He also suffered the indignity of his own brother resigning because he couldn’t support his plans. Speaking of indignity, another animal mock up from the Sun came this month attacking “cowardly Jez” (Jeremy Corbyn).

October
Despite the repeated rhetoric that the deal Theresa May had agreed with the UK couldn’t be reopened, it could and was reopened. Against all odds, Johnson won a couple of concessions and gave up some of his own to reach a new deal with the EU.
The right-wing papers struck a joyful tone but, again, the British prime minister didn’t quite have the numbers to get the Brexit deal through parliament.
Those concessions on the UK side that came at the expense of what the DUP wanted proved crucial, as highlighted by the Financial Times on 18 October.

November
After months – and years, really – of impasse, it was announced the British people were set to go to the polls again to elect a new government.
Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were the only realistic hopefuls looking to occupy Number 10 after the 12 December election.
On 5 November, the prime minister launched the Conservative campaign on the front page of the Daily Telegraph comparing Corbyn to Stalin.
Labour, meanwhile, kept it less inflammatory with its “10-point plan to save the NHS” on the cover of the Daily Mirror a week later.
The Conservatives enjoyed a clear lead in the opinion polls but the first time the two leaders clashed in a live TV debate it was something of a stalemate.
The Times played it straight with their front page on 19 November.

December
A long, tumultuous year in Brexit ended with Boris Johnson and the Conservatives romping home to victory in the general election.
As you might expect, there were some very different takes in the papers the following day.
The Daily Express was predictably jubilant.
Daily ExpressDaily Express
While the Mirror lamented a “nightmare before Xmas”.

Brexit may now be quieter next year, but don’t surprise if “getting Brexit done” takes a longer than Johnson’s promise of 31 January.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-action-plan-businesses-5199655-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2020
THE GOVERNMENT HAS today approved its2020 Brexit Readiness Action Plan, as it says there is still time for business to prepare, but that they do need to do so.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Minister Eamon Ryan and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney launched the plan today.
The government announced additional measures to help businesses prepare for Brexit.
Enterprise Ireland will shortly launch a new “Ready for Customs” grant through which businesses can claim grants of up to €9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs role.
Free custom training online and and custom insight courses are also on offer from Enterprise Ireland.
“This is not a drill,” said the Tánaiste, who said Brexit will happen whether a trade agreement is signed off on or not.
Coveney said preparations for Brexit “are in good shape”, but added that a “big national effort” is needed now by businesses.
Revenue will be writing to tens of thousands of businesses in the coming days to remind them to get their affairs in order. “Do not ignore that letter,” said Coveney.
The action plan outlines the vital preparations that businesses should be taking now in advance of 31 December 2020, when the transition period ends.

A statement issued by the Department of the Taoiseach today said that regardless of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the UK, “the end of the transition period will bring substantial and lasting change”.
“The UK’s departure from the Single Market and Customs Union has profound and immediate implications for every business that moves goods to, from or through Great Britain,” it said.
The statement said business “must take steps now to understand what these changes are and assess their impact”.
Irish businesses trading with Great Britain or using the UK land bridge are being asked to “intensify” their preparations for 1 January 2021.
“In the worst case scenario, the nw rules will prevent them from trading with Great Britain or could lead to significant delays in moving goods,” the statement said.
“Above all, we will face the challenge of the end of the transition period as an EU Member State, with the support, solidarity and strength this brings.”
Brexit deal change
The publication of the Irish government’s action plan comes as the UK government sets to introduce the Internal Market Bill later today, which aims to ensure goods from Northern Ireland continue to have unfettered access to the UK market while making clear EU state aid rules – which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland – will not apply in the rest of the UK.
Concerns have been raised that key parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, which sealed the UK’s departure from the EU in January, will be overridden by the legislation.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis yesterday told MPs that he expects the UK would “break international law” with its proposals to change how a key agreement with the EU operates.
Lewis said it would be in a “very specific and limited way”, adding there are “clear precedents” for the UK and other countries which need to consider their international obligations as circumstances change.

Yesterday evening, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said his concerns about reports of UK plans to override elements of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement have been “exacerbated” after hearing comments from the House of Commons.
Coveney said in the Dáil: “If those comments represent the considered view of the British government, then I find them gravely concerning.
“While we still await publication of the legislation, earlier this week we raised the media reports and briefings on this issue with the UK through diplomatic and official channels to express our concerns.
“However, rather than being reassured, my concerns have been exacerbated by additional comments deliberately made in the House of Commons today – openly committing the UK government to legislate to break international law in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement.”
Coveney said that “progress of the future partnership is inextricably linked to the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement”.
“Any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern, and a very serious step.
“Northern Ireland does not need this further uncertainty in relation to Brexit.”
Coveney added that “it is surely not too much to ask” that the UK government implement legislation “in full respect of its international obligations”.

BORIS JOHNSON’S CONTROVERSIAL Brexit legislation, enabling the UK to break international law, has cleared the House of Commons.
MPs voted 340 to 256, majority 84, in favour of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill,  despite warnings that the “law-breaking” legislation threatens UK unity and the country’s global reputation.
Ministers have defended powers contained in the legislation, which gives them the opportunity to override the Brexit divorce deal.
They argue such powers are needed to protect the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, amid concerns in Westminster that Brussels could seek to disrupt food goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland as part of trade talks.
The UK Government was forced to compromise earlier in the Bill’s passage in the face of a Tory backbench rebellion, which resulted in changes to give MPs a vote before ministers can use the powers which would breach the Withdrawal Agreement brokered with Brussels last year.
The Bill also contains powers which enable Westminster to provide financial assistance for economic development, infrastructure, cultural activities and education purposes across the country.

Opposition MPs have warned it will give the UK Government the chance to stray into matters which are devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, branding it an “attack” on devolution.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma told MPs: “Our approach will give businesses the regulatory clarity and certainty they want.
“It will ensure the cost of doing business in the UK stays as low as possible, and it’ll do so without damaging and costly regulatory barriers emerging between the different parts of the United Kingdom.”
Sharma accused SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford of wanting to be “shackled to the European Union forever”, to which Blackford replied: “You’re talking nonsense.”
Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour supported the principle of the internal market, but opposed the “law-breaking” Bill.
Trade talks
Meanwhile, the final round of post-Brexit trade talks began today, with negotiators from the British and EU sides meeting in Brussels to try to hammer out the final details of a plan to get the bare bones of a trade deal agreed before the end of next month.
The schedule for talks this weekshows that the three main obstacles are still taking up the most time in negotiations: the level-playing field, governance issues and fisheries.
“There were small advances after the 6th or 7th Round, but still the ideological is absolutely at odds with what was agreed in the political declaration and that’s still a massive concern and it doesn’t seem to be shifting,” Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said.
Related ReadsThe beginning of the end: This could be the final week of post-Brexit trade talks
Other topics to be discussed this week include energy, trade in goods and services, and law enforcement and judicial cooperation.
On the controversial bill that MPs have just voted through – and which threatens to overwrite elements of the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland – Neale Richmond refereed to a comparison of a “loaded revolver” on the negotiation table.
The UK had originally argued that the Bill protects the peace process in Northern Ireland. But after the Irish government came out to refute that claim, the UK government is arguing that it is only a last resort if the EU doesn’t act in good faith.
UK Prime Minister Johnson argues it will provide a “safety net” against what he claimed are EU threats to impose tariffs on UK internal trade, and carry out customs checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (what Johnson calls a blockade).
Although the EU wants all three offending Clauses in the Bill removed by tomorrow, Richmond says that this hasn’t changed ongoing trade negotiations, which will continue all this week.
But he added that the EU will pursue “all legal options” if needs be.

According to a statement from Number 10 Downing Street, Johnson spoke to congratulate Martin on his appointment as taoiseach.
Johnson “underlined the closeness of the relationship between the UK and Ireland, and the two leaders resolved to work closely to further strengthen links between our countries”.
The two leaders also discussed climate change and the importance of cooperation when Ireland takes a seat on the UN Security Council.
Martin and Johnson also discussed the coronavirus pandemic and the need to work together to ensure an economic recovery.

The UK’s departure from the EU – an issue that partially defined Leo Varadkar’s time as taoiseach – will remain high on the agenda for Martin.
The spokesperson said that Johnson “stressed his determination to reach an agreement as soon as possible, but emphasised that the UK’s fundamental principles will not change, and explained that the UK remains committed to implementing the Northern Ireland protocol”.
Both leaders said that they looked forward to meeting in person in the future.
Yesterday, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke with Martin.
“We agreed to work closely together to make Europe stronger, greener, more digital,” she tweeted.
She said that the EU also needs an “ambitious partnership with UK that respects our principles”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/neasa-hourigan-ceta-green-party-5300456-Dec2020/,"GREEN PARTY TD Neasa Hourigan has said efforts to push through government approval of outstanding elements of the controversial EU-Canada CETA trade agreement are “extraordinary” and “cynical”.
A vote on the deal was due to take place in the Dáil yesterday but was postponed until next month after a number of TDs raised concerns about it.
A split in the Green Party has emerged over the deal with Hourigan and her colleague Patrick Costello both saying they won’t back the full ratification of the trade deal.
Hourigan toldTheJournal.iethe current environment in the party is “unpleasant”.
“A senior staff member told the parliamentary party that my position on CETA was delusional this week. So it is quite an aggressive and unpleasant work environment.”
Hourigan, the party’s finance spokesperson, said this kind of commentary is “not helpful” and “not respectful”.
Most of the provisions in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which will remove the vast majority of trade barriers between Canada and the European Union, are already in operation.
Once ratified, CETA will, among other things, allow corporations to sue the Irish State through a new ‘Investor Court System’ over regulatory decisions that negatively impact their profits.
Concerns have been raised about the impact this could have on implementing legislation in areas such as climate change, health and housing.
Hourigan said there is “absolutely no time pressure” for Ireland to ratify the deal and we should wait to see the outcomes of debates in other European countries.
“It’s an extraordinary position to take, considering there’s absolutely no time pressure on the CETA decision. There’s a constitutional challenge in Germany. Cyprus has challenged it also, and the Dutch Greens have recently blocked it.
“It seems a strange decision to try and push this through in the way that they have, particularly since we did discuss it during the government negotiations and it doesn’t appear in the Programme for Government.”
The government says the deal — which came into force on a provisional basis in 2017 pending full ratification by member states — gives Irish and European producers, manufacturers and exportersunprecedented access to the Canadian market.
The deal has been ratified by 14 EU member states so far but countries such as Germany and Italy are yet to do so.
The agreement has been met with stiff opposition here from environmental campaigners, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and opposition parties.
Ratifying CETA does not appear in the Programme for Government (PfG) but the document does commit to supporting “new and existing EU trade deals”, as some in government have pointed out this week.
Hourigan, who helped negotiate the PfG, said many of the trade elements of the deal are already in place, and she and others worked hard to make sure the CETA deal was not specifically named in the programme.
“Most of the CETA deal is already in place. And so the implementation of the Investment Court System has absolutely no impact on whether we have access to those markets or not.”
‘No concerns raised’
However, Hourigan’s party colleague Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Roderic O’Gorman toldTheJournal.iethat an upcoming vote on CETA was flagged within the parliamentary party in early November.
“In two briefing notes it was noted that the issue around CETA was coming up and the week before Cabinet it was verbally raised at our parliamentary party meeting, and at no stage from 6 November up until last Thursday, when it was suddenly raised, was this raised by any member of the parliamentary party,” said O’Gorman.
“I think there’s a narrative out there that this was sprung on the parliamentary party, that’s not correct.

“When members of the parliamentary party did raise concerns that they felt this was being decided too quickly, at advisor level we reached out to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and indicated there were some concerns,” said O’Gorman.
“We got many things into the Programme for Government, stopping CETA wasn’t one of those.”
The Greens’ parlimentary party was told last month the party understood “that there is no risk that the ICS (Investor Court System — the controversial dispute settlement process) could overrule Irish courts or overturn any legislation passed by the Oireachtas”.
However, Hourigan said she wasn’t aware that a vote on the motion would take place until last Friday.
“The fact remains that this is directly contrary to Green Party policy and not in the programme for government,” she said.
Party u-turn
Hourigan said she has asked party leader Eamon Ryan and others in Cabinet why they backed a Dáil vote on the deal. At the time of publication, she had not received a response.
“I asked why it was being rushed through the week before Christmas with a 55-minute debate and I got no answer.”
Ryan met with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Monday evening to discuss the vote.
Afterwards a spokesperson said the leaders met and “reiterated their support for ratification”.
“However, they agreed to reschedule it for January as this will allow for a longer and more considered debate.”
Ryan previously campaigned against CETA, prior to entering government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.
So don't be behind the door now@EamonRyanin staying true to what you believe about CETA. The Dáil can't ratify CETA without the votes of@greenparty_ieTDs, and I don't see it in the Progamme for Government.#PostponeTheCETAVotepic.twitter.com/JETuNiy0Ap— Oisín Coghlan (@OisinCoghlan)December 14, 2020

At its National Convention in 2016 the Green Party passed a motion, proposed by the Brussels Greens, which stated the party “believes that the practice of granting investors exclusive rights outside of the normal courts system to sue countries for changes in legislation that impact profits is an affront to democracy”.
The motion went on to state that the party would “work for the rejection of CETA by Ireland and the European Parliament“.
Hourigan said party leadership “are entitled to discuss with our coalition partners, as they see fit, make agreements as they see fit” but “ultimately the party though has a very clear policy on this issue and a very clear history of activism on this issue”.
“There isn’t a mechanism to unilaterally overturn that, we would require a special convention to do that.”
‘Incredibly cynical’
Hourigan said efforts by some members of government, including some of her colleagues in the Green Party, to link ratify the deal with a post-Brexit recovery are “incredibly cynical”.
“No matter what we do in the next few months with CETA, it has a long road to go because all the countries have to ratify it before that aspect [the court system] kicks into place. And that will take some time.
“Linking it somehow to recovery from Brexit is incredibly cynical, it has nothing to do with Brexit. It doesn’t open any new markets to us, 80% of CETA is already in place.
“So to use that fear to push something through without proper oversight and without hearing the domestic debates in other countries is extraordinary.”

PARTING IS SUCH sweet sorrow, so the famous Shakespearean phrase goes – but it was made a little bit sweeter by the Liberal Democrats’ former MEPs.
The party’s 16 departing members of the European Parliament left hampers filled with British goods for the six MEPs that would replace them in their European grouping Renew Europe – including Irish MEP Barry Andrews, who took up his Strasbourg seat in February.
73 British MEPs were elected last May during the European elections, despite the UK’s looming exit from the EU. In that European election, 27 extra MEPs were elected across the EU member states – with the expectation that the UK would leave and those 27 MEPs would then take their seats.
Advertisement
This finally happened on 1 February, when the UK officially left the EU. This resulted in all British representation being withdrawn from the European Commission, Council and Parliament (they took the Union Jack down, too).
Among those 27 extra MEPs (sometimes referred to as ‘cold storage’ MEPs) were two Irish parliamentarians: Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune, and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews.
Andrews, whose party Fianna Fáil is in the same political grouping as the Liberal Democrats, was left a parting gift by his departing colleagues: a hamper full of products from the UK.
Among the goods were Yorkshire Tea, Henderson’s Relish, Scotch whisky Chivas Regal, and a Yorkshire pudding and pancake mix.
A note was left with the hamperthat read: “Although we have lost our voice in Europe, at the same time, we wish you well. Please accept these British regional products as a welcome gift.”
Andrews toldTheJournal.iethat the hampers were left for all of the new Renew Europe MEPs, of which there are six.
He said that taking up his seat, in place of MEPs like the Liberal Democrats was “very odd” and “there is certainly an air of real regret about the place”.

“The Liberal Democrats made a huge contribution in the group and fought to the end for the revocation of Article 50 – the strange thing for me is that on a personal level I benefited from their campaign ultimately running out of road.”
“That makes the gesture all the more generous and appreciated,” he said.
The former leader of the Liberal Democrat MEPs group Catherine Zena Bearder said that the hamper was “a gesture to welcome MEPs joining Renew Europe, a team we so enjoyed and were proud to be part of”.
“Although Brexit means we will lose our voice at the table in the EU on so many issues – issues we want to fight for, like standing up for human rights and protecting the environment – we will continue to champion the internationalist values we hold dear, here in the UK.”
The Renew Europe group is now the third largest in the European Parliament (97 MEPs), while the EPP (Fine Gael’s EU party) has is the largest, on 187 seats. The second largest party is S&D, with 148 seatsin the post-Brexit cycle.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fish-dispute-brexit-5306374-Dec2020/,"
INTENSE HAGGLING OVER EU fishing rights in UK waters threatened to sink negotiations on a post-Brexit deal and plunge cross-Channel trade into chaos.
Fishing is now the main obstacle to securing a pact by 1 January, when Britain leaves the EU single market, after progress on the other main issue of guaranteeing fair competition.
“It remains very blocked,” one EU diplomat told AFP.
Another said Brussels had made Britain its last offer on fishing access and it was down now to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to decide whether he wants a deal.
“If Britain doesn’t accept the latest EU offer it will be a ‘no deal’ over fish,” he warned, adding that London has until the end of the year to decide.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has proposed EU fishermen giving up nearly a quarter of the value of the fish they currently catch in UK waters. Britain is understood to be holding out for getting back much more than half.
The UK has suggested this compromise last for three years before it is renegotiated, whereas Europe is holding out for double that. “It’s all down to numbers now,” the second European diplomat said.
EU fishermen expressed alarm that “we are in the throes of being sold down the river,” in a statement from the European Fisheries Alliance.
It urged Barnier to stick to protecting them, saying: “The shape of a deal, as currently stands would give a huge blow to the European seafood sector which is made up of more than 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels with an annual turnover of 20.7 billion euros.”
However, time is short to reach an accord.
The European Parliament has highlighted a deadline of midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday to receive a deal for review if MEPs are to ratify it before the end of the year.
Their UK parliamentary counterparts are in recess, but can be recalled within 48 hours to do likewise.
But EU capitals are not binding themselves to the European Parliament’s deadline.

France’s European affairs minister, Clement Beaune, warned that only “a matter of hours” was left, echoing words used by Barnier a day earlier.
But, he told French radio talks will not be called to a halt even if they go past Sunday.
“We won’t do that because what is at risk is whole sectors like fishing, like sustainable competition conditions for our businesses,” he said.
The urgency of reaching a deal is being driven home by scenes of long lines of trucks at the freight rail link through the Channel tunnel as British companies frantically stockpile.
A group of UK MPs warned on Saturday that Britain has not installed the complex IT systems and port infrastructure needed to ensure trade with the EU runs smoothly.
Some disruption is inevitable, deal or no deal.
Outside the single market, British and European traders will have to fill out import-export, health and tax forms to send and receive goods.
A deal would avoid tariffs but there would still be traffic snarls as checks on truck loads and drivers’ papers are carried out.
Even truck drivers’ lunches will come under border scrutiny: the British government warned packed ham and cheese sandwiches are banned from entry into Europe under meat and dairy restrictions that apply to non-EU arrivals.
The European Union linked the fishing rights issue to the overall trade deal from the start.
It is an economically tiny activity for both sides, but politically potent with voters.
Initially strident positions on the issue have shrunk, with Britain now accepting some EU boats will continue to ply its waters and EU countries recognising catches will be cut.
The haggling is over how much, for what species, in what waters exactly, and for how long a fishing agreement should last before it is put up for review.
Regardless of any trade deal, both sides are bound by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to jointly manage those stocks to prevent overfishing them to extinction.","7.20pm, 19 Dec 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/joe-biden-northern-ireland-border-brexit-5278045-Nov2020/,"US PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden has stressed the importance of keeping the Irish border open following Brexit.
Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday, Biden said he did not want to see “a guarded border”.
“We want to make sure – we’ve worked too long to get Ireland worked out, and I talked with the British prime minister, I talked with the Taoiseach, I talked with others, I talked to the French,” he said.
“The idea of having a border north and south once again being closed is just not right, we’ve just got to keep the border open.”

Biden discussed Brexit with Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier in November during one of his first phone calls to other world leaders as president-elect, warning him Brexit must not jeopardise the Northern Ireland peace process.
Biden previously touched upon the 1998 Good Friday agreement during his presidential campaign, tweeting in September: “We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.
“Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.”
Negotiations between the UK and European Union on a post-Brexit trade deal resumed on Monday following technical discussions over the weekend.
Problematic issues including fishing rights, the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition in areas such as workers’ rights and state subsidies and the governance of any deal are yet to be resolved.

Speaking to reporters today, Ursula von der Leyen said Downing Street’s controversial UK Internal Market Bill had “distracted very strongly” from the two sides being able to secure fresh trade terms before the looming deadline.
The post-Brexit transition period, during which relations between the European Union and the UK have remained static, is due to end after 31 December and leaders on both sides of the Channel have warned that an agreement is needed by October if a deal is to be ratified in time for the start of 2021.
With the cliff edge only a month away, the UK Prime Minister has faced criticism domestically and on the world stage for pursuing legislation that would defy the Withdrawal Agreement brokered with the EU last year, breaking international law in the process.
Johnson was forced yesterday to agree to table an amendment to the Internal Market Bill, giving MPs a vote before the government can use the powers related to Northern Ireland which would breach the treaty.
But the compromise has not seen Brussels back down, with Eric Mamer, chief spokesman for the European Commission, telling a press briefing that its position had not changed and it still wanted the offending clauses to be withdrawn from the legislation.
Despite the wrangle over the Bill – which has been derided by every living former prime minister, scores of senior Tory backbenchers, US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Brussels – commission president von der Leyen said she remained sure that consensus on a future partnership with the UK could be reached.

It comes after von der Leyen used her annual State of the Union address to the European Parliament to warn Johnson that the UK could not unilaterally set aside the Withdrawal Agreement.
Von der Leyen, in comments reported by Politico, told reporters:
“This was an unpleasant surprise.”
In reply to another question, the German politician said she was “still convinced” a deal with London “can be done”.
The commission president’s comments come as the UK confirmed “some limited progress” had been made between the negotiation teams during informal talks in Brussels this week.
“The UK’s negotiating team had useful informal discussions with the EU this week as we seek to reach an agreement by mid-October on our future relationship,” said a UK government spokesman.
“These covered a broad range of issues and some limited progress was made, but significant gaps remain in key areas, including fisheries and subsidies.
“We will continue to work hard to bridge those gaps in talks next week, without compromising our fundamental position of being an independent country.”

BORIS JOHNSON’S BREXIT Bill is expected to easily pass through the House of Commons this week, given the large majority secured  by the Conservative Party in last month’s general election, as Members of Parliament return to work today.
The British prime minister’s ‘Get Brexit Done’ mantra resonated with voters and the Bill’s expected passage will pave the way for Britain to leave the European Union by 31 January.
Focus will now turn to a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and RU.
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has said the content of such a deal between is more important than reaching an agreement by the end of this year.
Johnson altered his Brexit Bill to make it unlawful for the British government to extend the trade talks into 2021, giving negotiators less than a year to thrash out a deal.
However, Irish and European leaders have warned that agreeing a trade deal before the end of 2020 may not be possible.

Johnson is due to meet Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, in London tomorrow. He is expected to reiterate his government’s position that the Brexit transition period, during which time the UK remains subject to many EU rules, should not be extended beyond December 2020.
Von der Leyen recently expressed “serious concern” over whether the bloc could conclude a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain this year.
A spokesperson for the DFA toldTheJournal.iethe focus of the trade talks “should be on content, not timing”.
“The EU has been clear that it will work hard to progress the negotiations as quickly as possible – but we should be clear that the overarching priority is to achieve an agreement that works as well as possible and that gives us the strongest possible foundations for a positive EU-UK relationship for years to come.”
The spokesperson added that Ireland and the 26 other EU Member States “will work for the closest, deepest and broadest possible relationship with the UK”.
“The future relationship will be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and will cover a range of issues of importance to Ireland. The aim is for an ambitious trade agreement, balanced by level playing field provisions,” they said.
Johnson must decide by July if he wants to ask for the transition period to be extended — and, if so, whether by one or by two years. He has previously insisted he will not seek an extension.
‘Johnson may regret legislation’
In a recent interview withTheJournal.ie, Tánasite and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said Johnsonmay regret amendingthe relevant legislation in a bid to avoid extending the transition period.
“I think he may regret doing that, by passing legislation, which effectively requires them to have everything done by the end of 2020, when they have the option to extend for a year or two years if they want to. It is effectively tying their own hands,” Coveney said.

“I think the EU isn’t going to be rushed here, they’ll negotiate a trade deal, as they always do. They’ll try to do it in as timely manner as we can, because everybody wants to get this behind us and to move on.
“But they’re not going to rush the deal and certainly Britain are not going to get a better deal because the EU are being rushed. If that is the strategy, I don’t think it’s going to work.”
Coveney continued: “There’s nothing to prevent Boris Johnson, if he wants to, of seeking an extension and changing the law if has to. I mean, he has a large majority that can allow him to do it … He still has options.”
In terms of Ireland’s priorities heading into the talks, Coveney said he doesn’t want to see any “race to the bottom” in terms of standards and regulations.
If that is where Johnson is heading, there “won’t be tariff-free or quota-free trade” according to Coveney, who added that such free trade remains the stated objective of both sides.
Comprehensive trade deals of the kind the EU enjoys with Canada, Japan and Singapore have so far taken between six and eight years to agree. However, some officials hope that a bare bones arrangement can be reached this year to avoid massive disruption and economic damage when Britain leaves the bloc.
Downing Street yesterday hinted that Britain may conduct post-Brexit trade talks with the US in parallel to those with the EU.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS written to European Council president Donald Tusk accepting a Brexit extension until 31 January 2020.
Tusk had recommended EU leaders approve an extension until 31 January 2020 and earlier today confirmed all EU member states have agreed to proceed on that basis.

The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK's request for a#Brexitflextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.
In a letter published this evening, Johnson said: “I would have much preferred it if the UK Parliament could have proceeded rapidly to ratify the deal we reached between us.
“Unfortunately, I very much fear that this Parliament will never do so as long as it has the option of further delay.

“That is why I am seeking a General Election in December to ensure the election of a fresh parliament which is capable of resolving the issue in accordance with out constitutional norms.”
Downing StreetDowning Street
Some leaders, most notably Emmanuel Macron of France, had been pushing a shorter extension to allow UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pass the recently revised Brexit deal through the House of Commons.
The EU leaders have now agreed to a so-called ‘flextension’ to the end of January 2020. The UK can leave the bloc earlier if the House of Commons and the European Parliament ratify the Withdrawal Agreement before then.
Last week British MPs voted to allow Johnson’s Brexit legislation to proceed. However, the government lost a second vote on his accelerated timetable to rush the legislation through – which forced another request for an extension to be considered.
Johnson earlier this month sought an extension, via an unsigned letter,against his own wishes. He previously said he would prefer to be “dead in a ditch” than fail to leave the EU by 31 October.
The latest extension is the third granted to the UK after an initial Brexit date of 29 March was missed earlier this year.

General election
British MPs are today due to vote on holdinga December general election. This morning’s announcement will mount pressure on opposition parties to decide whether to back a poll on 12 December.
Labour has said it will only back the move if Johnson makes “absolutely clear” that a no-deal Brexit is off the table.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election bid, to be made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), would require a two-thirds Commons majority – 434 MPs.
As an alternative, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have put forward a tightly-drafted Bill that would grant an election on 9 December.
The draft law, currently scheduled for tomorrow’s sitting, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament – 114 fewer than under the FTPA “super majority” rules.
With the SNP and Lib Dems supporting the initiative, the Bill is likely to pass even without Labour backing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-brexiteers-brexit-trade-deal-5312507-Dec2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S POST-Brexit trade deal with the European Union has won the backing of the Brexiteer backbenchers, who have said the agreement “preserves the UK’s sovereignty”.
A self-styled “star chamber” of lawyers – led by senior Tory Sir Bill Cash – was assembled by the European Research Group (ERG) to examine the 1,246-page text of the agreement.
They concluded that the agreement “preserves the UK’s sovereignty as a matter of law and fully respects the norms of international sovereign-to-sovereign treaties”.
In a statement, they said: “The ‘level playing field’ clauses go further than in comparable trade agreements, but their impact on the practical exercise of sovereignty is likely to be limited if addressed by a robust government.
“In any event they do not prevent the UK from changing its laws as it sees fit at a risk of tariff countermeasures, and if those were unacceptable the Agreement could be terminated on 12 months’ notice.”

The ERG’s legal advisory committee included Sir Bill, Martin Howe QC, Barnabas Reynolds, Christopher Howarth, Emily Law and the MP David Jones.
On fisheries, they stated that the agreement “temporarily limits the exercise of the UK’s sovereign rights over its waters that would apply in the absence of the Agreement”.
However, they said that at the end of the fishing transition period the UK “will have the legal right to take full control of its waters” and therefore the “question of practical sovereignty” is “dependent on the preparedness and robustness of the UK Government’s response at that time, which we are confident they will achieve”.
The backing of the ERG will be welcomed by the Prime Minister, who could have faced a rebellion on his backbenches without their support.
However, if they had failed to back the deal, it would likely have still passed comfortably tomorrow with Labour support.
Labour is alone among the opposition parties in saying it will support the deal – with the SNP and the Liberal Democrats having said they will vote against it.
But Keir Starmer faces a high-profile revolt over his decision to back the agreement.
Related ReadsA look at the detail: What is in the Brexit trade deal?
Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and ex-cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw are among the signatories to a statement calling on opposition parties not to support the “rotten” agreement.
The DUP, which backed Brexit, has also said it will oppose the deal because the Brexit divorce settlement imposes customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
MPs and peers will debate and vote on the EU (Future Relationship) Bill on Wednesday with the legislation being rushed through in a day ahead of the end of the transition period at 11pm on Thursday.
Meanwhile tomorrow, the deal will be signed in Brussels by EU chiefs before being flown by an RAF plane to London for Johnson to sign.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the international treaty would be signed by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel before being flown across the Channel.
An RAF plane will transport the treaty, accompanied by UK and EU officials, and the document is expected to be signed by the Prime Minister in Downing Street tomorrow afternoon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-coveney-barnier-5283332-Nov2020/,"CRUNCH TALKS AIMED at securing a post-Brexit trade deal between the European Union and UK will resume later today in what could be the final week of discussions.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his counterpart David Frost will meet again in London as they seek to hammer out an agreement.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said he has a lot of faith in Michel Barnier to negotiate a “balanced deal” but with just a month to go until the end of the transition period, he warned that time was running out.
“I’ve been saying for the last number of weeks that this is the key week, and we’re staying the same again this week,” Coveney told Morning Ireland.
“I think perhaps the difference is that the UK side are saying it as well this week.”
A recent sticking point in talks has been fishing rights – described UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as an “outstanding major bone of contention”.
But the Raab said there was “a deal to be done” after the EU showed progress on the so-called level playing field aimed at preventing unfair competition.
Coveney agreed that fishing is an outstanding issue but accused the UK of creating the perception “that they own all fish that are caught in their waters, as opposed to it being a shared stock, in many cases”.
“It’s about sustainably managing stock. Many of those fish are born and grow in Irish waters before they swim into British waters were they’re caught, in the case of mackerel in particular. So these are shared stocks.”

He said nobody is questioning the UK’s control of its own waters but as it looks for access into EU markets there are counter-questions from the EU, such as accessing their fishing waters “that our fleets have historically had for many many decades”.
“This is a negotiation where there is give and take on both sides,” he said.
“In a broader agreement, it is important that both sides recognise each other’s concerns and interests and, from my perspective,  the Irish fishing interests in UK waters are significant.”
Speaking on Sunday, Raab said this could be the last week of “substantive” negotiations and urged Brussels to recognise the “point of principle” on Britain’s control of its waters.
“As we leave the EU we’re going to be an independent … coastal state and we’ve got to be able to control our waters,” he told Sky News.
Fishing rights as well as the governance of any deal and the “level playing field” have been the main stumbling blocks preventing the two sides from reaching a deal so far.
Shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said yesterday it would difficult for Labour to vote against a Brexit pact.
“I don’t think we could vote against the deal because like I said the British government want us to get a deal, it’s in the national interest,” the MP told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour programme.
Without an agreement, the UK will leave the single market and customs union on December 31, and trade under World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.
A Number 10 source said over the weekend that the bloc “must understand that we are not going to sell out our sovereignty”.
Barnier and Lord Frost resumed face-to-face talks in the capital on Saturday after negotiations were paused earlier this month when one of the EU team tested positive for coronavirus.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-conference-arlene-election-boris-brexit-4868866-Oct2019/,"THE GAGS GAVE it away at the Democratic Unionist Party conference today.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had been declined a speaking spot at the conference because of his “inability to recall what he actually negotiated”, riffed deputy leader Nigel Dodds.
“Rather than have Boris with us today we have had to send him to the naughty step,” joked leader Arlene Foster.
The frosty relations with the government have dominated headlines about the DUP in the past week. From compromise on ‘blood red lines’ to being sidelined by Johnson in his deal with the EU, the DUP has gone from power to parody in the space of only a few day.
A day feels like a long time in politics, Foster told delegates.
But the jokes at Johnson and his government’s expense reveal the struggle going on at the heart of the DUP. The alliance with the government has brought the DUP power, money and a list of UK government-funded projects that will look good on a manifesto.
Yet the confidence-and-supply agreement has also brought the party to the brink of disaster. Johnson’s bid to push his deal through parliament – with all the provisions on customs and Stormont that the partyfinds so objectionable– has backed the party into a difficult corner.
It’s a reality that could leave the DUP uniquely vulnerable in the face of voters, who might easily conclude that the stinging defeats of recent weeks  – from same-sex marriage to abortion and a regulatory border in the Irish Sea – have made the party a poor man’s choice at the ballot box.

It was an idea that the party tried to dispel early this morning. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson made his speech a pre-election list of the gifts the confidence-and-supply agreement has brought Northern Ireland.

The agreement negotiated with Theresa May – which may or may not still have legs into the future – has left critics claiming that the party has had its mouth ‘stuffed with gold’.
But to Donaldson, it was a gift that instead could keep on giving  – for everyone in Northern Ireland. From education to mental health and broader infrastructure projects, he said that “we know exactly where this money is being used”.
Election
It still remains to be seen whether the DUP will back an election on Monday. Today, Foster said the party was “ready” and wiling to face voters.
“We have a strong record to put to the people and now more than ever we will seek a mandate to ensure Northern Ireland has the strongest team fighting for it,” she said.
Yet for all pre-election messaging, the phantom polling day that overshadowed this conference didn’t seem to channel excitement into attendees.
With relatively few young faces and a crowd of older members, there seemed little appetite to go knocking on doors in the dark evenings of December.
Even Foster’s speech attracted a smaller crowd than last year.
Challenges
Perhaps it was this the reason Foster and her fellow party leaders tried to project a message of the DUP as a broad church committed to a modern Northern Ireland.
It’s not an entirely new message, but today it was accompanied by a self-reflection that doesn’t always come naturally to the party.
Early this morning, Emma Little-Pengelly, who pulled off a surprise victory in Belfast South at the 2017 election, said: “Our opponents attempt to demonize us – part of the challenge will be to ensure that we do not make it easy for them.”

“Perhaps, too often, we play into our enemies hands,” she said. “I know that we are not a party of hate, or bigotry, or backwardness. I know we are a party of passion and compassion.”
She toldTheJournal.ieafterwards that unionism is broader than the DUP – she pointed out how Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives all contain different shades of the same commitment to the UK.
The DUP, she said, needs to do more to explain itself – especially to younger voters.
“There is so much more to the party. The fact that people do perceive some of what we say or some of what we do as motivated by hate, when I know it isn’t, grieves me, so I think we can do more to try and explain that and try and reach out to people,” she said.
The challenges faced by unionism, she said, might have distracted the party from projecting a more positive image.
“Maybe too few people see that we’re also very compassionate, that we’re passionate about a range of issues,” she added.
Whether or not we do get an election in the coming weeks, expect this message to be at the forefront of the party’s campaign for a long time to come.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ms-empty-shelves-food-supply-brexit-5318019-Jan2021/,"THE MAJORITY OF retailers are not experiencing major difficulties with their supply lines in the aftermath of Brexit and empty shelves in Marks & Spencer stores are not indicative of a wider issue, Ireland’s largest retail representative body has said.
Photos of empty shelves at M&S stores in Dublin caused a stir on social media in recent days, with many wondering if it was a harbinger of things to come now that the UK has officially left the European Union.
A spokesperson for the British chain toldTheJournal.iethat the issue arose because it is “transitioing to new processes” following Brexit.
“Following the UK’s recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and it is taking a little longer for some of our products to reach our stores,” he said.
The spokesperson added that the problem is expected to be resolved “soon”.
Products with a short shelf life – such as vegetables and refrigerated foods – are most likely to be affected by supply problems.
Retail Excellence’s Managing director Duncan Graham said M&S is particularly susceptible to facing issues because it sources the vast majority of its products in England and Wales and transports them to Ireland daily.
“It’s in these short shelf life products from retailers that are coming over on a daily basis and M&S is probably the most acute example of that because they source so much from the UK,” he said.
The industry spokesman predicted that we are unlikely to see similar problems at other major supermarkets as they have a more robust Irish supply base and appear to be coping well with the new arrangements.
“I believe on this side of the border the vast majority of retailers are reasonably well prepared,” Graham added.

While there has yet to be significant issues in Ireland, the UK parliament heard today that Northern Ireland is facing disruptions to its food supply because British suppliers are unaware of the new paperwork required to send food there.
Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK said there has been a lot of upheaval for freight operators, which he said was inevitable after the last-minute Brexit deal.
He said January is one of the quietest months of the year but volumes remain significant, with around 1,000 lorries a day entering Northern Ireland from Britain.
“I saw the first lorries arrive (in Belfast Port) under the terms of the protocol, on that first ship there were only 15 lorries, six of them were pulled immediately to go to the border control post because they didn’t have the correct documentation,” he told MPs.
“One large manufacturer in GB had 15 lorry loads of food to go to Northern Ireland this week, not a single one of them could move because when the lorries arrived there was no customs declaration and the operator quite rightly said, ‘there is no point in me lifting these because I’ll simply be detained or refused entry to board the ferry at Cairnryan or Liverpool.”

Leheny said while most companies in Northern Ireland understand their obligations but there has been a breakdown in communication to suppliers and operators in Britain.
He described an operator on the opening weekend of the year who resorted to a video on You Tube for the paperwork to get lorries moving.
Giving evidence, Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said events so far have been characterised by traders as “opening skirmishes”.
“Retailers have been stocking up before Christmas for this first week, the flow in the first weekend was less than 20% of the usual transport flow, there are real hardships that are going to come in the middle of this month,” he told MPs.
Victor Chestnutt, president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, said no difference has been seen yet at the farm gate but cautioned that it was “early days”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-economy-report-5212393-Sep2020/,"FAILURE TO REACH an agreement with the EU in post-Brexit trade talks could hit Britain’s economy three times harder in the long term than coronavirus, a think tank has warned.
Queues at the border, shortages of fresh food and medicine as well as more “hassle” travelling to the continent are also possible, according to the UK in a Changing Europe group.
A report by the organisation, based on modelling with the London School of Economics, said the impacts of coronavirus may mitigate or obscure the impact of a no-deal exit.
But it warned that not forming an agreement with Brussels would have a significant impact in the long term.
The authors wrote: “The claim that the economic impacts of Covid-19 dwarf those of Brexit is almost certainly correct in the short term.
“Not even the most pessimistic scenarios suggest that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a fall in output comparable to that seen in the second quarter of 2020.

“However – assuming a reasonably strong recovery, and that government policies succeed in avoiding persistent mass unemployment – in the long run, Brexit is likely to be more significant.
“Our modelling with LSE of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England’s forecast for the impact of Covid-19.”
The transition period, which kept the UK aligned to the EU’s single market and customs union rules to allow trade to flow smoothly after Brexit, expires at the end of the year unless both sides agree to an extension – something Boris Johnson has ruled out.
Trade deal talks between the two sides are continuing, but the Prime Minister has set a deadline of 15 October for an agreement to be reached, otherwise he has said he will simply walk away from the negotiating table.
If there’s no trade deal, there are also fears it could impact sections of the Irish economy severely.
Professor Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: “While the Prime Minister said no deal is a ‘good outcome’ our report shows that it may lead to significant disruption and will have a significant negative economic impact.
“As significant will be the political fallout of no deal, particularly with the UK and EU, but also inside the UK, particularly Northern Ireland, and internationally too.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-arrest-warrant-no-deal-brexit-4879351-Nov2019/,"EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANTS are frequently used between Ireland and the UK to apprehend suspects quickly and allow them to be surrendered over in order to be put on trial – but after Brexit, this will become a longer, more expensive and more complicated process.
In the case of a no-deal Brexit, European Arrest Warrants sent to and from the UK would cease to have effect, and prisoners held under such warrants without having been put on trial would have no legal basis to be incarcerated.
European Arrest Warrants, which were enacted in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, are used to arrest suspects in different participating EU countries. It has been described as faster and more effective than the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, and ends “political involvement” compared to those extradition orders.
In Ireland, European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) are issued frequently to the UK, and particularly across the border to apprehend suspects in Northern Ireland.
It’s understood that around 75% of all of Ireland’s EAW requests are sent to the UK.In 2017, they made up 60 0f a total of 76 requests, which were issued for crimes including murder, sexual offences, drugs offences, assault, robbery and fraud.
But in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the European Arrest Warrant System would “no longer apply” if sent to or from the UK, and there would be no legal basis for retaining British citizens in EU member state prisons on foot of a European Arrest Warrant.
In response to a query fromTheJournal.ieon whether British prisoners arrested under an EAW and held in an Irish prison would have grounds for release in a no-deal Brexit, the Department of Justice said:

What will replace EAWs?
Brexit Omnibus Bill 2019Brexit Omnibus Bill 2019
The Justice Department also said that the Brexit Omnibus Act 2019 – a bill containing legislation in the case of a no-deal Brexit – would introduce new arrangements “immediately” to ensure “minimal disruption” to extradition procedures.
“In the small number of cases where the UK has requested arrest and surrender of a person under an EAW… the Act will:(i) allow the extradition of Irish citizens without the need for a specific bilateral, and(ii) facilitate the faster transmission of extradition requests byinter alia,allowing electronic methods of communications.
‘Slow and costly’: The Convention on Extradition
The Omnibus Billmakes a number of changes, including the amendment to “section 14 of the Extradition Act 1965 to allow for the extradition of Irish citizens to another state where that state would extradite its own citizens to the State”.
In cases where a reciprocal arrangement isn’t in place, it’s not clear if the replacement system will be fast enough in order to keep a suspect incarcerated without legal basis.
Where an extradition order is issued, it’s also unsure whether these will be responded to in time to keep prisoners in jail pending a trial date.
According to the ‘UK in a Changing Europe’ report, it took “an average of18 monthsto extradite an individual under the Convention, compared with15 days for uncontestedEAW cases and48 days [7 weeks] for contestedones – partly because it placed no time limits on each stage of the process”.
A joint report by the irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission entitledEvolving Justice Arrangements Post-Brexitsaid that extradition orders “would cause considerable disruption and delay” compared to the previous EAW system.
“Given the necessity of maintaining a high-level of policing co-operation due to the 310-mile land border and the specific post-conflict realities on the island, any disruption to police co-operation could have serious consequences,” the report said.
Related Reads'A sobering read': Here's the Irish government's no-deal Brexit plan
The Irish Council of Civil Liberties said that a return to the old extradition system is complicated by the history of extradition between the UK and Ireland.
“Extradition between Ireland and United Kingdom was a very complex, bilateral system and it wasn’t straightforward,” it said, adding that even before Brexit, the UK was pulling back from the European Arrest Warrant system.
Numbers
The Department of Justice has said that “considerable planning and preparation” has been going on to prepare for Brexit, including “effective extradition arrangements” between Ireland and the UK.
It also said that for now, and for so long as the UK remains an EU member state, the Irish courts are continuing to deal with UK EAW cases as normal.
The Department of Justice couldn’t give figures on the number of persons in custody in Ireland pursuant to an EAW from the UK as well as and the number in custody in the UK on foot of an EAW from Ireland.
The Department said that this is because this number varies; “as cases are dealt with, new requests are received, or further arrests are made in Ireland on foot of existing or new UK EAWs”.
However, it’s understood that around 75% of all of Ireland’s EAW requests are sent to the UK, possibly slowing down future prosecution cases where a suspect has fled to Northern Ireland or the rest of the UK.
The European Arrest Warrantannual report for 2017showed that 207 EAW requests were received from the UK, with 60 sent by the Irish State.A total of 478 surrendershave been made to Ireland since the EAW legislation came into force in 2004.

UK Prime Minister acknowledged there could be “bumps in the road” as the country enters a new era, but he insisted that Brexit can “unleash the full potential” of the UK.
Johnson accepted there would be mixed feelings in a nation that remains deeply divided after years of bitter Brexit battles.
“For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come,” he said.
“And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss.”
The UK joined the then European Economic Community in 1973 but the 2016 referendum signalled the beginning of the process which resulted in Britain’s membership of the bloc coming to an end at 11pm tonight.
After years of bitter wrangling since the 2016 referendum, Johnson said his job was now to “bring this country together”.

With little set to change at 11pm as a result of the deal negotiated by the UK and EU, attention has already turned to the next set of talks aimed at securing the future relationship which will apply from 1 January 2021.
And Johnson has been clear he also wants to strike deals with countries around the world – notably Donald Trump’s US.

A Downing Street spokesman said: “Cabinet discussed the Government’s future trade agenda, which includes seeking a Canada-style FTA with the EU.
But Brussels is pessimistic about the 11-month timetable for reaching a deal and made clear that Britain will have to accept worse terms and conditions for trade than if it were still a member of the EU.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said: “We want to have the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom, but it will never be as good as membership.”
Senior Cabinet minister Michael Gove acknowledged the trade-offs that would have to be made in any deal.
“We want trade to be as frictionless as possible but the EU is clear, you can only have fully frictionless trade if you accept all of their rules, if you accept all their laws, you are subordinate to their judges, you are subordinate to their political structures,” he told the BBC.
There “will be some regulations that will differ in Britain” so “that may mean that when it comes to trading with Europe there are some bureaucratic processes there that aren’t there now”.
DUP Brexit Spokesman Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland must not be held in EU prison.
“As we leave the dank dungeon which has bound our economy, stunted our growth and restricted our economic freedom, it is important that the government does not allow the EU to continue its control through conditions attached in the negotiations which now have to follow about what our relationship is outside the walls of the European Union.”
Wilson added that there must be no agreement to allow the EU to continue to “impose its regulations on any part of the UK, demand immense amounts of money for access to the EU market, or restrict our ability to do the trade deals we wish with other parts of the world”.

Guests were quaffing English sparkling wine and dining on canapes including fillet of lamb on toast, Shropshire blue cheese, beef and Yorkshire pudding with horseradish sauce, mushrooms tarts and roast chicken skewers.
In Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum, rallies and candlelit vigils were taking place.
The Leave a Light On gatherings were intended to send a message to the EU to keep open a place for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit staged a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Republic of Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-front-pages-brexit-election-4871712-Oct2019/,"LAST NIGHT, MPS in the House of Commons voted to hold a general election.
The British public will go the polls on Thursday 12 December.
A late amendment from Labour had sought to change the date to Monday 9 December but that failed by 315 votes to 295.
In the end, MPs voted for an election by 438 votes to 20.
Now, let’s take a look at how the UK front pages reacted to last night’s developments.
The Metro runs with “Jingle Polls!”.

Keeping with the Christmas pun theme, the Daily Mirror runs with “It’s time to stuff the turkey”.

The Sun, meanwhile, leads with “New Year’s Leave”.

Taking a jab at the opposition, the Daily Mail runs with “Don’t let the Grinch steal your Christmas”.

“December 12, when Britain will vote … once and for all … to deliver Brexit” leads the Daily Express.

The Guardian plays it straight with “Parliament breaks deadlock with December 12 election”.

Focusing on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, The Times runs with “December 12 poll will get Brexit done, says Johnson”.

The Independent has: “It’s on: the Brexit election.”

Plain and simple, The Daily Telegraph goes with “Christmas election”.

And finally, the I runs with “Countdown begins for Christmas election”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brussels-boris-johnson-5202805-Sep2020/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said his controversial legislation to override parts of his Brexit deal is needed to end EU threats to install a “blockade” in the Irish Sea.
The Prime Minister said Brussels could “carve up our country” and “seriously endanger peace and stability” in Northern Ireland if Conservative MPs rebel to block his Bill.
Johnson is working to quell a plan to amend the legislation from senior Tories who are incensed that it could break international law by flouting the Withdrawal Agreement.
The EU has said the move is a serious breach of trust and has threatened to take legal action if Johnson does not alter the UK Internal Market Bill by the end of the month.
But the Prime Minister has doubled down and argued it is “crucial for peace and for the Union itself” and said voting it down would reduce the chances of a trade deal with the EU.
Writing in the Telegraph, Johnson said: “We are now hearing that unless we agree to the EU’s terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish sea.
“We are being told that the EU will not only impose tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that they might actually stop the transport of food products from GB to NI.
He said “in the last few weeks” he learned his negotiators had discovered there “may be a serious misunderstanding about the terms” of the Withdrawal Agreement he signed in October.
Johnson argued it was agreed during “torrid” days with the deadline for a deal fast approaching while “negotiating with one hand tied behind our back” because Parliament blocked a no-deal.
“If we fail to pass this Bill, or if we weaken its protections, then we will in fact reduce the chances of getting that Canada-style deal,” he wrote,
“Let’s remove this danger to the very fabric of the United Kingdom.
“Let’s make the EU take their threats off the table.

“And let’s get this Bill through, back up our negotiators, and protect our country.”
Both Ireland and the EU, however, have warned that Johnson’s plans pose a serious risk to the peace process rather than protecting the Good Friday Agreement.

Plans to block the bill
The Prime Minister held a conference call with around 250 MPs to try and drum up support for the Bill, and warned them against a return to the “miserable, squabbling days of last autumn”.
But during the call in which there were connection issues and no questions taken by Johnson further fall-out emerged from the EU.
Leaders in the European Parliament said they would “under no circumstances ratify” any trade deal reached if “UK authorities breach or threaten to breach” the Withdrawal Agreement.
Johnson appeared not to have ended the disquiet within his party during the call, with senior backbencher Sir Bob Neill saying he was not reassured by the speech.
Sir Bob, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee and is tabling an amendment to the Bill which he says would impose a “parliamentary lock” on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, said he still contends it contains “objectionable” elements.
“I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,” he told Channel 4 News.
Amid the worsening atmosphere between London and Brussels, it emerged the EU had even raised the prospect that it could block exports of animal products from the UK once the current Brexit transition period comes to a close at the end of the year.
In a statement following the latest round of talks on Thursday, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there were “many uncertainties” about the UK’s animal hygiene regime.
He said “more clarity” was needed if Britain was to receive the “third-country listing” entitling it to export animal products to the EU.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown joined fellow former prime ministers Theresa May and Sir John Major in condemning the Government’s plan, describing it as “a huge act of self-harm”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brext-delays-dublin-port-5313028-Dec2020/,"PEOPLE LIVING IN the border counties can expect to see an increased garda presence in the coming days as the Brexit transition period comes to an end at 11pm tomorrow night.
Officials from state agencies have also warned of potential disruption at Dublin Port as a result of new regulatory and customs checks on British goods coming into the country.
The border between north and south will remain frictionless after Brexit and gardaí won’t be setting up any Brexit-related checkpoints on the border.
However, in the coming days, they say regular checkpoints and patrols will be increased.
The plans were outlined by Superintendent Liam Geraghty of the Garda Press Office at a media briefing at Dublin Port this afternoon.
Asked what concerns gardaí have about the impact of Britain’s exit from the European Union on the region over the coming days, Supt Geraghty said the increase in presence is mainly to reassure communities.
“I suppose there’s no very specific concerns that we have or specific intelligence that we have,” he said.
“But we are very conscious that any change that comes into place has the potential for organised crime groups to try and take advantage of that. Our presence is to give a reassurance to communities along the border that we are out there we are present.”

Port plans
Supt Geraghty was speaking alongside representatives of other state agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners and the departments of Agriculture and Transport, who outlined their plans for the end of the Brexit transition period.
At 11pm tomorrow, Britain will become a ‘third country’ for the purposes of business and trade with the European Union.
It means that goods travelling from the UK into Ireland will have to be checked to ensure they meet European safety standards.
Speaking at the briefing, Revenue Commissioner Gerry Harahill said that dealing with these extra customs and regulatory checks could cause disruption.
“Customs and other regulatory checks take time — and some take longer amounts of time than others,” he said.
However, he said that Revenue will have staff on-site at the port 24 hours a day.
He added, “We have facilities in place to cater for checks, whether documentary or physical and we have systems and processes in place to manage the checks in an orderly way. So my message today is change is happening, things cannot and will not stay the same.”
Department of Transport official Eddie Burke highlighted the post-Brexit traffic management plans put in place by his department and Dublin City Council, which were announced earlier this month.
It’s a colour-coded ‘traffic light’ system with green, amber, red and blue status warnings corresponding to the level of traffic congestion.
Blue, he explained, is the “worst-case scenario where, effectively, the port is closed”.
Regular updates on the traffic situation in and around Dublin Port will be broadcast on Dublin City Council’s ‘Live Drive’ radio station (103.2FM).

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-barnier-negotiations-frost-backtracking-5115805-Jun2020/,"EU CHIEF NEGOTIATOR Michel Barnier said there has been no real progress made in post-Brexit trade talks and accused the UK of backtracking on a key commitment.
Barnier said at the end of the fourth round of negotiations that the UK team had continually sought “to distance themselves” from the political declaration agreed by Boris Johnson.
David Frost, Barnier’s British counterpart, acknowledged there had been only “limited” progress in the talks, which were the final ones before a potentially make-or-break high-level summit later this month.
And Frost conceded that they are “close to reaching the limits” of anything achievable by the remote formal rounds of talks, which are taking place virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Barnier said “the door is still open” for the UK to seek an extension to the current transition period before the end of June to allow more time for discussions, but the Prime Minister has vowed not to extend this.
The EU’s negotiator told a Brussels press conference: “My responsibility is to speak the truth and to tell the truth this week there have been no significant areas of progress.”
On the key area of fisheries, he said the UK has “not shown any true will” to explore compromises.
And he said both sides were still “very far” from reaching agreement on the level playing field, nuclear safety, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding, and an “overarching institutional framework” for the future relationship.

“In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack under commitments undertaken in the political declaration, including on fisheries,” Mr Barnier said.
“We cannot and will not accept this backtracking on the political declaration.”
But he said he hopes by the beginning of autumn to find “some common ground” for a future agreement.

In a statement, Frost said: “Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone. Negotiations will continue and we remain committed to a successful outcome.
“We are now at an important moment for these talks. We are close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve through the format of remote formal rounds.
“If we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work. We are discussing with the commission how this can best be done.
“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon.”
There is mounting concern among business – already hit hard by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic – at the prospect of a “cliff edge” break to the UK’s remaining access to the EU single market with no new deal to replace it.","2.28pm, 5 Jun 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-strategyhigh-stakes-gamble-irish-protocol-iiea-paper-5227858-Oct2020/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT’S strategy in proposing the Internal Market Bill was “most likely a high stakes gamble” to use the Irish Protocol as “leverage” in trade talks, according to a paper published by the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).
The paper states that this “extraordinary gamble” makes a trade deal more difficult to achieve.
Authored by Blair Horan, a member of the IIEA’s UK Expert Group and former general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Union, the paper uses official policy documents and statements to Westminster committees to provide an analysis on where current EU-UK relations stand.

The EU and UK are currently locked in trade talks that both sides have agreed must conclude at some point this month. The Brexit transition period ends on 31 December, meaning that the UK leaves the Single Market and Customs Union then.
Though commitments have been made in the Withdrawal Agreement in the event of no trade deal, agreed to and ratified by both sides, the UK has proposed a piece of domestic legislation called the Internal Market Bill that threatens to renege on commitments given on Northern Ireland if a trade agreement is not reached.
This has damaged trust and good faith relations on both sides of an already fraught and strained negotiating timeframe.
The paper concludes that it is difficult to assess “the real purpose” behind the UK government’s decision to table the Internal Market Bill and renege on an international treaty, but adds that “it now seems clear that the UK never intended to implement the Protocol in good faith, if there was no free trade agreement”.
Horan argues that the UK government’s strategy is “most likely a high stakes gamble” to use the Irish Protocol as “leverage” in the trade negotiations on issues such as fisheries, State aid and level playing field commitments, and also to try and secure a “light touch” implementation of the Irish Protocol.

The Protocol was designed by both the UK and the EU to give Northern Ireland tariff-free trade both within the UK and also with the EU – whether there is an EU-UK free trade agreement in place or not.
Horan says that rather than force the EU to compromise on the UK’s demands on fishing and the level playing-field, the proposal of the Internal Market Bill underscores the need for “even stricter conditions” in trade talks to avoid something similar happening again.
The paper also states that compromise is possible on both sides, with an agreement on an alternative means to secure the information that Exit Declarations would provide for NI-GB trade “possible to achieve”, but “limits to the degree of flexibility that the EU can concede on agri-food checks and controls”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-varadkar-4868197-Oct2019/,"THE DUP LEADER has blamed Leo Varadkar for setting a precedent that has led some loyalists to contemplate violent resistance to the Brexit deal.
Arlene Foster pointed to the Taoiseach’s warnings about the potential for increased dissident republican violence if Brexit led to a hardening of the Irish border, calling his comments “wrong”.
Foster was addressing fears around possible loyalist disorder if Brexit creates economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Simon Byrne is among those who have voiced concern at the prospect.

When asked about the issue ahead of her party conference this weekend, Foster suggested Varadkar’s words had been a contributory factor.
“Of course any violence or threat of violence should not be adhered to,” she told the PA news agency.
“When Leo Varadkar talked about the possibility of dissident violence along the border, if there were any border infrastructure piece, I thought that was wrong. I said so at the time.
“That’s wrong. That is not the way forward.”
Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.
“I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal – they are rejecting it,” she said.

“So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let’s deal with those fears.
“And let’s deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.
“And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues around (democratic) consent and the concerns that we have around customs.”

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has ruled out a pre-Christmas general election.
Speaking at Government Buildings this afternoon, Varadkar said that it was not in the best interest of the public to go to the polls at this time.
It is understood the Taoiseach told Fine Gael ministers in a pre-Cabinet meeting this morning that May 2020 is still his preferred date.
Speculation has been mounting in recent days about whether the recent Brexit events, as well as the upcoming election in the UK, might change matters in relation to when the Irish public will go to the polls.

“I am Taoiseach and it is my prerogative to ask for a dissolution of the Dáil if I thought it was the right thing for the country. I don’t think it’s the right thing for the country, not with the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said.
The Taoiseach said to have a “caretaker government” in place during times of Brexit uncertainty would not be best, stating that it will be a “crucial and potentially dangerous time for Ireland”.
Unlike in the UK, Irish elections can potentially result in weeks and months of government formation negotiations, he said.
“We know that there is going to be a UK election on the 12 December however we do not know what the outcome of that election will be and what that will mean for Brexit,” he added.
He said Ireland could find itself in a “difficult period” between 12 December and the 31 January, “not knowing if the Brexit agreement will be ratified, not knowing if the new government may seek renegotiation, potentially even facing into a no-deal Brexit on 31 January and I don’t think it would be in the country’s interests for us to be spending potentially weeks and months trying to put together a new government at such a crucial time for our country”.
Varadkar told his party colleagues today that he offered summer 2020 as a possible date to Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, however he is yet to agree to a date.
Martin has previously envisaged an election in Spring of next year, and when asked about the May 2020 date, the party leadertoldTheJournal.iethat there shouldn’t be arguing over “a few months”.

He said Fine Gael does not want a general election now, but added that the party stands ready if one were to occur.
His comments echo what he told party members at arecent fundraiser in Dublinwhere he stated that he believes his party can win the next general election.
“In fact, I am sure of it even though it may not become apparent until the last week or ten days of the election campaign,” he said.

The British Government said it wanted to reach its own, separate fast-track extradition arrangement with Brussels.
The move comes as the UK sets out its guidelines for post-Brexit negotiations which cover trade and other aspects of the future relationship with Brussels.

The guidelines set the deadline for progress against a backdrop of deep divisions between the two sides over issues including fish, state subsidies and standards.
The government has set out its plans for the talks ahead of the first round of negotiations on Monday, making clear that it “will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life”.
Some European countries, including Germany, have laws which forbid the extradition of their nationals to non-EU countries, creating a potential problem.
The UK wants law enforcement – and a series of other issues – covered by separate arrangements from the main trade deal, but the EU wants a single partnership agreement covering all aspects of the future relationship, with a single “overall governance framework” to monitor it.
The EU also warned that any co-operation must be based on the UK remaining signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights which was written into domestic law in the Human Rights Act, legislation which the Tories have promised to “update”.

Eugene Drennan will tell the Oireachtas Transport Committee this morning that disruptions to Ireland’s supply chain could have “catastrophic consequences” if certain measures are not in place by next year.
In his opening statement, Drennan will say that the next four weeks will be “a period of unprecedented disruption for the movement of goods in Ireland”.
“For the first time in nearly 50 years customs and import controls will apply at ports and airports on both sides of the Irish Sea,” he will say.
“Even if a deal is reached and implemented between the EU and the UK on tariffs, the new arrangements involving inspections by the Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the HSE and An Garda Síochána will create hold-ups at our ports and airports.
“For hauliers, these disruptions and obstructions will have catastrophic consequences.”
Drennan will also tell TDs that that hauliers are dependent on those in charge of ferries, ports and traffic, and that ports are heavily congested at certain times, even without new checks and controls.
He will also explain that hauliers are currently under pressure to get their goods to their destination on time, before taking the disruption that Brexit will cause into account.

“God only knows what the level of disruption will be once the new checks and controls take effect from 1 January 2021,” he will say.
“The disruption that this will cause is immense and has the capacity to bring the licensed haulage industry to a standstill.”
Drennan will call for a single entity to take responsibility for the free movement of traffic at and around Irish ports, claiming that “uncoordinated chaos” will occur if this does not happen.
He will also suggest that less concentrated ferry schedules should be put in place, and that port authorities should enforce these changes if ferry companies refuse to do so.
Finally, he will ask TDs for the State agencies responsible for inspections and controls at Irish ports after Brexit to deploy adequate resources and technology to allow them to do so with the least disruption possible.
“The success or failure of Ireland’s preparation for Brexit will not be on the shoulders of my members,” Drennan’s statement concludes.
“It will firmly rest with the different State agencies who have been asked by the Government to carry out the preparations.”
Separately, Kieran O’Callaghan of Chief Executive of Cargo Logistics will warn TDs that a direct daily ferry service to France will slow down cargo deliveries, which would have a negative impact on the transport of goods after Brexit.
He will tell TDs the UK will maintain an influence over Ireland’s supply chain after Brexit due to Ireland’s “over-reliance” on the UK land bridge.
He will suggest that the Irish government should invest in a ‘Cargo air bridge’ to Liege in Belgium, saying this will provide speed, reliability, and autonomy to Ireland’s airfreight model.

SENIOR CONSERVATIVES HAVE reacted in anger to Boris Johnson’s handling of the Brexit trade negotiations and the threat to deploy Royal Navy gunboats to patrol UK fishing waters in the event of no-deal.
The British Ministry of Defence has confirmed that four 80-metre armed vessels have been placed on standby to guard British waters from EU trawlers in the event that there is no new agreement on fishing rights after December 31 when transitional arrangements end.
Reports also suggested that military helicopter surveillance will be made available and that ministers are considering beefing-up Navy powers in legislation to authorise them to board and arrest fishermen found to be contravening post-Brexit rules.
Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, called the threat “irresponsible” while former European commissioner Lord Patten accused Johnson of behaving like an “English nationalist”.
Former defence minister Ellwood voiced his concern about the Royal Navy proposals and urged for the gaps in the negotiations to be bridged before the deadline.
Lord Patten, speaking to the Today programme, said he feared for the UK’s future under Johnson’s leadership.
Patten said: “While I hope for the best, I do fear for the worst because it is very, very difficult to see what the plan is, how we’re going to do so brilliantly when we’re out of this ‘cage’ of Europe – which we of course helped to build because the main constructor of the single market was Margaret Thatcher.”
The move is likely to be read in Brussels as a shot across the bows as negotiators knuckle down in a bid to secure an agreement this weekend.

No-deal ‘very, very likely’
This follows after Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned that a no-deal outcome looked more likely than an agreement in the trade negotiations.
Johnson said yesterday that it is “very, very likely” that the UK will fail to strike a trade deal.
The prime minister said he was “hopeful” that progress could be made in talks but stressed that the two sides remained stuck on fisheries and ‘level-playing field’ rules.
His comments came after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the negotiating teams’ positions remained apart on “fundamental issues”.
However, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said yesterday that “it is possible to get a deal”.
He added that could be achieved in a way that protected the EU’s interests in preserving the integrity of the Single Market while respecting Britain’s insistence on being an independent and sovereign country outside the bloc.
Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost are set to talk throughout the weekend in Brussels after Johnson and von der Leyen agreed at a dinner on Wednesday to resume negotiations ahead of a decision on the future of talks tomorrow.
Meeting with Gove
Yesterday afternoon, Johnson met with senior British minister Michael Gove, who has responsibility for Brexit planning, and other officials to “take stock” of the British government’s plans for a no-deal exit.
Related ReadsBoris Johnson warns no deal is 'very very likely' while Coveney says agreement is still possibleExplainer: Is this the final throw of the dice before a post-Brexit deal is struck?
It follows reports that German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron rebuffed Johnson three times this week after he made attempts to speak to them directly about the stalled trade discussions.
Fishing has been one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations with the bloc, with France reportedly unhappy with the UK’s proposals for reducing quotas for EU skippers and a short implementation period.
Speaking to reporters on a visit to Blyth in Northumberland, Johnson said fishing and a so-called level playing field ratchet that would tie the UK to future EU standards were the two major stumbling blocks to a deal.
He said: “There is the whole issue of fish where we’ve got to be able to take back control of our waters. So there is a way to go – we’re hopeful that progress can be made.
Earlier on Friday in Brussels, von der Leyen said the UK and EU had “not yet found the solutions to bridge our differences” on fisheries.
The Commission president urged the British government to “understand the legitimate expectations of EU fishing fleets built on decades, and sometimes centuries, of access”.

A DECEMBER ELECTION in the UK has moved significantly closer with the confirmation that Labour is to back a government motion to hold one.
In the House of Commons this afternoon, both Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn backed the holding of a general election but the matter will be subject to a vote later today.
The vote may even be derailed ahead of time due to a number of amendments attached to the election bill.
Johnson failed for thirdtime last night to get sufficient backing from MPsto hold an election but is trying another route today that is more likely to succeed.
Johnson has on three occasions sought to hold an election using the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, which requires two-thirds support in parliament, but failed to get the required numbers despite winning a majority on each of the votes.
This afternoon, Johnson said that his government has been “left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse”.
“There is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, fingers crossed, refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people. And that is to refresh this parliament and give the people a choice,” Johnson said.

Yesterday, Johnson fell 135 votes short of the 434 required to get an election after the vast majority of Labour MPs abstained.
After that proved unsuccessful, the UK government has today tabled a bill which will simply set the date of the next election as 12 December. This would require a simple majority in parliament.
The government had been wary of going down this route because such a bill could be amendment by opposition politicians.
A motion tabled by Labour’s Stella Creasy this afternoon was passed by the House of Commons making it easier for MPs to table amendments to the bill.

Two amendments being proposed would give 16 and 17 year olds and EU citizens the right vote in the election.
These amendments are unlikely to be selected for MPs to vote on but this will be decided later.
If they are selected and subsequently passed the government has said it will pull the entire election bill.
Despite this, the prospect of an election moved closer this morning after Corbyn confirmed that Labour would be supporting the government’s motion to hold an election.
Corbyn has repeatedly stated that he would support an election only afterif the threat of a no-deal exit was removed.

This morning, the document officially granting the UK aBrexit extension until 31 January 2020 was publishedand Corbyn has said this allows him to support an election.
This, however, isdespite the EU confirming that an extension was granted yesterdaybefore MPs voted on holding an election.
Addressing his party front bench this morning, Corbyn confirmed that his party’s position will now support the holding of an election.
“We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to 31 January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met,” Corbyn said.
Speaking this afternoon in the House of Commons, Corbyn said he backed to election as a way of removing “this reckless and destructive Conservative government”.
“A government that has caused more of our children to be living in poverty, more pensioners to be in poverty and more people to be in work poverty. More families without a home to call their own and more people living on the streets,” Corbyn said.
“I’ve said consistently that when no-deal is off the table we will back an election. Today after much denial and much bluster by the Prime Minister, that deal is now off the table. So this country can now vote for the government it deserves.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-breaching-ni-protocol-big-mistake-5286953-Dec2020/,"THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Minister Simon Coveney has warned the UK it will be making “a really big mistake” if it breaches the Northern Ireland Protocol on Brexit.
The British government is poised to reintroduce elements of its controversial Internal Market Bill next week, which could override the protocol, in a move that would breach international law.
It is also set to table its finance bill, elements of which could also breach parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol – designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland – agreed last year.
It comes amid an intense period of negotiations between the EU and the UK to reach a post-Brexit trade deal.
Coveney said today that such a move by the UK would be taken as a “clear signal” by the EU that the UK does not want a deal.
He said: “I think if they do that, it will be a clear signal to the EU that this process is not going to conclude well.
“We have certainly given signals in as respectful, but in as blunt a way as we can, that that would be a really big mistake at this stage in negotiations.
“I think Michel Barnier’s briefing of the meeting this morning would reflect that too.”

Earlier today, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly briefed European ambassadors that a breach of the Northern Ireland Protocol would trigger a “crisis” and cause a breakdown in trust.
Coveney told the Oireachtas Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union today that an agreement on the implementation of the protocol is close.
He expressed his hope that a deal will be reached soon, which could negate the need for the UK to introduce its own domestic legislation which could override the protocol.
He said: “There’s a lot of negotiating to happen between now and then. I hope there will be no need for domestic legislation that threatens the implementation of the protocol, because of a successful outcome to negotiation. Time will tell.”
Coveney was heavily critical of the British government’s actions around the Internal Market Bill, which he said had damaged their reputation internationally.
He said: “We’ve wasted so much time talking about the Internal Market Bill. The motivation of the British Government in terms of why they’re doing it.
Coveney added: “It’s undoubtedly doing damage to Britain’s reputation internationally. Not just in the European Union, on the other side of the Atlantic as well.
“They’re just trying to understand, what is the British Government at here?
“It’s in some ways a very provocative approach that has undermined trust and sucked in a huge amount of oxygen that could have been used to resolve these issues through negotiation.
“I think the EU will draw only one conclusion if that course of action happens, which will be hugely regrettable.”","10.00pm, 2 Dec 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2021-brexit-5206558-Sep2020/,"IRELAND NOW HAS no choice but to assume the UK and EU will fail to strike a trade deal, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said today.
The UK Government’s attempt to override elements of the Withdrawal Agreement through domestic legislation has increased the likelihood of a no deal, acknowledged McGrath.
It was a view shared by Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe as the pair outlined their Government’s strategy for next year’s Budget, which will be announced on 13 October.
The economic impact of the UK exiting on World Trade Organisation trade terms and the ongoing cost of the Covid-19 pandemic are both factored into a Budget outlook.
It projects a deficit of up to €19 billion – or 5.5% of GDP – in 2021.
McGrath said Budget 2021 will allocate significant resources to those sectors set to be worst hit by a no deal.
But he added: “There isn’t anything that the Irish Government could do that would come close to matching the scale of the disruptive impact on our economy of a no trade deal Brexit.

“So we sincerely hope that sense will prevail, and that there will be a deal done, but from the point of view of framing a budget, the only prudent assumption to make at this point in time is that a no trade deal will be done in the next number of weeks.
“It’s in everybody’s interest that that scenario is avoided but it’s not directly within our control, and given the events of the last week or two in particular I don’t think we’ve any choice but to assume that there won’t be a deal.”
Donohoe said the prospects of a no deal has increased as a result of the move at Westminster.
“My view in relation to the likelihood of this has changed in recent weeks and indeed days,” he said.
“Particularly given and since the internal market legislation was published in the House of Commons. Of course that’s been a very significant event.
“And it is our view that the appropriate and safe thing to do, from an Irish point of view, is now to be ready to deal with the consequences of a no trade deal Brexit.
“And as great as those consequences will be I’m absolutely certain that our economy has within it the ability to deal with those consequences and rebuild itself over time.”
The ministers said Ireland’s good reputation on international markets would enable the Government to borrow billions of euro to make up next year’s deficit.
The impact of the pandemic has already left the country facing a deficit of up to 30 billion euro this year.

The State has so far spent around €24.5 billion on Covid-19 support measures, including a wage subsidy scheme and enhanced unemployment benefits.
In the spring, the Government will also publish a medium-term plan to reduce the deficit.
The Government is not planning any broad-based increases in income tax next year to boost the public coffers, insisting such a policy would be “counter-productive”.
The budget will include details of a major recovery fund to deal with the ongoing impact of Covid-19.
In line with the programme for government agreed by the Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green Party coalition administration, the sectoral priorities in Budget 2021 will be health, housing and climate change.
Like last year, carbon tax will be increased by six euro per tonne, with part of the money generated diverted back into communities impacted by the transition away from fossil fuels.

https://www.thejournal.ie/geoffrey-cox-uk-5204023-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Sep 2020
FORMER UK PRIME Minister David Cameron has said he has “misgivings” about Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans, becoming the fifth former prime minister to speak out against the UK Internal Market Bill.
The bill is to be debated in the House of Commons today amid growing criticism that breaching international law would jeopardise the UK’s reputation.
The bill seeks to override the Brexit divorce deal agreed with between the EU and the UK, with the UK government admitting it would break international law.
Theresa May MPspoke out against the plan in parliament last week while the other living PMs,Gordon Brown,Tony Blair and John Major, have also spoken out against it in the media.
In mild criticism today,Cameron joined the former prime ministersin saying he was concerned about the plans.
“Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate, it should be an absolute final resort. So I do have misgivings about what’s being proposed,” he said.
Cameron went on to suggest however that Johnson’s plans may be part of a negotiation strategy.
The intervention comes as Johnson’s former attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has said it would be “unconscionable” to override the Brexit divorce deal, as the Tory rebellion against the controversial legislation grew.
The Tory MP said there is “no doubt” the “unpalatable” implications of the Withdrawal Agreement were known when the Prime Minister signed it, a time when Cox was the chief law officer.
The Brexiteer warned he would not back the UK Internal Market Bill unless ministers dispel the impression they plan to “permanently and unilaterally” rewrite an international agreement.

The QC, who was attorney general during the unlawful suspension of Parliament, said tariffs and customs procedures on certain goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain were part of the deal.
“There can be no doubt that these were the known, unpalatable but inescapable, implications of the agreement,” he wrote in The Times.
He said if the powers in the Bill were used to “nullify those perfectly plain and foreseeable consequences” then it would amount to the “unilateral abrogation of the treaty obligations” signed in October.
“It is unconscionable that this country, justly famous for its regard for the rule of law around the world, should act in such a way,” he said.
Cox urged ministers to use the “clear and lawful” options under the agreement to remedy their concerns that food imports may be blocked from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Or, “in extremis”, he said, they could take “temporary and proportionate measures” during an independent arbitration process.
“What ministers should not do, however provoked or frustrated they may feel about an impasse in negotiations, is to take or use powers permanently and unilaterally to rewrite portions of an international agreement into which this country freely entered just a few months ago,” he said.
UK Justice Secretary Robert Buckland had earlier said the controversial powers amounted to a “break the glass in emergency provision if we need it” and said he did not believe they would be used.
He said, during questioning on The Andrew Marr Show, that he would resign “if I see the rule of law being broken in a way I find unacceptable”, and insisted ministers were committed to getting a trade deal with the EU.
But the chances of the deed free trade deal being struck were hanging in the balance, with Downing Street’s chief negotiator Lord Frost heading to Brussels for informal talks this week.

Johnson warned that Brussels could “carve up our country” without his new Bill, as he stepped up his rhetoric as senior Tories prepared to rebel against the legislation.
Related ReadsWhere does Ireland's Europe minister think Brexit talks stand now?
Outrage at the Bill has come from across the political spectrum, including from Conservative former prime ministers Theresa May, John Major and Lord Howard.
John and fellow former PM Tony Blair united to urge MPs to reject the “shaming” legislation, saying it imperils the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK’s integrity.
“It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal – crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation,” they wrote in the Sunday Times.
Despite Johnson’s attempts to drum up support, Tory rebels suggested their numbers were growing and opinions were only hardened by Johnson’s increased rhetoric.
The Prime Minister, with a large Commons majority, should win an expected vote of the Bill’s principles during the second reading of the Bill today.
But a rebellion could come later with Commons justice committee chairman Bob Neill’s amendment, which he said would impose a “parliamentary lock” on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.
Labour minister Rachel Reeves said the party would “need to look at the detail” of Bob’s amendment and said Labour MPs will table amendments of their own.
She told the Marr show that Labour will vote against the Government’s Bill if it still contains clauses overriding the Withdrawal Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-fishing-rights-5282599-Nov2020/,"FISHING RIGHTS REMAIN an “outstanding major bone of contention” in post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and EU but there is a deal to be done, the UK Foreign Secretary has said.
Dominic Raab said this could be the last week of “substantive” negotiations as he urged Brussels to recognise the “point of principle” on Britain’s control of its waters.
He told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday: “I do think we’re in a reasonable position – there’s a deal to be done.
“If you look really at what the outstanding issues are, of course the level playing field, but it feels like there is progress towards greater respect for what the UK position was.
“On fishing there’s a point of principle: as we leave the EU we’re going to be an independent… coastal state and we’ve got to be able to control our waters.”
Raab said the UK recognised the impact on other countries, but said: “I think the answer is ‘can the EU accept that point of principle which comes with us leaving the political club?”.
He later told the BBC that with “pragmatism” he believes an agreement can be reached, saying: “The mutual interest in a deal is very strong.”
Labour meanwhile warned that a no-deal outcome would cause “untold economic harm” though the party has so far resisted confirming its support for an agreement.

Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told Sky: “We do want to see a deal, but until we see the construct of a deal, we can’t confirm our support for it.”
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord (David) Frost are holding in-person talks in London this weekend.
Face-to-face negotiations were paused earlier this month after one of the EU team tested positive for coronavirus.
Barnier told reporters as he arrived for the second day of discussions: “Work continues, even on a Sunday.”
Progress is understood to have been made across many areas, yet significant gaps remain on the EU’s access to UK fishing waters when the transition period ends on December 31.
Reports last week suggested that Barnier recently said the EU could accept a 15-18% cut in its share of fishing rights in UK waters, but British officials were said to have immediately rejected the offer.
A Government source said: “These figures are risible, and the EU side know full well that we would never accept this.
“There seems to be a failure from the Commission to internalise the scale of change needed as we become an independent nation.”
The Government has repeatedly said it is prepared to leave the transition period without a deal if the EU fails to move, and talks have been deadlocked for months over fishing rights and other issues.
They include the governance of any deal and the “level playing field” conditions aimed at preventing unfair competition by cutting standards or increasing state subsidies.
But ahead of what was said could be the final week of talks, a source close to the negotiations said: “Over the coming days we will continue to negotiate with creativity and intensity.
“We hope that the EU will come with some fresh thinking because what we’ve seen so far doesn’t cut it. They must understand that we are not going to sell out our sovereignty.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/sinn-fein-in-government-in-ireland-5199844-Sep2020/,"WITH THE NEW troika government continually slipping on its own banana skins, Sinn Féin should remember Napoleon’s advice to his generals, “Never intervene when your enemy is making mistakes”.
Sinn Féin is now the leading party of opposition. Given the new volatility in Irish politics,  it is only a matter of time before they arrive in the corridors of power.
I have always viewed SF like an alien spaceship from a distant galaxy, as a possible, but remote threat to our way of life, to be viewed with the utmost caution. Now that they have landed, I am shocked to see a close resemblance to ourselves.
However, while the whiff of gunpowder may have dissipated over the past twenty-five years, their public utterances remain as populist as ever. Nevertheless, they have arrived, and life cannot really go on as before.
A changing landscape
To the average voter, the glaring and unexplained mystery is why were Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil so doggedly opposed to SF participation in Government down South, while pulling out all the stops to ensure SF’s return to power in the North?
Yes, there are unspoken security concerns and substantial policy differences. However, as an experienced international election observer, I have seen the most unlikely political parties form successful coalitions.
Advertisement
In the past few years, since the leadership changes in SF, I have begun to think seriously about SF’s possible participation in Government. As a democrat, I respect their mandate, even if I profoundly disagree with many of their policies.
As an ex-member of the Defence Forces, I am seriously conflicted. Apart from the obvious policy issues, how would the SF/ DF (Defence Forces) relationship pan out?
A SF Minister for Defence; is it really that unthinkable? I will not be thanked by some of my former comrades for airing such heretical thoughts.
But then again, to paraphrase that great science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke; “If an eminent scientist tells you something is possible, believe him. If he tells you something is impossible, don’t believe him!”
The new middle ground
SF’s preparations for government are well advanced. Party President, Mary Lou McDonald, has already begun to lead her people on the relatively short journey across the Rubicon, to the centre-ground of Irish politics.
Their quickest way to government is to go into coalition with either FF or FG. However, even with a powerful mandate from the people, the onus is really still on SF to close the policy gap between them and the two main traditional parties of power.
What should SF do to be accepted as a coalition partner to either FG or FF?
The first major step for SF should be to distance itself from the toxic legacy of the Provisional IRA. Not easy to do so, if they are to hold on to their core support.
A start would be to put on record how the SF and Provos relationship has changed over the decades. Ultimately, when they are confident enough, the spectre of Provisionalism needs to fade away into history.
This first step should also involve SF, fully, and finally, accepting the Defence Forces (Óglaigh na hÉireann) as the one, true, legitimate armed force of this State. To their credit, they have consistently demanded improved pay and conditions for DF personnel, which is badly needed.
Related ReadsMary Lou McDonald: Sinn Féin will not take part in protest calling for change of governmentMary Lou McDonald: 'Irish unity referendum must happen in the next five years'Poll: Would you welcome a government that includes Sinn Féin?
Of course, it might be even more convincing if Sinn Féin also called for the DF to be properly equipped for their primary role of national defence. But then again, if they were to call for the DF to have tanks, jet fighters and frigates, to properly defend our neutrality, they might leave themselves open to charges of having a different agenda.
The second step is to review some of their socialist policies. SF has become more pragmatic and largely accepts the mixed capitalist/socialist nature of our economy. Like other left-leaning groupings in the Dáil, SF is not really socialist.
Indeed, over the years, there have been faint signals intercepted from the Starship Sinn Féin, that, in government, they may not be too quick to demand economic portfolios.
The third step is to rethink its position on the EU. In particular, SF ‘s opposition to the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy should soften, as the Post Brexit move towards EU unity intensifies.
In this regard, it should support the Defence Forces’ involvement in UN-mandated EU peacekeeping missions. It can do so, while still maintaining SF’s commitment to its policy of positive neutrality.
At present, it looks like they may have time to review their policies before the next general election, but who knows?
Finally, as regards the Defence Forces and Sinn Féin in Government, there should never be a problem. The real Óglaigh na hÉireann will, as it says in the Oath of Allegiance, always remain faithful to Ireland and loyal to the Constitution.

https://www.thejournal.ie/withdrawal-agreement-5201135-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Sep 2020
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has said that the British government would be committing an “extremely serious violation” of the Brexit withdrawal agreement and of international law if it follows through on its controversial bill.
In an extraordinary meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee in London today, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic told senior UK minister Michael Gove that the British government had agreed to the timely and full implementation of the withdrawal agreement last year.
He also stated, “in no uncertain terms”, that breaching this agreement would “break international law, undermine trust and put at risk the ongoing future relationship negotiations”. Sefcovic said the UK should reverse the measures it has proposed by the end of this month.
Gove refused to budge in the testy meeting today, however, and said the British government would not back down.
The meeting today came amid anger in Ireland, in Europe and in the US at the decision from the British government to renege on the Brexit deal it made with the EU.
The UK government has published a bill that would give British ministers powers to decide on some customs and State aid arrangements for Northern Ireland, which is contrary to the provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement, ratified by both the House of Commons and European Parliament.
During the successful election campaign for the Conservatives in late 2019, Boris Johnson had described the deal as “oven ready”.

Earlier today, Johnson’s government published its legal position on the matter and pointed to “difficult and highly exceptional circumstances” despite its wish to conduct its business in “good faith”.
From Dublin to Brussels, however, the prevailing opinion is that the British are not acting in good faith.
In an EU statement, it said it did not “accept the argument” that the UK Internal Market Bill was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement.
“In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite,” the statement said.
“Vice-president Maros Sefcovic called on the UK Government to withdraw these measures from the draft Bill in the shortest time possible and in any case by the end of the month.
“He stated that by putting forward this Bill, the UK has seriously damaged trust between the EU and the UK. It is now up to the UK Government to re-establish that trust.”
However, the British side indicated it would not be pulling back.
In a statement, Gove said: “I explained to vice president Sefcovic that we could not and would not do that. I made it perfectly clear to vice president Sefcovic that we would not be withdrawing this legislation. He understood that. Of course he regretted it.”
Meanwhile, there was growing unrest among senior Tories at the prospect the UK could go back on an international agreement, with Lord Howard becoming the third former party leader, after Theresa May and Sir John Major, to criticise the plan.

Speaking in the House of Lords, he accused the ministers of damaging the UK’s “reputation for probity and respect for the rule of the law”.
“How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards, when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?” he said.
Another Tory grandee, former chancellor Lord Lamont, warned the legislation would not get through the upper House unless there were changes.
“The Government are in a terrible mess and in a hole and I don’t think it is easy to justify.
“In a way, this could take us back to square one with a terrible dilemma,” he told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-legislation-trade-talks-5287870-Dec2020/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson will press ahead with plans allowing ministers to tear up the Brexit divorce deal despite the current round of UK-EU talks being at a critical stage.
The Government confirmed it will ask MPs to reinstate controversial legislation giving ministers the power to break international law by ignoring provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland.
MPs will vote on the UK Internal Market Bill on Monday, potentially throwing talks on a UK-European Union trade deal into crisis unless an agreement can be reached by then.
The EU has already taken the first steps in a legal action over the legislation.
The Government will also introduce the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill, which reportedly includes measures to override parts of the divorce deal struck by the Prime Minister and the EU in 2019.
The developments came as talks on a post-Brexit deal were continuing, led by David Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Intensive talks are continuing in person in London as they have throughout the week, with the negotiating teams continuing to work hard to resolve the differences that remain.
“Our focus remains, and will continue to be, on trying to secure a free-trade agreement, as it has throughout the negotiations.”
MPs will be asked to reinsert the controversial Northern Ireland provisions into the UK Internal Market Bill after the Lords voted to remove them.
The spokesman said: “We have been clear that those clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market and to protect the huge gains of the peace process.”
The Taxation Bill will include “measures which are required to prepare for the end of the transition period”.
Asked if that would include the power to waive tariffs on goods crossing the Irish Sea, the spokesman said the details would be set out next week.
Speculation in Westminster suggests that the Government could draw back from the controversial measures if a trade deal can be agreed with the EU.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney suggested a deal could be reached within days as he urged European Union members to “hold our nerve”.
The negotiating teams talked late into the night on Wednesday, fortified by a delivery of pizzas, as efforts continued to thrash out the deal which needs to be in place by the end of the month.
“It’s the time to hold our nerve, to trust Michel Barnier, who has done a phenomenal job to date,” Coveney told Newstalk.
“I believe, if we do that, there’s a good chance that we can get a deal across the line in the next few days.”
But the Irish minister indicated the scale of concern in the EU about the UK Government’s controversial legislation.
Coveney said he believes the UK wants a deal but added “they don’t always behave like that”, highlighting the bills scheduled for next week.
Downing Street sources played down the prospect of an imminent breakthrough.
“I haven’t seen any white smoke,” one insider told the PA news agency.
Businesses are frustrated with the uncertainty around trading arrangements once the UK leaves the single market and customs union at the end of the year.
Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy told Sky that the supermarket giant was preparing for a no-deal scenario.
“The biggest challenge we face really is the movement of product between borders, the movement of product between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, of course, between mainland Europe and the UK,” he said.
“That’s the one area where we really would urge the Government to give us some clarity and to allow us to prepare even better for the end of December.”
Fishing and the so-called “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on state subsidies and standards remain the main issues to be resolved in the talks.
Reports have suggested that the UK has watered down its demands for control of fishing rights, by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks currently caught rather than the 80% previously sought.
But this falls short of EU demands in one of the most symbolically important aspects of the negotiations.
Meanwhile, Labour is split over how to respond to a deal if it reaches the Commons, with senior figures at odds over whether to support it or abstain.
Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed there are differing opinions within the party on its approach to voting on a Brexit deal, but stressed that a trade agreement with the European Union was “in the national interest”.
The comments come after reports suggested there is a split at the top of the party over whether Labour should vote for any negotiated deal in the Commons or abstain.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-heres-what-will-change-5231482-Oct2020/,"BREXIT OFFICIALLY TOOK place on 31 January this year. But at 11pm on 31 December, Brexit in practice will kick in.
This will mean the UK leaves the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market, instigating a chain reaction that will hit Ireland quite hard.
The whole point of the transition period was to give businesses time to prepare for Brexit, but of course, no one knew that most of the past 11 months would also coincide with a pandemic that would divert attention and resources elsewhere.
Regardless of any outcome of the trade talks – there will be checks and controls between the UK and Ireland from 1 January 2021.
The Government has concerns that businesses may not be prepared for these changes – considering that they have readjusted their focus on adjusting for Covid restrictions.
So let’s have a look at what will change after 31 December – this article is based on the Revenue’s webinar videos on Brexit, background briefings on government preparedness, business webinars, and openly available information.
First: What is under the trade deal
Kirsty O'Connor via PA ImagesKirsty O'Connor via PA Images
Since there is a narrow timeline for a free trade deal (FTA) to be concluded between the EU and UK by 31 December, the Irish government has been preparing for two Brexit scenarios: a limited FTA, or no trade deal.
Until a deal is done, there will be a certain amount still left unknown – but there are a few things that we have known for some time.
The main change that we do know is that the UK will be leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market, which will have a huge impact on people and business owners in Ireland who send goods to, from or through the UK.
This will mean that the EU – and by extension, Ireland – will treat Great Britain as a ‘third country’ for the purposes of trade.
Northern Ireland and the Protocol

For Northern Ireland, the arrangements are even more confused. Northern Ireland is a part of the UK’s customs arrangement – but is also ‘aligned’ to the EU’s Customs Union and remains in the EU’s Single Market.
In practice, this means that Northern Ireland follows EU customs rules and imposes EU duties in some cases, and carries out SPS checks on agri-foods, and regulatory checks on goods going from GB to NI. Northern Ireland will also follow EU Vat rules in relation to goods, but not services.
This will mean import declarations and entry summary declarations are required for goods going from GB to NI, with “light-touch” infrastructure between the two regions to carry out physical customs checks.
This applies whether there is a trade deal or not, as it’s contained in the Withdrawal Agreement – but the arrangement would still need to be ratified by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
A special committee is working out how exactly the Northern Ireland protocol will be implemented.
Customs declarations will not be needed for trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland – again, because of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the ratified Withdrawal Agreement.
1. Customs is changing

Regardless of a trade deal, there will be additional customs barriers on goods from Great Britain or going to Great Britain from 1 January 2020.

Exporters will need to declare goods being transported by hauliers between Ireland and Great Britain with a custom declaration form. Additional costs are associated with this.
Batch letters have been sent out to businesses by Revenue asking businesses to take action to prepare for these customs changes.
They have identified 14,000 businesses that would be significantly impacted by Brexit and will carry our follow up calls with those businesses.
The first step is registering for an EORI number, which 90% of Irish exporters have done (those that trade in services do not need this).
Revenue has identified 4,000 businesses with activity worth over €50,000 and haven’t registered with EORI yet that they will follow up on.
The second step is that businesses will need to decide who is going to carry out custom declarations duties on behalf of a company, and if they have the required software to make the necessary declarations.
As part of this, some businesses may need customs agents; this will be either on a contract basis or in-house.
This was a more vital role before Ireland and the UK entered the precursor to the European Union in 1973, but was phased out due to the free movement of goods clause – one of the four freedoms that underpins the Single Market.
The Government is providing a number of supports to businesses to help prepare for additional customs measures – this includes offering supports for customs training.
2. Pre-booking declarations for trucks on ferries

British politicians have claimed over the years that Brexit-related checks could be streamlined using technology – and to a certain extent, they were right.
Ireland’s Revenue has introduced a new IT system for roll-on roll-off ferry deliveries.
There are three elements to this: one is the pre-boarding declaration.
A business exporting from Great Britain to Ireland must send a pre-boarding declaration of what the truck contains to Revenue, upon booking or checking-in with the ferry company.
The truck will not be able to board without this pre-boarding declaration – the same process will apply for goods being exported on trucks and by ferry from Ireland.
This process gives Revenue time to approve customs declarations as quickly as possible, and delegating as many trucks to the fasttrack ‘green lanes’ planned for ports.
Thirty minutes before docking in Dublin Port or Rosslare Port, truck drivers will be able to check online to see whether they can take the ‘green lane’ exit from the port, or whether they will have to go through customs checks.
It’s understood that Dublin and Rosslare ports will be ready for these processes by the end of the year, and it’s expected that staff and IT systems will also be ready.
This measure has been brought in to allow for the just-in-time food supply chain to continue as normally as possible – which had been a serious concern for the food industry.
3. The UK landbridge

For trucks that are using the UK landbridge to deliver goods to and from continental Europe, they will need to declare their transit.
Concerns have been raised about long delays through the landbridge because of customs checks that would be needed between the UK and France.
Work is still ongoing to try to find a route through the UK landbridge so that Ireland and EU member states can trade goods with one another through the UK.
Related ReadsThe UK's Protocol plan: 'Unfettered access' from NI to GB, and 'light-touch' checks from GB to NI
Recently, this included a plan from the UK government that a ‘passport’, or ‘access permit’, would be needed for trucks to gain access to Kent – the English county where the port of Dover is – in order to offset long delays that are expected.
This was confirmed by senior British Cabinet minister Michael Gove.
4. There will be checks – mostly on agri-foods
New sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks will be carried out on goods being traded between Great Britain and Ireland regardless of whether there is a free trade agreement or not.
Any business, regardless of size, which moves animals, plants, food products of animal origin and plant origin from, to or through Great Britain will be subject to new regulatory requirements.
Documentary identity and physical checks will form part of these new regulations.
They will add costs and cause delays compared to the current supply chain, which could have a huge impact on Irish businesses, as beef and dairy products are a huge export product for Ireland.
If you do import or export animal or plant products from Great Britain, you must register as an importer/exporter with the Department of Agriculture as soon as possible (the email to do so ishere:BrexitRegistration@agriculture.gov.ie).
Irish importers of GB animal or plant goods may also need to register for the European Commission systemTRACES, which allows for the electronic lodgement of documentation required for the import of certain consignments from third countries.
For the UK’s import control regime, particularly what SPS regime will apply for Northern Ireland, it’s a bit more complicated.
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, they announced that they would ‘phase in’ the additional post-Brexit checks and forms to help give businesses more time to prepare.  Because of this, it’s still not immediately clear to Irish authorities what the UK’s plans are (clarifications were due in September).
5. Costs and changes for consumers
Sasko LazarovSasko Lazarov
There will be additional costs to buying products from the UK after 31 December.
If an item costs between €22-150, VAT and import costs will apply to it, while products from the UK that cost over €150 will have VAT, import and customs-duty costs.
Different rates of depend on the product that you are buying.There will be no additional costs for sending letters to the UK.
You will need to pay these costs for parcels in a similar way that US goods ordered to Ireland are paid for – you may need to visit a post office to pay the charge before it is delivered to your house.
If there is no trade deal between the EU and UK, there could also be tariffs (or additional costs) on items you buy from the UK.
On agri-foods in particular, tariffs are quite high.
The CCPC has warned before that the consumer rights afforded to consumers in Ireland who buy products from the UK would be different after 31 December.
Those resident in Ireland with British driving licences are also being askedto swap them for an Irish driving licence, as the UK ones will be invalid here after 31 December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-kent-brexit-prank-toilet-of-england-signs-5281815-Nov2020/,"ACTIVISTS BEHIND AN anti-Brexit stunt that rebranded Kent as the “Toilet of England” have said police have better things to do than investigate their prank.
A number of signs across the English county were changed by a group of campaigners opposed to Brexit.

Where before motorists would be politely informed they were entering the Garden of England – as Kent is known – the new message read: “Welcome to Kent The Toilet of England”.
The stunt aimed to highlight fears of huge lorry queues along the county’s motorways, with suggestions that portable toilets will have to be installed on roadsides for use by delayed drivers.
Kent Police said they have been made aware of “criminal damage” to road signs in the county and inquiries are continuing.
But a member of the activist team, known collectively as EU Flag Mafia, hit out at the idea of officers devoting time to the stickered signs.
They told the PA news agency: “We acted on behalf of the residents of Kent. Everyone who was involved in placing ‘Toilet’ on the road signs lives in Kent and we reject any suggestion that any damage was done to any of the road signs – the stickers can be removed very easily.
“If any Kent resident feels offended, we suggest they simply remove the stickers.
“We suggest that Kent Police have better things to be doing with their valuable time, like trying to work out how the people in Kent will be still be able to travel around the county while thousands of lorries are gridlocked in jams around the county.”
The cloak-and-dagger operation – which activists stressed was compliant with Covid-19 guidelines – covered around 30 road signs stretching from Dartford near London to the border with East Sussex.
Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has previously warned that queues of up to 7,000 trucks could form in Kent unless businesses do more to prepare.

“I THINK, IN a sense, what other member states have done is simply pass the buck to the EU Commission and say ‘You deal with this’.”
Professor Anand Menon, Director of the think-tank The UK in a Changing Europe, says he was reluctant to share these thoughts after the flack he got on Twitter after writingthis opinion piecein the Financial Times, where he argued that the EU “behaved inflexibly”.
As a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London, Menon has become known as an articulate expert on Brexit, although, as he said today: “being an expert on Brexit is a pretty low bar, because there’s so much uncertainty”.
He’s also drawn people’s interest for his measured and informed criticism of the EU; in the Financial Times piece that festered a backlash last week, he argued:
Professor Anand Menon, Director of The UK in a Changing Europe.Geoff CaddickGeoff Caddick
Speaking in Dublin today at an event by theInstitute of International and European Affairs, Menon said that “And you hear this now if you have private conversations with officials from some of the east European countries who are now starting to think ‘Oh my God, what about the security relationship? This is all heading in the wrong direction.’”
Advertisement
Menon outlined in his speech how divided the United Kingdom had become since the Brexit vote, and that the divides didn’t stray over normal Tory/Labour lines, but a melée of different Brexit views, party loyalties, and the usual left- and right- wing inclinations.
UK parliament is “angry”, “divided” and “doesn’t know what to do” about Brexit, that it “almost perfectly represents the state of the British people”.
Out of the four “unpalatable” Brexit choices, surveys show that “no deal and Remain were the two most popular first choices” and “also the two most popular last choices”.
He also illustrated how divided the British people are by Brexit, and how it “shades” the British people’s views of each other.
“So for instance if you ask people how the British economy has performed since the referendum – not how it will perform after Brexit, how it has performed -Leavers will be far more positive about how it has performed than Remain.
“A majority of Remainers would not want to rent a room in their house to someone who voted Leave. A large number of Remainers will be uncomfortable about seeing one of their own kids marry a Leaver.”
He said that because of Brexit “sucking all the life out of politics and the civil service”, “economic grievance has gotten worse”.
Part of the reason for the Brexit vote stemmed from genuine grievance about the state of the country. Because of Brexit, we simply haven’t been governed for three years – nothing has happened.
“We face the prospect of continued uncertainty and continued populism in our political system for the foreseeable future, because of the melding of these two things: dissatisfaction with politics, and prevailing and continuing and dissatisfaction with the status of our economic setting.”

THE MOMENT THE UK officially left the EU was marked with cheers and the singing of God Save The Queen at the gates of Northern Ireland’s seat of government.
Crowds started gathering from 10.30pm in preparation to hear the distinctive sound of a Lambeg drum being played.
DUP MLA Jim Wells led a countdown from 10 to 11pm before shouting “freedom” to cheers and the waving of union flags and sparklers at Stormont’s front gates.
A piper then played to mark the moment.
The event, billed as a thanksgiving, was opened with a prayer before speakers including Wells and independent unionist councillor Henry Reilly addressed those assembled.
“This is a happy day for our nation, this means that our nation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland moves out from the bondage of Europe to the freedom of the rest of the world,” Wells said.
“We have an economy that is bigger than Russia, that is bigger than India, we are the fifth largest trading nation in the world and therefore we have a wonderful opportunity as a nation to go out and to trade and to prosper and I am confident that we will do so.
“The people who are telling us tonight represents a major disaster were the same people that told us 14 years ago that if we didn’t join the euro the British economy would collapse, well how wrong were they because had we had joined the euro, then we during the recession would have been in a disastrous situation.”

Hundreds gathered at Westminster for a Brexit celebration to mark the UK leaving the European Union.
A music system was set up on the back of a lorry on Parliament Street, with people dancing in a closed-off section of the road to music by Sir Tom Jones and Queen.
As one man walked through the crowd with an EU flag draped over his shoulders, another man carrying the Union Flag shouted at him: “Go away loser.”
Dozens of people gathered around the Sir Winston Churchill statue, while others rang bells and banged a drum attached to a modified cart called Little Ben.
The cart belongs to David and Nancy Waller, who travelled from Shropshire to take part in the Brexit Celebration.
Waller, 59, said the cart cost about £500 to restore and build, thanks to a “Brexiteer” blacksmith who donated his services free.
He said the bell, which people have been ringing throughout the evening, was found in a salvage yard but was originally forged at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London.
Waller said: “We have come here because we are great supporters of democracy. At one stage we thought it was all over, but it ain’t now.”
Addressing the crowd from a stage before the 20-second countdown, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: “This is something that I fought for – for 27 years and something that many thousands of you gave your time and money for.
“We faced an established that didn’t even want to listen to us. An establishment that never wanted that referendum to take place. An establishment that tried for three and a half years to frustrate the will of the greatest democratic mandate ever seen.”

He added: “The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy.
“Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before. This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation.”
At 11pm, bongs from Big Ben were played out through speakers. It was followed by a rendition of the national anthem, with the lyrics produced on a large screen above the stage.

Irish demonstrations
Hundreds of anti-Brexit campaigners have taken part in a number of demonstrations along the Irish border in opposition to Brexit.
The anti-Brexit protests organised by the Border Communities Against Brexit group and Sinn Fein were held to mark the UK leaving the European Union.
Protesters gathered at six locations along the border in counties Louth, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Donegal on Friday night.
Around 200 people gathered a few miles from Newry to voice their opposition to Brexit.

The anti-Brexit campaigners also demanded for Northern Ireland to continue to have a voice in the EU after the UK leaves.
In an earlier protest, Border Communities Against Brexit activists unveiled a new billboard declaring the “fight goes on”.
They urged the Irish Government and the restored Stormont Executive to push for some form of continued representation in EU structures.
It comes as the region’s three MEPs leave the European Parliament ahead of Brexit.
Border Communities Against Brexit expressed relief that a hard border with security check points appeared to have been avoided but warned the process was not over and there remained the risk of a damaging no-deal on trade.
Speaking on the Northern Ireland side of the border, campaigner Declan Fearon said: “Today we meet all the parties at Stormont and one of things we would like to impress upon them is the urgent need for both the Executive in Stormont and the Irish Government to address the issue of representation for communities.
“We are entitled to be represented in Europe, we are still part of the single market, we should have that representation at the table, even in an advisory role.
“We have actually spoken to Mr Verhofstadt (former Brexit co-ordinator for the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt) and members of the European Union on that issue and he said they had absolutely no problem whatsoever in allowing that to happen.
“It’s up to the Irish Government especially and indeed to the new Executive at Stormont to make sure that they push for that to happen.”

Updated 9 September 2020
THE UK HAS officially Brexited.
Great Britain left the European Union on 31 January 2020 following a deal – the one we know as the Withdrawal Agreement.
Although it is no longer a member state, the transition period allowed for the status quo (the UK still follows all EU rules and trade conditions haven’t changed) to continue as the two sides hashed out what their future relationship would look like.
That 11-month period is now getting dangerously close to its finish line and there is yet to be a trade deal signed.

In typical Brexit tradition, it hasn’t been smooth sailing.
And 31 December 2020 is probably the hardest of the hard deadlines in the process.
If the transition period ends with no trade deal, the UK will automatically leave the single market and customs union with no fallback option. Tariffs and border checks would be required at all UK/EU borders.
Whatever your walk in life, you’ll want (and need) to know what’s happening in the coming weeks. The future relationship will impact everything from healthcare to transport and the Premier League to Northern Ireland peace.

Javid originally ordered production of the celebratory coins in advance of the original departure date of October 31.

But the Brexit delay meant about a million coins had to be melted down and the metal put aside until a new exit date was confirmed.
The Chancellor has now unveiled coins bearing the inscription “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” and the date of 31 January.
He said: “Leaving the European Union is a turning point in our history and this coin marks the beginning of this new chapter.”
About three million Brexit coins will enter circulation around the UK from Friday, with a further seven million to be added later in the year.
Javid, who is Master of the Mint, was given the first batch of coins, and will present one to Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week.

TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said he is sick of talking about Brexit but that Ireland does not have the luxury to turn a blind eye as the UK enters the transition period where trade and movement will be negotiated.
Speaking at Dublin Port this morning, Coveney said: “Brexit is going to dominate Irish politics for at least the next 12 to 18 months. I know that the public are fed up talking about Brexit – so am I, quite frankly.
“But we don’t have the luxury of not talking about Brexit and preparing for it.”
He also took aim at Micheál Martin and Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson, Lisa Chambers, who he said don’t “seem to want to talk about Brexit, and I don’t know why”.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Meanwhile, he earlier said that without a “level playing field” there will be no EU trade deal with Britain post-Brexit.
Coveney said any diversion from Britain on workers’ rights or competition rules will see negotiations for a future trading relationship with the EU scuppered.
“There won’t be a trade deal if there isn’t a level playing field, one that is robust and credible,” he said.

“Standards will have to be maintained in regards to environmental standards, or workers’ rights and so on.
“That is only half of the challenge, the other half is around fair competition. If the UK is trying to derive a competitive advantage for its own companies in order to trade into the EU – if that’s the objective there will be no trade deal.”
Coveney added that Boris Johnson would have to respond to concerns within the business community if that were the case: “You’re not going to disadvantage your own companies by not adhering to state aid competition rules for instance.”
He added that Britain has “tied its own hands” in terms of ruling out an extension to the 12-month time period for negotiations, and said both the UK and EU will need to prepare for damage control as some areas will be prioritised over others.
“The EU wants a deal but recognises a full future relationship deal is not possible by the end of year, so we will have to prioritise within the negotiations.
“The EU will prioritise a good deal on fishing as part of negotiations for a free trade agreement that may be limited in scope but tries to provide one that doesn’t involve tariffs and quotas, that’s going to cause a lot of political tension (in Britain) because promises were made.
“The EU is pragmatic and wants to work in partnership with the UK, but make no mistake, they will defend their own interests, that’s what a trade deal is about.
“Really the tone of these negotiations will be determined by the UK’s approach, I hope we don’t get the sabre rattling we’ve seen in the last round, there was too much grand standing and not enough recognition of real and legal consequences.
“The EU is an open book, very predictable, very treaty based, and the UK know only too well, if they’re not willing to approach negotiations in that knowledge, we’re going to have real problems.
“The EU will not be taken for granted and will always protect the interests of those staying in the union first and that’s why things may be difficult.”

Coveney added that a deal around security, energy, data and other areas will not be possible to conclude by the end of the year.
He added that it is “unlikely” that the prime minister will ask for an extension, adding they were “not getting into playing games”, but hopes Johnson would seek an extension, for which a protocol was included within the Withdrawal Agreement, if necessary.
“From an Irish perspective, we’ll be looking for a full implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, the setting up of committees to examine how Northern Ireland will operate in the EU customs code,” he said.
“There is no other option to have some form of checks (on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland), if you’re going to avoid border checks and Boris Johnson has signed up to that now and there has to be follow through, so that the Withdrawal Agreement is implementable.
“There is a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it, that’s why I think the EU will want to finalise the negotiation mandate quickly,” Coveney added, noting that he believed the draft mandate for the negotiations will be confirmed by the European Council on 25 February.
Coveney said that he thought of Friday, 31 January as a “very sad day”, adding: “I think everybody is losing here, Britain will be weaker in terms of global standing for not having the support of the EU.
“The EU will be weaker for not having the strength that Britain brings and Ireland will be somewhat weaker because our relationship is going to change with the UK, and you have to ask yourself, for what?
“I think history will judge this decision as a mistake, but a decision the UK is entitled to make.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-settlement-scheme-5098934-May2020/,"MORE THAN 3.5 million applications have now been received for the EU settlement scheme in the UK, according to the British Home Office.
EU citizens are asked to apply by June next year in order to carry on living and working in the UK after freedom of movement with the European Union ends.
The department said 3.56 million was the best approximate up-to-date figure available and it was unable to give a specific number from the internal data calculations.
The news comes after last month immigration experts warned gaps in UK government data were making it difficult to know whether the scheme is working.
According to official data published today, more than 3.4 million (3,468,670) applications were received by the end of March.
This is slightly lower than previous estimates but the Home Office document said published figures “may not necessarily match monthly totals” as they are all experimental, meaning the exact numbers are provisional and yet to be finalised.
Some 493,800 applications were for children and 78,850 were from people aged 65 and over.
Northern Ireland had a “noticeably higher proportion” (18%) of applications from those under the age of 18 compared to the rest of the UK.
A decision has been made on more than 3.1 million (3,147,140) applications, leaving a backlog of 321,530 still to complete.
Some 58% (1,813,390) of concluded applications were granted settled status – giving them permanent leave to remain living and working in the UK – while 41% (1,299,350) were given pre-settled status, where they would need to re-apply again after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence.
There have been 23,740 applications which were withdrawn or “void”, 10,030 classed as invalid and 640 refused, according to the figures.
Applications from British citizens – who already have a right to live in the country and would not require leave to remain in the country – are among those which would be classed as void, the Home Office said.

Refusals are made on eligibility or suitability grounds.
Applications are refused when someone is a serious or persistent offender or when someone does not meet the criteria for the scheme – if they are not living in the UK or are not from one of the countries which can apply.
But it may also be when insufficient proof of residence has been provided.
Overall, the highest number of applications continued to be from Polish, Romanian and Italian nationals.
Ealing, west London, had the highest number of applications from Polish nationals (16,630) of all local authorities.
Newham, east London, was the local authority area which saw the most applications submitted by residents (84,950).
Outside of London, the highest number came from people living in the Midlands – Birmingham (71,790) followed by Leicester (55,930).
Campaigners have called for the scheme’s deadline to be extended because of delays caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Documents could not be accepted by post, scanning facilities and a helpline for applications had closed, and charities were unable to meet applicants needing help and advice in person during the pandemic, the Commons Home Affairs Committee heard last month.
The Home Office has since said the helpline is now back up and running.
In March, the number of applications being submitted and finalised each dropped by more than 100,000, showing the lowest monthly totals since June last year.
But Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs the scheme was a “success” and she saw no reason for an extension as there is still just over a year left to apply.
She insisted support for applicants had not stopped and the Home Office was still receiving around 2,000 applications every day.
Announcing the latest figures, immigration minister Kevin Foster described the scheme as “the biggest of its kind in British history”, adding that there was “still plenty of time left to apply”.

EUROPEAN MINISTERS HAVE signed off on Brussels’ red lines for the forthcoming post-Brexit trade talks with the UK.
The proposals put into writing warnings by Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief negotiator, that Britain must sign up to a “level playing field” in any free trade agreement.
The level playing field stipulation could see Brussels attempt to bounce the UK into following some EU rules and standards after the Brexit transition period ends in 2021, a concession British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already ruled out.
In its negotiation mandate, the EU stated that any future relationship with the UK should be “underpinned by robust commitments to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition, given the EU and the UK’s geographic proximity and economic interdependence”.
On fisheries, the EU General Affairs Council, at its meeting this morning, also agreed to negotiate to “uphold the existing reciprocal access to waters” – a move that is set to flare tensions with Brexiteers and British fishermen.
Johnson used a speech in Greenwich in London earlier this month to announce that, once free of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, “British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats”.
Croatian Europe minister Andreja Metelko-Zgombic said the EU is “ready” to commence trade talks now its mandate had been ratified.
He said: “The council has adopted a clear and strong mandate for our negotiator, Michel Barnier.
“This confirms our readiness to offer an ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced partnership to the UK for the benefit of both sides.

“The EU is now ready to start negotiations.”
Cultural objects
The terms also include a controversial clause stating that Britain should “return unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin”.
The passage is thought to refer to the Elgin Marbles – ancient Greek sculptures brought to Britain more than 200 years ago and now on display in the British Museum.
Greece has been vocal about demanding the return of the marble sculptures, which once adorned the Greek Parthenon temple, to Athens.
Downing Street has insisted that the future of the marbles is “not up for discussion as part of our trade negotiations”.

In Westminster, Johnson is chairing a meeting of senior ministers on his Brexit committee ahead of the publication of the UK’s negotiating position on Thursday.
British ministers are expected to seek a Canada-style agreement with zero tariffs, a proposal Johnson and his Europe adviser, David Frost, have set out in speeches in recent weeks.
But the push for a Canada-style deal could set up a clash with the EU after Barnier ruled out such an agreement.
He has previously said the UK is too close in proximity to be permitted to compete with the other 27 member states on such terms.

Frost and his team will head to Brussels for the first round of negotiations on 2 March, after being armed with the UK’s own mandate.
The tight time schedule for the talks remains an issue, with European ministers voicing concerns over the Prime Minister’s unwillingness to extend the deadline beyond December.
Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, arriving at the council meeting in Brussels, warned of the “immense” time pressure facing both sides as they attempt to agree a future trading relationship.
“The time pressure is immense, the interests are huge – it’s a very complicated treaty – so it will be very hard work. A tough road ahead,” he told reporters.

Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the EU was making a “generous and fair” offer to the UK, but warned Johnson not to renege on the commitments made in the Withdrawal Agreement.
His comments follow reports that Johnson has ordered his Brexit team to find ways to “get around” the Northern Ireland protocol which aims to avoid the introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson is expected to meet Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at Number 10 today as part of his diplomatic efforts with EU leaders before talks commence.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-fishers-brexit-disappointment-5310646-Dec2020/,"AN IRISH FISHING industry group has reacted angrily to the terms of a post-Brexit trade agreement between the UK and the European Union.
Under the deal announced today, the EU will hand back to the UK 25% of the value of fish stocks caught by European boats in British waters, having originally proposed to hand back between just 15% and 18%.
Earlier this week, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier rejected a push by UK diplomats to reduce EU access to British fish stocks by as much as 35%.
The compromise is being hailed by the British government as a significant increase in the quota for UK fishers.
But the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation (KFO), which represents Donegal fishermen, has said today that it won’t accept the new arrangements, which will reduce its members’ access to UK waters.
“In spite of a seismic effort to redress the imbalance of the proposed deal in recent days, not enough has changed and our highly-developed mackerel fishery stands to lose out dramatically,” said Seán O’Donoghue, KFO chief executive.
“While the full detail of the text is not yet available, it will require very close examination and analysis. Make no mistake – we will be seeking compensation from our EU colleagues to put right this grievous wrong.
“We won’t accept this. Moreover, we fully expect the Irish Government to deliver the requisite compensation in the form of transfer of mackerel quota from the other EU coastal states which pro-rata, have seen a much less severe impact on their respective mackerel fisheries.”

Commenting on the announcement of the deal this evening, the Taoiseach conceded that the agreement will be disappointing for Irish fishers.
“But compared with the prospect of ‘no-deal’, which would have seen them completely excluded from British waters, the negotiators have worked hard to minimise the damage,” Micheál Martin said in a statement.
“The Government will work to ensure that the sector and the coastal communities that depend on it are supported through the period ahead.”
Costs and delays
Business groups, meanwhile, have expressed relief that a trade deal was reached before the end of the Brexit withdrawal period on 1 January.
“It is a major relief for Irish businesses exporting to the UK that the threat of about €2 billion annual tariffs has now been removed,” said Danny McCoy, chief executive of business lobby group IBEC.
“However,” he warned, “the trading conditions for Irish business with our nearest neighbour will be very different, involving complex customs procedures and more costly transport options.”
The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has also welcomed the announcement but added that the agreement will cost Irish businesses in the end.
Its director-general, John McGrane said, “Although the agreement protects the free trade of goods, businesses still face increased costs and delays and disruption in areas such as financial services amongst others. This will add new costs to businesses at a time when they are looking to recover from the ever-growing impacts of Covid-19.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-uk-parliament-approves-brexit-deal-4976360-Jan2020/,"LAST UPDATE|23 Jan 2020
QUEEN ELIZABETH II has given royal assent to the legislation for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU with an agreement at the end of January.
The British Prime Minister hailed the crossing of the “Brexit finish line”, despite the months of further negotiations which will be needed with Brussels to agree a trade deal.
He called for the “rancour and division” to be left behind over the UK’s departure from the European Union on 31 January.
But there was little sign of reconciliation in the House of Commons as the announcement that the legislation had been given royal assent was made by deputy speaker Nigel Evans.

SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was immediately on his feet, denouncing the “constitutional crisis” caused because the devolved administrations – including the Scottish parliament – had not given consent to the deal.
“Our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored,” he said.

It still needs to be approved by the European Parliament before ‘Brexit day’, with a vote expected on 29 January.
Johnson said the nation would “move forwards as one United Kingdom”, adding: “At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it.
“Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future – with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-parties-deadlocked-brexit-extension-5112495-Jun2020/,"A CALL TO extend the Brexit transition period to give businesses more time to deal with coronavirus has divided the Stormont executive.
SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has proposed that executive colleagues jointly urge the UK Government to ask the EU for an extension beyond the end of 2020.
While her call was backed by ministers from Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party, the DUP and UUP opposed the move, resulting in a tied vote.
Even if Mallon had secured a majority around the executive table at Monday’s meeting, the proposal would still have fallen if the DUP had voted against it, under cross-community voting rules.
During the meeting of the devolved administration, ministers agreed to revisit the issue in two weeks’ time.
Mallon said businesses and communities were “consumed” by the impact of coronavirus.
“In recognising this I brought a proposal to the executive today that as a Northern Ireland Executive we would write to the UK Government requesting an extension to the transition period, just as they have done in Scotland, just as they have done in Wales,” she said.
“It was disappointing that the DUP didn’t vote in support of my proposal.”
She added: “I think it’s very important at this time that we do all we can to protect our businesses and our communities and that is why we must request an extension of the British government.”
The EU has said it is willing to consider a two-year extension of the transition arrangements to provide time to reach a comprehensive trade agreement.

But the UK Government has insisted the transition period will end as scheduled at the end of the year.
When the transition period ends the Northern Ireland protocol will come into force – an arrangement by which the region continues to follow single market rules for goods and administers the EU’s customs code at its ports.
Later at Monday’s daily Covid-19 media briefing, DUP First Minister Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill stated their different perspectives on the call for an extension.
Foster, who said the executive’s private deliberations should not have been made public, stressed that an extension was a matter for the UK Government.
“It’s not a matter for the executive here in Stormont,” she added.
“I believe something we need to focus on doing is making sure that we have the minimum amount of risk to the Northern Ireland economy, that’s certainly where my focus is at currently in terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, and I hope it’s where the focus of my colleagues is at as well.
“I would much prefer to move forward in terms of consensus, building consensus. I think we have consensus around the fact that we all want to protect the economy of Northern Ireland after Brexit and after the transition period, and therefore we should focus on that and make sure that we do our best for the economy and the people of Northern Ireland.”
O’Neill said an extension was necessary because the local economy was “on its knees”.
“Given the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic impact that’s having on our economy, I think it’s only reasonable the deadline should be extended,” she said.
“There’s a need for an extension in order to allow us to be able to deal with the economic catastrophe that is Covid-19 and its implications for our economy.
“There isn’t anything good to come from Brexit, there should be an extension and if this is going to be foisted upon us then my opinion is that there should be an extension.
“Our local economy is on its knees because of the coronavirus epidemic and the fact that they’re having to respond and deal with all of that and to have that shock, and then to have the Brexit shock, the outcome of which remains to be seen, so there should be an extension.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ursula-johnson-4957445-Jan2020/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Jan 2020
THE EU’S TOP official has told the UK it could lose its open access to the European market if it refused to extend post-Brexit partnership talks beyond 2020.
Ursula von der Leyen’s warning to Prime Minister Boris Johnson came ahead of their first meeting in her capacity as European Commission president — and with Brexit just three weeks away.
Both sides are eager to move on from the more than three years of tumult and acrimony that followed Britain’s decision in a 2016 referendum to end its decades-long membership of the bloc.
The UK Prime Minister is expected to press home his desire to reach a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of December 2020, when the transition period is set to end.
Johnson has insisted he will not push back the deadline but critics claim that the timescale is too tight to reach a new deal, a position von der Leyen suggested today.
“There will be tough talks ahead and each side will do what is best for them,” von der Leyen said in a keynote speech at the London School of Economics.
Downing Street said last night Johnson would tell von der Leyen that “there will be no extension” to the deadline.
The UK will keep following EU rules and paying its membership fees during the transition talks.
“Having waited for over three years to get Brexit done, both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement to conclude on time,” Downing Street said.
Von der Leyen countered today that this meant Britain would probably lose unfettered access to its closest trading partner after 2020.
“With every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off,” she said.
The European Union has never reached a trade agreement with any of its partners in less than a year, most often the process taking much longer.

But Johnson is eager to brandish his Brexit credentials and reap what he considers to be the benefits of independence from Brussels.
Britain’s refusal to align itself with the bloc on issues such as environmental standards and workers’ rights could see UK companies face EU tariffs.
But it would also give Britain much more leeway in negotiating a new free trade agreement with the United States and growing countries in Asia down the line.
London’s booming financial district would also be free from outside oversight that some in the sector fear, including the outgoing head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.
“It is not desirable at all to align our approaches, to tie our hands and to outsource regulation and effectively supervision of the world’s leading complex financial system to another jurisdiction,” he told the Financial Times.
Johnson’s meeting with von der Leyen, the first since she took office, will also be attended by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Number 10 said Johnson will underline that the forthcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious free trade agreement, and not on alignment.
Brussels insisted on Monday that trade talks would not be on the agenda at the meeting.
European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said the meeting would “set the scene” for the Brexit process, but in order to launch trade talks the European Council – made up of the 27 remaining EU nations – would need to approve a mandate “and we are not at that stage yet”.
“This is not a meeting that will go into the details of the trade negotiation per se,” he added.
House of Commons
Meanwhile, MPs will continue to scrutinise the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) in the second day of its committee stage.
Yesterday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay insisted the government would stick to its EU departure timetable after facing calls to guarantee the UK will leave with a trade agreement.
The Cabinet minister said the Conservatives had committed in their manifesto to not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020.

Barclay expressed confidence in negotiating a trade agreement with the EU in the 11-month transition, but did not rule out a no-deal arrangement.
Clause 33 of the WAB seeks to prohibit ministers from trying to extend the implementation period, which would begin once the UK leaves the EU on 31 January.
Labour said the WAB is a “bad deal” for the UK and called on the government to come forward with proposals to show how it will avoid the “catastrophe of no-deal at the end of this year”.

Today’s Commons debate on the Bill is likely to be dominated by an amendment demanding the Government continues to negotiate to take in lone child refugees from Europe after Brexit.
A clause containing a commitment to strike a deal with the EU so unaccompanied child refugees could continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after exit day was removed from the Bill when it was reintroduced to Parliament after the election.
Clause 37 replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to “make a statement” on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete.
Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer and Alf Dubs, who fled from the Nazis on the Kindertransport to Britain when he was aged six, have written to all Tory MPs calling on them to vote against the Prime Minister’s “disgraceful” change.
It comes as the Telegraph reported that the EU has warned Johnson not to water down protections for its citizens living in the UK after Brexit.
The paper said Barnier raised “issues of concern” in a letter to Mr Barclay before Christmas, in which he was said to have highlighted the need for an independent watchdog to enable EU citizens to make complaints against the government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-raab-northern-ireland-brexit-5259980-Nov2020/,"DOMINIC RAAB HAS said he is “confident” that the Northern Ireland hurdles can be overcome to ensure the UK secures a trade deal.
The UK Foreign Secretary added he believed the government would be able to allay American fears and navigate the Northern Ireland issue to satisfy allies in the US following Joe Biden’s presidential election win.
It comes as Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed during a phone call on Saturday to “redouble efforts” to reach a UK-EU trade deal and signed off on talks continuing next week.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister had told his Brussels counterpart that there remained “significant differences” in the UK-EU negotiations, with the two sides continuing to be apart on their positions over fishing rights and a level playing field agreement.
The call follows two weeks of intensified talks between the UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost and his European Union equivalent Michel Barnier ahead of further discussions between the pair in London next week.
Rabb told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve been very clear we are absolutely committed to respect the Good Friday Agreement but our argument is, and it was good to have the opportunity when I was in Washington to explain, it is the EU who has put pressure on that with the approach it has taken.
“We want to resolve all those issues with the EU – obviously the negotiations are ongoing, there is a good chance of a deal if we get the flexibility from the EU on fisheries and level-playing field.
“I’m confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively, correctly, and, as I said, we listen very carefully to our American friends, particularly on the Hill and in the Irish lobby – they feel very invested in the Good Friday Agreement, we understand that, and I pay tribute to what George Mitchell and Bill Clinton did – but it is not the UK which is putting it at risk, it is the approach of the EU.”

Asked whether a trade deal could be secured with the EU by the end of the week, the Foreign Secretary added: “I wouldn’t make assumptions, that is the one thing we know about the Brexit process.
“I spoke to David Frost yesterday, the issues are where they are. The Prime Minister has spoken to Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the Commission, and negotiations are ongoing.
“What I would say is that it still boils down to two basic issues. There is progress being made but we’ve got to see whether it is enough to get us over the line.
“There are some core interests at stake for the UK, points of democratic principle around control of our laws, control of our fisheries as an independent coastal state.
“I don’t think we can toss those aside. But if the EU shows the flexibility, the good will to meet us halfway, I am confident a deal can still be done.”
Johnson and von der Leyen’s conversation last month led to discussions being “intensified” before a fallout after the European Council meeting on 15 October briefly derailed the negotiations.
UK chief negotiator Lord Frost was in the Belgian capital to speak face-to-face with his European Union counterpart Barnier earlier this week as the deadline for doing a deal edges closer.
After Saturday’s phone call, Lord Frost tweeted: “Prime Minister Boris Johnson and commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke today about our negotiations with the EU.
“My talks with Michel Barnier will continue in London on Monday.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/barnier-boris-johnson-trade-deal-5111911-May2020/,"THE EU’S CHIEF Brexit negotiator has told Boris Johnson to stick to his promises as he warned there would not be a trade deal otherwise.
Michel Barnier appeared to play hard ball with the British prime minister ahead of a fourth round of trade talks this week as he insisted the prospect of a no-deal end to the transition period this year would be compounded by the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.
Barnier told The Sunday Times there would not be an “agreement at any cost”.
With talks on future trading arrangements seemingly in deadlock over issues like fisheries, Britain has only until July 1 to seek an extension to the transition period.
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond, former party Seanad spokesperson on EU affairs, said these warnings from Barnier are “key for Ireland”.
“This is a vital week in terms of Brexit negotiations. The clock is ticking and with no sign of the UK seeking an extension, the prospect of no deal is unfortunately very real,” Richmond said in a statement.
“Such an eventuality would be the worst case scenario for all parties and every effort should be made to avoid it. However, this requires all parties to keep their promises. Ireland in particular must be attuned to Mr Barnier’s warnings.”
Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will end the transition arrangement on schedule at the end of the year.

However, Barnier accused Britain of not keeping its commitments.
“The UK has been taking a step back – two steps back, three steps back – from the original commitments,” the EU’s chief negotiator said.
“The UK negotiators need to be fully in line with what the prime minister signed-up to with us.
“Because 27 heads of state and government and the European Parliament do not have a short memory.”
Barnier said the EU’s heads of state remembered “very clearly the text which we negotiated with Boris Johnson”.
“And we just want to see that complied with. To the letter… and if that doesn’t happen there will be no agreement,” he told the paper.
Barnier insisted UK withdrawal from the EU was a “lose-lose” for both sides, saying no-one – not even Nigel Farage – had shown there was any “added value” to the UK’s departure.
He said, therefore, the natural next step in trade negotiations was “damage limitation”, and if no agreement were reached that would result in “even more consequences” at the worst time possible, given the coronavirus pandemic.
“So, I think we have a joint responsibility in this very serious crisis, which affects so many families… with so many deaths, so many sick people, so many people unemployed… to do everything we can to reach an agreement and I very much hope that we will do so,” he said.

THE HEAD OF the UK Government Legal Department has resigned amid anger over suggestions Boris Johnson is planning to override elements of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
Sir Jonathan Jones’s departure was confirmed by the Attorney General’s Office, which declined to comment on the reason for the latest exit in a string of resignations of top civil servants.
It comes as Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis this afternoon told the House of Commons “this does break international law in a very specific and limited way”.
“We are taking the power to disapply the EU law concept of direct effect required by Article 4 in a very certain and tightly defined circumstances,” he said.

The Financial Times reported today that Jones was quitting as the department’s permanent secretary due to a dispute with Downing Street.
Two Whitehall officials were said to have told the paper that he was departing over concerns the Prime Minister wanted to row back on parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland.
A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office said: “I can confirm Sir Jonathan has resigned but cannot comment further.”
Also quitting as Treasury solicitor, his is the sixth resignation of a senior civil servant this year amid growing tensions between officials and Downing Street as Johnson and his top aide, Dominic Cummings, plan an overhaul of Whitehall.

Labour’s shadow attorney general Lord Falconer tweeted: “Jonathan Jones impressive lawyer and very decent person. Loyal civil servant.
“If he can’t stay in the public service, there must be something very rotten about this Government. Reckless, law breaking, trashing the best of the UK.”
The resignation came as the eighth round of trade deal negotiations between the UK and the EU were to get under way in London on Tuesday.
Senior EU figures were dismayed by suggestions new Brexit legislation to be introduced on Wednesday could override key elements of the Withdrawal Agreement brokered by Johnson last year.
Johnson’s official spokesman insisted the “limited clarifications” were necessary to ensure the gains from the Good Friday Agreement can be preserved in the event talks fail.
But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned there could be no backtracking by the UK on its previous commitments if it wanted to reach a free trade agreement.
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney warned that abandoning the agreement would be “a very unwise way to proceed”.
Sir Jonathan, a barrister and Queen’s Counsel, became the head of the Government Legal Department in 2014, having previously served as legal adviser to the Department for Education (DfE) and director general of the Attorney General’s Office.
His departure follows the resignation of Sir Mark Sedwill as Cabinet Secretary and of permanent secretaries Jonathan Slater, from the DfE, Sir Simon McDonald, from the Foreign Office, Sir Richard Heaton, from the Ministry of Justice, and Sir Philip Rutnam from the Home Office.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS sidestepped accusations from European leaders that he is on course to deliver a “harder Brexit” after his General Election win.
The UK Prime Minister appeared to set himself up for combative trade talks in the new year after ruling out adhering to Brussels’ rules after 2020 when the transition period ends.
He altered his own Brexit Bill this week to make it unlawful for the Government to extend the trade talks into 2021, giving negotiators an unprecedented 11 months to thrash out a free trade deal.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned that Johnson looked embarked on a “harder Brexit than we anticipated” and said he feared the UK wanted to “undercut” its European rivals on food, health and product safety after exit day.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, in an article for the Project Syndicate website, similarly said competition on social and environmental standards between UK and the EU bloc would “lead only to a race to the bottom”.
Johnson was asked about the Taoiseach’s comments while visiting British troops in Estonia today but dodged answering the question directly.
He replied:

The Conservative Party leader said there had been a “positive feeling” during his bilateral meeting with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas in the capital Tallinn.
Should the EU and UK agree to a trade deal before the end of 2020, Estonia is one of the 27 EU countries in the bloc that will have to ratify the new terms.
Johnson also spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and Downing Street said the pair discussed negotiating an “ambitious trade agreement” after Britain leaves the EU.
The PM told MPs on Friday that the “oven was on” when it came to delivering Brexit next year, but said there would be “no alignment” to EU rules during any post-exit free trade deal.
“This will be with no alignment on EU rules, but instead with control of our own laws, and close and friendly relations,” he told those on the green benches.
He made the comments after seeing his European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill passed by a 124 majority by MPs, paving the way for the UK to finalise its divorce from Brussels by the 31 January deadline.
Turning off from Brexit over the Christmas break, the PM turned his attention to other issues by making a festive trip to visit British troops stationed in the Baltic country.

Along with personnel from Estonia, France and Denmark, they lead Nato’s operation to protect Europe’s eastern border with Russia.
He told the troops their service was “incredibly important” as it allowed people in Britain to have “Christmas in peace and security”, noting how when he was a boy Estonia was still part of the Soviet Union.
His trip comes as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned serving personnel to be braced for cutbacks as part of his bid to secure more long-term investment in defence.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Political Thinking podcast, the Cabinet minister said the armed forces would need to “cut our cloth to match our ambition” in order to secure fresh funding for innovative technology.
Asked about the comments, the Johnson said: “We’re the second biggest player in Nato, we’re the biggest military in Europe – we believe in supporting our armed services.
Downing Street faced criticism from their own benches when Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving Tory MP, called the alleged decision to boycott BBC Radio 4’s Today programme “counterproductive”.
Ministers have not been interviewed on the morning radio show since Johnson’s election victory, and the PM’s chief aide Dominic Cummings reportedly told staff during the campaign not to listen to the flagship programme.
Bottomley, the Father of the House of Commons, told the Saturday edition of the programme: “There are mistakes governments can make, even in their first week, and I personally think that not coming on the Today programme when invited is unwise, injudicious, counterproductive and if you want to have me on every time a minister says no, I’ll come.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/austtralia-boris-johnson-5296271-Dec2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS been told to “be careful what you wish for” as he was given a stark warning of the torments of trading with the EU on so-called Australian terms by the nation’s previous prime minister.
Malcolm Turnbull said that Australia faces “very large barriers” to trading with the bloc and that ending the Brexit transition period on similar terms will be “pretty disappointing”.
Turnbull’s warning yesterday came after the Johnson said there is a “strong possibility” that the UK will fail to broker a trade deal with Brussels.
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said told EU leaders this morning that there were now “low expectations” a post-Brexit trade deal could be struck.
An EU official said leaders heard that the “probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal” at a brief discussion of Brexit at a marathon Brussels summit, as time ticks down to a Sunday deadline to make a call on prolonging talks or giving up
On the potential for no deal, Johnson used his euphemism ofexiting with an “Australian relationship”, with the nation not having a free trade deal with the EU and instead trading on terms set by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Turnbull, who was the Liberal Party prime minister until 2018, told BBC Question Time: “It’ll be pretty disappointing, I think you’ll find out.
“But Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one.
“There are very big barriers to Australian exports of agricultural products in particular, there’s a lot of friction in the system in terms of services, there’s a lot to aim for.
“So, you know, be careful what you wish for. Australia’s relationship with the EU is not one from a trade point of view that I think Britain would want, frankly,” the former Rhodes Scholar added.

Earlier, Johnson had told his Cabinet to “get on and make those preparations” for a departure without a trade deal, though he said negotiators would “go the extra mile” to get a treaty in time for the end of the transition period on 31 December.
“I do think we need to be very, very clear, there is now a strong possibility – a strong possibility – that we will have a solution that is much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” he said in an interview.
Johnson insists that the UK can “prosper mightily” under a no-deal but the Office for Budget Responsibility financial watchdog has suggested that a no-deal outcome could wipe 2% off gross domestic product – a measure of the size of the economy – in 2021.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-political-reaction-5310577-Dec2020/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS said that the post-Brexit trade agreement announced by the European Union and the United Kingdom today represents “a good compromise and a balanced outcome”.
In a statement, Micheál Martin said that he hopes the deal will be approved by both sides over the coming days “to allow the agreement to enter force on 1 January”.
However, while he does “respect” the UK’s choice to leave the EU, “I very much regret the decision,” he said.
“The UK was an important member of the European Union, and Ireland and the UK frequently worked closely together on many EU issues,” Martin said.
“However, as we now approach the end of the Transition Period, I wish the UK well in this new chapter in its history. The UK will always be a close friend and partner.”
On the so-called Irish Protocol contained within the agreement, Martin said he believes it is “a good outcome for the people of Northern Ireland”.
“It enables Northern Ireland business to trade smoothly with Britain and within the EU Single Market. It supports the all-island economy. It protects Ireland’s place in the EU single market and customs union. Most importantly, it avoids a return of a hard border on the island,” he said.

“I am confident that with everyone’s goodwill and working together, it will be a success.”
Commenting on the announcement, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the Good Friday Agreement has been protected in the deal.
However, she said her party is “under no illusions that there is no good Brexit for Ireland, north or south”.
In a statement, the Dublin Central TD said, “Four and a half years ago the north of Ireland voted to remain, but despite the wishes of the people it now finds itself outside of the European Union as a result of a Tory inspired Brexit.
“There will be relief that a trade deal has now been agreed between Britain and the EU and special arrangements for Ireland, encapsulated in the Irish Protocol, will be implemented.
“The Good Friday Agreement has been protected, there will be no hardening of the border and protections for the all-island economy are in place. There is also a level of certainty for businesses.
“But we are under no illusions that there is no good Brexit for Ireland, north or south, and the full consequences of this are as yet unknown.”
McDonald said that the text of the deal will now have to be studied in order to “test it against what had been set out in principle in the wider agreement, the Irish Protocol and also against the Good Friday Agreement”.
“This is not the end of the road… So we need to start the planning and we need to start talking about a future beyond Brexit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-deal-5239852-Oct2020/,"MICHEL BARNIER HAS insisted that both sides in the post-Brexit trade negotiations must be willing to compromise as efforts continued to restart the stalled process.
The European Union’s chief negotiator insisted an agreement was “within reach” despite being rebuffed in efforts to continue formal discussions this week.
Barnier and his counterpart David Frost, Boris Johnson’s Europe adviser, have remained in touch but the negotiations have been in limbo since last week’s European Council summit failed to produce a breakthrough.
The UK Government has insisted that there must be a fundamental change of approach from Brussels, with Barnier demonstrating that the EU will compromise in key areas.
The main stumbling blocks remain fishing rights, the governance of any deal and the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition, which includes state subsidies.
Time is short to reach an agreement before the end of the transition period on 31 December.
Barnier told the European Parliament: “Our door remains open. It will remain open right up until the last day when we can work together.”
But he said “it takes two to make a deal”, adding: “We are not sure that’s the outcome we will obtain and that’s why we need to be ready to deal with the consequences of a possible no-deal scenario.”
Extending an olive branch to the UK, Barnier indicated the EU was willing to make compromises – but only if Johnson also agreed to give ground.
“We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides in order to do our utmost to reach an agreement and we will do so right up until the last day which it’s possible to do so,” he said.
“Our doors will always remain open right up until the very end.”
The EU’s chief negotiator insisted: “Despite the difficulties we’ve faced, an agreement is within reach if both sides are willing to work constructively, if they are willing to compromise.”

But he warned: “Time is running out each and every day”.
Barnier said the level playing field remained a “fundamental concern”. But he added: “The UK are willing to look at this demand, and they’re willing to move forward and shift in their way of looking at this.
“They’re willing to do things in a different way to what exists in current trade deals among other countries.”
On fisheries, Barnier said: “There will not be a trade deal without a fair solution for fishermen on sides.
“There needs to be mutual access to waters and there needs to be a fair distribution of quotas for fishermen on both sides.”
European Council president Charles Michel told MEPs: “We want a deal but not at any cost.”
He added: “You can’t have your cake and eat it too”.
In London, Johnson’s efforts to win over business leaders to his approach ran into difficulties after a “pointless” call with bosses.
The Prime Minister and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove addressed around 250 business leaders yesterday, insisting the UK would prosper either with or without an EU trade deal.
“There is a big opportunity for this country and we want to help all of you to seize that opportunity,” the Prime Minister said.
But one of the business leaders on the conference call told the PA news agency: “The whole thing was over in 23 minutes. There was no opportunity to ask questions and it was completely choreographed.
“Only three people were allowed to ask questions, set up in advance, and we were essentially told ‘it will all be fine’.”
The session was described as “a little bit of a ramble and a lot of posturing”.
“It was a wasted 23 minutes of my life. It was pointless,” the source said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fisheries-brexit-2-5136959-Jul2020/,"THE DISPUTE ABOUT fisheries is a major issue in Brexit talks.
Although a debate between the UK and EU around immigration has garnered more headlines in recent years, fishing rights are perhaps the most tangible example of why the UK wanted to leave in the first place.
Around half of Ireland’s fishing catch take place in UK waters. According to the Department of Agriculture and the Marine, Ireland’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) made up 10% of the EU’s EEZ, and the UK’s EEZ made up 17%.
After Brexit, Ireland’s waters will make up 12% of EU waters.
Now that the UK is leaving (and, theoretically, taking its waters with it) Ireland’s fishermen and fishing industry are under threat of being locked out of waters that had been frequented by Irish trawlers long before either country joined the EU.
As it currently stands, the UK is still in the transition period, meaning it’s still abiding by the EU fishing rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. This dictates that EU fishing fleets have access to the 6-12 nautical mile limit around each country’s coast, and neighbouring countries have access to the 0-6 mile zone.
A preliminary target date for the fisheries agreement to be struck was today, 1 July – but as of yesterday afternoon, the two sides were still debating the shape of the new fisheries arrangement to be in place between the EU and UK from next year.
These negotiations are now expected to go on for most of July and August, and possibly into the autumn. Negotiators from Brussels are hoping the UK will give EU members access to its fishing waters so that the UK can gain access to the Single Market in return.
This week's agenda for trade talks.European UnionEuropean Union
Patrick Murphy, CEO of the Irish South & West Fish Producers Organisation Ltd said that when Ireland first joined the EU in 1973 – the EEC as it then was – it had enough fish in its own waters and close by around the UK waters, that crews from here didn’t need to develop fishing sources elsewhere.
French and Spanish coasts go too deep to trawl in, he said, so those fishermen come to the continental shelf around Ireland, the UK and Iceland where the fish come to spawn.
“We’ve the jewel in the future of European waters: our fish, they come to spawn here, they go to the juvenile stage and they swim off to all the other countries.”
But now that the UK is leaving, it’s losing half of its fishing grounds because it only ever fished in its immediate area.

Irish crews fear that if there’s no deal on fisheries and the UK leaves the EU, the waters around Ireland will see even more traffic from Spanish, French and other European trawlers.
“If you look at all the other countries, the nomads we’ll call them, they came to Ireland and England. So, even though they lose [British] grounds, they can still come into Ireland’s grounds,” said Murphy.
“We’re going to see hundreds of boats coming in on top of us if we don’t get an agreement.
This latter point about quotas is made by other fishermen too – that when Ireland entered the EU, there was more of an emphasis on agriculture than on fish, and because of that fisheries “didn’t get as good a deal as we would have hoped”.
Celtic Seas PartnershipCeltic Seas Partnership
The UK had pushed for trade talks to be split into various sectors – with fisheries split out from other trade issues. But the EU has fought against that, and they are currently being negotiated as part of the one trade deal.
Murphy insisted a fisheries agreement must remain part of the trade talks agenda. Sean O’Donoghue, CEO of the Killybegs Fisherman’s Organisation in Co Donegal, agrees.
“If fisheries was split out from trade talks, we’re in really deep trouble,” O’Donoghue said, adding that if there isn’t a fisheries deal, there won’t be a trade deal.
Access to UK waters
John Ward is CEO of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, which represents owners of trawlers and other commercial fishing vessels. He said that if Ireland loses access to UK waters, it would have “a tremendous negative effect on the Irish fishing fleet”.
“Particularly for the two main species that we fish – being mackerel and prawns.”
64% of Ireland’s largest fishery, mackerel, and 43% of our second biggest fishery, prawns, is caught in UK waters.
“If we didn’t have access to UK waters, we would only be able to fish mackerel, let’s say, in February, March, maybe April.”
O’Donoghue said that it would be “an unmitigated disaster for us”.
“If you look at it over 10 years, we’re over 60% dependent on catches of mackerel in the UK. We’re about 40% overall for all species. We share about over 50 species with the UK – the fish don’t recognise borders in the sea, as such.

He said that if we lost access to UK waters, it would halve the value of the seafood sector in two years.
He said the numbers may seem small, but they are vital to coastal communities in Ireland. The fishing sector makes up 25% of employment along Donegal’s coasts.
So what do fishermen want?
According to Murphy: “If you’re asking what do fishermen want, boil it down – we want to be protected.
“And the way we want to be protected … first of all we want the sustainability of the stock protected. We want to know how many boats are going to be allowed to come into Irish waters if the English kick them out. That’s first and foremost, it’s called displacement.”
Murphy is worried about an influx of boats coming in around Irish shores to fish there, and the danger that poses for the quality and sustainability of fish stock. It would be like hosting a football tournament, he says – but having all the teams play at once instead of one-on-one.
“So at the moment there’s a balance – boats fish all around the place, they have different ways of fishing. But if you condense them into one area, and they all keep running on the same grass at the same time, the grass won’t stand up. That’s nature. I think it’s the same for fishing.
“They want to keep the same [Common Fisheries Policy], even though the UK is taking away one third of the waters and one third of the fish out of the pot.”
“England and Ireland would be the kingpins over the fishing industry in Europe if we had nobody else there. We would be the guys with the goldmines.”
This week marks the first face-to-face Brexit talks since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are being held in Brussels, with the level playing field request by the EU still proving to be the biggest stumbling block to agreeing a deal.
Negotiators have until the end of the year to reach an EU-UK trade deal; the UK had he option of requesting an extension, but have refused that option repeatedly. The deadline to avail of that offer was yesterday, 30 June.
A claim was made in this article that over two-thirds of the EU’s fishing waters, and two-thirds of the EU’s fishing catch, belong to Ireland and the UK.This article by FullFactfound that the waters around the UK make up 13% of EU waters. The UK government has accepted this proportion in a statement to FullFact.
But in a statement provided to TheJournal.ie, the Department of Agriculture and Marine said that Ireland’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) made up 10% of the EU’s EEZ and the UK’s EEZ made up 17%. After Brexit, Irish waters will make up 12% of EU waters.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-brexit-deal-likely-5246292-Oct2020/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney said a post-Brexit trade deal is “likely” but it will not be easy.
He described talks between the EU and the UK as currently being in a “very serious zone” and said he is “under no illusion of the challenges” as they try to come to an agreement.
He said the next 10 to 14 days is the “realistic” timeline now “to complete this”.
“We’re likely to get a deal but it won’t be easy,” Coveney said.
Talks between the EU and the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal will take place in Brussels from Thursday.
The EU, led by Michel Barnier, and the UK, led by David Frost, have been meeting in London since the negotiations restarted last week.
Coveney made the comments today during a Irish Farmers’ Journal webinar.
The Fine Gael TD said the EU is working towards a “no trade deal Brexit” and there will be “no more extensions of time” when it came to the negotiations.
“There’s no such thing as a no-deal Brexit any more, what we’re now fighting for is a no trade deal Brexit which from an agricultural perspective would be hugely disruptive on many, many levels,” he said.

“We’ve got to be ready for January 1, there’s going to be no more extensions of time, no more transition periods.
“Time is up at the end of the year.”
He said there will be a new trading environment on January 1 whether or not a trade deal is reached.
“If there’s no trade deal it’ll be on the basis of WTO standards,” he said.
“If there is a trade deal that will avoid tariffs and quotas but we will still, unfortunately, have a lot of disruption to trade.”
He warned it will take “some getting used to” for many businesses and they need to prepare for January 1.
“This is a new reality, we wish it wasn’t happening but it is,” he said.
“Businesses have 65 days to get their act together.”
Coveney added: “Can we get a deal? Yes we can. This is doable but difficult.”

Minister of State for Skills and Further Education Niall Collins is today highlighting the support available through Skillnet Ireland’s Clear Customs programme.
Clear Customs is an online training programme to support affected Irish companies develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements that will be needed from 1 January 2021.
Businesses, trading either with or through Great Britain, will be subject to a range of new customs and regulatory requirements from that date.
It’s estimated that the number of customs declarations required will increase from 1.6 million annually to 20 million after the UK’s departure from the Customs Union and Single Market.

The Clear Customs initiative is being made available immediately to eligible businesses free of charge and is being delivered through a new mobile app and virtual classroom training sessions.
“Over 90,000 Irish businesses trade with or through Great Britain every year. The Clear Customs programme is designed to address the needs of each of those businesses. It supports skills development that will help prepare your businesses for Brexit, and support future growth,” Minister for State Niall Collins said.
Since its launch on 10 September, there have been over 750 applications from companies for the programme.
Skillnet Ireland chief executive Paul Healy said: “We want to increase the reach of the programme to those businesses that are not yet prepared for the changes underway.
“To ensure they have enough time to complete the course, which is five weeks in duration, we would urge companies to sign up sooner rather than later.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eu-trade-talks-2-4996717-Feb2020/,"
LAST SATURDAY, THE day after Britain finally left the EU, was the first anniversary of the EU-Japan trade deal coming into force.
According to the European Commission, in its first year the economic pact has led to boosts in exports of wine, dairy, meat and machinery. In Ireland, Bord Bia has been the EU’s partner in promoting EU beef in Japan.
When the Japan deal was signed, after years of negotiations, European officials were quick to herald the agreement as a significant victory while Brexit rumbled on in London and Brussels.
The deal with Japan may have taken years of negotiation, meanwhile the EU’s agreement in principle last year with the Mercosur – the trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay – took two decades.
Even after such a long negotiation period, the deal was met with fierce criticism as Irish farmers have protested that the deal will see cheaper South American beef products undercutting them.
This is the reality of trade talks and deal-making. They’re long, laborious and contentious with many variables at play. With Britain now out of the EU, the clock is ticking to get a post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the end of the year, before WTO rules kick in bringing significant tariffs for Ireland with them.
Hard graft
For every step forward like the EU-Canada agreement, there’s a knockback – such as the Belgian region of Wallonia wielding its opposition to that agreement.
This is the environment that the UK is entering now as a third country, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant that a deal with the EU can be struck by the end of 2020.
For critics of Johnson, this is fanciful. For Johnson, it’s an ambitious play to prove Brexit was worth it.
EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said that the EU will set out its mandate for the talks by the end of February. Then the hard graft will begin.
Phil HoganFlickr / Arno MikkorFlickr / Arno Mikkor / Arno Mikkor
The EU-UK talks have a unique bent as both sides are entering from positions where there are no pre-existing trade barriers and they are now about to put ones up.
Everything will be on the table from custom checks to fisheries, data transfers to police cooperation, meat and dairy to financial services and every nugget in between.
An early tiff has already emerged in Europe seeking access to British territorial waters for fishing.
The UK will be out of the single market and customs union so unlike non-EU members like Norway, it will not be beholden to any EU rules and foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said that the UK will not align with EU rules, which throws a spanner in the works from the off.

Michel Barnier has said that a deal for the UK where there are zero tariffs and quotas “won’t happen for nothing and without conditions”.
The UK is keen to secure a “Canada-style” deal which would see most tariffs dropped. That would be ideal for Johnson and co but what will the EU want in return?
Each member state can veto a deal and Ireland’s position on certain issues could change between now and when talks fully kick off. With Fine Gael trailing in the opinion polls ahead of this Saturday’s general election, Varadkar may not be the Taoiseach to helm Ireland into this tricky time.
Standards
There will be plenty of talk of a “level playing field” where the EU will expect the UK to share certain standards, such as policy on state aid, workers’ rights and environmental standards.
For Ireland, the risks are acute. Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, toldForathat the agri-food sector is particularly at risk.
“There is a great fear that if the UK diverges away from the European Union on standards then what type of foodstuffs will it allow into the market? And what kind of a competitive threat is that for Ireland?” McKeever said.

Another issue relates to standards around state aid and foreign direct investment. When the UK is completely independent of the EU, it could alter standards to become more attractive to foreign direct investment and “that would be a threat to us as well”.
If a deal emerges from these talks, it will also have some influence on the trade deals the UK strikes elsewhere, especially with countries that already have existing deals or engagements with the EU.
“I think that a country that sits in some part of the world that is trying to do business with both the EU and the UK will want to see some kind of equivalence across standards and I think that will be challenging for the UK,” McKeever explained.
He added that the tight timeline for getting a deal done limits the scope of what can be achieved.
The EU will set its mandate at the end of this month and a deal will need to be reached by October to be ratified by the European Parliament by December. The reality is that the timeline is about eight months and Johnson has been resolute in saying he would not seek an extension.
“It’s condensed into a very short period and all the threats haven’t gone away,” McKeever said. “People will still need to be getting themselves ready for customs and all the paperwork that is going to take place. You can’t let up on this in any way, shape or form.”
If no arrangement is made by year’s end, the dreaded cliff-edge Brexit that we’ve heard so much about since 2016 will effectively come to pass.

A POST-BREXIT trade deal can be struck within days, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said today as he urged European Union members to “hold our nerve”.
UK and EU negotiators, led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, talked late into last night, fortified by a delivery of pizzas, as efforts continued to thrash out a deal which needs to be in place by the end of the month.
Coveney said there is still a “good chance” a deal can be done.
“It’s the time to hold our nerve, to trust Michel Barnier, who has done a phenomenal job to date,” he said.
“I believe, if we do that, there’s a good chance that we can get a deal across the line in the next few days.”

Downing Street sources played down the prospect of an imminent breakthrough. “I haven’t seen any white smoke,” one insider told the PA news agency.
No-deal scenario
Businesses are frustrated with the uncertainty around trading arrangements once the UK leaves the single market and customs union at the end of the year.
Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy told Sky News the supermarket giant is preparing for a no-deal scenario.
“We have been doing everything in our power to make sure that we are well placed to continue trading, to continue to supply our customers regardless of whether there is or isn’t a no-deal Brexit,” he said.
“The biggest challenge we face really is the movement of product between borders, the movement of product between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, of course, between mainland Europe and the UK.
“That’s the one area where we really would urge the government to give us some clarity and to allow us to prepare event better for the end of December.”

Yesterday Boris Johnson used the language of the referendum campaign to spell out to Brussels that the UK’s “bottom line” on a post-Brexit trade deal is to “take back control”.
The UK prime minister said he is “absolutely committed” to trying to secure a deal “if we can” amid warnings that talks with the EU have reached a “make or break” point.
Reports have suggested that the UK has watered down its demands for control of fishing rights, by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks currently caught rather than the 80% previously sought.
But this falls short of EU demands in one of the most symbolically important aspects of the negotiations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-no-real-sign-trade-talks-5093564-May2020/,"THE EU TRADE Commissioner Phil Hogan has said that the UK has shown “no real sign” that they want the trade negotiations to succeed, or culminate in a deal.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme, Phil Hogan said: “There is no real sign that our British friends are approaching the negotiations with a plan to succeed.
“I hope I am wrong, but I don’t think so.”
He added that the British government and politicians “have certainly decided that Covid is going to be blamed for all the fallout from Brexit”.

“My perception of it is they don’t want to drag the negotiations out into 2021 because they can effectively blame Covid for everything.”
Speaking to a House of Commons committeelast week, senior minister Michael Gove said that the EU negotiating team “regard the UK not as a sovereign state, but on the path to EU membership”, instead of a member state leaving the EU.
He also said that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the organisations arguing for an extension because of the Covid-19 pandemic, had argued for an extension before, “so that while things have changed, they also have not changed”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Dáil that his hopes for the next round of negotiations was “not good”, based on the evidence so far.
“The EU has said that we need a comprehensive agreement that involves multiple different areas that are all interconnected from level playing field, to fishing, to market access, to ensuring we tariff free and quota free trade, and a whole range of other things.
“The easy thing is to call for an extension,” he said, adding that they have to think of a way that’s politically palatable for them to accept an extension, but they are “unlikely” to get a request for more time from the UK.

The pair held a phone call last night, when they discussed Brexit negotiations, climate change and their respective efforts to curbing the spread of Covid-19.
“The leaders updated one another on their respective efforts to tackle coronavirus and the steps they have taken to ensure people in the UK and Ireland can enjoy Christmas as safely as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement.
“They discussed shared challenges including the environment and committed to working together ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 summit next year.
“They discussed the progress in the UK-EU trade negotiations and the Prime Minister underlined his commitment to reaching a deal that respects the sovereignty of the UK.
“The leaders also reaffirmed the need to prioritise the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.”

The Belfast solicitor was shot by loyalist paramilitaries, amid claims of collusion with state security forces.
His widow Geraldine and son John met Martin at Government Buildings in Dublin this week, and the Taoiseach later told the Dáil that the need for a public inquiry was agreed as far back as 2001 and that the UK should stick to that agreement.

With just 10 weeks until the transition finishes, Johnson and the senior Cabinet minister Michael Gove will use a conference call today to tell business leaders they should be ready for major change regardless of whether there is a deal with Brussels.
The warning comes after the British government rebuffed a fresh attempt by the EU to restart the negotiations on a post-Brexit free trade deal agreement after they were abruptly halted by the Prime Minister.
In the aftermath of last week’s EU summit in the Belgian capital, he accused the EU leaders of seeking to impose “unacceptable” conditions on the UK and said there was no basis for talks without a “fundamental change of approach” from Brussels.

🇪🇺🇬🇧 I just spoke to@DavidGHFrost.As stated by President@vonderleyenon Friday, I confirmed that the EU remains available to intensify talks in London this week, on all subjects, and based on legal texts.We now wait for the UK’s reaction.
Yesterday, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier appeared to hold out an olive branch, offering to intensify talks with negotiations based on legal texts – two key British demands.
Initially, the offer was welcomed in the Commons by Gove as a “constructive move”.
But while No 10 acknowledged that there had been a “constructive discussion” between Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost, it said there was still no basis to resume negotiations.
“This means an EU approach consistent with trying to find an agreement between sovereign equals and with acceptance that movement needs to come from the EU side as well as the UK,” a spokesman said.
In the Commons, Gove said it was “almost incredible” that the EU had so far refused to discuss legal texts but suggested Barnier’s statement demonstrated the Government’s “firmness” was producing results.

The major stumbling blocks remain access for EU boats to UK fishing grounds and the “level playing field” rules to ensure fair competition – including any state subsidies that the UK government might seek to give to UK firms.
Under the transition arrangements – which kicked in after the UK left the EU at the end of January – Britain has continued to enjoy full access to the single market and customs union, but that is due to end at the end of the year.
While Gove acknowledged that leaving the transition period without a trade deal would cause “some turbulence”, he insisted there could be no going back.
Meanwhile, the British government has launched a “time is running out” campaign urging businesses to get ready for the end of the transition period on December 31, regardless of whether a trade deal is in place.
Business leaders, however, have urged both sides to compromise, warning a final no-deal break – with the imposition of tariffs, quotas and customs controls – would deliver another blow to an economy still reeling from the impact of coronavirus.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-meps-brexit-2-4869474-Oct2019/,"TWO IRISH MEPs have voiced their frustration at not being able to take their place in the European Parliament due to the Brexit impasse.
On Friday, European Ambassadors postponed a decision on how long to delay the UK’s departure from the European Union. It was envisaged that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October.
Barry Andrews, a first-time candidate for Fianna Fail in Dublin, and Deirdre Clune – a sitting Fine Gael MEP re-elected for the Ireland South constituency – were due to take the seats they won in May when the UK left the EU.
However, the date for Britain leaving the EU looks set to extend beyond the end of October and the pair say they are in limbo until a date is confirmed.
‘Frustrating’
A European Parliament spokesman has confirmed the two MEPs have no formal or informal position, expenses or facilities until the UK leaves the European Union.
Under EU law, 751 MEPs, including 73 from the UK, were elected following the European elections in May.
Advertisement
Eleven Irish MEPs were elected – four from Midlands North West, four from South and three from Dublin.
The elections were conducted with an extra seat in the South and Dublin constituencies, but the winners of those two seats cannot take their place in parliament until the British MEPs leave.
Andrews said in the meantime he has been keeping busy with speaking engagements and voluntary work.
“Obviously it is frustrating from a personal standpoint,” he said.
“It is obviously not in my interests to say that but it is in the national interest and it looks as if we are reaching an end point to the Brexit process and it is no longer a question of if they will leave, but when. There is not a lot we can do until we get that final clarity.”
Clune won the last seat in the Ireland South constituency following several days of recounts.
“Back in May, we thought we would be good to go in October but all we can do is wait,” she said.
“It remains to be seen if there will be a general election in the UK as well.

“There is no point getting uptight or annoyed about things that are totally out of my control.
“There is a new commissioner coming in November and that is when the real work begins. There are 27 people in this situation around the EU waiting to take up a position so we’re all in the same boat.”
Clune said she is lucky because, unlike Mr Andrews, as a former MEP she is entitled a “transitional allowance” ie her full salary.
“I am doing a course in corporate governance in University College Dublin and I have been keeping on top of reading files about all that is going on in the European Parliament as you would when you are a MEP,” she said.
All the UK MEPs were due to leave the European Parliament on 31 October but this remains up in the air until an official leave date is announced.
“Until that point, there is no legal basis for the European Parliament to attribute any particular status to these two individuals,” the European Parliament spokesman said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/boris-johnson-illegal-5204355-Sep2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S DECISION to break international law by reneging on the Northern Ireland Brexit Protocol, which was negotiated, agreed and ratified by his Government, has done immense, possibly irreparable, damage to Britain’s reputation and influence.
One only has to imagine the laughter in Tehran at the recent insistence of UK Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, that Iran should respect its international commitments. The Chinese Government’s shameful propagandists on Hong Kong will be celebrating this gratuitous manna from heaven.
It is important therefore to ask “why on earth did Johnson do it?”. What could possibly be in it for him or for his country? Before considering what might be the real reasons, it is important to look at the series of threadbare excuses put forward by Johnson and his apologists.
As a general rule, someone who offers several diverse explanations for their behaviour is both unconvincing and disingenuous. The British Government has proffered at least five separate excuses.
Johnson’s poker game
To start with the most ludicrous of the excuses, Johnson claims that the Withdrawal Agreement, so carefully designed and agreed by the EU and UK to protect the Northern Ireland peace process, must be repudiated in order to protect that process.
Those who drove the Brexit referendum in 2016, including Johnson, paid no heed whatever to the sensitivities of the Good Friday Agreement and dismissed all warnings including from the senior British politicians who made the Agreement possible. Former PMs Major and Blair have expressed outrage at the latest mendacity.
Johnson’s continued lack of interest in, or empathy for, Northern Ireland was confirmed by his allegation in Saturday’s Daily Telegraph that the European Union has threatened to impose a blockade on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Advertisement
This entirely false statement, unrelated to the provisions of the draft legislation and designed to win over wavering Conservative backbenchers, was tone deaf, emotive and dangerous in the context of Northern Ireland.
The second excuse, also briefed by Johnson’s people to the media, was that he had known all along that the Northern Ireland Protocol would never work. Internal British briefing papers confirm that the UK Government knew exactly what was in the Protocol.
The British people should not hold their breath waiting for an apology for having been repeatedly assured during last December’s general election campaign that the Brexit deal was oven-ready and in Britain’s clear interests.
The third explanation, namely that the deal was rushed, entirely ignores the seriousness with which every country is obliged to approach the value of its word, the binding nature of its international treaties and the dignity of its sovereignty.
‘Bad faith’
Fourthly, it has been suggested by some of those sent out to bat for Johnson that the UK is entitled to break international law because the EU is acting in bad faith, a claim that is not only false but also more than a bit rich in the circumstances.
This nebulous argument only has meaning in the Alice and Brexitland world in which every Humpty Dumpty can happily proclaim that “when I say a word, it means just what I choose it to mean”.
Fifthly, it is argued that the British Government is, after all, acting legally. This risible claim is contradicted both by the resignation of the UK’s most senior legal official and, explicitly, by the Northern Ireland Secretary in the House of Commons.
Every excuse, short of Johnson eating his own homework, has been put forward. Since all of these can be dismissed, the intriguing question is what Johnson’s real motivation could have been in pursuing a policy that significantly damages the UK’s interests and standing. There seem to be four plausible explanations.
Ask yourself: why now?
First, those close to Johnson’s have apparently convinced him of the need to distract British public attention from his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, to which the strange driving patterns of his closest advisor made such a spectacular and indelible contribution.
The Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, seems to interpret Johnson’s intentions in this way, as evidenced by his decision during recent Prime Minister’s questions to focus on Covid-19 rather than on the Government’s egregious law-breaking.
Second, one should not underestimate the role that creating disruption for its own sake – disruption of political norms, democratic institutions and international rules – plays in the populist, Trump-inspired Cummings game-plan.
Related ReadsBrexit rebellion: David Cameron raises concerns over controversial bill, making a clean sweep of former PMsWhere does Ireland's Europe minister think Brexit talks stand now?Opinion: Is Britain on the path to becoming a rogue state?
Third, any insult to the EU, the more gratuitous the better, is red meat to the tame, fact-free parts of the media on which the Government is so heavily reliant.
Finally, importantly, it is possible that the move was designed to provoke the EU into pulling out of the Brexit trade deal negotiations, thus providing London with a weapon in its long-strategised fall-back blame game.
This is a game which the UK Government has already lost comprehensively across Europe and around the world but for which some of the domestic battleground is still to play for.
The EU would be justified, by any reasonable standards, in walking away from discussions with a negotiating partner that has just demonstrated its disdain for a previous treaty on which the ink is not yet dry.
Fortunately, the European Commission, backed forcefully by all 27 European Governments, is too experienced to fall into that trap. The EU is cleverly treating the two strands of the negotiation separately.
It is planning to “float like a butterfly and sting like a bee”. On the one hand, in the future trade negotiations, Michel Barnier is continuing to discuss calmly and in good faith, even with a partner that has not shown similar good faith.
On the other hand, in the Joint Committee on implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol, Commissioner Maros Sefcovic has made clear that the EU will under no circumstances accept the unilateral rewriting of the Protocol.
A growing number of decent British politicians are still hoping to block the latest assault on British values. If they fail, the EU will ensure that the ball remains in Johnson’s court. His Government will deserve and bear the blame if the Brexit negotiations fail.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bosi-johnson-queens-speech-4941265-Dec2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has unveiled what he called the “most radical Queen’s Speech in a generation” with measures to toughen up criminal justice, invest in the NHS and deliver on the “people’s priorities”.
Johnson’s legislative programme includes Bills which will ensure the most serious violent offenders – including terrorists – serve longer prison terms.
A Royal Commission will be established to improve the “efficiency and effectiveness” of the criminal justice process, and the British government will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service’s funding, with an extra £33.9 billion (about €40 villain) per year provided by 2023/24.
Of the 25 Bills detailed in Johnson’s second Queen’s Speech in less than three months, seven are devoted to Britain’s departure from the EU – with legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law.
The key Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) – which implements Johnson’s Brexit deal – would allow the UK to leave on 31 January, and deliver an implementation period until 31 December 2020.
Addressing both Houses of Parliament, the Queen said her government’s “priority” was to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January – but that it would also embark on an “ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people’s priorities”.

She said the “integrity and prosperity” of the UK is of the “utmost importance to my government” – amid fresh calls from the SNP to grant Holyrood the power to hold a second vote on Scottish independence.
The speech confirmed plans for the “deepest review” of Britain’s security defence, and foreign policy since the end of the Cold War.
Led by the Prime Minister, it will cover the armed forces, the intelligence agencies and counter-terrorism as well as the future development of foreign policy.
The British government will look at whether the Official Secrets Act needs overhauling in the wake of the Salisbury chemical weapons attack as well as considering whether there is a case for updating the treason laws.
Other pledges include a plan to change business rates – with a retail discount upped from one-third to 50%, and measures will be developed to provide for minimum levels of service during transport strikes.
General election
Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act – a move which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of parliament.
And the British government will set up a Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission to look at the broader aspects of the constitution and develop proposals to restore trust in institutions and in how British democracy operates.

Many Bills – including those on the environment, domestic abuse and ‘Helen’s Law’ which denies parole to murderers who withhold information about their victims – appeared in the last Speech.
The State Opening of Parliament, which follows last week’s general election, took place without some of the traditional ceremony, with Queen Elizabeth II arriving by car rather than carriage and wearing a dress and hat rather than her robes and state crown.
In a written introduction to the speech, Johnson said: “Last week’s seismic election not only changed the political landscape, it has broken the parliamentary deadlock of the last three years and allowed the country to go forward.
“Millions of people, many of them who have never voted Conservative before, put their faith in this government and voted overwhelmingly for us to move this country on and deliver change.
“We have no time to waste, and we begin immediately with the most radical Queen’s Speech in a generation to deliver on the priorities of the British people.”

Gabriel Makhlouf said any form of Brexit will be damaging for Ireland in his first keynote speech since being appointed governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.
The governor said the Republic of Ireland has a small open economy that leaves it vulnerable to external risks such as Brexit.
“Our work on Brexit has spanned across our mandates, and we have published extensive analysis of, and advice on, the risks and the steps required to mitigate them. Ensuring that people, households, firms and the country adapt, adjust, and manage this change is a constant process,” he said.
Makhlouf was addressing students at Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) on Wednesday morning.

“Brexit will inevitably bring disruption – even with a ‘deal’ – which, by its very nature, will dissipate over time. But we must not lose sight of the inevitable long-term costs. Any form of Brexit will be damaging for Ireland,” he said.
He said the Central Bank has been preparing for Britain’s exit from the EU for some time but the Withdrawal Agreement is stage one of a longer process.
While the UK is set to leave the EU at the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to get the Withdrawal Agreement ratified by Parliament.
Johnson is hoping to secure a majority in December’s British General Election in order to enable him to achieve that.
“Our work will continue over the coming weeks, months, and indeed years as we all transition to the new arrangements, whatever they may be. The fact is that the process is far from over – simply having a Withdrawal Agreement is not the end of the road but only the end of the beginning,” said the Central Bank governor.
Mahklouf said analysis from Central Bank economists shows that a disorderly Brexit or a permanent loss of corporation tax revenue could result in the level of debt remaining above 90% of national income “well into the middle of the next decade”.
He said it was crucial the level of public debt be reduced so that public finances can withstand the negative shocks Brexit could potentially bring.

He said economic resilience is needed for the country to meet the economic challenges ahead.
“Building economic resilience is not like building a bulwark and then assuming the job is done. There is no one-off solution to the challenge of building resilience. It is a continuous process, involving individuals, households, businesses, institutions and authorities, such as the Central Bank, both at home and abroad.
“Irrespective of the particular shift or shock, rapid change in the world around us and our openness and international interconnectedness mean we need to build resilience.”
He said that while the Republic of Ireland’s economy has benefited greatly from its openness, the economic crisis and recession “showed just how vulnerable we are to shifts in global economic and financial conditions, in particular when large domestic imbalances are allowed to build up”.","1.42pm, 20 Nov 2019",
https://www.the42.ie/irish-football-brexit-5289379-Dec2020/,"FIFA ARE REPORTEDLY set to forbid Irish footballers moving to UK clubs before they turn 18, signalling a major change for Irish football.
Fifa’s rules do not allow the international transfers of players under the age of 18, though an exception is made if the player is moving from one EU nation to another, in which case the player can move from the age of 16 once criteria relating to education is met.
The most talented Irish footballers have traditionally moved to clubs in the UK well before they turn 18, with recent Irish internationals Troy Parrott, Aaron Connolly, Jayson Molumby and Adam Idah all signing professional contracts with English clubs at the age of 16.

With the Brexit transition period ending on 31 December, however, the EU exemption no longer applies to clubs in the UK.
Many UK clubs believe Irish players under the age of 18 would continue to be allowed move to the UK from the age of 16 because of an exemption under the Common Travel Area between the Irish and UK governments, and so had been recruiting as normal in recent weeks.
A senior English Football League source toldThe42on Tuesday there would be no exemption for Irish youngsters under the Common Travel Area, however, and that has reportedly been confirmed by Fifa today.
Sports law firm Mills & Reeve today reported a Fifa Council meeting today approved the transfer of minors between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not the Republic of Ireland.
“Fifa announce ‘Brexit exemption’ to allow the transfer of minors aged 16-18 between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but not between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Without this exemption, ‘international’ transfer of minors is prohibited”, tweeted the sports law firm.

The change would represent a major culture change for Irish football, and would shift emphasis to the elite player structures in this country, with these structures now necessary to develop players between the ages of 16 and 18 who would otherwise have been coached at well-heeled UK academies.
Presently, Ireland’s elite player pathway consists of national underage leagues at U13, U15, U17 and U19 level; leagues consisting of League of Ireland clubs’ academies, some of which are affiliated with local schoolboy clubs.
The FAI this week announced with regret the cancellation of the final three rounds of games in this year’s national underage leagues following a government directive, in spite of the fact the GAA were allowed proceed with their minor championships.","10.25pm, 4 Dec 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-withdrawal-agreement-text-published-5310994-Dec2020/,"SCRUTINY OF THE Brexit trade agreement between the European Union and the UK has begun after the full text of the treaty was published today, less than a week before it is due to be implemented.
Legal experts and British MPs are poring over the 1,246-page document published this morning, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeks to persuade Eurosceptic MPs within his party to back it as the “right deal” for the country.
Johnson acknowledged to Conservative MPs that “the devil is in the detail” but insisted it would stand up to inspection from the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteers, who will assemble a panel of lawyers to examine the full text ahead of a Commons vote.
But the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation Barrie Deas accused Johnson of having “bottled it” on fishing quotas to secure only “a fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law”.
Deas said Johnson had “sacrificed” fishing to other priorities, with the subject proving to be an enduring sticking point during negotiations.
“Lacking legal, moral or political negotiating leverage on fish, the EU made the whole trade deal contingent on a UK surrender on fisheries,” he said.
“In the end-game, the prime minister made the call and caved in on fish, despite the rhetoric and assurances that he would not do what Ted Heath did in 1973.”
The share of fish in British waters that the UK can catch will rise from about half now to two-thirds by the end of the five-and-a-half-year transition.
The EU’s 27 member states indicated they will formally back the deal agreed by the UK with Brussels’ officials within days.
It covers trade worth about €735 billion and means goods can be sold without tariffs or quotas in the EU market.
Festive plans cancelled
The timing of the Christmas Eve deal forced politicians and officials in the UK and Brussels to tear up their festive plans.
EU ambassadors were briefed on the contents of the deal by Michel Barnier, who led Brussels’ negotiating team in the talks with the UK.
After a highly unusual meeting on Christmas Day – with at least one diplomat wearing a Santa hat and another in a festive jumper – they agreed to write to the European Parliament to say they intend to take a decision on the provisional application of the deal.

MPs and peers will be called back to Westminster on 30 December to vote on the deal, but MEPs are not expected to approve it until the new year, meaning it will have to apply provisionally until they give it the green light.
The agreement will almost certainly be passed by the UK parliament, with Labour supporting it, as the alternative would be a chaotic no-deal situation on 1 January.
But Johnson is keen to retain the support of the Eurosceptics on his benches who helped him become prime minister.
This morning, Conservative former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told BBC Breakfast: “I very much hope this treaty stands up to scrutiny and I hope to be able to support it.
“But I was elected on a manifesto which promised to get Brexit done so I need to read (the document) before I can work out whether this actually enables us to do that or whether it traps us in the regulatory orbit of the European Union.”
Johnson had earlier messaged Tory MPs on WhatsApp as he tried to get them all on side.
“I truly believe this is the right deal for the UK and the EU,” he wrote, in a message seen by the PA news agency.
“We have delivered on every one of our manifesto commitments: control of money, borders, laws, fish and all the rest.
“But even more important, I believe we now have a basis for long-term friendship and partnership with the EU as sovereign equals.”
He added that “I know the devil is in the detail” but the deal will survive “ruthless” scrutiny.
Officials in Brussels and the capitals of EU states are also beginning to scrutinise the deal, with another meeting of ambassadors expected before the new year, possibly on 28 December.
The European Commission has also announced a £4.5 billion fund to help regions and industries within the bloc which will be hit by the UK’s withdrawal from the single market and customs union – including fishing communities who face losing out as the UK takes a greater share of stock in British waters.
French Europe minister Clement Beaune said it was a “good agreement” and stressed the EU had not accepted a deal “at all costs”.
Beaune said that British food and industrial products entering the European single market after January 1 will not pay customs duties “but will have to meet all our standards”.
“There is no country in the world that will be subject to as many export rules to us as the UK,” he told broadcaster Europe 1.

WITH THE GENERAL election only two days away,TheJournal.iehas been asking each political party for their positions on a variety of issues affecting people across Ireland.
So far, we’ve published Q&A pieces onhousing,insurance,cycling,childcareandagriculture.
Each article teases out parties’ positions by asking them a number of specific questions.
For this article we asked parties about their stance on one of the most fundamental issues in the State. Specifically, what constitutes the nation and whether Irish people should vote on reunification.
There’s been increased debate around the issue of a united Ireland ever since the Brexit vote in 2016, a poll which saw Northern Ireland vote to remain in the EU.
The subsequent Brexit negotiations saw the border become the single biggest stumbling block to progress and the eventual agreement led to customs arrangements inNorthern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK.
In December, Northern Ireland electedmore nationalist MPs than unionist MPs for the first time, raising questions about whether changing demographics and voter sentiment were moving unification closer than ever before.
Underthe Good Friday Agreement, it is acknowledged that a united Ireland can be brought about if voters both north and south “exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given”.
The decision to hold a border poll is ultimately one to be taken by the UK’s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The agreement states that the secretary is to hold such a poll if they deem it likely a majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote for a united Ireland.
So given that context, we’ve asked parties running in the general election whether they are in favour of a united Ireland and if/when a border poll should take place.
The responses below are word-for-word what were given by the parties with the exception of the answers from the Social Democrats and Aontú, who did not respond but have manifesto policies on the issue.

Fine Gael:The party’s full official title is “Fine Gael – The United Ireland Party”. So, yes based on the principle of consent and a majority, north and south, being in favour.
Fianna Fáil:Yes. A United Ireland is a founding goal of our party. We believe it should be achieved through consensus.
Sinn Féin:Yes.
Labour:Labour aspires to the unification of all the people on the island of Ireland, first and foremost, as the logical and necessary first step towards political unity. The best thing we can do to secure that now is to ensure the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully operational.
People Before Profit:Yes we do.
Green Party:Yes.
The Social Democrats (From the party’s manifesto):We believe that a United Ireland, achieved by consent, has the real potential to benefit the people of the entire island economically, politically and culturally. We will therefore work towards achieving this in a spirit of mutual respect of all peoples who share this island and based on a foundation of Social Democratic principles.
Aontú(The party’s website outlines the following policy):Aontú seeks the independence of the Irish people north and south, east and west. We believe in self-determination; that decisions made as close to the people that they affect, are better decisions. Irish people can influence those decisions and they can hold the decision makers to account. When decisions are made in London, Brussels and Berlin they are not made in Ireland’s interest.
Irish Freedom Party:Yes we aspire to a democratic United Ireland.  We are an all-Ireland party who wants an Ireland ruled by the Irish people not by London or Brussels.
The National Party:The National Party supports the unification of Ireland in one sovereign and independent republic.

Fine Gael:An Taoiseach said during the seven-way leaders’ debate that he believes in a United Ireland but it should only be put to the people when we believe the poll would pass both North and South. Calls for a border poll at this time, which are not properly thought through, are only likely to exacerbate division and uncertainty.
Fianna Fáil:No. A border poll at this point would be divisive rather than conciliatory.
Sinn Féin:Yes.
Labour:No. It is clear that any border poll held in the next five years would be highly divisive in Northern Ireland at a time when Brexit has already increased tensions across the nationalist-unionist divide.
People Before Profit:We are for a border poll – held on both sides of the border.
Green Party:One thing we have learned from Brexit is that we should not rush into decisions, particularly through referenda, that have not been sufficiently prepared for or had sufficient public engagement on. Therefore we would only be happy to hold a border poll if sufficient public debate, engagement of all communities, and a robust economic assessment of the impact of reunification has been completed and this would be difficult to progress in the lifetime of this government.
Aontú (The party’s website outlines the following policy):A referendum on Irish reunification is now the only reasonable next step and is necessary to allow the north to move forward economically and socially. Aontú will support calls for this referendum and will actively campaign for a Yes to Unity vote.
Irish Freedom Party:Our preference is to have a period of consultation and preparation with all of the stakeholders on the island. Brexit is a factor too and it will take a few years to see the full effect of that on the island.
The National Party:We do not believe Ireland’s national unity is beholden to the temporary whim of an electorate in the form of a border poll. We support a negotiated settlement between the south and the north to achieve sovereignty and independence.

Fine Gael:An Taoiseach has said, he believes in a United Ireland but it should only be put to the people when we believe the poll would pass both North and South.
Fianna Fáil:We will establish within the Department of an Taoiseach a unit to lead a formal study and cross-community consultation on a Green Paper to outline how the Irish government should approach the handling of any unity referendum should circumstances arise where it can be called.
Sinn Féin:Sinn Féin wants to see a referendum on Irish unity within the next five years.
Labour:Any referendum in Ireland should be a vote to agree the reunification of Ireland if the majority in Northern Ireland had already voted in favour of this.
People Before Profit:The circumstances are appropriate at the moment.
Green Party:A border poll in the Republic should come at the same time as a poll is conducted north of the border. It should only be carried out when there is a likelihood of it passing.
Irish Freedom Party:When it is clear and obvious that a majority of people on the island desire a United Ireland and a sufficient level of consultation has taken place.
The National Party:We do not believe a border poll is a viable vehicle to practically achieve unity and independence.

Fine Gael:Any holding of a border poll, either North or South, would be inappropriate at this time as specified above. As such, any determination as to whether the polls should be held simultaneously or otherwise is, similarly, inappropriate as it would only exacerbate division and uncertainty.
Fianna Fáil:This sequencing should be considered as part of overall preparations for a United Ireland.
Sinn Féin:That should be discussed by a Citizens’ Assembly.
Labour:The Belfast Good Friday Agreement sets out that a border poll should be held in Northern Ireland to confirm a situation where the majority of people is in favour of reunification of Ireland. Any referendum in Ireland should follow this, unless a wide range of political parties in Northern Ireland ask the Irish government to hold a simultaneous poll.
People Before Profit:In our view, a similar poll should be held on same day in the 26 counties.
Green Party:It should be conducted at the same time.
Irish Freedom Party:We should await the outcome of the vote in the north.
The National Party:See above. The Good Friday Agreement is not a permanent settlement. From a nationalist-republican perspective, the GFA can only be judged by its utility in moving us further towards a United Ireland. It has failed to achieve this, and the National Party staunchly opposes blind faith in the institutions and mechanisms of the GFA.

Fine Gael:The Irish Government should be focused on actively supporting the Good Friday Agreement and the restored institutions. Fine Gael’s  vision aligns with the Good Friday Agreement aspiration of ‘equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity’ and fully equal rights for same-sex couples and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTI+) people across the island.
Fianna Fáil:We will establish within the Department of an Taoiseach a unit to lead a formal study and cross-community consultation on a Green Paper to outline how the Irish government should approach the handling of any unity referendum should circumstances arise where it can be called.
Sinn Féin:Yes it should. The Irish Government has a duty and obligation to make preparations for Irish unity. In Government, Sinn Féin will:
Labour:Labour leader Brendan Howlin has for a number of years called for an inclusive, non-sectarian public conversation on the future of Ireland, modelled on the New Ireland Forum of the 1980s, including discussion of a potential unitary Irish state while open to other political views including British Unionist perspectives.
People Before Profit:It should. Within such a forum People Before Profit will be promoting the case for a socialist United Ireland rather than extending the current 26 county tax haven.
Green Party:Yes.
Aontú (The party’s website outlines the following policy):Given that the opinions of Irish people north and south are changing significantly in support of Irish unity and given the demographic change, it is foolish and irresponsible for the governments in Dublin and London not to start to plan for the unity of the Irish people. We need to see the ongoing, planned and increasing devolution of far more powers from London to Ireland, to allow a managed transition to unification. The North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association must be developed to provide deeper and more regular parliamentary support to the work of the North/South Ministerial Council
Irish Freedom Party:Yes, because it is a realistic possibility and any government would be wise to maximise its preparation.
The National Party:The government must immediately end its partitionist mindset and adopt a 32-county approach to questions of policy, while also respecting the temporary political realities of the island. Practically, only a nationalist government can set about laying the foundations for the creation of a united and sovereign republic.

Fine Gael:It is far too early to start making pronouncements and decisions on political structure. It would be divisive and counterproductive to the goal of a United Ireland.
Fianna Fáil:This should be considered as part of overall discussions and considerations.
Sinn Féin:That should be discussed by a Citizens’ Assembly.
Labour:It is too soon for any party to set down a fixed vision of appropriate institutions for political unity across Ireland. The whole point of having a broad, inclusive dialogue with all communities is to tease out some of these issues, not to prejudge the outcome of such dialogue.
People Before Profit:We do. There should be a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution for a 32 county Ireland. Beforehand there should be citizens assemblies held all over the country to have a democratic input into the making of this constitution. At such assemblies we will advocate new political structures which extend democracy by giving electors a right to re-call deputies who break their manifestos.
Green Party:The continuation of the Stormont Assembly is likely to be retained in any United Ireland. While the Green Party has not set out any specific set of constitutional reforms, using provincial assemblies as a model for regional government under a new remit is something this which could be considered under the principle of subsidiarity and strengthening democracy.
Irish Freedom Party:There would need to be a huge consultation process regarding the political structure. Our preference would be a federal Ireland with a bill of rights for all.
The National Party:The National Party would be open to considering political structural options such as a unitary or a federal state as part of prospective negotiations between north and south. However, the fundamental Irish nationalist demand of national independence and sovereignty for the entire island in one political entity must first be satisfied.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION and its leaders granted the UK an extension to Article 50 which triggers its withdrawal from the EU in order to allow the UK to hold an election.
Despite the new Brexit deadline having been pushed back to 31 January, the issue has not gone away. Whatever the political make-up of the House of Commons is on 13 December, that will decide the next course of Brexit.
A change of Tory leader was once thought to bring enough change to get some form of Brexit divorce deal through the fractured House of Commons – but that hasn’t worked.
So here we are, in the midst of a winter election: but how will a new government, and a new House of Commons, change Brexit?
Here are the options…
The Conservatives
The detail of the Conservatives’ Brexit policy has been in flux (remember Tory PM David Cameron campaigned for Remain), but now they stand for Brexit, and one that involves leaving the Customs Union and Single Market as Theresa May announced in 2017.
If Boris Johnson delivers on his pledge to storm home a victorious election result for the Tories, and a 320-strong majority, we have a straightforward path for his Brexit deal.
The House of Commons returns on 16 December, so Johnson is likely to “unpause” his 110-page Brexit Withdrawal Agreement legislation, and propose a new schedule for debating and amending it.
This is where the snag could be: if an amendment is tabled and passed by the House that is in some way incompatible with the Withdrawal Agreement or the EU’s red lines, then we’re back to another British parliamentary stalemate.
But, with the possibility that things could all go smoothly in the setting of a fresh House of Commons, a Tory majority could mean that the UK actually does leave on 31 January next year (particularly as it would reenforce Johnson’s mandate to pass his Brexit divorce deal).
The Labour Party
Where to start. The UK’s Labour Party has struggled with what Brexit stance it would take. As the Tories became the party that would deliver Brexit, the natural position for the opposite main British party to take was Remain.
Advertisement
But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been a long-standing critic of the EU as overly bureaucratic and veering too close to the idea of a European federation.
Corbyn has looked weak during bouts of Prime Minister’s Question as a result – criticising the Tories for their record on Brexit, for failing to get a Brexit deal through the House, but not being clear about what he would do instead.
A bit of clarity camein Julythis year, when Labour said it would back a second referendum first and foremost, and that in a referendum where the options were the Tories’ Withdrawal Agreement, a no-deal Brexit or remain, Labour would campaign for remain.
Corbyn said Labour was the “party of choice” when it came to Brexit.
At the Labour Party’s party conference in September, the partynarrowly rejecteda grassroots attempt to force leader Jeremy Corbyn to have Labour campaign outright for Remain, and to reverse the outcome of the 2016 Brexit vote.
Instead, Corbyn and Labour’s ruling executive agreed in a secret ballot that Labour would adopt no official Brexit position in its general election campaign. So here we are.
Corbyn clarified this further this week, when he told Sky News that if in government, he and his party would ask for a fourth Brexit extension from the EU, despite indications from the EU that another extension won’t be granted.
He thensaidthat he would “secure a credible deal in three months”, then “put it to the people for the final say, with the option to remain, in six months”.
As to what kind of Brexit deal Labour would negotiate, according to Corbyn’s most recent comments, free movement of people between the UK and EU would continue, suggesting a closely aligned soft-Brexit.
“[Free movement] enriches the lives of all of us,” he said.
The Lib Dems
The Liberal Democrats recently became the party of Remain, meaning they will reverse Brexit by unilaterally revoking Brexit if they manage to form a government majority (highly unlikely).
Its leader Jo Swinson responded to a question on whether this was antidemocratic by saying that the party was open about what it would do when in government, and if successful on 12 December, it would be a new democratic mandate.
The Lib Dems are expected to pluck some seats away from the Conservatives in pro-Remain areas on this clear mandate.
Criticising Corbyn’s indecision, Swinson said: “On so many grounds, Jeremy Corbyn is not fit for the job of prime minister.
“On the biggest issue of the day, he has prevaricated and will not give a straight answer. Even now if you ask him whether he is Remain or Leave he will not tell you how he would vote.”
Related ReadsFour nations, 650 seats and one elephant in the room: What to expect from the UK election?
The Brexit Party
Another straightforward one. The Brexit Party think that the only way to deliver on the Brexit mandate from the 2016 referendum is through a no-deal Brexit.
Its founder and leader Nigel Farage has asked Johnson to form a pact with him for the election, which would see them team up to wil seats, but would mean that Johnson would have to “drop” his Brexit deal.
“I urge the Prime Minister to reconsider and drop the deal because it’s not Brexit,” he said in a Brexit Party newsletter.
Instead, Farage says that “a simple FTA” should be agreed by 1 July 2020.
“That must mean no new EU Treaty. No new negotiations on the impossible basis of Mr Barnier’s Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration. No signing us up to any political linkage to the EU or the authority of EU courts,” he said.
‘Regional’ parties & the Greens

The Scottish National Party has campaigned against Brexit and to remain in the EU, on the basis that the majority of Scotland voted to remain.
Scottish National Party leader Nicolas Sturgeon has vowed to “escape Brexit” during the launch of her independence-seeking, pro-European party’s British election campaign.
“A vote for the SNP… is a vote to escape Brexit,” she said, tying a remain vote to the apparent growing Brexit fatigue.
Plaid Cymru and the Green party are also ‘remain’ parties, and have agreed a‘Remain’ election pactwith the Lib Dems across 60 seats in England and Wales in order not to split the anti-Brexit vote.
The DUP is, of course, a pro Brexit party, and Sinn Féin are a staunchly anti-Brexit party. But both have said that they are against any kind of border in the Irish Sea or on the island of Ireland.
TheSDLPare against Brexit, theUUPare for it, generally speaking.The Alliance Partyare also firmly anti-Brexit, which could do well in this election.
“If you are a pro-EU unionist, Alliance is your best and possibly only option and I think this has helped the party,” said Dr David Mitchell, an expert in conflict studies in TCD.

BUSINESSES THAT FAIL to adhere to new post-Brexit customs rules will be penalised by Revenue, it has been warned.
Today saw the first ferries arrive in Ireland from Britain under new trade rules following the end of the Brexit transition period.
But despite pleas from hauliers, there will be no light-touch implementation of the new regulations.
Tom Talbot, head of customs operations in Dublin Port, said Revenue will sanction those who flout the rules.
He said: “Do not be tempted to skip the customs facilities and go through the port.
“Revenue are there, we will know who has left the port without calling to customs as required. We will follow it up. Where necessary, in due course, it will be followed up with sanctions. Please heed that message.”
He added: “Although we don’t propose to apply those sanctions on day one, we prefer to work with businesses and traders and where there is genuine error, we will follow that up.
“Where there is non-compliance, those penalties, those prosecutions, the legislation is in place and, where we need to, Revenue will not be found wanting to apply those sanctions.
“Each offence will carry a different fine and sentence, and they are in line with current customs penalties.”
On Friday, several lorries were turned away because they did not have the correct paperwork filled out.
Talbot said he was pleased to see the rules being firmly implemented at this early stage.
He said: “I’m aware that one of the ferry companies have turned back a number of trucks and we very much welcome that.
“We have made it very, very clear that where trucks arrive at the port, whether that’s Holyhead or Dublin, if the correct paperwork has not been done in advance, those trucks will be turned back.”

Talbot said that there could be no loosening of the rules, even for a short grace period, because of Ireland’s responsibilities as an EU member state.
“The reality is Ireland is a member of the EU, and we have requirements based on that membership,” he said.
“We have a requirement to protect the single market, we have a requirement to protect the customs union. We have to abide by those rules. That will be the message from the Revenue Commissioners.”
There were few delays at Dublin port on Friday morning despite the new regulations, because business is typically slow on New Year’s Day.

Talbot said: “The first trucks from Britain post-Brexit arrived in Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port this morning. As we expected, the freight was very low given the time of year and given where we are.
“When we look at the ferries coming in through the rest of the day, we expect similar low volumes of traffic.
“It probably won’t be until next week before we see an increase in volume of trucks coming into the various ports.”
In Dublin, Irish Ferries’ ship Ulysses docked at 5.55am with about a dozen trucks on board, having travelled from Holyhead in Wales.
There were no delays as the freight trailers cleared customs checks for the first time under the new rules.
In Rosslare, Irish Ferries’ ship Isle of Inishmore arrived from Pembroke in Wales. A truck transporting bananas was the first to pass the new customs checkpoint.
After 47 years as an EU member state, the UK left the bloc at 11pm on New Year’s Eve, becoming a third country for trade purposes and customs declarations.
New documentation and red tape is now required between EU member states and Britain which is anticipated to cause massive delays at ports in the coming weeks.
A small number of ships arrived after 11pm on Thursday night but they were covered by the previous arrangements.
The Stena Line ferry group said while it had been quiet in Holyhead early on New Year’s Day, the port authority had indicated that six freight loads bound for Ireland had been turned away due to not having the correct references.
The company appealed for hauliers to have their pre-boarding notifications (PBNs) ready for check-in.","6.21pm, 1 Jan 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/british-mps-to-vote-on-brexit-deal-house-of-commons-5312791-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|30 Dec 2020

BRITAIN’S EU TRADE deal has cleared the House of Commons, as the Government seeks to rush approval through Parliament in a single day.
After little over four hours’ debate, British MPs voted by 521 to 73 to give the European Union (Future Relationship) Bill, ratifying the deal finally agreed on Christmas Eve, a third reading.
The Bill now goes to the House of Lords, where the debate is expected to continue until around 10.30pm today.
If, as expected, it passes the upper chamber, it will then go to the Queen for royal assent, with an announcement expected around midnight.
That would pave the way for the deal to take effect at 11pm tomorrow when the current Brexit transition period, during which the UK has continued to follow EU rules, ends.
Opening the debate in the Commons, the Prime Minister said the deal would enable the UK to trade and co-operate with the EU on the “closest possible terms” while taking “sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny”.
He said he hoped it would end the “old, desiccated, tired, super-masticated arguments” which have dogged the country for years and enable it to move forwards to a “new and great future”.
“It embodies our vision shared with our European neighbours of a new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals joined by friendship, commerce, history interests and values while respecting one another’s freedom of action,” he said.
“We are going to open a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world and reasserting global Britain as a liberal, outward-looking force for good.”

Labour backed the deal, despite misgivings from some pro-European MPs who said they would be abstaining or voting against.
However, party leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while the agreement is “thin” with “many flaws”, the alternative is to leave the EU single market and customs union with no agreement, pushing up prices and driving businesses to the wall.
“There’s only one choice today, which is to vote for implementing this deal or to vote for no-deal. Those that vote ‘no’ are voting for no-deal,” he said.
“This is the nub of it: those voting ‘no’ today want ‘yes’. They want others to save them from their own vote.
“Voting ‘no’, wanting ‘yes’, that’s the truth of the situation and that’s why my party has taken a different path.”
However, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, condemned the deal as “an act of economic vandalism” and attacked Labour for failing to oppose it.
“I am sad to say that the official opposition has been missing in action. I can understand that this might be politically pragmatic for Labour but it definitely isn’t politically principled,” he said.
Two junior shadow ministers – Helen Hayes and Tonia Antoniazzi – announced they were resigning their posts on the Labour front bench as they could not support the agreement.
One Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, defied the whips to vote against the agreement while another 36 abstained.
All the other opposition parties opposed the agreement – including the DUP, which backed Brexit but objects to provisions which mean Northern Ireland will still be subject to some EU rules.
But Tory Eurosceptics were jubilant, declaring that the “battle for Brexit” had finally been won.
Veteran Sir Bill Cash said: “Like Alexander the Great, Boris has cut the Gordian Knot.”

Mark Francois, one of the self-styled Spartans who held out against Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement, said they could now “lower our spears”.
Earlier in the day, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel formally signed the agreement.

Following the brief ceremony in Brussels, the documents were then flown to London by the RAF where Johnson put his name to it.
Michel said: “The agreement that we signed today is the result of months of intense negotiations in which the European Union has displayed an unprecedented level of unity.
“It is a fair and balanced agreement that fully protects the fundamental interests of the European Union and creates stability and predictability for citizens and companies.”
At Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted by 92 to 30 to deny the deal legislative consent, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged it would not affect the passage of the Bill at Westminster.
“The fact is, Scotland’s voice has been ignored on Brexit all along, every single step of the way,” she said.

Post-Brexit trade talks are ongoing between the EU and UK: if there is no trade deal, tariffs of up to 56% could be placed on cheese going from Ireland to the UK.
Even if there is a trade deal, customs and health certificates could mean that exporting cheese to the UK will be “like exporting into China”.
Unlike other dairy products, this cannot be redirected elsewhere, as Ireland and the UK are the only consumers of cheddar cheese in significant quantities. So plans are being made to make new cheeses on the island of Ireland, intended for export to the EU.
This new cheese factory will be located in Belview, near the Waterford border, and will make edam and gouda cheese. This a joint venture between Glanbia and the Dutch company Royal A-ware, as part of a strategy to diversify the Irish export market.
The cheese industry in Ireland
Conor Mulvihill from Dairy Industry Ireland toldTheJournal.iethat if there is a trade deal, that will mean there is “no tariff no quota arrangement”.
“The UK is a 17 million person market on our doorstep,” Mulvihill says, pointing out that it’s difficult to ignore, Brexit or not.

“But what it means is there’s going to be a rake of non-tariff barriers. It will be like exporting into China, there will be a rake of heath certs and transport certs that will still need to be put onto our product.”
He says that cheese is a relatively high-volume and low-profit margin product (there’s a 3-4% margin on cheddar exports to the UK), so any type of extra delay or cost is a challenge, though is still “infinitely” better than a no-trade deal situation.
Referencing the ban Russia placed on EU products in 2014, he said:
There are four cheddar factories in Ireland which process 2 billion litres of milk a year; 56% of what is produced is exported to the UK market, which is worth over € 1/4 billion a year.
These figures are from 2017-2018, but are thought to be broadly representative of the market as it stands currently, as hardly any investment has gone into producing cheddar in Ireland since Brexit.
A look at environmental concerns
There has been some debate about the future of the dairy herd in Ireland in the context of how to respond quickly to the climate crisis.
An Taiscehas been granted permission by the High Courtto seek a judicial review of An Bord Pleanála granting planning permission, based on environmental concerns about this particular cheese plant, which Glanbia and Dairy Industry Ireland strongly refute.
In its objections submitted to planning authorities, An Taisce said: “Intensive cattle farming is also a major emitter of GHGs [greenhouse gas emissions] and is contributing significantly to Ireland’s ongoing failures to reach its legally binding Paris Agreement targets.”
An Taiscehas arguedthat the impact of the estimated 450 million litres of milk needed to supply the plant should have been assessed by An Bord Pleanála, particularly the resulting ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions and “likely” deterioration in water quality.
Related ReadsUK committee warned by NI business panel why Brexit is a problem - using cheese as an example
According to An Taisce’s estimates, the milk produced to supply this plant on its own would lead to a 2.5% increase in ammonia emissions.
Glanbia has said that the cheese factory is an “essential” piece of infrastructure, and will help to sustain the local rural economy. Glanbia pays out €1.05 billion in payments per year to its network of 4,500 family farms.
It aims to create 100 permanent jobs in the factory, and up to 400 jobs during construction. Glanbia said is “fully satisfied” in the project’s merit and is happy to work with any stakeholder about their concerns.
A national debate has been ongoing about the environmental sustainability of the dairy herd in Ireland.
When asked about this, Mulvihill said that the dairy industry has dealt with “three huge icebergs” this year: Covid-19, Brexit and climate change.
“It goes beyond emissions because… we’ve come to the conclusion that that’s hugely important for de-carbonisation.”
“Because there’s so much good going on – we have the globally lowest carbon footprint per litre of milk produced,” he says, though adds that gross emissions are increasing due to the success of the dairy industry.
“The way the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] emissions calculations are done, it means that Agriculture is 33% of [Ireland's] emissions so we are rightly scrutinised.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tory-election-campaign-4881379-Nov2019/,"THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY will launch its campaign today ahead of a 12 December general election – and it has not been a great start so far for leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Party chairman James Cleverly said Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg had “caused a huge amount of hurt and distress” with his comments on Grenfell Tower.
Rees-Mogg faced widespread criticism, including from Grenfell survivors and Jeremy Corbyn, after he said people are safer if they “just ignore what you’re told and leave”.
Rapper Stormzy called on Rees-Mogg to resign, calling him a “piece of s**t”, after the Tory MP suggested that Grenfell victims should have used “common sense” and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Rees-Mogg apologised for his remarks and said he intended to say he would also have listened to the LFB advice.
Cleverly told theBBCno-one could “credibly” know what decisions those “trapped” in the tower faced that evening.
‘Unacceptable’
The Tory chairman also said remarks by prospective Gower MP Francesca O’Brien were “unacceptable” but suggested she would not be axed as Tory candidate.
O’Brien posted on social media that people featured in reality TV show Benefits Street needed “putting down”.
FacebookFacebook
Cleverly said: “This is a comment that the candidate themselves recognised was unacceptable.
“People often tweet in haste and regret what they have done afterwards.”
Cleverly also faced questions about a Tory campaign video that critics claim had been “doctored”.
The film depicts Labour’s Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer struggling to answer a question on TV about his party’s position on leaving the European Union, despite him answering it “perfectly adequately”, according to the BBC’s Nick Robinson.

Cleverly told the BBC that Tory social media feeds had posted the interview in full and then followed it up with a “light-hearted” video on Labour’s Brexit position.
“What we also did, and this is not unique to us, is we did a light-hearted satirical video, obviously so with a comedy soundtrack, highlighting the Labour Party’s chaotic position on Brexit,” he said.
Asked whether his party had “posted a lie” online, he replied: “I disagree with your assessment of it.”
A resignation
Elsewhere, the shadow secretary of state for Wales, Christina Rees, accused Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns of “brazenly lying” about his knowledge of an allegation that a Conservative candidate had sabotaged a rape trial.
Cairns has now resigned, though he said he was unaware of former staff member Ross England’s role in the collapsed trial until after the story broke last week.
He has told the Prime Minister that he is sure an investigation into his conduct will clear him, but he does not want any more speculation and this is why he has stepped down.
BBC Wales said it had obtained a leaked email sent to Cairns which showed he had been made aware of the allegations as early as August last year.
Vindictiveness
The challenges faced by the Tories come on a day when Johnson said Corbyn had taken a stance that demonises billionaires with a “relish and a vindictiveness” not seen since Stalin’s attitude to landowners following the Russian revolution.
Corbyn, speaking in his hometown Telford, said he would be a “very different” prime minister if his party wins the election.
“I was not born to rule. None of us in this room were born to rule. I don’t pursue the kind of politics that thinks it’s all a game, a parlour game, a debating society game.
Johnson is expected to put Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the NHS and law and order at the centre of the Tories’ campaign.
He left Buckingham Palace at 10.37am after spending just over 25 minutes with the Queen at her official London residence.
In Downing Street, he is expected to say: “There is only one way to get Brexit done, and I am afraid the answer is to ask the people to change this blockading Parliament.
“It’s time to change the dismal pattern of the last three years and to get out of our rut.
“Let’s go with this Conservative government, get Brexit done, and unleash the potential of our great country – delivering on the public’s priorities of our NHS, crime and the cost of living.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-has-happened-whats-next-4989224-Feb2020/,"THE UK HAS left the European Union, ending more than four decades of economic, political and legal integration with its closest neighbours.
We’ve passed three different Brexit deadlines before the House of Commons finally ratified the Brexit ‘divorce’ deal, aka the Withdrawal Agreement.
But things willfeel the same for the next 11 months at least, owing to a transition period intended to allow both sides time to agree the terms of their future partnership.
As part of the transition period, which is to last until 31 December 2020 if Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend it, the UK stays in the Customs Union, the Single Market, and the European Courts of Justice still oversee its implementation of EU law.
But Britain will lose its representation and voting rights in the EU institutions. This includes having no British members of the European Parliament, no say in European Council meetings, and no EU Commissioner.
So what next? The trade talks, of course. The three years we’ve gone through so far has been called “the easy part”. Here are the key moments ahead:
February/March: Trade talks begin
Britain says it is ready to start trade talks from today, but EU members states are still discussing what they want from the negotiations.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to flesh out his ideas for a free trade agreement along the lines of a recent EU deal with Canada, in a speech to be delivered in early February.
The EU mandate could be approved by national ministers on 25 February, officials in Brussels suggest, which would mean talks could begin around 1 March.
Britain is hoping to open trade talks with the United States and other non-EU countries around the same time.
Trade is not the only issue that must be resolved with Brussels, however. Britain and the EU closely cooperate on security and law enforcement, education and energy among many other issues.
Brexit trade talks: What are the biggest issues
There are three main issues to look out for in the trade talks: fisheries, level-playing field standards, and Northern Ireland.
On thelevel-playing field,this had been a legally binding commitment in the Withdrawal Agreement aimed at creating a base level of standards for labour rights, the environment, tax and state aid rules.
This is so as to ensure state aid rules aren’t used by either side to boost their own companies; labour rules aren’t lowered in order to increase company profits; or environmental standards aren’t renegned upon in order to become more competitive post-Brexit.
But in the final Withdrawal Agreement, the level-playing field provision was taken out and instead put into the Political Declaration – reducing it to a statement that the UK could do a u-turn on in trade talks, which would be a concern for the EU’s economy, and for EU citizens living in the UK.
Onfisheries, this has been a big issue for both sides to find common ground. The UK wants to “take back” its waters, meaning EU vessels would no longer be allowed to fish in its waters.
Advertisement
But the EU’s response to this would be to increase tariffs on British fishing imports – meaning the UK market would catch more fish and sell less of it, or make less of a profit from the amount they do sell.
More than 50% of fish that have been caught in UK waters are by non-UK vessels last year. This is mirrored in Ireland, as a spokesperson for the Foyle Fisheries Co-Op told uspreviously:
When asked whether the UK would trade access to it’s waters for a trade deal with the EU, Michael Govetold Sky News”No… If people want to fish in our waters, we’ll decide… We’re in control.”
OnNorthern Ireland, UK Chancellor Sajid Javid has said that there wouldn’t be alignment with the EU after the transition period ends; Johnson is expected to repeat that sentiment in a speech to be given tomorrow.
He’s expected to demand “no alignment, no jurisdiction of the European courts, and no concessions” with Brussels, which is fine, if it didn’t immediately pose a concern for the customs arrangements in Northern Ireland.
If there isn’t alignment, that would mean that the UK and EU would have different rules, and if the differences are dramatic enough, it suggests that custom checks of sorts will be needed.
Under the protocol provision in the Withdrawal Agreement, the customs plan for Northern Ireland is very vague. But, if Johnson doesn’t align the UK’s rules to the EU’s, it could mean hefty checks at ports and airports on good going between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
That all depends on: the level of alignment/divergence, and the customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, as to be clarified by a special committee.
These include 1 July: Extension deadline
The transition period is scheduled to last until 31 December 2020.
Britain can ask to extend this for one or two years, but must inform the EU of its request by 1 July.
Johnson insists he will not do this, saying that Britain must be free of EU rules and regulations as soon as possible.
He has blocked himself from requesting an extension with an amendment attached to the Withdrawal Agreement, which was approved in a vote by the Houses of Commons.
But this could be reversed if Johnson wants – the real block to the decision would be the possible political backlash to the UK remaining in the Customs Union and Single Market for longer.
31 December: Transition period ends
Without an extension or a trade agreement, relations between Britain and the EU will be severed at the end of 2020.
This seems impossible by comparative standards: for reference, other EU trade talks have dragged on for much longer:
Failure to agree one in time would mean a stripped back, very basic trading relationship on WTO rules, which could mean cross-Channel trade, transportation and a multitude of other ties severely disrupted overnight.

BRITAIN WILL BE a “second-rate player” after Brexit, unable to compete with big powers like the US, China and EU, outgoing EU Council president Donald Tusk has warned.
The former Polish premier said Brexit supporters were deluded if they thought leaving the EU would bring a return to dominance on the world stage, saying the departure marked “the real end of the British Empire”.
Tusk’s outspoken intervention comes in the midst of a UK election campaign in which Brexit is one of the key issues dividing the parties, and he urged those seeking to keep Britain in the bloc not to lose hope.
Some Brexit backers have argued that leaving the EU, the world’s largest trading bloc, will enable Britain to forge closer economic ties with other countries around the world.

“You could hear in these voices a longing for the Empire. But the reality is exactly the opposite – only as part of a united Europe can the UK play a global role,” Tusk said in a speech at the College of Europe in Bruges – a finishing school for the next generation of EU bureaucrats.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is fighting the 12 December election on a pledge to “get Brexit done” after failing in a pledge to get Britain out on 31 October.
The new departure date is 31 January, but the main opposition Labour party is pledging to renegotiate the divorce deal and put it to a second referendum, while the Liberal Democrats have vowed to scrap Brexit altogether.
Tusk, who leaves office at the end of the month, has made no secret of his opposition to Brexit.
“The UK election takes place in one month. Can things still be turned around?” Tusk said.
“The only words that come to my mind today are simply: don’t give up. In this match, we have had added time, now we are in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties?”

Days after the incoming head of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive, said the shock of Brexit had brought the remaining 27 members together, Tusk hailed their unity during more than two years of tortuous talks with London.
“The EU27 have maintained extraordinary self discipline and loyalty among themselves, despite London’s attempts to ‘bilateralise’ these negotiations,” Tusk said.
Tusk also used the speech to take aim at French President Emmanuel Macron over his recent blocking of EU membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania and his call for rapprochement with Russia.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-agreement-5292316-Dec2020/,"THE UK AND the EU have reached an agreement in principle on issues relating to post-Brexit trade with Northern Ireland.
It follows a meeting between Cabinet minister Micheal Gove and European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic yesterday.
In a joint statement this afternoon, the two announced that an agreement had been made “in principle”, included arrangements relating to the Northern Ireland border.

It means the UK will remove three clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would have broken international law and denied the EU a say in future trading arrangements between the North and Ireland.
The clauses could have overridden the Withdrawal Agreement, and their removal means the UK will not introduce any similar provisions in another piece of legislation, the Taxation Bill.
“Following intensive and constructive work over the past weeks by the EU and the UK, the two co-chairs can now announce their agreement in principle on all issues, in particular with regard to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland,” the joint statement said.
The agreement covers issues including border checks on animal and plant products, the supply of medicines and deliveries of chilled meats and other food products to supermarkets.
There was also “clarification” on the application of rules on state subsidies.

https://www.thejournal.ie/key-moments-of-campaign-4931797-Dec2019/,"
IT WAS A victory for the Tories in Thursday’s general election, with Brexit now likely to happen within the next month.
Although they came out with a majority in the end, it was not always plain sailing for the Conservative Party during the election campaign.
On the first day of the campaign, in fact, there was a controversy involving senior minister Jacob Rees-Mogg .
He was forced to apologise over comments about London’s 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed 72 lives. The MP suggested some of the victims could have survived if they had followed “common sense”, ignored fire brigade advice to stay put and fled to safety.
Rees-Mogg has not been seen on the national stage since.
Anti-Semitism warning
There were tough times too for the Labour Party. Britain’s Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis made an unprecedented political intervention to warn that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of anti-Semitism allegations within his party made him “unfit for high office”.
Mirvis said “a new poison” had taken hold of the party, which had been “sanctioned from the very top” and left British Jews justifiably “gripped by anxiety” before the 12 December poll.
London Bridge terror attack
The campaign was rocked on 29 November when convicted terrorist Usman Khan knifed two members of the public to death before being shot dead by police on London Bridge.

The incident immediately became politicised as Khan had already served time for terror offences, before being released early.
Johnson said he thought it was “wrong” that Khan had been set free early, sparking criticism from the father of one of the victims, who helped run a prisoner rehabilitation programme.
David Merritt said the prime minister was using his son Jack’s death to promote “vile propaganda”, accusing him of trying to “make political gain from people’s death in a terror incident”.
‘Deemed untrustworthy’
The prime minister also came in for criticism after refusing an interview with the BBC’s chief political interrogator Andrew Neil.
Guardian News/ YouTube
The veteran broadcaster subjected all the other leaders to a grilling, giving Corbyn a particularly uncomfortable time, but Johnson ducked out, leading to accusations of cowardice.
Neil scolded the prime minister in a much-watched monologue, saying he would like to ask him “why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy”.
Johnson said he had done over 100 interviews in the campaign and felt the format was “tired”, further fuelling his party’s feud with the BBC, which it accuses of anti-Brexit bias.

With Johnson riding high in the polls with just days to go before the vote, and seemingly set for victory, his campaign was blindsided by a mother’s picture of her ill son sleeping on a hospital floor due to a lack of beds.

The prime minister invited further criticism when he took a reporter’s mobile phone and put it in his pocket as the journalist tried to show him the picture.
The story spiralled further out of control when the Conservatives accused a Labour activist of punching an advisor to health minister Matt Hancock during a visit to the hospital.
Butvideo footage later revealedthat the activist had accidentally struck the advisor, who was looking the other way, as he jabbed his finger at Hancock’s car.
Get Brexit Done
And then there was Johnson’s creative photo opportunity in which he climbed into a JCB and smashed through a wall that had the word ‘gridlock’ printed across it.

Speaking yesterday, the prime minister pledged to heal the divisions of Brexit. He said he had an “overwhelming mandate” to take Britain out of the EU by the end of January.
But at the same time he sought to reach out to Remainers, insisting his “One Nation” government would never ignore their feelings of “warmth and sympathy” towards the other nations of Europe.
“Now is the moment, precisely as we leave the EU, to let those natural feelings find renewed expression in building a new partnership,” he said.
“I frankly urge everyone on either side of what are, after three and a half years, increasingly arid argument, I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rosslare-dunkirk-ferry-brexit-5280594-Nov2020/,"BUSINESSES ARE BEING urged to decide how they will get their goods to and from the European market when the Brexit transition period ends on 1 January.
A new direct ferry service from Rosslare Europort to Dunkirk is being heralded as a welcome addition to the slate of shipping options to replace the UK landbridge amid fears of lengthy delays.
The service will be operated by Danish international shipping company DFDS and will run six-times a week starting from 2 January.
The additional route means there will be 13 each-way direct sailings between Rosslare and the European continent during peak times of year.
Transport minister Eamon Ryan said the service is a “welcome addition” of capacity as the Brexit transition phase comes to an end.
“I urge business to take advantage of these new routes as a real alternative to avoid the inevitable delays that will be experienced on the UK Landbridge,” Ryan said.

The government is urging business, freight logistics companies and hauliers to consider switching to direct maritime routes to the continent to avoid the delays involved in transiting through the UK.
Voyage time for the Rosslare-Dunkirk route will be 24 hours. This is longer than sailings to other French ports such as Cherbourg or Roscoff, but it leaves users within three hours of Paris and 20 minutes from the Belgian border.
“This is a hugely exciting development, not only for us in Rosslare Europort, but for Ireland as a whole, Irish industry, and the haulage sector,” the port’s general manager Glenn Carr said.
Carr said the route will also be attractive for inbound and outbound tourism when Covid-19 travel restrictions are eased.
Shannon Chamber, which represents 270 companies in the Shannon area, welcomed the news.
“This is exactly the news that our members and Irish companies generally needed to hear and is an issue that the Chamber along with the Irish Road Haulage Association has been lobbying on for some time,” said Eoin Gavin, vice-president of Shannon Chamber.
Exporters will “now have certainty that they will have a direct route to Europe from 2 January 2021,” which he said will remove “the much-dreaded alternative option” of the UK landbridge.
“This means for example, that a company in Shannon exporting goods on a Friday can be guaranteed their arrival at their European destination by latest Monday, guaranteeing speed to market as opposed to not knowing how long a delay they would face if goods were stalled at UK ports,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/thomas-byrne-interview-brexit-5201971-Sep2020/,"THOMAS BYRNE IS the seventh person to hold the role of Minister of State for European Affairs – a junior ministry that has become more important in recent years.
Since the Brexit vote in June 2016, the Europe portfolio has involved a lot of batting for the benefits of the EU and the importance of upholding the Good Friday Agreement – the latter of which was greatly helped by having the same customs and regulatory rules North and south.
Never has there been a greater need for it than this week, when the UK threatened to renege on commitments to Northern Ireland contained in the concluded and ratified Withdrawal Agreement (upon which Boris Johnson glided into a successful general election campaign).
The non-Cabinet European Affairs minister role was first created in 1997; since then its alumna have assumed more senior Cabinet roles.
Current Eurogroup President and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe assumed the role in 2013, and his Fine Gael colleague Helen McEntee – who is now a Justice Minister at the age of 34 – preceded Byrne.
Being a junior minister for Europe looks good on a CV.
For Byrne, moving from a role as Fianna Fáil’s education spokesperson to a junior minister for Europe may seem left-of-field, but he started his professional career as a solicitor in the EU law department of Irish firm McCann FitzGerald, He also twice ran as an MEP candidate, adding that he’s “always had an interest” in European matters.
And, like many domestic politicians who become MEPs, Commissioners, or take up another European role, he’s already using the safe, steady language of an EU politician.

Already out to bat for Ireland and the EU in a game of Brexit this week, he told BBC Radio 4 that the UK’s actions to renege on commitments made in the Withdrawal Agreement in relation to Northern Ireland were “uniquely unprecedented”.
He said that the UK’s claim that they were taking this action to protect the Good Friday Agreement was “completely false”, and that the opposite was true.
In an interview withTheJournal.ie- held during the throes of a diplomatic crisis with the UK government over the Withdrawal Agreement – he responded to a question about whether Ireland has done enough to protect Northern Ireland with a familiar answer:
He adds that no one could have foreseen the UK rowing back on an international treaty it ratified just months earlier.
“The [Irish] Protocol is there, fundamentally, to protect trading goods to the island of Ireland, and thereby protect the peace process,” Byrne says – another recognisable phrase.
Advertisement
“Anything at all that is said or done about the Protocol can have immediate effects in Northern Ireland.”
Byrne repeats another familiar phrase: that in his phone calls with all his European counterparts, he is “struck” by the solidarity there is with Ireland.
When asked whether other EU countries care anymore about Brexit, he says they do, and insists that Brexit hasn’t slipped off their agenda.
“Well it’s my job to keep it on the agenda,” he adds.
An exemption on travel
Though having relaxed into the role, Byrne admits that his start as Ireland’s Europe minister has been somewhat clipped by not being permitted, under public health guidelines, to travel to Europe.
When asked has he travelled abroad, he gives an emphatic ‘no’.
But, anticipating a change to Ireland’s travel rules next week, he plans in-person meetings in two weeks’ time: “The General Affairs Council is happening physically in two weeks. So we expect to be there at that point, and we’re making preparations to be there.”
Currently, foreign diplomats and workers involved in the supply chain are the only workers exempt from travel restrictions –MEPs have written to the Taoiseach Micheál Martinto ask for an exemption to allow them to travel to the European Parliament without having to restrict their movements for 14 days upon their return.
“I don’t want to start comparing us to nurses or doctors,” Byrne says, but adds that the current travel regulations are “pretty restrictive”, and that diplomacy will be needed as the trade talks come to an end this winter. If not sooner.

NEW: 🚨🚨🚨🇬🇧🇪🇺🚨🚨🚨UK planning legislation to override key parts of#brexitwithdrawal treaty and Northern Ireland protocol - a potentially HUGE move in negotiations; major ructions in Whitehall - my latest via@FThttps://t.co/UU3VT2Yeta
When Byrne read Peter Foster’s exclusive in the Financial Times last Sunday night, which said the UK was planning to override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with a piece of domestic legislation, he thought it was incredible.
Despite it setting off alarm bells in Dublin, he said that the Irish government took an initial reaction “of caution and care”.
“What we don’t want to do on this side, is just immediately ratchet up things,” he said.
The Bill was published on Wednesday afternoon, and was as extreme in reneging on the Withdrawal Agreement as had been promised – contradicting requirements for custom declarations for goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and giving British ministers the power to decide on State aid rules for companies in the North.

Byrne compares the British government’s actions to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s “absolute commitment to treaties”, when he invoked a Portuguese Treaty from 1373 in the House of Commons during the Second World War.
When it’s suggested that Boris Johnson was not far off when he is reported to have said that the Brexit deal agreed“never made sense”, particularly in relation to what customs rules the North was to abide by, Byrne refutes this.
“I think it makes perfect sense. What the protocol aims to achieve is to ensure that goods can trade freely on the island of Ireland, and that requires a protection for the [EU's] Single Market as well.
He said that the protocol was the end result of compromise on both sides in negotiations, though there is still “a lot of work to do”.
When asked whether there is any chance for a trade deal to be struck, Byrne says that the government launched its Brexit Readiness plan this week encouraging businesses to be ready on the basis of “a limited deal or no deal”.
He says that Ireland and Europe will watch how the Internal Market Bill progresses through the UK Parliament.
Sovereignty, Europe, and Anglo-Irish relations
The UK has argued that though it was one of the most influential countries in the EU, it paid more into the EU ‘pot’ than it got out – an argument that had always been the reverse for Ireland (mostly because of the EU’s CAP payments to farmers).
Following on from Ireland’s resurrection from the depths of the recession to high offices of influence (see Paschal Donohoe as head of the Eurogroup, and Mairéad McGuinness’ new role), it will be paying more into the EU than before.
“You’d love to have a stronger health competence or whatever might be useful now, but that’s not going to happen without big ratification… we’ve got to work with what we have.”
On the more macro issue of Ireland’s place in Europe, Byrne says Ireland has a close relationship with European nations, but adds that it could be closer.
“Countries like Croatia and Austria, those countries that you mightn’t think of, there are business links that can be developed to mutual benefit,” he says.
Byrne also stresses, however, that relations with the UK must be maintained.
On the fisheries issue in trade negotiations,a sensitive one for Ireland, Byrne says that “you can see where Britain is coming from as well, there’s a lot of deprivation on the coasts in England, that’s where they’re coming from”.
“I think we’ve it’s absolutely necessary to maintain a close relationship with Great Britain. There’s no two ways about that. It’s a really important relationship.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-joins-eec-1973-reporting-4988403-Feb2020/,"
ON 2 JANUARY 1973, Britain joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in festive spirits following a decade of tough negotiations, though public opinion on membership was mixed.
For around 10 days, as part of a Fanfare for Europe gala, 300 sports and cultural events were held nationwide showcasing the EEC countries.
Football players from the three new states played against a team of athletes from the six other countries. Italy loaned a Michelangelo artwork for an exhibition, the Netherlands provided a Rembrandt. Only the Louvre declined to join the fun by refusing to let the Mona Lisa leave Paris.
Membership of the EEC had increased from six to nine that year – Ireland also joined in 1973, alongside Denmark. The Conservative government’s europhile prime minister Edward Heath described Britain’s entry to the bloc as “very moving”.
Here’s how the press reported the events.
Hastings and Waterloo
On 31 December 1972, the eve of the big day, the British press devote their front pages to the event.
A chapter of a thousand years of history is closing, says The Sunday Times. The Sunday Telegraph predicts joining would prove as decisive for British history as the Battles of Hastings or Waterloo.
“The Daily Mail above all warns its readers against the use of inappropriate common parlance that could shock the citizens of the eight other countries,” wrote the AFP.

Meanwhile the most passionate advocates against joining the EEC organise their last stand that day. Five hundred people join a torchlit procession to the sound of bagpipes in front of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.
Stink bombs
Festivities celebrating the event got under way on 2 January 1973, at a “European” dinner with 258 attendees hosted by the British Council at Hampton Court Palace, the former royal residence.
The next day Heath, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip attend the first gala evening, an opera at Covent Garden in London – where they are met by stink bombs thrown by 200 protesters.
Public opinion is “hesitant and (…) remains — polls say — deeply divided” over joining, AFP reports.
The decision to join had been taken in 1972 by a vote in parliament but it was never put to a referendum, unlike in Denmark and here in Ireland.
‘A fool’s paradise’
AFP reporter Basile Tesselin heads to a London pub to test the mood.
“We have our own government, a parliament we elect,” a print worker tells him.
“I’m wary of you, I see you coming,” says a taxi driver from Scotland.
“You suck up to us, and then once we’re in your sacred trap, your fool’s paradise, you’ll make us fall out with our real friends, the Americans, the Canadians, the Australians. And you’ll all become communists and take us down with you.”

The list of recriminations grows: fears that VAT (Value Added Tax) will increase, that the weight of trucks will become an issue, and over the free entry of Europeans.
“I like going to Europe,” says one truck driver from Scotland. “Particularly to France. I feel at home there. I don’t trust the English.”
The opposition Labour Party quickly makes clear its intention to renegotiate the accession treaty. Its leader Harold Wilson accuses the government of having “abdicated” its responsibilities to Brussels.
‘Yes’ then ‘No’
In 1974, Labour returns to power and, after securing a renegotiation, organises a referendum the following year on whether or not to remain in the EEC.
The “Yes” vote wins by 67%.
On 23 June 2016, 41 years later, Britons will vote by 52% to leave the now European Union.

Brandon Lewis said such checks had been in place “since about the 19th century” and the Government would work to “deliver in a way that works for people and businesses, and all communities, in Northern Ireland”.
During questions, he told the Commons: “We have also been clear there will be some checks, particularly on SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) – live animal and agri-foods, as an example.
“We are delivering on that with the Northern Ireland Executive and these are checks that are building on checks that have been in place since about the 19th century.
“But we are determined to deliver in a way that works for people and businesses, and all communities, in Northern Ireland.”
Lewis also confirmed a “slimmed-down Finance Bill” will be brought forward “later this year” to deliver commitments made on trade by the UK Government.

Responding to the DUP, he said: “At the heart of our approach is our determination to ensure that trade does flow freely to ensure that businesses trading in and with Northern Ireland can continue to trade properly.
“We will make full use of the provisions in the Protocol to deliver on that and we will continue to discuss these with the EU.
“As I say, there are still issues that we are discussing as a part of a free trade agreement, as well as through the specialist joint committee, but we will be ensuring that all of the commitments that both myself, the Prime Minister and other colleagues have made here at the despatch box will be delivered through a slimmed-down Finance Bill later this year.”
Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh called on both the EU and UK to “act in Northern Ireland’s interests and deliver the certainty businesses are crying out for”.
She said: “Not a single clause in the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill changes the facts that new requirements on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland will be coming into force in 13 weeks’ time.
“Why are a coalition of business groups still waiting for answers on 60 of the 67 basic questions they put to the secretary of state in June on how the Protocol will work? Why is there still no border operating model?
“Why is it the necessary infrastructure described by the permanent secretary for the environment and agriculture has been described as undeliverable? Isn’t it time for both the EU and UK to act in Northern Ireland’s interests and deliver the certainty businesses are crying out for?”

https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-matt-hancock-covid-vaccine-5287289-Dec2020/,"
WAS THE UK’S medical regulator able to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 before the European Union’s regulator because of Brexit?
The British Health Secretary Matt Hancock made this claimon Times Radio; the claims have been repeated by a small number of political colleagues of Hancock, though not by his senior Cabinet colleagues.
The UK became the first Western country to clinically approve a vaccine for use against SARS-CoV-2 after the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccineon Wednesday.
China and Russia have already approved vaccines for use in specific groups without waiting for large-scale clinical results known as Phase 3.
This article examines the statement by Hancock, the response of the British Prime Minister and the head of the MHRA, the British domestic legislation referenced in relation to this, and whether they support the claim made by Hancock and others.
The facts from those pieces of evidence show thatanyEuropean Union member state – including the UK – had the option to authorise vaccines itself at a national level, rather than working en masse with the rest of the EU.
This rule still applied to the UK, even though it has technically left the EU, because it’s still in the transition period.
In other words: even if Brexit had never  happened, the UK regulator would still have been able to make this decision to approve the vaccine because it was already allowed under EU law.
The Claim
Here are the comments by Hancock that we are factchecking:
“The reason we’ve been able to move this fast – and the UK is the first country in the world to have a clinically authorised vaccine – the reason is twofold: firstly, because the MHRA has done a great job of working with the company to look at that data as it’s come through, and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would.
“The second reason is because until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, the EMA. Because of Brexit we’ve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans who are moving a little bit more slowly. We do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we’ve been able to speed up how they’re done because of Brexit.”
The UK’s junior health minister Nadine Dorriesechoed his comments on Twitter:
“No one should be in any doubt about how it is that we can start rolling out the vaccine next week. A month ago, we changed the regulations to exempt us from requiring EU approval. We would still be waiting if we hadn’t. Thanks to Brexit we can now move ahead swiftly and safely.”
Tory MP and ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggsaid on Twitter:
“We could only approve this vaccine so quickly because we have left the EU. Last month we changed the regulations so a vaccine did not need EU approval which is slower.”
Reactions
At the time of writing, senior British government figures have avoided repeating Hancock’s claim when it was put to them, and the head of the UK regulator that authorised the vaccine appeared to refute his comments.
MHRA chief executive June Raine made two important points on this issue ata press briefing on Wednesday. The first was that the UK regulator approved the vaccineunder European law(ie, not because European law no longer applied); and the second was the role of the “rolling review” in allowing the Pfizer vaccine to be approved quickly.
A “rolling review” is where a medicine is assessed on a staggered basis, with packages of data from ongoing studies sent to regulators as they become available instead of waiting for all trials to conclude before sending all the data.
“We have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,” Raine said.
When UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about Brexit’s role in approving the vaccine at a briefing yesterday (at32:22 in this video), he didn’t say that Brexit was a reason why the vaccine was approved so fast in the UK.
He said: “…The UK seeming to get the vaccine soon [or] early, perhaps ahead of many other countries, I think that’s really down to the vaccine taskforce and the way they’ve gone out to organise that.”
All seven of the vaccines “backed” by the UK are “global efforts”, Johnson added.
When it was put to British Education Secretary Gavin Williamson that it happened because of Brexit,he twice avoided answering the question directly on LBC, and instead said that the UK has “the best regulators” in the world, ‘better than the French, Germans or the Americans’.

At a briefing between the Prime Minister’s spokesperson and journalists, the spokesperson is quotedas having emphasisedthe ‘hard work’ of the MHRA and those who took part in the vaccine trials, rather than affirming that it was because of Brexit.
The Facts
When the UK medicine regulator approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine, it made a decision that is available to all EU member states.
There is provision in European law, still in effect in the UK now, to allow temporary and limited use of a non-EMA approved vaccine (or other medicine) in limited cases such as to fight a pathogen or a nuclear incident.
Recent changes in British domestic law were not to allow the vaccine to be approved quicker or easier, but instead clarified how the vaccine can be used post-approval.
The EU rules
The UK has ‘officially’ left the EU, meaning that its MEPs and Commissioner have left European Union institutions, but as agreed by both sides, the UK remains under some EU rules until the end of the transition period on 31 December.
One of these rules isDirective 2001/83/EC, which has also been drafted into UK domestic law and came into effect in the UK in 2012.
Article 5(2) of that directive states:
This means that during public health emergencies (such as a pandemic or a nuclear disaster), EU countries can ask the EMA for a conditional authorisation to use an ‘unapproved’ medicine.
An official from the European Medicines Agency (EMA)saidthat the Pfizer vaccine received a “temporary authorisation” for supply and use in the UK in “specific batches”.
It’s worth noting that the EMA has also been conducting a “rolling review” of the Pfizer data; it’s due to meet on 29 December to decide whether to grant it conditional approval. After the UK regulator approved the Pfizer vaccine for use, the EMA said that it has the“most appropriate”process to approve a vaccine “in the current pandemic emergency”.
UK domestic law
Both Dorries and Rees-Mogg referred to how the UK government changed its legislation last month as a key reason why the UK was able to approve the vaccine quickly.
The legislative change can be seen in Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations (UK gov press release here).
In that press release, it states: “Until the end of December, and as part of the transition period, vaccines must be authorised via the European Medicines Agency and that authorisation will automatically be valid in the UK.
“After the transition period ends in January 2021, the MHRA will have new powers to approve medicines, including vaccines, and will have greater flexibility to do this in a shorter time, while maintaining the highest standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.”
Legislative changes made by the UK government recentlydid expand the scope of what the UK can do with vaccines not yet licensed by the EU, such as allowing more people to administer them, and granting the vaccine producers with immunity from legal liability.
As stated by legal expert and Financial Times columnist David Allen Greenhere,this Regulation 174 instrumentdoes not change the EU directive, making it “irrelevant” to the debate on whether Brexit had a role in approving the vaccine for use.
The changes made were not to allow the MHRA to approve use of the vaccine separately to the EU’s regulator, but to widen the scope of how an unapproved vaccine can be used.
The Verdict
The claim made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Brexit was one of two reasons why the UK became the first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for use hasn’t been publicly echoed by the UK Prime Minister, nor the head of the regulatory body which approved the Pfizer vaccine.
The UK didn’t choose to wait for the EU regulator to approve the vaccine, the way EU member states like Ireland did,but instead used a European law still in effect in the UK to default to its own regulator for temporary and limited approval.
It could be argued that this is part of the process of the UK leaving the EU – that the UK is distancing itself from EU institutions as part of Brexit.
But the choice made by the UK would have also been available to themif they hadn’t left the EU in January.
It may be the case that the MHRA becomes faster at approving new drugs than the EMA after the transition period ends, because it decides on new standards and processes to approve vaccines and other medicines.
But it’s incorrect to say that Brexit was the reason, or part of the reason, for the UK becoming the first country to clinically approve a Covid-19 vaccine. This is supported by EU and UK legislation, and the statement from the head of the MHRA.
The claim that the UK approved the Pfizer vaccine before the EU because of Brexit isFALSE.

https://www.the42.ie/brexit-irish-football-5285625-Dec2020/,"THE ENGLISH FA, Premier League and English Football League (EFL) today announced new, post-Brexit rules around transfers taking effect from 1 January, though there is confusion as to whether they apply to young Irish footballers.
Under the new rules, English clubs will not be allowed to sign players from the European Union until the player turns 18, as is the case under Fifa rules.
Clubs within the EU can sign players from other EU countries the age of 16.
A senior EFL source toldThe42there is no exemption for Irish players, and so players must wait until 18 if they wish to transfer to a English club.

Some clubs, however, have been proceeding as if it were business as usual and can continue signing Irish players from the age of 16.
One Irish club source toldThe42there has been a “scramble” among English clubs in recent days to establish interest in signing young Irish players. The same club were contacted by seven English clubs across the last four days, all of whom said they were able to continue signing Irish players from the age of 16.
One of these clubs cited the Common Travel Area as the basis for the exemption.
The Common Travel Area (CTA) is an agreement between the Irish and British governments that pre-dates the European Union, and is thus not dependent on it. The CTA allows for the free movement of people between Ireland and Britain, and enshrines rights related to employment, healthcare, and education.
In 2019, the Irish and British governments agreed to protect the CTA regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The issue is likely to ultimately come down to whether the CTA supersedes the Fifa transfer rules applicable to the rest of the world.
An FA spokesperson toldThe42this evening they are awaiting confirmation from Fifa on the issue.

Elsewhere, English clubs will be limited to signing a maximum of six players per season aged 21 or under from overseas under the new rules, which has been introduced in a bid to give more opportunities to domestic talent.
Senior players moving to the UK, meanwhile, will have to be granted a work permit to complete their transfer. Each transfer will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, on a points system.
Points are scored based on senior and youth international appearances, the quality of the selling club (based on the league they are in, league position and progression in continental competition) and club appearances (based on domestic league and continental competition minutes.)
These work permit requirements will not apply to Irish players, however, with the FA’s rules stating these apply only to a player “who is not a citizen of the United Kingdom or Ireland.”","10.51pm, 1 Dec 2020",

The Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union has released a progress report today, ahead of being dissolved on 31 December.
The report summarises the evidence it has heard since the 2017 general election, from various industries including representatives of the food and drinks industry, agriculture, the economy, politics, and fuel and energy.
Among the most significant bits of information contained in the report, were the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on thefood industryin Ireland.
Paul Kelly, Director of FDI, expressed the view that “any introduction of tariffs would decimate much of Ireland’s food and drink imports to the UK”.

He highlighted the industry’s reliance on the UK market, with 71% of beer exports, 85% of cider exports and 66% of prepared consumer foods exports going to the UK.
Joe Healy, President of the Irish Farmers’ Association said that 37% of Ireland’s food and drinks exports and 50% of beef exports went to the UK, making Irish agriculture “uniquely exposed”.
He reported that Brexit uncertainty and the devaluation of sterling had already had a major impact on Irish agriculture, particularly the beef sector, and expressed concern that any disruption to the UK market through the imposition of tariff barriers, border checks, certification requirements or other regulatory changes, or new entrants to the UK market, would seriously undermine Irish exports.
Victor Chestnutt, Deputy President of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, told the committee that around 85% of Northern Irish produce was sold to British market, so free and frictionless trade with Great Britain was a priority.
He also that Brexit had already had an impact on farmers in Northern Ireland, with overall losses of approximately £27 million up to September 2019.
Pat McCormack, president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, discussed the significant financial losses already experienced by agriculture producers as a result of Brexit uncertainty, particularly in the beef sector.
He said that 30% of Irish dairy exports go to the UK and 50% of Irish cheese was exported to the UK in 2018.

A visit toDublin Portby four members of the Committee was also included in the report. It  was informed by the Chief Executive, Eamonn O’Reilly, that €30 million had been spent on border controls since December 2017.
Of the 1.6m units of freight (trailers and containers) that move through Dublin Port currently, 200,000 were from/to destinations outside the EU and were already subject to border controls. But after Brexit, the number of freight units from outside the EU would rise from 200,000 to 1 million.
Michael Mahon, EirGrid’s Director of Grid Development and Interconnection, outlined the details of the Celtic Interconnector project, which would link the electrical grids of Ireland and France at points in Cork and Brittany.
He stated that the Interconnector would increase competition in theenergy marketand provide Ireland’s only energy connection to an EU Member State after Brexit. The project was approved for grant funding of €530 million by the European Commission, 65% of which would be allocated to Ireland.
Professor Mark Ferguson, Director General of SFI and Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government of Ireland, explained that Ireland was set to become a net contributor to theHorizon 2020 programmefor the first time.
He provided the breakdown of Ireland’s top five research EU research collaboration partners as of July 2019 – Germany (10.64%), Spain (10.3%), UK (10.01%), France (9.48%), Italy (8.75%), the Netherlands (5.4%). If the UK withdraws from Horizon, 10% of Ireland’s research projects would need to find other collaboration partners.

The European Commission sent a formal notice to the UK at “the first stage of infringement proceedings, giving the UK four months to address the shortcomings has identified.
Infringement proceedings are launched when an EU country fails to implement EU law, and can lead to the European Court of Justice imposing financial penalties.
The UK has failed to “comply with EU law on the free movement of EU citizens and their family members”, according to the infringement decision.
It states: “UK national legislation limits the scope of beneficiaries of EU free movement law in the United Kingdom as well as the possibilities for EU citizens and their family members to appeal administrative decisions restricting free movement rights.

“The Commission considers that the United Kingdom has thereby breached the Free Movement Directive 2004/38/EC as well as EU rules on freedom of movement of EU citizens (Article 21 TFEU), freedom of movement of workers (Article 45 TFEU) and freedom of establishment (Article 49 TFEU).
“EU law on free movement of persons continues to apply to and in the United Kingdom as if it were still an EU Member State during the transition period.
“Furthermore, the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK after the end of the transition period, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, are built on the rights that they currently enjoy in the United Kingdom under EU rules.”
It added: “The United Kingdom’s shortcomings in the implementation and transposition of EU free movement law risks therefore also affecting the implementation of the citizens’ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement after the end of the transition period.
“For these reasons, the Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom, the first step in the infringement process.”
Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told a Brussels press briefing: “In this specific case, the Commission considers that the United Kingdom has failed to notify its last five legislative instruments for the transposition of the free movement directive, its national rules transposing the safeguards prescribed by the directive for certain individual decisions restricting free movement, as well as correspondence tables.”

UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed during a phone call today to “redouble efforts” to reach a trade deal and signed off on talks continuing next week.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister told his Brussels counterpart that there remained “significant differences” in the UK-EU negotiations, with the two sides continuing to be apart on their positions over fishing rights and a level playing field agreement.
The call follows two weeks of intensified talks between the UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost and his European Union equivalent Michel Barnier, with Johnson and von der Leyen paving the way for further discussions between the pair in London next week.
“Prime Minister Boris Johnson today spoke with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for a stock take on the progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU,” a Number 10 spokeswoman said.
“The Prime Minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish.
“The Prime Minister and President agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.
“They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations.”

Briefings between the two leaders are regarded as key moments in the cross-Channel bartering.
Their conversation last month led to discussions being “intensified” before a fallout after the European Council meeting on 15 October briefly derailed the negotiations.
Ireland’s Europe minister Thomas Byrne, speaking before the phone call, cast doubt that the conversation would lead to white smoke on agreeing a deal, saying discussions are still at a “technical level”.
“I personally don’t expect that there would be major progress today but at the same time I think it is very good that the top two are talking – I think that’s really positive but I don’t think we would expect ‘a moment’ at this particular point,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
UK chief negotiator Lord Frost was in the Belgian capital to speak face-to-face with his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier earlier this week as the deadline for doing a deal edges closer.
After talks finished on Wednesday, Barnier briefed MEPs and EU diplomats that “very serious divergences” remain, with only 54 days left until the end of the transition period.
He said the main stumbling blocks continue to be around the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on areas including state subsidies, fisheries policy and the governance of any deal.
After the phone call,  Frost tweeted: “Prime Minister Boris Johnson and commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke today about our negotiations with the EU.
“My talks with Michel Barnier will continue in London on Monday.”
He previously said progress has been made during two weeks of intensive negotiations but “wide divergences remain on some core issues”.
Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said earlier today that he doubted the conversation between von der Leyen and Johnson would make a significant difference in the EU-UK trade talks.
“I personally don’t expect that there would be major progress today but at the same time I think it is very good that the top two are talking,” said Byrne, speaking on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
Byrne doesn’t believe that the chief negotiators should be sidelined and that heads of state shouldn’t be engaging to achieve a deal.
“No, Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier… they speak on behalf of all Europeans, individual member states don’t – that’s the way the European Union works,” said Byrne.","11.28am, 7 Nov 2020",7 Nov 2020
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-is-happening-on-friday-4974848-Jan2020/,"THE UK WILL officially leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 31 January – but nothing will be noticeably different for people until the start of next year.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had, for a brief period, asked people to“bung a bob for Big Ben to bong”- basically, to crowdfund £500,000 to get the iconic clock tower to ring - but thisfailed to gather much momentum, so those bells won’t ring.
The Brexit Party has received permission to hold a celebration in Trafalgar Square – but without fireworks.
It’s been three years since the UK voted to leave the EU, in June 2016; since then the country’s parliament and people have been locked into a debate about how they wanted to act on that vote.
Among the options discussed were amicably agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU, walking away and leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement, and revoking Article 50 to reverse the entire Brexit process (this won’t be an option anymore after Friday).
After a clandestine-esque meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Johnson and the EU struck a Brexit ‘divorce deal’, or Withdrawal Agreement last autumn.
Assuming the European Parliament votes the deal through as it’s expected to on Wednesday 29 January, the definite and final Brexit date is now Friday 31 January 2020 (the previous Brexit leave dates were 29 March, 12 April, and 31 October.)

So what will happen on the day? The UK will legally leave the EU at 11pm on 31st – the reason for that time is that equates to midnight in Brussels.
The UK’s representation in the European Parliament will be retracted, meaning it will have no more MEPs. The UK has 73 MEPs as it stands, so other countries will get a few new MEP seats: Ireland had 11, and will increase to 13, for example.
Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune, and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews were elected in the European elections on 24 May last year, but haven’t taken their seats, as they were waiting for Brexit to officially happen. Clune and Andrews haven’t been paid since being elected.
The UK will have officially left the EU and will then enter the transition period, where the UK remains in the Single Market and the Customs Union to give people, government and businesses time to prepare for the new trading rules and standards that will come in after the transition period (what exactly these are has yet to be decided).
The transition period is to last until 31 December 2020. The UK has the option to extend the transition period for another one or two years, which Johnson has said he wouldn’t do.
So taking that at face value, the UK will have left the Single Market and Customs Union on 1 January 2021.
The Brexit trade negotiations are the next phase, and a crucial one: they will decide customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, and the EU’s new trading relationship with the UK.
Johnson is promising to have this all negotiated by the end of the transition period, so 11 months’ time, which seems impossible by comparative standards: for reference, other EU trade talks have dragged on for much longer:
If Johnson wants to extend the transition period, he has until 1 July to request a one-time only extension for either one or two years.
In short, by 11pm 31 January, the UK will have legally left the European Union, British MEPs will leave the European Parliament and new “cold storage” MEPs will take their seats, and it won’t be possible to revoke Article 50 to reverse the Brexit process.

AS THIS DECADE nears its end, democracy perhaps never so questionable and climate change the only thing that matters, Irish racing is hardly at the summit of priorities.
Somehow, the United States and United Kingdom’s populations voted in Donald Trump and Boris Johnson respectively as leaders, which is almost as depressing as the fact that this pair of buffoons ended up being the best options available to the Conservatives in either nation.
These are interesting times, if you want to be as glib as is becoming the political norm. As a friend messaged me on Thursday evening, “2019 Reeling In The Years will be quite nice to look at. We will explain it to our children. We will have no answers.”
I struggled to sleep last night but most of us woke this morning, some tending to horses in the bitter cold of the winter dawn. Racing people are perhaps more wrapped up in their sport and profession to the exclusion of other matters than most, yet they can certainly ask what all of this means on this island.
A no-deal Brexit is disastrous on many levels, including racing — although there have beenindications latelythat such as scenario is likely to be avoided. “In the event of Britain crashing out without a deal it would be recognised as a third country and the EU requires movement from third countries to go through border inspection posts,” Brian Kavanagh toldthe Irish Timesback in January.
This being Brexit, little or no progress was realised throughout the year, and Johnson’s ‘Get Brexit done’ manifesto, which effectively won the day, was an empty soundbite nevertheless enough for a weary population who want to get on with their lives.

Intriguingly, Kavanagh, when asked byThe42what his response was to the Tories’ electoral landslide, was looking at it positively. This is despite the reality that a Labour victory might have entailed a second vote on Brexit.
“I think it’s probably a good outcome,” Kavanagh said, “as it brings certainty to the situation,” sounding almost as fatigued by the past few years as the British voter.
“The lift in sterling’s exchange rate is a positive for racecourse media rights income too.”
The sterling’s improvement will also be an incentive for Irish owners to target British races, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the movement of horses between the islands, and in theory between southern trainers and Down Royal or Downpatrick.
Of great significance too is the changing picture in the Republic, a general election now a certainty in the next few months, with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fighting over each other to achieve a more presentable reason to end this government’s reign, thereby going to the polls with a narrative to suit themselves. The portents are not good for Fine Gael.
Four lost by-elections of late have put pressure on Leo Varadkar, who gives the impression that he is reeling, and there are enough people pissed off about with the government, be they farmers, house hunters or in need of a functioning health service, for a change not to seem more likely than not.
At the Horse Racing Ireland awards night Tuesday, Minister Michael Creed was again guest of honour, and there seems to be no end to his commitment to racing. Fine Gael has been good for the sport, with the €67.2 million annual funding for the sport continuing in 2020.
HRI has excelled in promoting the economic value of racing, especially in rural Ireland, but it now seems likely that Micheál Martin will be the next Taoiseach, heading a government of the soldiers of dynasty and whatever left-wing partner or partners.Irish racing, rather like the Arabs and oil, has recognised that it cannot rely on government funding indefinitely, hence the change in taxation of bookmakers here in recent years. Yet we remain reliant too on a flourishing scene in retail in Britain, which is a concern.
The supply of pictures from Irish racing to cross-channel betting shops is a central element to the sport’s media rights deal announced last year and which runs until 2023. Retail, due to changes to FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminals) rules, is in a perilous enough state in Britain, while it is too early to tell how shops will fare here subsequent to the government’s decision to double betting tax (with a key exemption for smaller bookmakers).

And if North Belfast can elect a Shinner, nothing is sacred anymore.

Launching the party’s General Election campaign in Westminster, Farage said that Johnson’s deal did not represent Brexit.
Farage said that if the Tories did not agree to an alliance and abandon the deal he would make sure every household in the country was made aware it was a “sell out” of Brexit.
“I say to Boris Johnson – drop the deal,” he said.
The Brexit Party leader said that if Johnson did not agree to his terms: “We will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales.”

The comments came after US President Donald Trump appeared to call for an electoral pact between Farage and Boris Johnson, saying the pair could become an “unstoppable force”.
A Number 10 spokesman said the Prime Minister had not spoken to the US President about his Brexit deal which was “agreed after they were last in touch”.
“The PM’s deal takes back control of our money, laws and border and allows us to do trade deals with any country we chose – including the US,” he said.
Ahead of Farage’s comments, Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said: “We are not interested in doing any pacts with the Brexit Party or indeed with anybody else.”
The Communities Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We are in this to win it.”

“We can’t make a trade deal with the UK because I think we can do many times the numbers that we’re doing right now and certainly much bigger numbers than you are doing under the European Union.”

THE UK AND European Union are on collision course for a Brexit trade battle as Boris Johnson and Michel Barnier set out competing visions of the future relationship.
Major stumbling blocks are already obvious, just days after the UK left the European Union, with battles over fishing and the application of a “level playing field” on issues including state subsidies, environmental standards and workers’ rights.
The Prime Minister insisted there was “no need” to abide by EU rules and said that British fishing grounds are “first and foremost” for UK boats.
But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that allowing European trawlers into British waters was “inextricably linked” to securing a trade deal.
And he pointed to the joint Political Declaration, agreed with Johnson, which committed the UK to”robust commitments to ensure a level playing field”.

The Prime Minister used a speech in Greenwich, south-east London, to stress his commitment to free trade – and signal his determination to secure an arrangement with Brussels along the lines of that agreed between the EU and Canada.
“There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policies, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,” he said.
Johnson confirmed that if a Canada-style agreement was not possible, he would be prepared to walk away without a full trade deal, like Australia’s relationship with the EU.
“The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada’s or more like Australia’s and I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper mightily,” he said.
While the government was ready to consider an agreement with Brussels on fisheries, “it must reflect the fact that the UK will be an independent coastal state from the end of this year, controlling our own waters”.
“Under such an agreement there would be annual negotiations with the EU, using the latest scientific data, ensuring British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats.”

EU stance
Shortly before Johnson spoke, the EU set out its draft negotiating mandate, calling for “reciprocal access” for fishing vessels, and stating that a free trade area with no tariffs or quotas was contingent on a “level playing field … ensured through robust commitments”.
Barnier told reporters in Brussels: “It’s clear that the agreement that we wish to have in the interests of UK fishermen and in the interests of European fishermen – I call that reciprocal access to our territorial waters and our markets – that agreement on fisheries will be inextricably linked to the trade agreement, as indeed will be… the agreement on the level playing field agreed with Boris Johnson.”
He said that “where there’s a will, there’s a way” to reach a deal.
“But we are constrained by the decision, if it’s confirmed, the decision of Boris Johnson to leave the single market and the customs union at the end of this year.”
Barnier, who said he had a “very direct and frank relationship” with the Prime Minister, suggested it would not be possible to complete the whole deal within 11 months.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nine-month-countdown-starts-as-uk-and-eu-knuckle-down-for-trade-talks-5029081-Mar2020/,"THE FIRST ROUND of post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and European Union are due to start today, with the two sides well apart on a final agreement.
David Frost, the Prime Minister’s Europe adviser, and his team of negotiators will travel to Brussels to kick-start the nine-month process of vying to secure a new trade arrangement with the EU.
Both sides published their negotiation mandates last week, revealing that they are at odds over Boris Johnson’s push for a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal, as well as demands over fishing, state subsidies and standards.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal like Canada’s, which would eliminate most import taxes but still require some border checks, was not suitable for Britain due to its close proximity and links to the continent.
Instead, he wants Britain to agree to sign up to a number of level-playing rules set by Brussels.
The bloc is also arguing for little to change in terms of fishing quotas and access to British waters for European boats – a continuation of the status quo that ministers in Westminster are vehemently against.
A high-level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for June, by which time it should be clear whether the Canada-like agreement sought by Johnson is possible by the end of the year.

The EU wants to see progress on both fishing and financial services at that summer marker.
Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for Brexit preparations, said the UK would not “trade away” its “newly recovered sovereignty” during the talks.
“Our aim is to secure, through a fair and measured approach, a comprehensive free trade agreement, and also find common ground on questions such as fisheries, internal security and aviation,” said the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in an article on Sunday.
“I believe we can secure a great new deal for an exciting new era.
“But it is important that we are clear from the start that these negotiations are taking place in new times.
“Yes, we want the best possible trading relationship with the EU. But we will not trade away our newly recovered sovereignty.”

French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin warned the Prime Minister that the tight 31 December deadline would not pressure the EU 27 into agreeing fresh terms.
She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: “If we need six more months we, as Europeans, are very clear that we want a good deal, a fair deal, a deal that can last for many generations to come, and we will not sign for the sake of having a deal. It would make no sense.”

The outbreak of coronavirus is said to be complicating cross-Channel relations as negotiators prepare to start bartering.
The Telegraph reported that Downing Street and the Department of Health and Social Care are involved in a stand-off over whether Britain should retain membership of an EU pandemic warning system used to stem the Sars and bird flu outbreak.
It comes after a further 13 coronavirus cases were confirmed in the UK yesterday – the largest jump in a single day.
According to the newspaper, No 10 fears continued membership of the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) could hamper trade negotiations.
As a result, Downing Street is said to have prevented Health Secretary Matt Hancock from travelling to meet counterparts to coordinate a Europe-wide response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Liberal Democrats have called for the trade talks to be postponed and the deadline to be extended to allow ministers to focus on stopping coronavirus.
Acting leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Then the NHS and local communities can get the funds and the focus they deserve, and the UK can talk to our European neighbours about how we can cooperate against the coronavirus which does not recognise national borders.”

Varadkar and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee are meeting Barnier today in government buildings.

The meeting is taking place just days before the UK formally leaves the EU this Friday.
“The European Union is a union of 27 member states. The UK is only one country. And we have a population and a market of 450 million people,” Varadkar said.
Johnson has repeatedly ruled out requesting an extension to the transition period, during which the UK abides by EU rules, past 31 December.
But Varadkar, whose talks with Johnson were seen as key in securing a breakthrough on the exit pact, questioned whether it would be possible to negotiate a full trade deal in time, saying “it will be difficult to do this”.
And he warned against any attempt by the UK to broker parts of a deal over time with the EU.

THE UK AND Brussels appeared close to finally striking a post-Brexit trade deal tonight as speculation mounted that both sides were poised to make an announcement.
Taoisach Micheál Martin said on RTÉ’s Nine O’Clock News: “…Given the enormous time that has been put into negotiations, there does seem to be a sense today that this is nearing a conclusion.”
“We are in the final phase,” one EU official said. Asked whether this meant a deal later today, a source close to the talks said: “Very likely, yes.”
The UK and the EU were understood to have made progress on their differences over fishing rights and “level playing field” mechanisms on competition issues as the clock ticked down to the 31 December deadline for the end of the Brexit transition period.
It follows nine months of intense, and at times rancorous, negotiations.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a virtual meeting late on tonight with Cabinet ministers to discuss the situation.
Despite numerous reports of a breakthrough, one German reporter based in London said that a press conference had been scheduled for 8pm, butwas cancelled.
Bloombergreportedthat the ‘outline of a deal’ had been done, and just needed the final approval of the UK Prime Minister and the 27 EU member states.
The Financial Timesreportedthat British officials said a trade deal completed as early as this evening was “possible”, though there were issues left to resolve.
The official line from No 10 Downing Street was that a deal done today was that it was “possible but far from certain”.

He said that the landbridge route would continue to be used by Irish hauliers, that the customs arrangements if there is no deal is risky, and that even if there is a deal “we may still have difficulties” with transportation after the Brexit transition period.
Taoiseach Micheal Martin said fishing was still the main obstacle in the way of a deal.
“It’s all down to fish, it would appear right now,” he said.
“There was a lot of progress made on the level playing field over the last two to three weeks and it’s very difficult for all involved but the gap is still wide on fish, and for fishing communities in Ireland it’s a time of worry.”
“It’s about sustaining rural communities,” he said.

Earlier today, British Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said he is “reasonably optimistic” that a late deal will be agreed before the current trading arrangements expire at the end of the month.
When asked whether there is a link between French President Emmanuel Macron’s action to shut the border with France and the Brexit negotiations, Jenrick said: “I hope not.”
How likely is a deal?
The British pound surged against the dollar on optimism that a deal could finally be reached, with sterling rising to $1.35 at around 3.51.
Diplomats from EU member states, which would have to approve any technical agreement, were less optimistic however, warning that they still needed to see a text and that problems may remain.
But a definitive breakthrough on 10 months of tortuous negotiations seemed close.
Any agreement still faces a race to be signed off by the leaders of the EU’s 27 member states, as well as the ratification of the deal in the European Parliament and the House of Commons.
With just seven days to go until the UK leaves the Single Market and Customs Union, it has been suggested that a deal could be approved provisionally before the cut-off date, and then scrutinised by EU lawmakers in the new year to avoid a cliff-edge.

The focus has recently shifted to cross-Channel calls between EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after exhausted officials failed to close the gap on how to share access to UK fishing waters.
The remaining differences between the two camps were narrow but deep, in particular over fishing, with EU crews facing a dramatic cut in their catch from British waters.
London has pushed to reduce EU fishing fleets’ share of the estimated €650-million annual haulby 35%, with changes phased in over three years.
The EU, in particular countries with northern fishing fleets like France, Denmark and the Netherlands – was insisting on a25% reduction over at least six years.
Talks could continue yet
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed ambassadors and then senior MEPs yesterday, and said that Brussels was ready to negotiate until the end of the year – or even “beyond” – but time was running out for any deal to be provisionally applied.
EU members agreed to keep talking, but one diplomat warned: “Barnier was unable to tell member states whether there would be a deal tomorrow, before Christmas, the New Year or summer 2021.
“Also a narrow path might in the end prove a dead end,” he said.
A colleague from another member state earlier suggested that if there was no breakthrough today, talks could resume next week.

“I think it’s very welcome, but with a tinge of sadness that the Withdrawal Agreement has passed through all the stages in Westminster.
The UK is set to leave the EU at the end of January, after EU chiefs signed off on the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with Boris Johnson.
Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, confirmed on Friday that he had signed the Withdrawal Agreement.

The document, agreed between the UK and the EU after years of back-and-forth negotiations, was also signed by the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.
Queen Elizabeth II gave royal assent to the legislation for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, paving the way for the UK to leave the European Union with an agreement at the end of January – almost four years after 2016’s Leave vote.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the European Parliament before Brexit day, with a vote expected on 29 January.
The UK is set to enter a transition period in February, during which the relationship with Brussels will remain the same while trade talks are finalised before the tight 31 December deadline.
Trade experts have warned that negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with the EU could prove difficult, especially in such a short time frame. Critics of Brexit have also said that the UK could still end up facing a no-deal scenario if an agreement isn’t reached before the deadline.
“Yes, on the first of February, the UK will leave, and nothing will change,” McEntee said today.
“However, the idea that we can negotiate a trade deal with one that is comprehensive, one that provides very little change for our citizens, not just in the UK and Ireland, but the EU as well, within about a 12-month space, it’s very difficult,” she said.

“Now of course the EU is willing and Michel Barnier is still there, and he is working with his team, and all member states are included to ensure that we have a mandate and that we are ready for these negotiations when they start.”
“We do know, of course, that Boris Johnson has said he does not want to have an extension, which means trying to negotiate a very difficult trade deal, essentially in 10 months,” McEntee added.
“We know, looking at previous trade, how long they have taken, but we have said ‘we are willing, we are ready’.
“And what we do need to make sure that in all of the negotiations Ireland’s priorities are heard, that the other 26 member states’ priorities are heard and that there is a level playing field, that we have a balance of rights and obligations throughout all of this.”

He has previously said the government is preparing its latest Budget on the basis of a no-deal Brexit.
He recently told the UK Liberal Democrats’ conference he was “not that optimistic” of a future free trade agreement being reached between the UK and the EU.

Speaking ahead of today’s meeting, Martin said: “I look forward to joining colleagues in Brussels this week. When we met in July, we agreed an unprecedented €1.8 trillion package to support Europe’s economic recovery.
“If we are to see the full benefit of that package, we need to maximise the potential of the Single Market, including building our collective digital capacity, economic resilience and competitiveness.
“This is all the more important in the context of the economic disruption of both Covid-19 and Brexit.”
European Council summit
Martin’s spokesman said he would update fellow EU state leaders with his thoughts on Brexit developments at a special meeting of the European Council today.

Participants will discuss how to deepen and strengthen the Single Market as a key tool to drive Europe’s economic recovery. The council will also consider how to improve the competitiveness of European industry.
Martin’s spokesman said: “The European Council will be briefed on the latest state of play in the Brexit negotiations which are continuing this week, and the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to share his assessment of recent developments with fellow leaders.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/coronavirus-brexit-simon-coveney-5021178-Feb2020/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY said that the coronavirus and ongoing Brexit negotiations add further urgency to forming a government in Ireland.
Simon Coveney was speaking in Brussels ahead of the special EU Council summit.
Coveney warned Brexit will dominate Irish politics for the foreseeable future.

“I think it will because the future relationship with the UK is something that is going to fundamentally impact on the health of the Irish economy, its growth rates and how goods come and go in and out of our markets which is based on exports with the rest of the EU, but also with the rest of the world,” he said.
“So, of course if we could have a government in place following on from the general election recognising the mandates that all parties have that would be great, but I’m afraid it’s not as simple as that, if it was we would making more progress on it.
“I think it’s going to take some more time to deal with the new realities of Irish politics which is that the political landscape is quite fractured, and certainly Fine Gael will try to be be constructive in terms of how we move forward.
“In many ways the meetings that Helen [McEntee, the Minister for European Affairs] and I are having today are a reminder of why it’s important for a new government to be formed soon.”
His comments come ahead of a meeting between the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail later today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-boris-johnson-3-5199929-Sep2020/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL Martin has spoken to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today after the Irish government got no “heads up” on the controversial new British legislation that will override elements of the Brexit deal and breach international law.
Downing Street had insisted changes in the Internal Market Bill were simply “limited clarifications” to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if they failed to secure a free trade deal with the EU.
But yesterday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis provoked a furious reaction when he confirmed to MPs yesterday that the legislation would breach international law in a “very specific and limited way”.
Speaking to reporters in Government Buildings today, the Taoiseach said “meaningful negotiations can only proceed on the basis on mutual trust”.
“Unilateral actions which seek to change the operation of measures already agreed included in an International treaty and incorporated in domestic law do not build trust,” said Martin.
“Trust is fundamental in the conduct of any negotiations,” said the Taoiseach, conveying that he is “extremely concerned about the unilateral nature of the UK government’s actions”.
He said the actions by the UK government “undermines” progress in the negotiations, stating:

“It does not build trust.”
Martin said he would “register our very strong concerns” to the UK prime minister, and the move to ”deviate what is an agreed international treaty”. He said people in Europe and the UK were taken aback by yesterday’s comments.
“It is not an acceptable way to conduct negotiations,” said Martin, who added that he is particularly concerned the latest developments “drags Northern Ireland back into the central stage” and could “potentially be divisive”.

When asked byTheJournal.ieabout his first reaction to Lewis’ comments in the House of Commons yesterday, the Taoiseach initially he thought it “was a new departure”.
“I haven’t quite witnessed a member of any government gong into any parliament and saying we are going to break int law,” he said.
He said it does raise questions about whether the UK government will adhere to any agreement if one is reached, adding that Lewis “didn’t display any subtly in terms of his intention”.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said it was important to keep eyes on the prize and to stay calm, but was clearly annoyed at the recent developments.
“I would caution anyone who is thinking about playing politics with Northern Ireland on Brexit again, Northern Ireland is too fragile and too important to be used as a pawn in the broader Brexit negotiations,” said Coveney.

“Now is not the time to reignite disagreements that have been settled,” he said.
Coveney said what has been different to any other week in negotiations, is this week the Irish government and the EU taskforce got no heads up.
Generally if the UK government is making a decision or change in direction “we would get a heads up”, he said, stating the he, the Taoiseach or Tánaiste would get a call saying ‘we are going to do something this week that may create issues’.
“None of that happened this week,” he said, stating:
“My understanding is the taskforce got no heads up this week, we got no heads up this week, instead it broke in the media and yesterday we had a statement in the House of Commons,” he said, there was no reach out or back channel discussions.
“It is an extraordinary way of trying to close out negotiations, where trust is the most import component,” he said.
He said the UK government’s approach is “very, very problematic”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/increased-risk-of-enforcement-by-scotland-over-rockall-fishing-vessels-government-warns-5320446-Jan2021/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS said there remains an “increased risk” to Irish vessels fishing off Rockall in the North Atlantic after engagement with Scottish authorities.
A statement this evening from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine comes three days after aDonegal fishing vessel was prevented from fishingin the waters around Rockall by a Marine Scotland patrol boat.
The Northern Celt vessel was boarded by officials from the agency responsible for Scotland’s fisheries on Tuesday and skipper Adrian McClenaghan was told that he can no longer fish within 12 nautical miles of the disputed outcrop.
Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock that sits approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.

It has been a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the UK for several decades.
The UK claimed sovereignty over the tiny islet in 1955 and purported to annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.
Ireland has never recognised British sovereignty over the outcrop.
Last year, Scotland threatened action if Irish vessels continue to operate in the zone around Rockall.
In a statement this evening, the Department said Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue met to discuss Tuesday’s incident.
“The Ministers are fully aware of interactions between an Irish fishing vessel, and a Marine Scotland patrol vessel in recent days. The Irish Government has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities.
Related ReadsExplainer: Where is Rockall and why has it sparked tensions between the Irish and Scottish governments?
“Through this engagement, the Irish Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the longstanding fisheries tradition in the area. Taking account of the new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, this may also require contact with the European Commission,” the Department said.
“In addressing these issues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as their respective officials, are considering all options for further engagement on the issues involved and are continuing to work closely together.
“While engagement continues, there  remains an increased risk of enforcement action being taken by Scottish fisheries control authorities against Irish vessels operating in the waters around Rockall at present.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/barnier-says-gas-remain-uk-and-eu-brexit-5255756-Nov2020/,"MICHEL BARNIER HAS said “very serious divergences” remain between the European Union and UK as efforts continue to strike a post-Brexit trade deal.
The EU’s chief negotiator said the main stumbling blocks remained the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on areas including state subsidies, fisheries policy and the governance of any deal.
Barnier updated MEPs and EU diplomats on the status of the negotiations with his UK counterpart David Frost, which have been taking place in Brussels.
He said: “Despite EU efforts to find solutions, very serious divergences remain in level playing field, governance and fisheries.
“These are essential conditions for any economic partnership.”
Frost said progress had been made during two weeks of intensive talks but “wide divergences remain on some core issues”.

“We continue to work to find solutions that fully respect UK sovereignty,” he said.
Despite the failure to achieve a breakthrough, it is expected that the two sides will remain in contact by videoconference calls, with further talks next week in London.
The EU believes a deal needs to be done by the middle of November if it is to be ratified by the time the UK leaves the single market and customs union when the post-Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.
In an indication that a deal may not be possible, Barnier said the EU is “prepared for all scenarios”.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney responded to Barnier’s comments by tweeting: “A reminder that a #Brexit trade deal is far from certain.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-talks-5222212-Oct2020/,"BETWEEN THE COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid approach of the end of the Brexit transition period, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Irish people and businesses.
One thing we can be certain of is that come January, Brexit will bring huge changes to Ireland and how we do business. The Government has been preparing for Brexit since well before the first deadline of 29 March 2019 and this work has intensified in recent months.
This past week we have seen the EU begin an infringement process against the UK over the Internal Market Bill which is in contravention of the ‘good faith’ protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the ninth round of trade negotiations begin in Brussels.
An agreement must be reached by Halloween to avoid a hard Brexit. While the chances of a deal are slim, it is still very much possible. European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister will take stock today of where these negotiations stand.
Looking like a no-deal
However, due to the lack of progress in negotiations, in May 2020 the Government agreed to step up the no-deal preparations and at this stage, it is most likely that if there is a deal, it will be extremely limited.
Advertisement
No matter what form Brexit takes come January, the UK will leave the Single Market and Customs Union. Customs checks will be required on goods moving to, from or through the UK and significant disruption to business-as-usual is guaranteed.
The Government has been focused on helping businesses prepare themselves for Brexit as far back as 2019 when the ‘Getting Ireland Brexit Ready’ campaign was rolled out at a cost of €1.5 million to ensure that all businesses were aware of the steps they needed to take to prepare themselves.
This September, the updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan was published to support the preparatory work needed for the permanent changes that Brexit will bring. No matter what size a business is, it is crucial that this work in undertaken.
A €20 million Brexit fund was established to help Irish businesses who trade with the UK to put in place the necessary systems to prepare for the forthcoming customs arrangements.
Additionally, investments in infrastructure at our ports and airports have been ramped up substantially to prepare for the eventual introduction of such checks on EU-UK trade passing through Ireland.
We have also secured an increase in the share of customs collection costs retained by us to 25%. This will provide us with a buffer should costs increase over time.
Preparing for January
Crucially, a new Brexit Omnibus Bill will be brought to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks by Minister Simon Coveney. The first Brexit Omnibus Bill in 2019 dealt with preparations for a potential no-deal Brexit and the forthcoming version will address the permanent changes that will arise in January. The Bill will protect our citizens and allow the sectors most impacted by Brexit to operate without disadvantage.
The EU has been a strong ally to Ireland throughout the Brexit process and this support shows no signs of waning.
The €1.82 trillion Covid-19 recovery fund agreed by EU leaders includes a €5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve which will protect those Member States most affected by Brexit. Ireland is well positioned to benefit substantially from this fund given our unique position and shared border with the UK.

The past four years have been dominated by uncertainty for Irish businesses and the Covid-19 pandemic has only added to this stress. The Government has committed to doing all it can to protect its citizens and businesses from the onslaught that Brexit will bring come January.
However, there is only so much the Government can do. Businesses must be proactive and take Government advice to prepare as best as they can. Businesses have not been left wanting in the Government’s Brexit preparation and this will only grow as we move closer to 1 January.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit for anyone, but we can all work to limit the negative impact. If you have any concerns, check out www.gov.ie/brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-hauliers-urged-not-to-load-trucks-unless-travelling-directly-to-the-continent-5307394-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Dec 2020
The Stena Foreteller will begin operating tomorrow.
STENA LINE IS adding a second ferry on its Rosslare to Cherbourg route ahead of schedule amid significant disruption to freight deliveries because of the UK travel ban.
The freight-only Stena Foreteller will commence crossings tomorrow, having originally been scheduled to begin sailing on 4 January.
The addition of the vessel will double the company’s freight capacity on the route and increase the number of weekly sailings from three to six. It will also offer an additional 3,000 lane metres of freight capacity per trip.
The ferry operator said it had witnessed a sharp increase in demand for freight deliveries and direct routes to mainland Europe as several countries imposed travel restrictions on the UK over fears of a new variant of Covid-19, which is prevalent in London and the south east of England.
“The developments of the last few days in terms of border closures have put enormous strains on the logistics industry,” Stena Line CEO Niclas Mårtensson said.
“Our Rosslare-Cherbourg service is the shortest direct crossing between Ireland and France, and I’m delighted to see that our operational team on the Irish Sea have been able to ‘fast-track’ the introduction of the Stena Foreteller, providing vital additional capacity in the run up to Christmas,” he added.
Earlier today the president of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) has said that no truck should leave Ireland unless they have a confirmed booking to travel directly to the continent.
IRHA president Eugene Drennan told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that there are currently between 200 and 250 Irish lorries stuck in England after France banned road freight from Britain due to the new coronavirus strain.
The Port of Dover in Kent, where the majority of Irish hauliers are currently waiting, is closed to all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further notice due to the border restrictions in France.

Drennan said he expected stranded hauliers to be allowed travel back to Ireland this evening and tomorrow and said “ferry companies have to do their utmost to get us home”.
Drennan appealed to Irish hauliers to not leave Ireland and said there are no ferries travelling directly to the continent today.
“No haulier, no trucker, no factory should load a truck this morning if that truck hasn’t got a confirmed [ferry] booking to go to the continent,” said Drennan.
He also called for direct lines of travel for goods between Ireland and the continent.
France last night blocked all lorry freight from the UK as concerns mount about a new strain of the pandemic coronavirus.
French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari announced that the country was suspending all traffic – air, rail and sea – from the UK from midnight for at least 48 hours.
It comes as nations across Europe, including Ireland, moved to halt inbound flights from the UK in a bid to prevent the spread of a virus mutation sweeping through London and the south east of England.
Independent TD and former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, Verona Murphy claimed that there isn’t enough capacity to get Irish trucks home from the continent.
Contradicting claims by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, the Wexford politician said drivers may spend Christmas in the cabs of their trucks.
“He has no idea it would appear,” she said on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne radio programme.
“There are 200 odd trucks that went to the UK to try to use the land bridge, there’s another 200-300 heading for Cherbourg, and some already there that are trying to get back into Ireland. As well as another 200 trying to leave Ireland to try to take product to the continent,” she said.
Related ReadsEamon Ryan says Ireland will work with UK 'on what comes next' after 48-hour suspension of transport
Murphy called for the Dáil to be reconvened to deal with the matter.
Meanwhile, Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish exporters Association, said his members had begun moving freight away from the UK landbridge with France to direct shipping routes with the continent.
McKeever said it “is a bit early” to say what the impact on his members will be today. “What we do know is that freight is open between Britain and Ireland but we have witnessed huge queues going into Holyhead,” he said.
McKeever said the impact of the current restrictions – which may last beyond 48 hours – could have a detrimental impact in two to three weeks time.
McKeever also said the current situation is a “real test of Brexit”.
“What would have happened in the event of Brexit is that the outbound freight out of the UK would have been the one that faced all the delays so this is an exact replica of what we would have seen…on roll-on, roll-off freight.”
The Irish Farmers Association (IFA) also said it is very about the impact of border closures on the food supply chain.
“This level of disruption could be very damaging for the movement of stock off farms and the efficient functioning of the supply chain,” IFA President Tim Cullinan said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-brexit-trade-talks-5290388-Dec2020/,"HERE WE GO again.
There’s less than a month to go before the UK leaves the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union, having officially left the bloc in January.
Things seemed to have flared up this weekend – so what is going on?
To recap, since trade talks began almost 10 months ago, the core stumbling blocks have remained the same: the level-playing field provisions, a dispute mechanism and fisheries.
Now with just weeks left before the transition period ends – which was an arrangement where the UK could have one foot in the European Union and one foot out to give it time to prepare to leave – those three issues are still yet to be completely resolved.
Over 95% of the EU-UK trade deal has been agreed and drafted into a legal text.
A flare-up on Friday saw UK chief negotiator David Frost and the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier jointly announce that they would ‘pause’ negotiations.
The final hurdle of Brexit talks was always going to end up being made by political leaders, as happened in the first round of Brexit talks.
A breakthrough was made over the Northern Ireland Protocol after then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Cheshire, after months of deadlock between the negotiating teams.
In this case, negotiators deferred to Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Both leaders spoke yesterday, released a statement that said gaps remain, but that negotiations in Brussels would resume today and the two would speak again tomorrow evening.

What’s happening here is that the political leaders are being asked to give negotiators a bit more wiggle room in order to strike a final deal.

The three main stumbling blocks that have ground talks to a halt have been:
In the past few weeks, murmurings from politicians have suggested that progress has been made on the level-playing field issue, possibly the most contentious of the three.
But reports from the confidential talks have suggested that demands from the French government over rights to the UK’s fishing waters may have created a new problem this week, just as a deal was about to be struck.
Any one of the leaders of the 27 EU member states can veto a final trade deal. Giving them access to the details of the deal before this vote takes place ensures that everyone is onside – which seems to be where this last-minute snag arose.
“We know that 100% access to fishing waters in the UK maritime zone is finished,” European Affairs minister Clement Beaune told le Journal du Dimanche.
“But we need lasting access. The British can’t have total access to our EU Single Market and exclude fish.”
Tory MP Andrew Bridgen suggested on RTÉ Radio One today that the UK government would grant this “lasting” access, though there has been some suggestion ofa time-limited trialof various fishing arrangements.
The 27 EU leaders are due to gather in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit planned to tackle their own budget dispute, but which will now once again be clouded by the post-Brexit trade talks.
If there is no trade deal between the EU and UK, trade between the two nations would have high tariffs set by the World Trade Organization. This could have a huge impact on Ireland’s highly lucrativedairyand beef sectors.
But if the UK reverted to a no-free-trade deal relationship with the EU from 1 January, trade negotiations between the two regions would continue in the new year, as some sort of trading relationship would need to be built up due to the UK’s geographical proximity and the close relations that already existed when it was an EU member state.
Today, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney suggested today that if Westminster passed either the contentious Internal Market Bill or the more recent Taxation bill, which contravene provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement, that he couldn’t see how the European Parliament could pass an EU-UK trade agreement.
Both the House of Commons and the European Parliament would need to vote to accept any EU-UK trade agreement before it can be ratified, and come into force.
But Coveney also said that if a trade deal was struck, that problems linked to those pieces of legislation “may find a way of disappearing”, suggesting that the EU is less concerned about those bills than it is about striking a deal, which is still the most likely outcome.
Current negotiations may rumble on from today right up until the European Council meeting on Thursday, which would give the UK time to pull its two contentious bills.

Last week, discussions between the two sides on a post-Brexit trade deal broke up early with “significant differences” remaining.

But Barnier and Frost will meet face-to-face in London today, before talks with the rest of their teams on tomorrow.
The UK’s chief negotiator Frost said last week that though the ability to meet in person had given “extra depth and flexibility” to the discussions, there was more to do.
Barnier said that while Brussels had engaged “constructively”, officials needed to see an “equivalent engagement from the UK side”.
“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” he said. “However, after four days of discussions, serious divergences remain.”

It had been hoped the face-to-face meetings – agreed following a high-level conference call last month between Boris Johnson and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen – would inject new momentum into the process.
Johnson has been adamant he will not allow the discussions to drag on into the autumn, arguing that British businesses and citizens need certainty on the way forward before then.
If the two sides are unable to reach a deal by the end of the current Brexit transition period at the end of the year, it will mean Britain leaving the single market and the customs union without any agreement on future access.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-michel-barnier-brexit-brussels-5211566-Sep2020/,"MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney is set to meet with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Coveney said the EU-UK Brexit negotiations have been challenging in recent weeks but that the EU has Ireland’s full support.
The remark comes amid recent controversy over the UK Government’s bid to use domestic legislation to override elements of the Brexit divorce deal, in particular the Northern Ireland protocol on post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Coveney explained that he and Barnier will discuss the current state of play on Brexit when they meet today, and that Barnier will update him on the most important issues relating to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
“The last few weeks have been challenging – Michel and his team have our full confidence and support as we find a way forward,” he said.
Under the protocol, Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods and administer the EU’s customs code at its ports.
However, the UK Internal Market Bill seeks to override elements of the protocol’s operation, including around the application of EU state aid rules in Northern Ireland and on the requirement for exit summary declarations for goods moving to Great Britain.
The laws, if enacted, are designed for use if a wider trade deal with the EU and UK does not materialise.
Coveney and European Affairs minister Thomas Byrne are due to exchange views with their counterparts on the current EU-UK negotiations at a meeting of ministers for European affairs.
Byrne said he was looking forward to engaging with his EU colleagues in the General Affairs Council (GAC).
“During my time in Brussels, I will also take the opportunity to meet individually with a number of my EU ministerial colleagues,” he said.
“We will discuss the many important issues on the GAC agenda, including Brexit, the next EU budget and the rule of law in our union.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eu-brexit-trade-bill-legislation-5201746-Sep2020/,"TALKS ON A post-Brexit trade deal with the EU are hanging in the balance after Brussels demanded the UK abandon plans to override key elements of the Withdrawal Agreement.
At a stormy meeting in London yesterday, the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove insisted that the UK government “could not and would not” drop measures in legislation tabled earlier this week.
It prompted European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to accuse the UK of an “extremely serious violation” of international law, putting the ongoing trade talks in jeopardy.
Despite the tensions, Britain’s negotiator David Frost said there had been “useful exchanges” and talks would resume next week in Brussels, although he warned that there were still “a number of challenging areas”.
‘Terrible mess’
Meanwhile Boris Johnson is facing growing unrest among Tory MPs deeply unhappy at the threat to undermine the international rule of law.
The former chancellor Lord Lamont said the government was in a “terrible mess” and warned the UK Internal Market Bill would not get through the House of Lords in its present form.
In the Commons, senior Conservatives are tabling an amendment to the bill which they said would limit the powers it gave to ministers in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement.

Johnson has set a deadline of 15 October for an agreement to be reached, otherwise he has said he will simply walk away from the negotiating table.
However Sefcovic said the UK side needed now to rebuild trust which had been “seriously damaged” by the events of the past days.
He said the provisions in the bill relating to the Withdrawal Agreement had to be dropped by the end of September and that the EU would “not be shy” about taking legal action if the government refused.
Under the terms of the bill, ministers would take powers to vary a protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement relating to the customs arrangements in Northern Ireland after the current Brexit transition period ends on 31 December.
The protocol, agreed after much difficult negotiation, was intended to prevent the need for the return of a hard border in Ireland while ensuring the integrity of the EU single market.
The UK government has said the measures in the Bill are simply a “legal safety net” to enable it to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process.
This drew a dismissive response from the EU which said that “it does the opposite”.
Senior Irish politicians, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, were both highly critical of the proposed legislation. Martin spoke to Johnson earlier this week to raise his concerns.

Among Tory MPs there was uncertainty whether the measures were intended as a negotiating tactic designed to put pressure on the EU as the trade talks enter their final stages.
Even some committed Brexiteers voiced concern that Johnson had gone too far.
Sir Bernard Jenkin, the leader of the strongly pro-Brexit European Research Group, said Johnson “should be more mindful of the reputational damage of playing such hardball”.
The senior Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, is tabling an amendment to the bill which he said would impose a “parliamentary lock” on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.
Among its supporters are Theresa May’s former deputy, Damian Green.
Neill told Times Radio: “We are not natural rebels. We’ve all served as ministers, we know that this is a serious job, and we do our best to take the job seriously. So we don’t do anything like this lightly.
“So I hope it’s at least an indication as a government that really, you need to think very hard and carefully about going down this route. For heaven’s sake, try and find some other way.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-talks-uk-checks-5140546-Jul2020/,"THE FOURTH ROUND of Brexit trade talks ended a day early this week, with both sides warning of remaining big differences while also committing to continue negotiations next week in London.
The meetings in Brussels were the first held face-to-face since the coronavirus shutdown, adding to hopes that substantial progress would be made.
“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” Barnier said in a statement.
But, of course, things don’t always go to plan when it comes to Brexit: “However, after four days of discussions, serious divergences remain.”
More hopefully, the former French minister added: “We continue to believe that an agreement is possible and in everyone’s interest.”
Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost closely mirrored Barnier’s statement, warning that “significant differences” remain with the European Union.

But Frost added: “We remain committed to working hard to find an early understanding on the principles underlying an agreement.”
This isn’t too dissimilar to the language used at the tail end of negotiations for the Withdrawal Agreement, which did eventually culminate in a ratified deal.
So, where were there agreements?
Yesterday, there were reports that Irish and UK officials agreed to allow Irish food products and live animals to travel through the UK via ‘green lanes’ as its landbridge to the European Union.
What this would mean, in practice, is that hauliers carrying food and animal products from Ireland destined for the EU can travel through UK ports without having to go through as many custom checks. Post-Brexit, there will be more checks in place for countries travelling from NI to GB, or vice versa.
In March,the Irish Cabinet was toldthat this arrangement would mean traders only have to make customs declarations and pay import duties when they arrive at their final destination.
This is actually something that had been agreed two years prior,as stated byMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: “We politically agreed two years ago to develop ‘green lanes’ for Irish goods moving between parts of our single market via the UK landbridge”.

Although it had been agreed that Irish goods being sent to the EU, and vice versa, would be allowed to bypass checks at UK ports, the exact details had yet to be worked out.

Technical work is still ongoing about how IT systems would work: for example, what happens when Irish goods arrive in Calais through the UK landbridge.
This issue has been discussed this week, and solutions to problems previously raised by other EU member states in relation to this issue were found and sent around.
Disagreements
Since the beginning of trade talks, the topics that have remained the biggest divider for the negotiating teams is the level playing field provisions, the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice, and what access to UK waters EU fishing vessels will get.
The UK is still requesting that the European Court of Justice hold no legal jurisdiction in the UK; that there would be no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law; and for an agreement on fisheries that reflects the Brexit vote to ‘take back our waters’.
5/6 UK sovereignty, over our laws, our courts, or our fishing waters, is of course not up for discussion.   Equally we do not seek anything which would undermine the integrity of the EU’s single market.— David Frost (@DavidGHFrost)June 25, 2020David Frost/ Twitter
5/6 UK sovereignty, over our laws, our courts, or our fishing waters, is of course not up for discussion.   Equally we do not seek anything which would undermine the integrity of the EU’s single market.
As stated byBarnier in his statementthis week, the aims that the EU negotiating team has are: robust guarantees for a level playing field – including the crucial issue of State aid – to ensure open and fair competition among businesses; a fair deal on fisheries; and an effective ‘dispute settlement’ mechanism (meaning the European Court of Justice or another body to settle disputes).
There are serious gaps to be bridged there – particularly on the level-playing field provision, and fisheries (read more about the plight of Irish fishermen here).
‘Light touch’ technology
There was a lot of doubt about the notion that technology could help avoid a hard border – there was some light shed this week into how exactly it could work:
HM Revenue & CustomsHM Revenue & Customs
In HM Revenue & Customs documents first reported on byBloomberg, and shared publicly by Guardian journalist Lisa O’Carrollhere, plans are laid out about how to abide by the Northern Ireland protocol, and ensure customs rules are obeyed.
It states that on trade going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, “this should take place as it does now”.
On trade going from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland, it states that there will be no tariffs if the goods remain in Northern Ireland (a separate problem is how traders prove where they end up), but goods that go beyond that will face duties.
Related ReadsSo long and thanks for all the fish: Irish fishermen say UK Brexit position could spell 'unmitigated disaster'
There will be import and entry summary declarations (relating to safety and security) on goods coming from the UK and destined for Northern Ireland – but the document states that there will be “no new physical customs infrastructure”.
The system unveiled in this document requires ports and terminals to adopt either a pre-lodgement process or a storage model to carry out custom checks.
For the pre-lodgement model, a technology system called the Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS) is being launched by HMRC, in order to allow customs declarations to be made ahead of time.
This will mean that a haulier, the person delivering the goods, will be given a Goods Movement Reference number (GMR) which they can provide to prove that goods have been declared ahead of time.
The document says that the movement of goods should be “linked” to declarations, “enabling the automatic arrival in HMRC systems as soon as goods board so that declarations can be processed en route”. This would mean that they are given clearance by the time the hauliers depart at a port.
But a Northern Ireland committee on Infrastructurewas told this week that any delays here could be quite costly, as Roger Armson of Larne Port said: “An intervention of 5-10 seconds per vehicle, and all of a sudden traffic is backed up onto the ship.”
When Armson asked at a stakeholders’ meeting how long will it take for a truck giving data to receive a response from Revenue, he said he didn’t really get an answer, but added, “We’re hoping it will be instantaneous”.
So there seems to be some clarity at the end of the tunnel – but it remains to be seen if it works in practice.
Background
The UK left the EU on 30 January this year, immediately entering a post-Brexit transition period during which it still benefits from de facto EU membership – it still remains in the Customs Union and Single Market.
This transition period comes to an end on 31 December, by which time it is hoped an EU-UK Free Trade Agreement, ratified by the EU and UK parliaments, will come into effect.
Without a new agreement, the two sides would see ties reduced to minimum standards set by the World Trade Organization with high tariffs, quotas and serious disruptions to business.
London is pushing hard to agree on the broad outlines of the trade deal this summer to give businesses clarity well before the end of the year.
The EU is less pressed for time and believes that necessary ratification by the European Parliament and other member states would require a deal to be done by late October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/freight-group-warns-of-trade-disruption-as-supply-chains-slow-up-due-to-new-rules-5326021-Jan2021/,"FREIGHT TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION Ireland has warned supply chains “are slowing up” and criticised as “unsustainable” the current level of inspection of goods coming into Ireland.
In a week that has seen disruption to supply chains and stocks across the island of Ireland, the FTAI has raised concerns about the impact of post-Brexit importation and the timelines given to the industry to adjust to new rules.
FTAI General Manager Aidan Flynn said it is “unbelievable” that 30% of goods imported into Dublin Port are being inspected, which he described as “unsustainable”.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne, Flynn said the industry is not able to handle the new documentary and regulatory requirements.
He said industries “haven’t had a chance to test” these new regulatory customs requirements and that “supply chains are slowing up” as a result.
While some issues may be ironed out, there is significant pressure on the haulage industry which operates on “very, very tight margins, who really don’t have any time to waste, as we try and understand what the new requirements are,” Flynn said.
Last week, Revenue gave a stern warning that many businesses “were not as prepared as they thought or significantly underestimated what was involved in being Brexit ready”.
At a Brexit briefing in December, Eddie Burke from the Department of Transport was asked how long it could take for traders to get used to new post-Brexit checks and systems. He said it unclear how long it would take.
Given the new processes and checks that have to be done on goods, particularly on goods entering Ireland from the UK, delays are inevitable.
“Customs and other regulatory checks take time — and some take longer amounts of time than others,” Revenue Commissioner Gerry Harrahill explained last week.

These aren’t new processes — Irish authorities have been carrying them out on goods coming from ‘third countries’ for years.
However, these have never been applied to UK goods until now, meaning the overall volume of imports that have to be checked increased basically overnight on 1 January.
Agricultural and food products travelling from the UK into Ireland will have to be checked to ensure they meet European safety standards.
Plant and animal products coming from Britain will have to travel with a health certificate signed by a UK vet and official identity seal.
Farm equipment will have to be checked to make sure it’s not contaminated with soil.
Consignments can be rejected or unloaded and the individual boxes checked if they don’t meet the new requirements.
While there have been “isolated instances” of empty supermarket shelves this week, FTAI’s Flynn said many retailers had stockpiled before Christmas and said there is “no cause for concern at the moment.”
“But there’s no doubt that supply chain is reliant on efficiency. We do rely on Britain and have done a lot for the landbridge to connect continental Europe,” said Flynn.
“We do have new direct services to continental Europe, but we just don’t have enough to be able to handle the volumes we are seeing, over-bookings on ferries, which obviously highlights the fact that the increased demand needs to be dealt with.”
“And we didn’t see an awful lot of support for new ferry operations into continental Europe…and we need more support from various different departments in Government to help support industry transition so that there isn’t a long term issues with supply chains.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-thatcher-cameron-ukip-5206937-Sep2020/,"AS THE INTERNAL Market Bill causes more rancour in Brexit talks, it is no surprise to see that focus of attention for many in the UK has rendered down to the internal dynamics of the British Conservative Party.
The party that championed accession to the EEC in 1973 when the Labour Party opposed such a move has struggled with the European project ever since the days of Margaret Thatcher.
The matter has bedevilled every Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher from all sides of the debate while an inability to steady the horses on this led to the calling of the Brexit Referendum in the first place.
The lady turned
Thatcher was initially a keen enthusiast for the EEC, her campaigning in the 1975 Referendum on remaining in the Single Market was crucial to ensuring victory. Her infamous showdown with Jacques Delors at Brussels set up a schism in the Tory Party’s approach to Europe that continues to this very day.
It was Black Wednesday and the departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism that completely undermined John Major’s strength as leader leading to bruising battles to pass the Maastricht Treaty with growing levels of rancour on his backbenches.
This culminated in Major putting his leadership on the line against John Redwood whose brand of Eurosceptism continues to pour forth from the very back of the green benches in Westminster.
Parallel to this saw the birth of several Eurosceptic parties such as the Anti Federalist League, James Goldsmith’s Referendum Party and the infamous UK Independence Party or UKIP.
Advertisement
The road to Brexit
The demise of Major and the Labour landslide victory in 1997 saw the Conservative Party go through three leaders before settling with David Cameron in 2005. The Conservative leaders in the interim period all battled internally and arguably pointlessly with the question of Europe.
William Hague was regarded as being slightly more Eurosceptic than Major who was and remains a pro-European while both Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard were full throated Eurosceptics.
Former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ken Clarke, failed to be elected leader on numerous occasions for his reluctance to downplay his enthusiasm for the European project.
Through this period UKIP began to make electoral inroads winning seats in the European Parliament that gave Nigel Farage a growing profile and resources to set himself up as the Eurosceptic voice who was a viable alternative for many Conservative voters.
UKIP consistently performed well in European elections, often beating the Tories, although failing to win seats in the House of Commons.
Cameron’s false move
When he was elected leader, David Cameron attempted to lance the European boil by taking the Conservatives out of the EPP-ED Group in the European Parliament, this robbed the Conservatives of huge influence as members of the biggest bloc but was a psychological shift.
Unfortunately, this did little to halt the progress and calm the Eurosceptic tendencies of elements of the Conservative Party especially when Cameron led the Conservatives into Government with the strongly pro-European Liberal Democrats in 2010.
Following another European election defeat to UKIP, Cameron promised ahead of the 2015 General Election that he would hold a straight in or out Referendum on EU membership.
Cameron won that election and we know what happened in a Referendum campaign that split the Conservative Party and indeed the entire UK.
Roll onto the leadership of Theresa May and the negotiations of the UK’s departure from the UK and the various factions of the Conservative Party clashed again over the nature of what Brexit should look like: soft, hard or compromised.
A very British Boris and his Brexit
The farcical scenes of indicative votes, leadership heaves and resignations on all sides led to May’s departure and the election of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.
Related ReadsCovid-19 pandemic means hard Brexit 'could impact Irish economy even worse than feared'Brexit: Senior US politicians write to Boris Johnson over his efforts to 'flout the Northern Ireland protocol'Opinion: Boris and his friends are living in a post-truth 'Alice and Brexitland'
The champion of the Eurosceptic wing and someone who had voted Leave, Johnson negotiated a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU identical to one that May had failed to get through her party a year previous.
Johnson purged many of the pro Europeans out of the party including the likes of Clarke and Nicholas Soames, the Grandson of Winston Churchill before campaigning on a promise to “get Brexit done”.
Roll on less than a year from that General Election campaign and the subsequent ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement supported by every Conservative MP currently in the House of Commons and Johnson’s Government is threatening to renege on this Agreement and breach International law.
The reaction has been stark. Some Eurosceptics, like the aforementioned Redwood and Duncan Smith, say the moves do not go far enough while arch Brexiteers like Howard and Norman Lamont say the moves contained within the Internal Market Bill go too far and jeopardise the UK’s global standing when it comes to the rule of law.
Compromise amendments have been submitted and reports abound of heavy whipping. Johnson has the majority to get this through the House of Commons with limited opposition but he will struggle to get it through the House of Lords. All the while the EU and many international partners watch on aghast.
This comes to the crux of the problem. For decades the Conservative party have been totally divided on the EU and their focus has been solely on the internals of both the party and matters in Westminster. However, the reality is that Brexit is a matter between both the EU and the UK.
The British Government needs to realise that compromise amendments and sanctions internally mean little, they should really be focussing on talks with the EU.
Michel Barnier and his team wait patiently for the Conservative Party to get over their latest European breakdown.
Neale Richmond is a Fine Gael TD for Dublin Rathdown and is former Seanad spokesperson on EU affairs for the party.

https://www.thejournal.ie/belfast-south-emma-little-pengelly-claire-hanna-sdlp-north-4928806-Dec2019/,"VOTERS IN THE North will go to the polls tomorrow in an election all parties are promising could help determine the direction of Brexit.
For once, the election is proving difficult to predict. In North Down, it’s a too-close-to-call race to decide who the successor to Independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon might be, while in North Belfast Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane is in contention to unseat DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.
But it’s in Belfast South, a constituency that covers everything from the student flats of the city centre to the leafy suburbs of the Malone Road, where the battle between the forces of Remain and Leave will be most closely watched.
The SDLP’s Claire Hanna is aiming to unseat the DUP’s Emma Little Pengelly, who pulled off something of a surprise victory at the 2017 election to defeat former SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell.
Two years later, some are predicting Little Pengelly may lose it amid a growing dissatisfaction with the DUP over Brexit.
In Westminster, she has joined her DUP colleagues invoting repeatedlyagainst first Theresa May’s and now Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.
Today, out doing a final canvas with her dad, a loyalist activist, the DUP candidate is bullish about her prospects tomorrow.
“This was always going to be a tight race. The SDLP won it by a couple of thousand votes in 2015, we won it for the DUP by 2,000 votes in 2017,” she says. “Then you add onto that that Sinn Féin have pulled out, of course it makes it more challenging,” she tellsTheJournal.ie.
Sinn Féin’s decision not to contest the race in a bid not to split the Remain vote was a key moment in the campaign and immediately left Little Pengelly facing a serious struggle.
But “a lot of people are very animated, particularly about the union”, she says.
Some voters, she adds, will always “wobble” – but that’s the nature of politics.
Still, the largest party in the North could be in for something of a seismic shock. Commentatorshave warnedthat both Leave and Remain unionist voters, armed with plenty of grievances over the DUP’s botched approach to Brexit and doomed pact with Boris Johnson, could punish the party at the polls tomorrow.
“People aren’t happy about the way Brexit has been handled, no matter what side,” Little Pengelly admits.
This morning, campaigning in the Belvoir area of the city, her focus was on encouraging turnout.

One particular working class district, Drumart Square, is an example of the kinds of places Little Pengelly is relying on  – she says that support levels for the DUP are at 60% to 70%.
Two flats loom over the square - locals say that residents were meant to be re-housed after the Grenfell disaster in London, but nothing has happened so far. With a tattered flag on a lamp-post calling for no prosecutions for the British soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday, it seems as safe a DUP spot as you might find in Belfast.
But one woman, who didn’t give her name, toldTheJournal.iethat many in the area would only be backing the DUP reluctantly in this election. Many, she said, thought that the delays to Brexit had become a “betrayal”.
People will be voting for the party out of fear of a united Ireland, she said.
It’s a concern that the DUP has been trying to tap into. On Little Pengelly’s leaflets, she tells people that only the DUP can “protect Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom”.
Critics of the DUP would say it’s Arlene Foster who has helped place it in jeopardy. But Little Pengelly says that people will understand that the blame should lie squarely with Johnson.
Besides, she argues that the election is about much more than Brexit.
And she’s not wrong. The election has coincided with a genuine crisis in the North’s healthcare system – workers are currently fighting for pay parity with the rest of the UK and increased staffing levels.
A major healthcare strike is expected next week and the crisis has dominated media coverage here in recent weeks. Staff across a vast array of NHS services are expected to take to picket lines across the North next Wednesday.
“On the doors, it hasn’t just been a Brexit election. Brexit of course comes up, it comes up in certain areas more than others. But ultimately, what comes up the most is health and no Northern Ireland Assembly,” says Little Pengelly.
She says she has been trying to assure people that the DUP wants the Assembly, which collapsed nearly three years ago, to return.
“We didn’t collapse the Assembly, we have been willing to go back immediately. We are not for asking for anything to go back,” she says.
SDLP
A short journey away in a middle-class suburb of Carryduff, which is home to voters with a wider array of party allegiances, Claire Hanna is hearing the same concerns. On one doorstep, a woman bemoans the state of the healthcare system in the North and the length of the waiting lists.
She also asks why the Executive still hasn’t returned.

It would have been better if it never collapsed, sighs Hanna. But she says there are signs that the North’s parties might be willing to get around a table again.
Hanna, an MLA for the area, says she has been hearing similar concerns for weeks. The SDLP candidate and her team of 120 campaigners have been stressing that she is a local, a Remainer and an expert on Brexit.
However, it wasonly in Februarythat her future seemed uncertain after she opposed the SDLP’s partnership with Fianna Fáil.
“I remember saying about three weeks ago, ‘God, I wish the election was today, I would definitely have won’, because there was a real motivation and enthusiasm. And then it has just inevitably dragged on a little bit and it’s Christmassy and people have shit to do,” she says.
Still, she is quietly confident ahead of tomorrow’s vote.
“We have done everything we can. I’m not into sporting analogies, but we have done everything we can, we have left nothing behind,” she says.
Hanna is seen as something of the favourite. Sinn Féin polled over 7,000 votes in 2017 and if the party’s supporters back her, she has a strong chance of winning.
However, Hanna disagrees that the Sinn Féin backing was a pivotal moment. Instead, she sees the Green Party’s blessing as the one that could help swing the election.
“That really substantially contributed to it being a post-sectarian campaign and took it outside of what could have been perceived as a nationalist thing, because I think the Greens are well respected for being beyond that,” she says.
We’re knocking on every door this time, because we need people coming from Alliance, Green, Sinn Féin, Ulster Unionist and non-voters. And we’re finding it.
It’s not the only backing she’s got. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have all fallen over themselves to help Hanna’s campaign, with even a bus load of Young Fine Gaelers joining her on the campaign trail.
Today, her campaign team is somewhat older – no one on the team today was under 50. But Hanna says that hasn’t been the trend throughout the campaign, which has attracted a lot of twenty- and thirty- somethings who are beginning to be discontented with the state of the public services in the North.
Her last piece of campaign literature – which prompted coos and chuckles from canvassers today – asks voters if they want a “scared future” – underscored by photos of Little Pengelly, Johnson and Ian Paisely Jnr – or a “shared future”.
Dramatic campaign literature aside, the party has been making pains to stress it’s taking a positive approach to the campaign. However, that doesn’t stop it hoping that disaffection will deliver votes tomorrow.
“I think the support is there. It’s just the extent we can turn it out,” she says.

SPEAKER JOHN BERCOW is leaving his House of Commons role today. Controversial, colourful and the scourge of ‘chuntering’ MPs, Bercow has been one of the breakout stars of Brexit.
His cry of “Order” has become something of a catchphrase and turned him into a star of social media, while there have been countless semi-viral moments in recent years: like (of all things)this mashupof Bercow saying the name of Conservative MP “Mr Peter Bone” set to the tune of Beethoven’s fifth symphony.
And while today Bercow will no doubt receive plaudits and praise for his work over the last 10 years, the man himself is controversial and far from universally liked.
There have been multiple allegations that Bercow, a former Conservative MP, physically intimidated and bullied House of Commons staff.
He’s also been accused by critics of bending parliamentary procedure to his will, invoking the fury of Tory MPs in particular.
Today, he will chair his final day in the House of Commons – making him one of the longest-serving speakers of the modern era.
Here’s a look back at some of the most important moments of his decade-long tenure.
Empowering backbenchers
Bercow, an MP for Buckingham, was elected in 2009. He promised to be“completely impartial”and said he wanted to be the “backbenchers’ Speaker”.
By the latter measure, he seems to have succeeded. The number of urgent questions – which allows opposition MPs to ask pressing questions of government ministers – has shot up during his time as Speaker, while Bercow created a reputation as a chairman willing to chide and interrupt even the most senior members of the House of Commons.

Brexit
Regarded as a colourful figure ever since he took office, Bercow has become known beyond the world of Westminster since Brexit began to unfold.
In the polarised atmosphere of the House of Commons, Bercow found himself accused of being a Remainer sympathiser and being biased in favour of Labour, even having to defend a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker on his wife Sally’s car.
His decision in January to allow an amendment forcing Theresa May to present a new Brexit plan to MPs within three days if her deal was voted down – which promoted anger in the government – empowered those same critics.
But the real drama came as Bercow was accused of upsetting hundreds of years of parliamentary precedent in March by ruling out a third meaningful vote on her Brexit deal unless there was a substantial change to the agreement – prompting accusations that he had plunged the UK into a “constitutional crisis”.

It was a decision that changed the course of Brexit and one that still seems to smart among Tory MPs today. But it did little to discourage the Speaker.
Only this month, Bercowdenied Boris Johnsona second vote on his Brexit deal after the prime minister was defeated on‘Super Saturday’, telling MPs that another vote would be “repetitive and disorderly”.
Prorogation
While he was unable to stop the government proroguing parliament, Bercow made clear his displeasure at the decision to suspend the session – which many saw as an attempt to prevent elected representatives scutinising Johnson’s Brexit plans.
“This is not a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It is one of the longest for decades,” he said.
“It represents an act of executive fiat,” he added.
After the Supreme Court ruled that the prorogationwas unlawful, Bercow was among the first to respond.
“As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency,” he said.

Controversial
There have been multiple bullying accusations against Bercow, all of which he has denied. With bullying and harassment in parliament seen as a major issue, Bercow came under scrutiny.
One report, by Dame Laura Cox, found that many senior parliamentary staff, included Bercow, shouldconsider standing downin response to the culture of abuse.
However, in May 2018 the Commons standards committee blocked an investigation into allegations against Bercow.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
He was also criticised for his expenses claims, which included a claim for a chauffeur-driven car journey from the House of Commons to Carlton House Terrace – a journey of 1.12 kilometres.
Who replaces him?
In September, Bercow announced that he would be leaving the role. “At the 2017 election I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep,” he said.
His decision to set his departure date as 31 October – Brexit day – raised eyebrows but with the UK’s departure date now extended most of the spotlight should remain on Bercow today.
Back in 2011, he promised to“disappear”after leaving the role. Whether that does happen remains to be seen, but his replacement should be elected soon.
Current favourites include Labour’s Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Bercow’s deputy, as well as former deputy prime minister, Labour’s Harriet Harman.
There issome speculationthat the election could take place Monday, ahead of parliament being dissolved – but that remains to be confirmed. If that does go ahead, it leaves the new Speaker little time to settle in before MPs leave to campaign ahead of polling day on 12 December.
If you don’t want to miss your final chance to see Bercow as Speaker, you can tune into thelive streamof the House of Commons – he should be in the chair for most of the day.

https://www.thejournal.ie/psni-chief-calls-for-backup-brexit-protests-4941347-Dec2019/,"POLICE SERVICE OF Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne has appealed for more officers to help the “stretched” force amid fears of Brexit-related protests at ports in the region.
Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan, extra customs regulations could be imposed on goods travelling between Great Britain and the North to safeguard the Irish land border with the EU.
Unionists are adamantly opposed to what they term a border in the Irish Sea.

Byrne said: “It is about turning the lens from the border to the ports, so we will be asking for people.”
He added: “There is a continuing threat from dissident republicans but also potentially for ports… if the arrangements are seen to be adverse to Northern Ireland.”
Mutual aid provisions allow other forces around the UK to augment PSNI numbers if necessary and Byrne said the force is looking at the supply of body armour.
He said: “We need more officers on the front line.”
The North has major ports in Larne in Co Antrim and Belfast, serving traffic from Scotland and north-west England.

The DUP is opposed to Johnson’s Brexit plan, accusing him of facilitating an economic united Ireland.
Policymakers are juggling the need to prevent a hard border between the North and the Republic with unionist concerns about preserving the integrity of the UK.
Extra officers have already been allocated to controlling the Irish border and Byrne said planning is well advanced. He is bidding for extra officers to augment the 300 already granted.
“We are giving it a daily dust-down to make sure we are ready for whatever comes our way,” he said.
Addressing a meeting of the Policing Board in Belfast, which scrutinises his force, he said: “Given where we are, I am as confident as I can be.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-brexit-trade-talks-resume-as-significant-differences-remain-5307363-Dec2020/,"TALKS ON A post-Brexit trade deal look set to continue into next week after another weekend of tense negotiations failed to achieve a breakthrough.
After lead negotiators Michel Barnier and Lord Frost met in Brussels on Sunday, a UK Government source said the discussions had been “difficult”.
The source said “significant differences” remained over the key issues of fisheries and the so-called “level playing field rules” on state aid for business.
“Teams have been negotiating throughout the day and expect to continue tomorrow. Talks remain difficult and significant differences remain,” the source said.
“We continue to explore every route to a deal that is in line with the fundamental principles we brought into the negotiations.”
The European Parliament had said the talks needed to be concluded by yesterday evening if it was to ratify any deal before the current Brexit transition ends on December 31.
However, if there were to be a deal, under EU rules it could be provisionally signed off by leaders of the 27-member bloc with ratification delayed until 2021.

Earlier Barnier warned that Britain must be prepared to respect the EU’s sovereignty if the talks were to succeed.
He said the EU remained committed to achieving “a fair, reciprocal and balanced agreement” but said both sides needed to be able to act when their interests were at stake.
His comments came after a UK Government source warned that the negotiations would fail unless there was a “substantial shift” in the EU’s position in the remaining days of the talks.
The British side has accused the EU of making “unreasonable demands” and of failing to respect UK sovereignty over fishing rights and fair competition rules.
In a statement posted on Twitter, Barnier said the talks with the UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost were at a “crucial moment”.
“The EU remains committed to a fair, reciprocal and balanced agreement. We respect the sovereignty of the UK. And we expect the same,” he said.
“Both the EU and the UK must have the right to set their own laws and control their own waters. And we should both be able to act when our interests are at stake.”
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he believed a deal was still possible but said it would require movement on the EU side.
“We want these talks to reach a positive conclusion. I think everybody wants a deal. Unfortunately, the EU have put in some unreasonable demands,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme.

It’s now imperative that PM seeks an agreement to extend the Brexit transition period. The new Covid strain - & the various implications of it - means we face a profoundly serious situation, & it demands our 100% attention. It would be unconscionable to compound it with Brexit.
If there is no deal by December 31, the UK will leave the single market and customs union and begin trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms – with the imposition of tariffs potentially leading to higher prices in shops.
But Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should try to get an extension to the Brexit transition period because of the discovery of a faster-spreading coronavirus strain that has caused European countries to halt flights and ferry crossings from the UK.
She tweeted: “It’s now imperative that PM seeks an agreement to extend the Brexit transition period.

Irish Farmers’ Association president Tim Cullinan said Ireland is a small nation on the periphery of Europe that will be most affected by Brexit.
He urged that a deal is agreed between the UK and EU to allow trade across the UK and Ireland to continue following the end of the transition period.
“But it’s not just farmers that are going to suffer, every citizen in this country is going to suffer because of this because once there are restrictions on product coming into this country, it’s only going to do one thing and if any product is scarce we all know what will happen – it’s going to cost more,” he told the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee.

“The government is going to have to put their hand in their pocket and co-fund money we are getting from Europe because we’re talking billions, £1.5 billion for agriculture alone per year, that is what this is going to cost.”
News emerged today that the UK and EU reached agreement on how to implement aspects of Brexit involving borders and trade.
The agreement covers issues like border checks on animal and plant products, and deliveries of chilled meats and other food products to supermarkets.
Cullinan emphasised the importance of a deal being secured.
He concluded his submission to the committee, saying: “Obviously we want to see a deal, we are very concerned where we are at and if we don’t get a deal, funding is going to be absolutely critical for this sector going forward.”

Brexit talks have been underway in London this week, with one UK Cabinet minister saying this morning that the trade talks were in a“difficult phase”.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that there were a “number of tricky issues” that remained to be worked out.
A senior source in the UK government said earlier that a “breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding”.
Fishing rights have been a“major bone of contention”in post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU, with the UK seeking to assert control of its waters.
The issue of the “level playing field” relates to aims to prevent unfair competition on state subsidies and standards.
The Brexit transition period is due to end on 31 December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-truck-delays-cabinet-5329596-Jan2021/,"ONLY TWO THIRDS of goods from the UK have all paper work completed before arriving at Irish ports, the Cabinet was told today.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told his ministerial colleagues that trade volumes from the UK to Irish ports have increased this week, but it remains well below the level at this point last year.
The volume of trucks arriving in Ireland is around 50% lower than in previous years, State officials said on Monday, which is partly due to post-Brexit checks creating an obstacle for deliveries from Great Britain.
Officials said it is also partly due to Covid-19 travel disruption: not as many ferries are operating, and shops are closed in Ireland during Level 5 restrictions, and require less goods.

Cabinet was told today that some stock is not leaving the warehouses due to the paperwork not being up to scratch with what is required post-Brexit, with Coveney stating that documentation not being in order is an ongoing issue.
The government is urging all businesses and traders to engage with the authorities about the new rules.
Cabinet was also told that a number of shipments trying to leave Dover Port have been refused due to the freight not having the right papers.
While ministers were updated on the document headaches, Cabinet was also informed that truck drivers travelling to France will soon have to get a negative Covid-19 antigen test result before travelling with their stock.
The antigen test, which detects viral protein fragments in a nasal swab, are thought to be less effective than the more common PCR test, but they have a quick turnaround.
Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan brought a plan to government today that will see hauliers given antigen tests due to new French rules which requires drivers to have one before arriving in the country.

Previously, haulier drivers were exempted from needing a test under EU travel rules.
It is estimated the antigen tests for truck drivers, which the State will pay for, is likely to cost between €2 million and €5 million over a 12-week period.
Government has agreed to fund the tests, with a private operator due to carry them out. Truck drivers travelling back from France to Ireland will not need an antigen test as of yet.
The test sites for truck drivers travelling to France will be identified at Irish ports.

PARCEL DELIVERY COMPANY DPD UK has said that it will be pausing all its road delivery services from the UK to Europe, including Ireland, as it deals with the customs changes caused by Brexit.
These services will be paused until at least Wednesday 13 January, the company said this morning.
In a statement, DPD said that it’s been a challenging few days for its teams as the UK leaving the Single Market and Customs Union has required “significant changes” to the way it takes parcels cross-border.
It said: “It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe. This has placed extra pressure on our turnaround and transit times.
“We are seeing up to 20% of parcels having incorrect or incomplete data attached, these will have to be returned to you so that the required data can be provided.
“In addition to this we are seeing delays and congestion at UK ports and more rigid requirements for channel crossings.”
DPD UK said the pausing of services until 13 January will give it a chance to “validate the data we have in our system, reduce the delay and give you the opportunity to give us the correct data we need in order that we can export, from next week, successfully”.
It said an update will be provided on Tuesday 12 January.
It added that in future parcels sent to DPD UK with incorrect or incomplete data will result in the parcel being returned to the sender.
“We are very keen to avoid this and ask that you give this matter immediate attention,” the company added.
A statement from An Post said is it “trading fully and smoothly with almost all of the UK online retailers for whom it delivers across Ireland”.
“An Post has put in place a digital solution for all its UK retailers which simplifies the process and enables seamless despatch and immediate delivery,” the statement said.
It said some delays are to be expected but the “majority of items” dispatched through the digital system are released for delivery straight away when they arrive into Ireland.

Stena Lina
Meanwhile, twelve Stena Line ferries scheduled for between today and Tuesday 12 January have been cancelled, the Irish ferry operator said this morning.
The sailings, going from either Rosslare to Fishguard or Holyhead to Dublin, have been impacted by a combination of the Covid travel restrictions imposed recently, and new Brexit requirements.
This has lead to a decrease in both passenger and freight numbers, Trade Director for the Irish Sea Paul Grant said: “Stena Line is currently reviewing its sailings and schedules on Irish Sea routes as a result of Irish travel restrictions and the decline in freight volumes during the first week of Brexit. Problems in the supply chain have resulted in a significant fall off in freight volumes this week at our Holyhead and Fishguard ports.
“Our business model is based on a freight and passenger combination, so to have the twoparts severely restricted at the same time is putting severe pressure on our ability tomaintain our normal levels of frequency on certain routes. Volumes are expected toremain light as we move towards the weekend, consequently we will reduce somesailings on a temporary basis.
“Capacity can be reinstated quickly as demand picks up again but in the meantime weneed to be prudent and efficient in how we manage our sailing schedules.”
After 47 years as an EU member state, the UK left the bloc at 11pm on New Year’s Eve, becoming a third country for trade purposes and customs declarations.
New documentation and red tape is now required between EU member states and Britain, which is anticipated to cause massive delays at ports in the coming weeks.
Revenue this week urged all freight operators and drivers looking to travel to the UK or from the UK to ensure they had their PBNs ready ahead of check-in for the sailing.
A Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN) is needed before a lorry can get onto a ferry to cross the Irish Sea, as the UK is now considered a third country for trade purposes.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, Revenue said that it’s aware that trucks have been denied boarding in Holyhead, but added that “a significant number of businesses” are submitting customs declarations and pre-boarding notifications “without any issues”.
It said that it was clear that many businesses “were not as prepared as they thought or significantly underestimated what was involved in being Brexit ready”.
Because of this, Revenue said it has implemented “a temporary easement measures” relating to the lodging of safety and security declarations that will help business to meet their obligations and get their goods moving.
“We expected challenges such as this to arise where trade and or business didn’t make the necessary advance planning arrangements that we have strongly advocated over at least the last two years.
“We made it very clear in our engagements with industry that real, permanent and immediate changes would arise. Those who are having difficulties is the outworking of that warning.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/improved-economic-forecasts-5331618-Jan2021/,"THE IRISH ECONOMY expanded in 2020 in spite of the pandemic, according to the Central Bank of Ireland.
Spurred on by a 4% increase in exports, driven mainly by the booming pharmaceuticals, tech and business services sectors, Irish gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.5% last year.
However, “strict containment measures” currently in place across the country “are likely to dampen activity significantly in the first quarter” of 2021, the Central Bank has said in its latest Quarterly Economic Bulletin.
Against the backdrop of the recent virus surge and tightening of public health restrictions, growth will “remain subdued” in the near-term.
But assuming a successful ramping up of the vaccination programme by the second half of the year, “the economy should begin to recover,” according to the Central Bank forecasts, which have been upgraded since last October.
GDP is then forecast to grow by a better-than-expected 3.8% in 2021 — a 0.3% improvement from the last Bulletin in October 2020 — and 4.6% in 2022.
“Reflecting the recent resurgence in cases, both domestically and globally, the near-term outlook has deteriorated and become more uncertain,” the report said.
“However, the development and prospect of widespread deployment of vaccines offers hope for a path out of the crisis and, further out, an improved outlook for economies and societies.”
Unemployment
But GDP doesn’t tell the full story.

Modified domestic demand — a measure of indigenous activity that strips out the influence of the multinational-dominated export sector — is forecast to improve by just 2.9% this year after a 7.1% collapse in 2020.
Ireland suffered the worst initial collapse in domestic demand in Europe at the outset of the crisis last year. The situation improved as restrictions were loosened over the summer and again in the run-up to Christmas, the Central Bank said — but domestic activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels to start the year.
Consumer spending is projected to have fallen by 8.3% last year and is only forecast to improve by 2.1% in 2021 before a further 6.9% recovery in 2022.
Meanwhile, the post-Brexit trade agreement reached before Christmas between the European Union and Britain may have averted “significant disruption to economic activity”, according to the latest Bulletin.
But “in the long run, the negative impact of the UK’s EU exit on trade flows, migration and productivity will reduce output in the Irish economy”.
Graph illustrating flucutations in the labour market in 2020
Unemployment is also likely to remain a sticky issue well into next year with the labour market “likely to lag somewhat until the broader economic recovery becomes more well established”, according to the Bulletin.
The standard rate of unemployment averaged 6.2% last year but will increase to 9.3%, as Government income supports are gradually wound down and firms come off State-financed life support.
This assumes that the vaccine drive will allow the economy to be substantively reopened in the second half of the year.
In a more severe scenario, one that assumes a “substantially longer timeline for the deployment of vaccines”, unemployment could average out at 13% in 2021, the Central Bank warned.
“What I would say about this [severe] scenario compared to previous Bulletins is, I do think it’s clear that the probability of it happening is now much less than it had been,” Mark Cassidy, Director of Economics and Statistics at the Central Bank, said.
“In none of our previous Bulletins did we have the positive news about the development and the commencement of the rollout of vaccines. So certainly, we will be more, much more confident in our baseline scenario than we would have been in previous Bulletins.”
Housing market
Across the EU, Ireland had the strongest increase in savings in the second quarter of last year.
The savings ratio — the percentage of gross disposable income saved by households — rose to 35.4% in the spring of 2020; a historically high level.
Graph showing the development of household savings in 2020
“The savings rate then returned to 21.4% in the third quarter, but remains elevated,” the Central Bank highlighted.
“Between March and November 2020, Irish households have increased their deposits by €11.6bn.”
But the unwinding of these savings will be key to the recovery this year and beyond, Cassidy said.
“What happens with these will be a very important factor in determining the future path of the economy,” he explained.
“On the one hand, they could be retained or they could be used to pay down debt. They could also be spent but then it will matter what type of goods and services they are spent on.
This could inflate house prices given the current “significant shortage of housing”, Cassidy said.
On the other hand, the increase in unemployment could result in a decline in demand for property.
“Also the uncertainty [for workers] in relation to current and future incomes does make it more difficult for many to get access mortgages,” he explained.
“So I wouldn’t want to make a prediction as to whether the negatives and the positive will outweigh each other. I think, to an extent, they will probably largely offset each other.”

TRUST IN POLITICIANS, the Union and Prince Andrew were among the topics discussed by the leaders in the first televised debate of the UK general election.
UK Prime Minister and Tory leader Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn went head-to-head tonight, after the Lib Dems and SNPlost a legal challengeto take part.
Throughout the hour-long debate, Boris Johnson attempted to steer the debate towards Brexit, while Corbyn tried to push issues like the NHS, wealth inequality, and housing.
According to aYouGov pollthat asked responders “Leaving aside your own party preference, who do you think performed best overall in tonight’s debate”, 51% answered Boris Johnson, and 49% answered Jeremy Corbyn.

Jeremy Corbyn came under pressure to clarify what side he would campaign for if there was a second referendum.
“Mr Corbyn, you’ve heard tonight, cannot answer the fundamental questions,” Johnson said towards the start of the debate.
Corbyn clarified that he would negotiate a new deal with the EU, and put that deal along with the option to Remain, to the public in a second referendum next year, if he won enough support to form a government on 12 December.
In response to accusations from Johnson that this would be another delay, Corbyn said accused Johnson of being misleading by saying that his “oven-ready” Brexit deal wouldn’t have “Brexit done” by the 31 January next year.
“That idea that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s deal can be dealt with and finished by the end of January is such nonsense,” he said.
“You are not going to get it done in a few months and you know that perfectly well.”
2. Boris Johnson and the Union
ITV debateITV debate
When asked by a member of the audience whether Brexit was more important than the Union, Corbyn gave a long and winding answer, while Johnson said succinctly: “The Union is the most important thing”.
Corbyn’s reply was: “The agreement the PM has put to parliament is about creating a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, creating a different customs arrangement having promised to the DUP he would never do that.

He said that Johnson’s deal “is damaging to this country, to workers’ and consumers’ rights”.
Johnson responded with: “We have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together”.
“Corbyn would do a deal with Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party, and the price of that would be a second referendum on the Union with Scotland.”
Corbyn said that “this is nonsense, there’s not going to be a coalition with the SNP, no deal has been done and there will be no deal done”.
After a bit of back and forth on whether there would be another Scottish independence referendum, Johnson concluded that “I didn’t hear him rule it out”.

Corbyn accused Johnson’s government of entering into secret talks with the US to open up the NHS to American pharmaceutical companies in a future trade deal.
“What we know of what Mr Johnson has done is a series of secret meetings with the United States in which they were proposing to open up our NHS markets as they call them to American companies,” he said.
Johnson hit back, denouncing the claims as “an absolute invention”, insisting there were “no circumstances whatsoever” in which a Conservative government would put the NHS “on the table” in trade talks.

Answering a question on whether is the monarchy fit for purpose, Corbyn won applause for his immediate, pointed response: “Needs a bit of improvement.”
Johnson said after a short pause that “The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.”
The question was followed up with a query on Prince Andrew, to which Corbyn said that “we must be mindful of the victims” of Epstein.

Claps and jeers were heard after almost every response, and in some cases, the sincere responses from Corbyn or Johnson prompted laughter from the audience.
When asked whether they could be trusted, Johnson answers “look what I’ve delivered”, which prompted some laughter. When asked again whether the truth matters in this election, Johnson said “I think it does” – which prompted even more laughter.
At one point, the presenter Julie Etchingham asked both leaders to shake hands as a gesture and a pledge to change politics for the better.
Later on, a member of the audienceasked, in the interest of cooperation and friendship, what Christmas present would each leader leave under the tree for the other. Corbyn responded with ‘A Christmas Carol’ by Charles Dickens to show “understand how nasty Scrooge was”, and Johnson said he’d gift “a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal”, before choosing the non-political pot of damson jam.

Other party leaderswere asked for their views on various issuesafter the Johnson-Corbyn debate – here’s a quick round-up of what was said.
Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson.Repeating comments that she’s made before, Swinson said that she would revoke Article 50 and reverse Brexit if she became Prime Minister.
Swinson said that Labour are “all over the place” on Brexit and said that the EU has been helpful to the UK in tackling issues like climate change. Swinson said that she would use a nuclear weapon if she was leader, which raised some eyebrows.
Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon.Answering questions during the rapid-fire question round, Sturgeon said that she would be open to “an informal arrangement” with Labour, despite Corbyn ruling it out earlier.
She also said that the EU’s solidarity with Ireland was a good reason for Scottish independence, and also added that she didn’t think Scotland would adopt the euro instead of the pound.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragesaid pulling Brexit Party election candidates was a “big decision”, but was needed to make sure there wasn’t a second EU referendum. He said that he would “rebrand
He criticised judges for making political decisions “without being accountable to anyone”, and said a written British constitution was needed to make referendum decisions legally binding.
“Trade not aid, is where we should be heading,” Farage said. “So much foreign aid is spent in bad ways, I think halving it is the right thing. We’re going to reduce tariff barriers, we’re going to stop raping and pillaging their fisheries, we’re actually going to help these countries to make themselves richer and better.”
Sian Berry leader of the Green Partysaid “none of the other parties are quite there yet” when it comes to their environmental policies, and said she couldn’t believe that the topic of climate change was “relegated to the quick-fire section”.
“I can’t believe neither of these two leaders brought up the most important issue that we face alongside Brexit, I think it’s just outrageous.”
When asked whether they can spend £100 billion a year on getting the UK carbon neutral by 2030. “In the Greens, this isn’t a target that we take lightly.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-meeting-5200063-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2020
THE UK GOVERNMENT haspublished proposed legislationthat would, if passed into law, unpick key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement in a move that has provoked sharp criticism in Ireland, Europe and the US.
The controversial bill, which Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis admitted yesterday would breach international law, was published this afternoon amid concerns from EU leaders about the UK’s approach to the final weeks of negotiations.
The wide-ranging bill, published this afternoon, includes provisions that would allow the Northern Ireland Secretary of State to ‘disapply’ or change rules on state aid that would circumvent EU regulations in Northern Ireland and the UK.
Through provisions handing the UK government an array of powers that could apparently be used to set aside EU law and European Court of Justice case law on state aid – a key source of disagreement between the two sides – the UK has attracted fierce criticism from Europe and, this evening, from the US.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin earlier expressed his “deep disappointment” in a phone call with Boris Johnson while US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi said this evening there’d be “absolutely no chance” of a US-UK trade deal passing Congress if the British government follows through.
The Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed between the UK and the EU last year, would see many EU customs rules be applied in the North in a bid to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland – effectively creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.
Many of the crucial elements of the bill are an attempt to reverse or undermine that position.
The bill provides UK ministers with the power to make regulations about customs exit declarations, specifically giving them the power to ignore rights and obligations that would arise under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Legal expertshave already pointedto a range of scenarios in which, if passed into law by the UK parliament, the legislation would breach the agreement between the UK and the EU.

This afternoon, President of the European Council Charles Micheltweeted: “The Withdrawal agreement was concluded and ratified by both sides, it has to be applied in full.”
“Breaking international law is not acceptable and does not create the confidence we need to build our future relationship,” he added.
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said she is very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the Withdrawal Agreement.
“This would break international law and undermines trust. Pacta sunt servanda = the foundation of prosperous future relations,” she tweeted.
Speaking to reporters earlier, EU vice president Maros Sefcovic said:
“I will call for an extraordinary joint committee on the withdrawal agreement to be held as soon as possible so that our UK partners elaborate and respond to our strong concerns on the bill.”
Sefcovic is now due to travel to London to meet senior Tory minister Michael Gove as the EU seeks clarifications from the British government on how it plans to proceed.
This evening, senior US Democrat Pelosi said: “Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the stability brought by the invisible and frictionless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
“The UK must respect the Northern Ireland Protocol as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border.
“If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill would preserve jobs and peace in Northern Ireland, as well as allowing unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and England, Scotland and Wales.

Good Friday Agreement
Boris Johnson spoke to Táoiseach Micheál Martin this evening following the publication of the bill amid concerns about what it could mean for Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.
A spokesperson for the UK prime minister defended the bill this afternoon, saying the deal reached in 2019 was written “at pace” in “the most challenging” circumstances.
“The Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol aren’t like any other treaty.
“It was agreed at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances to deliver on a clear political decision by the British people with the clear overriding purpose of protecting the special circumstances of Northern Ireland,” the spokesperson said.
“It contains ambiguities and in key areas there is a lack of clarity. It was written on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached between us and the EU on the details and that may yet be possible.”
These comments were criticised by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,who condemned the approachtaken by the UK government.
“In the General Election it was, according to the PM ‘oven ready’ – now, when they want to jettison it in breach of international law, it was ‘signed in a rush’. What a bunch of incompetent and unscrupulous chancers – and they are trashing the UK’s international reputation,” she tweeted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/internal-market-bill-recap-5214394-Sep2020/,"THE INTERNAL MARKET Bill arrived with a thud, but may have petered out of the headlines since, despite significant developments with it this week.
As a quick recap: the UK and EU negotiating teams are locked in tense trade negotiations, which appear as though they could collapse at any moment over any of the three main obstacles of State aid rules, fisheries, or an agreed dispute mechanism.
As these trade talks stumble towards the end – with the final scheduled talks due in the next two weeks – the UK introduced a Bill that could derail the whole process. The Internal Market Bill.
The UK has been harshly criticised by former British Prime ministers, EU figures, as well as senior US politicians for proposing a domestic bill that would break an international treaty (with the same countries you’re trying to negotiate a new deal with in a tight timeframe, too).
Although Irish government is concerned by these developments -as Minister Simon Coveney showed in a fiery exchange with Andrew Marr- the approach to this Bill is to sit back and see what happens with it as it passes through the House of Commons and House of Lords.
What it says
The draft law is intended to ensure free trade across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after Brexit.
But it would give a British minister the power to unilaterally regulate UK State aid within Northern Ireland – a violation of the Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement which says it must liaise with the EU over any State aid that needs to be awarded.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted in the House of Commons that the bill “does break international law in a very specific and limited way”.
Johnson says the powers are needed only if the EU goes through with threats to impose custom and regulatory checks on certain types of trade going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Johnson famously called checks on live animal and agri-food products going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland a food ‘blockade’ – but the Irish government has repeatedly corrected this.
As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney said: “What is agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement and in the Protocol is that there will be limited checks on goods coming from GB into Northern Ireland, because there is an agreement to prevent the need for physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.”

What happened this week
This week, MPs proposed amendments to the Internal Markets Bill. One, proposed by the British government’s backbench MPs, was passed.
The only difference it makes would be to give MPs the power to approve the date on which these powers to override the Withdrawal Agreement come into effect (MPs love emphasising the power of Parliament versus the government of the day).
Coveney has already said that this amendment is not enough to ease Ireland’s and the European Union’s concerns, and wants the full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement before any EU-UK trade treaty is signed.
Senior Tory MP Bob Neill, who led the threatened rebellion of Tory MPs who oppose the bill, said the new amendment, which would restrict the powers’ use, made “the best of a bad job”.
“It’s not where I wanted to be, but in the interests of the country it’s right that we do get a proper functioning, working set of rules to enhance and improve the internal market within the UK,” he said during Tuesday’s debate.
On Thursday, Attorney General Suella Braverman was quizzed over her approval of the Bill, and called her Opposition counterpart unpatriotic, “emotional” and “illogical” for suggesting otherwise.
What happens next
The bill will now receive further debate in the Commons early next week, ahead of a vote on Tuesday on whether it should progress to the upper House of Lords for weeks of scrutiny there before becoming law.
There is some suggestion that the Bill could be stalled, and left suspended in the process awaiting the outcome of the trade negotiations.
If the British team get what they want from trade negotiations, particularly around State aid, they’ll most likely withdraw the bill. If they don’t, the threat remains on the table (like Johnson’s favoured sword-of-Damocles metaphor).
The EU has demanded Britain withdraw the clauses in the bill that conflict with the Withdrawal Agreement or it could face legal action, and Minister Simon Coveney has said there will be no trade agreement while the threat of that Bill remains.

FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has said he was “not sure” it would be possible for the European Union and Britain to reach a trade deal by the end of the year.
Britain and the EU are about to embark on negotiations aiming to hammer out a trade agreement by the time the post-Brexit transition period shuts at the end of December.
But France has made clear it thinks the negotiations will be particularly difficult, especially in such a tight timeframe.
“I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,” Macron said at a meeting with fishermen, who are concerned for their livelihoods after Brexit, at an agricultural trade event in Paris.
“Anyway, it is going to become more tense because [the British] are very hard,” he said, adding that fishing rights would be a key point of contention.

Britain formally ended its 47-year membership of the EU on 31 January, nearly four years after a majority voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum.
France and several other countries want to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while London wants full autonomy and limited access for European fishermen.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU’s top priorities are fishing, security and maintaining fair trading conditions for European companies.
He has also firmly rejected a British suggestion that City of London companies could be given broad, permanent access to EU markets without conditions.
Overall, French fishing boats generate 30% of their revenue from catches in British maritime territories, particularly rich in fish stocks.
French officials say that the UK exports the bulk of its catch to Europe, indicating that British fishermen have plenty to lose if the two sides fail to reach a deal.","1.46pm, 23 Feb 2020",

SENIOR TORIES ARE being asked whether they want “Big Ben to bong” at 11pm on 31 January to mark the UK’s exit from the European Union.
Health SecretaryMatt HancockandIain Duncan Smiththis morning confirmed they back Leave campaigners’ “Bells for Brexit” proposal.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragetold LBCthat if Big Ben doesn’t strike at 11pm, “our country looks like a joke”.
He also said: “I have put in an application through Leave Means Leave to book Parliament Square for the evening, to put up some staging, to have some singing, to have some music, to have some speeches.
“I’ve also applied to have some fireworks, which has been refused point blank.”
Yesterday morning, Boris Johnson said that the problem with the proposal is it would cost £500,000 to make Big Ben ring on the day. His official spokesman insisted that Brexit would be properly marked, but said there was not a specific government fund.
This morning, there were around 25 active pages on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe attempting to raise cash for the “Big Ben bong”. But the majority had received no donations at all, and the most successful page so far had only attracted £220.

The iconic clock tower hasn’t rang since 2017 due to extensive restoration works being carried out, and which aren’t due to be completed for several years.
“But we’re working up a plan so that people can ‘Bung a bob for a Big Ben bong’,” Johnson said.
Johnson said that during the refurbishment, the clapper of the bell was taken away, !so we need to restore the clapper in order to bong Big Ben on Brexit night.”
Meanwhile, The Times reports that a group representing Britain’s bell-ringers are opposed to the idea, as they wish to remain apolitical. Bishops and vicars back that stance, according to the paper.
No official funding plan
Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ultimately ruled out after it was revealed that it could cost £500,000.
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the Commission, said they believed “it is important to weigh up the costs”.
“We also have to bear in mind that the only people who will hear it will be those who live near or are visiting Westminster,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Leave.EU campaign has called for churches across the nation to echo their reaction to the Allies’ victory against the Nazis in the Second World War.
“Whichever way you look at it, February 1 will be the most momentous morning in British history since the glorious day in 1945 when our country celebrated victory over the Nazi regime in Germany,” the group said.
But the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers declined to give its backing.
“There are historical moments for which bells have been rung – end of world wars for example. In 2018 the Central Council worked with the Government on a recruitment and awareness campaign to recognise 100 years since WW1 Armistice,” a spokeswoman said.
“However the Central Council, as a principle, does not endorse bell ringing for political reasons. Individual towers have discretion to ring for such occasions but is on a case-by-case basis and typically needs permission from the incumbent.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-eu-rules-trade-talks-4989679-Feb2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON WILL tell the European Union he is prepared to accept border checks in a no-deal like scenario as tensions ratcheted up between the sparring sides.
As the dust settles on Britain’s formal EU withdrawal on Friday, attention has turned to the impending trade talks as the UK Prime Minister prepares to lay out his post-Brexit vision on Monday in a speech in London.
The UK  government is understood to be privately infuriated by what it perceives to be attempts by Brussels to change the terms of the deal struck in October as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Reports have surfaced in recent days suggesting EU chiefs want the UK to continue to follow Brussels-made rules on standards and state subsidies, while accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over matters relating to any trade deal.
But in what promises to be a combative speech, Johnson is expected to tell the EU he will accept no alignment, no jurisdiction of the European courts, and no concessions to any Brussels’ demands when talks start in March.
A government source told the PA news agency that Johnson would be prepared to accept a Canada-style free trade deal – a checks-lite trade arrangement that would allow tariff-free trade for the majority of goods, but that would not include the UK’s dominant services sector.
Analysis undertaken by the UK Treasury in 2018 predicted that Britain’s economy would be 4.9% worse off under such a deal within 15 years, when compared with expected growth if it had remained in the EU.

If a Canada-esque deal cannot be signed-off, insiders say the government is gearing up to walk away with what is dubbed an “Australia-style” arrangement – a re-branding of a no-deal Brexit.
It would see the UK revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, with additional mini-deals tacked-on to ensure travel arrangements, such as international flights, can continue.
A government source told PA:
European leaders have already set out their own warnings to Johnson over the upcoming talks.
French President Emmanuel Macron used an article in the Times to outline how the level of single market access granted to the UK would “depend on the degree to which the European Union’s rules are accepted”.
Another area of trouble could be Gibraltar, with Spain reportedly laying down a gauntlet to EU negotiators over the terms of any deal in the offing.
According to the Observer, the EU will back Spain over its territorial claims to the British overseas territory by giving Madrid the power to exclude its population of 34,000 people from any potential trade deal.
In his keynote speech in London on Monday, Johnson is preparing to rule out relaxing rules on workers’ rights, food hygiene standards and environmental protections.
He is also expected, according to government sources, to confirm UK negotiators will pursue free trade agreements with the likes of the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand at the same time as dealing with Brussels.

The Sunday Telegraph reported that a trade deal is earmarked to be agreed with Japan by Christmas, followed by more agreements with Australia and New Zealand in mid-2021.
On top of the tough stance on trade, the Sunday Times reported that British diplomats have been ordered to make a break with their former EU allies in a bid to “adopt a stance as a confident independent country”.
According to a leaked telegram quoted by the paper, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK should be free to “dis-apply EU foreign policy positions” during the 11-month transition period, as Britain prepares to move away from the bloc.
It comes as the Mail on Sunday revealed the PM toasted his Brexit success on Friday evening with a £350 bottle of rare vintage red wine.
The paper said the Conservative Party leader opened a bottle of 1994 Chateau Margaux that was left to him in a supporter’s will, gifted with strict instructions for it not to be drunk until Britain was no longer an EU member.
Dominic Cummings, the PM’s chief aide and the mastermind behind his “get Brexit done” slogan, is said to have teared-up after the UK’s departure was confirmed at 11pm.
Taking to the microphone at a party at Downing Street, the Sunday Times said the Vote Leave strategy guru had to compose himself by clutching a hand over his face, before addressing those in Number 10 for the historic occasion.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-citizens-right-uk-5034419-Mar2020/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has published a draft law to guarantee the Common Travel Area rights of Irish citizens to live and work in the UK without restrictions despite Brexit.
An Immigration Bill brought forward yesterday will repeal EU free movement laws but legislate for an exemption for Irish people.
British immigration minister Kevin Foster said that “this bill provides certainty and clarity for Irish citizens on their rights to enter and live in the UK, reflecting the reciprocal arrangements for British citizens in Ireland”.
The draft legislation states that “an Irish citizen does not require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom”, with some limited exceptions.
The idea is that there will be no change to free movement across the Irish Sea. Other EU citizens will require visas from as early as next year.

Both the Irish and British governments haverepeatedly stressedthat they wanted to keep the Common Travel Area, which has been in place since 1922.

But legal experts had warned that extra legislation might be needed to guarantee Common Travel Area rights.
A 2018 report commissioned by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission referred to “the dated language of some of the legislation, over half a century old, which operationalises the CTA. References to aliens and foreigners are out of step with contemporary nationality and immigration law in Ireland and the UK, which could undermine future efforts to enforce CTA related rights by litigation”.
One of the report’s co-authors, Professor Aoife O’Donoghue, toldTheJournal.iethat the new bill “finally puts the Common Travel Area on a solid footing in the UK. This certainty is very welcome, particularly as the Act gives individuals rights that they can rely upon”.
But she added that “other elements, like the right to vote in elections and referendums, are not covered by this Act and will need continued monitoring and cooperation between Dublin and London”.
The Durham University law professor also advised Irish people living in the UK to apply for extra status if they want to bring foreign relatives to live with them in future.
“Importantly”, O’Donoghue said, “the Common Travel Area does not give any family rights to individuals, so registering as an EU citizen under the EU Settlement Scheme remains important for current or future family members from outside the UK”.
Foster said “we remain firmly committed to protecting the long-standing Common Travel Area arrangements, which predate our EU membership and reflect the close and historic ties between our two great nations”.
Exceptions include the possibility of deportation for serious criminal offences, although the British government’s policy is not to deport Irish criminals except in “exceptional circumstances”.Nobody has been deportedin at least the past three years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-government-brexit-bill-lords-defeat-5261794-Nov2020/,"KEY PARTS OF Boris Johnson’s controversial Brexit legislation have been rejected by the Lords.
Peers moved to strip controversial clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill that would enable ministers to break international laws.
The Lords voted 433 to 165, majority 268, to reject law-breaking powers after fierce criticism by Tory former leader Michael Howard and Tory ex-chancellor Ken Clarke.
The government immediately responded by insisting it would not back down.
A government spokesperson said: “We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted to remove clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill, which was backed in the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256 and delivers on a clear Conservative manifesto commitment.
“We will re-table these clauses when the Bill returns to the Commons.
“We’ve been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market and the huge gains of the peace process.
“We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances.”
Peers went on to inflict a further defeat on the government by 407 votes to 148, majority 259, stripping out a further contentious clause relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
All other controversial provisions were removed without votes.
Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith said: “I am sure some in government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight’s historic votes in the Lords. To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law.
“The government should see sense, accept the removal of these offending clauses, and start to rebuild our international reputation.”
The move came after Tory former prime minister Sir John Major said the government’s plan to override key elements of the Brexit deal hurt Britain’s global reputation.

Sir John condemned Johnson’s position, insisting it was “unprecedented in all our history – and for good reason”.
Sir John said the UK Internal Market Bill, which ministers have admitted will breach international law, had “damaged our reputation around the world”.
Asked about the Lords votes, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told BBC2’s Newsnight the UK government’s stance had “undermined trust”.
He said:
Coveney added: “Effectively, what the Prime Minister is proposing to do with this legislation is to deliberately threaten to break international law by passing domestic legislation which effectively says if the EU doesn’t give us what we want in the negotiations around the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, and, in particular, the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland, well, then we are going to legislate to give British ministers the powers to do what they want to do anyway.
“And that has been a tactic that really has undermined trust in these negotiations.”
US relationship
The Prime Minister’s stance could risk creating early tensions with US president-elect Joe Biden.
Biden warned during his successful campaign against Donald Trump that a trade deal with the US was “contingent” on the prevention of a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson has insisted that the Bill is designed to “protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland”.
Biden, who is proud of his Irish heritage, has warned the agreement cannot “become a casualty of Brexit”.
Meanwhile, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was in London yesterday to resume trade talks with Downing Street counterpart Lord Frost.
Barnier tweeted that he was “happy to be back” in the capital, with the two teams “redoubling our efforts” for an agreement.
He listed the three major sticking points – governance, the level playing field and fishing policies – as the three “keys to unlock a deal”.
Time is fast running out to have a deal in place by the end of the transition period on 31 December, with businesses fearing the high trade tariffs they would face in the absence of an agreement.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has lost a motion before the House of Commons to hold a general election on 12 December.
The motion saw 299 MPs in favour and 70 MPs against the prime minister’s proposal.
The Labour Party abstained from voting and as the proposal did not secure a two-thirds majority required, it was lost.
However, Johnson told MPs that he would be “giving notice for the presentation of a short bill for an election on 12 December” to Parliament tomorrow.

“I simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that is Brexit or anything else,” he said.
“Last Tuesday, we briefly allowed hope to bloom in our hearts when for the first time in three-and-a-half years parliament voted for this country to leave the EU,” Johnson old the chamber.”
‘Flextension’
This morning, EU Council president Donald Tusk agreed to extend Brexit until 31 January 2020.
Some leaders, most notably Emmanuel Macron of France, had been pushing a shorter extension to allow Johnson pass the recently revised Brexit deal through the House of Commons.
The EU leaders have now agreed to a so-called ‘flextension’ to the end of January 2020. The UK can leave the bloc earlier if the House of Commons and the European Parliament ratify the Withdrawal Agreement before then.

In a letter to Tusk which was published this evening, Johnson said “I must make clear my view that this unwanted prolongation of the UK’s membership of he EU is damaging to our democracy and to the relationship between us and our European friends.”

“I would have much preferred it if the UK Parliament could have proceeded rapidly to ratify the deal we reached between us. Unfortunately, I very much fear that this Parliament will never do so as long as it has the option of further delay,” he said.
“That is why I am seeking a General Election in December to ensure the election of a fresh parliament which is capable of resolving the issue in accordance with out constitutional norms.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-announcement-5310333-Dec2020/,"THE UK AND European Union are on the threshold of striking a post-Brexit trade deal.
An announcement is expected on Christmas Eve, but talks were continuing through the night on the details of an agreement.
The development came as Britain and the EU were believed to have made progress on resolving issues including fishing rights and the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing unfair competition.
The expected deal comes with just days left before the current trading arrangements expire on 31 December.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson led a late-night call with Cabinet ministers to update them on the situation.

#brexitwork will continue throughout the night. Grabbing some sleep is recommended to all brexit-watchers at this point. It will hopefully be an early start tomorrow morning...
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney the expectation is that a deal will be done today, stating there have been last-minute discussions about fisheries.
He said he expected an announcement to be made later on today, stating that a Christmas Eve Brexit deal will be an “enormous relief”.
Johnson has been in close contact with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in recent days as top-level efforts intensified to get a deal over the line.
The pair are expected to have a further call on Christmas Eve to agree the deal.
European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer suggested an announcement could come early on Christmas Eve.
“Work will continue throughout the night,” he said shortly after midnight.
“Grabbing some sleep is recommended to all Brexit-watchers at this point. It will hopefully be an early start tomorrow morning…”
The UK side expected talks over the legal text of the deal – reportedly around 2,000 pages long – to continue into the early hours.
A deal covering the UK-EU trading relationship worth almost £670 billion will come as a relief to business leaders.
If, as expected, it provides for trade free from tariffs and quotas the economic shock of breaking away from the EU’s single market and customs union will be softened.

The Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast that a no-deal Brexit could wipe 2% off gross domestic product – a measure of the size of the economy – in 2021, adding to the damage to jobs and livelihoods already caused by coronavirus.

If a trade deal is announced between the UK and the EU, the European Research Group will reconvene its Star Chamber to scrutinise and deliver an opinion on it.
But the details of the deal will be closely scrutinised to see where either side has compromised.
It was widely reported Britain offered a longer transition period regarding fishing rights than it previously wanted and would agree to the EU handing back only 25% of its quotas in British waters at the start of the process.
And as the battle to spin the situation began, French sources reportedly claimed the UK had made “huge concessions”, especially on fisheries – a symbolically important issue on both sides of the Channel.
The late-night wrangling on the final aspects of the deal is thought to have included discussions on species of fish as part of the quota arrangements.
Any deal Johnson secures is likely to pass through Parliament with Labour expected not to oppose it – Sir Keir Starmer has stressed that an agreement with the EU would be in the national interest.

But in a sign of the political difficulties Johnson may face, the European Research Group (ERG) of hardline pro-Brexit Tory MPs said they would scrutinise any deal in great detail.
The ERG said it would reconvene its so-called “star chamber” of legal experts to examine the text.
A statement issued by the group on Wednesday said: “Given that the new agreement is also highly complex, the star chamber will scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom after we exit the transition period at the end of this year.”
But it is not only hardcore Eurosceptics who could be critical of a deal.
Lord Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, said “the truth is the deal means the introduction of significant barriers to free trade” through customs and regulatory checks.
But he acknowledged “it is better than no deal and we could certainly do with some good news”.

The negotiations in Brussels were fuelled by a late-night delivery of pizzas.
If a deal is agreed it would have to be backed by the EU’s 27 member states.
MPs and peers would be recalled to vote on a deal next week, but the European Parliament has said they will not have time to ratify a deal before January 1 – meaning any agreement is likely to be provisional.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-phil-hogan-5193640-Sep2020/,"EU CHIEF BREXIT negotiator Michel Barnier has said he would miss Phil Hogan, who relayed “any Irish concerns to me very directly” over the last four years as Ireland’s EU Commissioner.
Inan addressto the Dublin arm of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), Barnier thanked Hogan for his work in both Commissioner roles he held (Agriculture and Trade) and for his team of experts, who were of “great value”, he said.
“I used to meet him once a week as Trade Commissioner. And I look forward to working with the future Commissioner of Irish nationality in the final stretch of the negotiations with the UK.”
Commenting on Ireland’s new EU Commissioner, who is yet to be appointed, he said that he’s sure they will be “very proactive” in defending their portfolio.
“Even though I am French, I have always been close to the Irish concerns. I will never forget my meetings with people on the ground in Ireland and Northern Ireland.”
‘No move’ on Brexit talks
Without going into detail about the Brexit trade talks, Barnier reiterated previous claims that the UK was not cooperating, or “engaging constructively” in talks.
This comes after a meeting with the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost in London yesterday.
Barnier said: “We did not see any change in the position of the UK. This is why I express publicly that I am worried and I am disappointed because, frankly speaking, we have moved.
The three obstacles
The first of three major stumbling blocks in EU-UK trade talks are thelevel-playing fieldprovisions, or the sense of “fair play”, as Barnier put it.

“This is particularly important in the area of state aid, where the potential to distort competition using subsidies is significant.”
Citing a number of suggestions of what no level-playing field provision would mean, Barnier said:
The second obstacle is an agreement onfisheries, and Barnier was quite strong on this issue today:
Responding to an article in the Times of London that claimed the EU refused to discuss a proposal for fisheries suggested by the UK, Barnier said:
“No new legal texts have been tabled by UK negotiators.”
“And of course, the fishermen and women of many other EU countries. That is just not acceptable,” he said.
The third main stumbling block in Brexit trade talks has been a‘dispute settlement’mechanism. This would be a process where both the EU and UK could resolve any dispute that happens between the two trading blocks.
The European Court of Justice was suggested as one possible way of solving future trade disputes, but the UK has refused that suggestion.
Other issues
Barnier also argued that although the UK calls for wanting a“clean break”in some areas, it is choosing to continue relationships with the EU in others.
These include: on transport and energy trading; on its role for conformity assessments for goods; and on many aspects of police and judicial cooperation.
Barnier also made a very pointed criticism about the UK’s suggestion forrules of origin, as well as other areas:

The company has contacted its customers to inform them that law changes following Brexit mean that they are currently not allowed to offer the service.
The service allows patients to get prescriptions for specific medications without seeing a doctor face-to-face.
Lloyds said that the reason they have had to suspend the service is down to a law which now states UK-based doctors can not prescribe Irish patients medications.
A statement from Lloyds reads: “Unfortunately, we’ve had to temporarily suspend our service in Ireland and you won’t be able to place any more orders for the moment.
“This is due to a change in the law linked to the end of the Brexit transition period which means out Irish-registered but UK-based clinicians can no longer prescribe to our Irish patients.”

Lloyds customers had been sent an email in the days leading up to the New Year which stated that their service would not be affected by Brexit.
“We want to take this opportunity to apologise for any confusion or disruption this might cause to the way you get your treatments. We’re doing everything we can to get the service back up and running. We’ll update you as soon as possible,” the statement added.

The Taoiseach acknowledged the “severe impact” that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations would have on the industry and the disappointment expressed by the representative bodies during the discussions this afternoon.
The discussions were also attended by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue.

The talks took place ahead of a Cabinet meeting today where supports for fishing will be discussed.
A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said the Government was fully committed to engaging with the representative bodies and working with and for the sector and coastal communities in the coming period.
“The Government will have an initial discussion of the matter at its meeting today. The Taoiseach confirmed that all possible avenues to support the sector would be examined, and a comprehensive plan would be developed in consultation with the representative bodies,” the spokesperson said.
Industry groups reacted angrily to the terms of the trade agreement after they were announced last week.
The deal sees the EU hand back to the UK 25% of the value of fish stocks caught by European boats in British waters, having originally proposed to hand back between just 15% and 18%.

https://www.thejournal.ie/housing-hotels-dublin-tourism-travel-wild-atlantic-way-4886747-Nov2019/,"FÁILTE IRELAND HAS said that Dublin “desperately needs” more hotels to sustain Ireland’s tourism industry.
CEO of Fáilte Ireland, Paul Kelly, was speaking as industry staff gathered in Croke Park to launch the organisation’s tourism plans for 2020.
Dublin, he said, “desperately needs” an increase in hotels, calling the city a “gateway to Ireland”
“When we project that over the next three to four years, we believe we’re still going to be about a thousand rooms short of what’s required,” Kelly said.
“There is no shortage of space for development in Dublin,” he said.
The tourism industry wants to see the number of houses “increase and improve” but “there are sites that are more appropriate for hotels than housing”, Kelly added.

The rapid increase in the number of hotels across the city have become a target for criticism as Dublin’s housing stock remains low and the homelessness crisis continues.
Kelly said that Ireland is losing out on tens of millions of euro in revenue due to the lack of hotels for conferences and events.
Brexit
The tourism body also warned that the coming year will prove “challenging” for tourism in Ireland.
With 2019 a “mixed year”, with visitor numbers remaining largely flat, businesses are facing a difficult few months ahead due to the uncertainty caused by Brexit.
Fáilte Ireland is hoping that a new €6 million domestic and Northern Ireland marketing campaign, as well as the opening of 25 new attractions across the country, will combat any industry-wide slowdown.
“Business sentiment is down, fuelled by rising costs and low-priced competition in the sector. More than half of tourism businesses around the country have seen a decline in business from Britain and Northern Ireland,” Kelly said.
Fáilte Ireland projections for 2020 predict only a small increase in overseas visitors to Ireland, with hopes that the figure could rise to over 9,700 in 2020 – only a marginal increase from 2019.

The organisation also warned that both the south-east and the border counties had been impacted most by Brexit. A weaker pound has made visiting Ireland a lot more expensive for UK tourists.
“Rural Ireland gets impacted more than Dublin city,” Niall Tracey, the Director of Marketing at Fáilte Ireland, said.
With fewer Northern Irish visitors travelling across the border, some businesses in the region have already felt the brunt of Brexit, while port connections in the south of the country have also taken a hit.
Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, will address the event today.
He praised the organisation’s plans to respond to the challenge of Brexit. “I am confident the plans and initiatives will provide an assurance to the sector that where growth opportunities exist, they will be exploited,” Ross said.

Although some consultations have already taken place with major Irish-Scottish groups, the Scottish and Irish governments want to look at any and all informal or local links that also may exist between the countries in order to sustain them into the future.
The aim ofthe questionnaire, which can be found here, is also to update the two countries’ views of the links as they are now: a Department spokesperson said “we want the questionnaire to bring in as many diverse voices and ideas as possible, to help us shape our engagement with Scotland”.
Contributions are welcome from those living in Ireland or Scotland, as well as those with an interest in the relationship between the two countries.
Among the questions being asked in the survey are:
The review focuses on areas where the Scottish government has devolvedcompetency, and is split into five main parts: business and economy; community anddiaspora; academic and research links; culture; and rural, coastal, and islandcommunities.

Scotland has a well developed island community, which the Irish government is looking to learn from, while the academic research links are believed to be quite developed. The Irish-Scottish Health Forum is seen as a good example of cooperation between the two countries.
The publication of the questionnaire today comes aftera visit by the Tániaste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneyto Edinburgh to visit the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon.
In ajoint-opinion piecewith Cabinet Secretary for Tourism, Culture and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop, Coveney wrote: “Scotland and Ireland have long been neighbours and friends, from our historic Celtic roots to contemporary links in business, education, culture and beyond”.
“It is easy to take relationships for granted. This review will begin the assessment of how things stand – what we do together as governments, as trading nations, as research bodies, as cultural institutions, as communities.”
The questionnaire is the result of a close relationship between Irish and Scottish authorities built on the British-Irish Council, and through structures of the Good Friday Agreement 1998.
Speaking about the questionnaire, a Department spokesperson said: “Coming twenty-one years after devolution, now is a time for both governments to work together to revitalise and intensify the bilateral relationship.
“This review will provide a blueprint for this engagement over the next five years. Our hope is that it can capture and deliver on the ambitions of our people for the Ireland-Scotland relationship.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-emi-award-5331273-Jan2021/,"THE EU’S FORMER Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that a “clever solution” should be found to a diplomatic row, where the UK is refusing to give the EU’s ambassador to London full diplomatic status.
The UK is refusing the ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida this status based on the EU being an organisation rather than a nation; but this is in contrast to other non-EU countries’ approach.
Barnier said that he understood that things cannot stay the same after Brexit, but said that “it would be wise” if a solution were to be found.
The EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator was speaking as the European Movement Ireland awarded Barnier as ‘European of the Year’, and is the first non-Irish citizen to win it.
In a Q&A session after receiving the award, Barnier said it was very important to him that “we have to understand why 52% of the British people voted against Europe. There are reasons. We have to listen, we have to understand, we have to answer”.

“It’s too late for the UK, but it’s not too late for other member states. We have to be pro-active to draw the lessons,” Barnier said. “I have no longer this feeling that another EU member state would be tempted to leave, but we have to be vigilant.”
In his speech accepting the award, Barnier said that Brexit for Ireland was less about trade and customs, and more about “maintaining peace and stability”, and so he and his team tried to be “particularly attentive” to all the different communities in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Addressing the pro-Brexit argument of sovereignty over close unity, Barnier said that national and European sovereignty should be pulled together, rather than pulled apart: “They go together like these two flags behind me.”
The former French minister also used a number of phrases as Gaeilge, including “ní neart go chur le chéile”.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Barnier’s “resourcefulness and integrity”, and ”consistent, fair, de-dramatised” approach made a Brexit deal possible.
He praised Barnier’s “very particular bond between you and people in Ireland”, recognising challenges facing Ireland and the importance of protecting the Good Friday Agreement.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that during the arduous Brexit talks, that Barnier “never faltered”.
Related ReadsHow has trade between Ireland and Great Britain been affected in the first two weeks of Brexit?
“You asked for one thing when this is all over: a quiet and peaceful fishing trip in Ireland,” Coveney said.
In the last weeks of the trade negotiations, Barnier said that Coveney spoke to him two or three times a week on fish stocks with “a lot of competence, it’s not so often that a Foreign Affairs minister is so competent on fisheries”.
It had been reported by the Telegraph that Barnier has become an adviser on the Brexit agreements to the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Barnier confirmed this, and said that it would only be for a few weeks – perhaps two months.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-no-deal-very-likely-5296535-Dec2020/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2020
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has warned it is “very, very likely” that the UK will fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.
Johnson said he was “hopeful” that progress could be made in talks but stressed that the two sides remained stuck on fisheries and ‘level-playing field’ rules.
His comments came after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the negotiating teams’ positions remained apart on “fundamental issues”.
The two leaders have agreed to make a decision on the future of the negotiations by the end of the weekend.
Despite statements from both sides that no trade deal is more likely than a deal, it’s understood that if the UK gives ground on the level-playing field, and the EU gives ground on fisheries, that a deal could be done.
It’s also expected that if one side moves first to compromise, the other side will do the same.
Coveney’s comments
While in Berlin to meet with his German counterpart Heiko Maas, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told a press conference “it is possible to get a deal”.
He added that could be achieved in a way that protected the EU’s interests in preserving the integrity of the Single Market while respecting Britain’s insistence on being an independent and sovereign country outside the bloc.
“Both can be achieved, we need to find a way of designing a middle ground that can achieve both.”
Simon Coveney said nobody was questioning British sovereignty or control; he said there had been a lot of “frustration” during negotiating efforts.
“What I would say to politicians, we need to try and dial down the language in terms of the division and differences of views and focus on the detail.
“The idea that the UK and EU cannot put a good, constructive, positive partnership in place in the context of that new relationship.

Speaking to reporterson a visitto Blyth in Northumberland, Johnson said today: “Unfortunately at the moment, as you know, there are two key things where we just can’t seem to make progress.
“And that’s this kind of ratchet clause they’ve got in to keep the UK locked in to whatever they want to do in terms of legislation, which obviously doesn’t work.
“But I’ve got to tell that from where I stand now, here in Blyth, it is looking very, very likely that we will have to go for a solution that I think would be wonderful for the UK, and we’d be able to do exactly what we want from January.
“It obviously would be different from what we’d set out to achieve but I have no doubt this country can get ready and, as I say, come out on World Trade terms.”
Earlier, von der Leyen said the UK would be free to decide whether to follow suit each time the EU changes its regulations – though if it refused the bloc would adapt the conditions for access to its markets.
It’s worth noting that around 97% of the deal has been agreed, and drafted into legal text.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said in previous weeks that “a landing strip” was in view for where negotiations could come to an agreement. Though the sides seem far apart now, that suggests that a deal is still possible if the political decision is taken to do one.
On level-playing field and fisheries
The level-playing field measures aimed at preventing the UK undercutting the EU on standards and state subsidies have proved a major stumbling block in the talks since they started in March.
On fisheries, the Commission president said the UK and EU have “not yet found the solutions to bridge our differences” and urged the British Government to “understand the legitimate expectations of EU fishing fleets built on decades, and sometimes centuries, of access”.
“On these and other points, our negotiators are working. We will decide on Sunday whether we have the conditions for an agreement or not.”
She added: “One way or the other, in less than three weeks it will be new beginnings for old friends.”
French president Emmanuel Macron meanwhile insisted he was not demanding to “have my cake and eat it” in response to a question on the EU’s proposals that the bloc’s fishermen would be able to continue to access UK waters for a year in a no-deal.

Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost are continuing talks in Brussels after Johnson and von der Leyen agreed at a dinner on Wednesday to resume negotiations ahead of a decision on the future of talks this weekend.
Downing Street declined to deny reports that Johnson had requested calls with the leaders of France and Germany but was rejected, after he said he would be willing to return to Brussels – or head to Paris or Berlin – to get a deal over the line.
The Prime Minister also said yesterday that the Cabinet should “get on and make those preparations” for a departure on terms like Australia’s, which does not have a trade deal with Europe, unlike Canada.
But Malcolm Turnbull, who was Australia’s prime minister until 2018, told Johnson publicly that he should be“careful what you wish for”as Australia’s relationship with the EU is “not one from a trade point of view that I think Britain would want, frankly”.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden defended the British Government’s description of a no-deal exit as trading on Australian-style terms, insisting ministers were not “taking people for a ride”.
The price of a no-deal
The British Retail Consortium has warned that supermarkets and their shoppers would be hit with a £3.1 billion annual “tariff bombshell” without a deal, with 85% of foods imported from the EU expected to face tariffs exceeding 5%.
The pound continued to fall as traders’ fears of a no-deal Brexit intensified.
Against the dollar it hit a three-week low of 1.323 today, down 0.5%. Against the euro it fell to an 11-week low at 1.091, down 0.4%.
Ayush Ansal, chief investment officer at the hedge fund Crimson Black Capital, said: “With a no-deal departure from the EU now arguably odds-on, the UK is heading for the worst possible outcome at the worst possible time.”
He added: “Some market watchers are even suggesting the pound could fall to parity with the dollar in the event of no-deal, which would be a symbolic coup de grace for sterling.”

Queue Management on M50 Northbound approach to M1/M50 JunctionDept of TransportDept of Transport
IRISH TRANSPORT AUTHORITIES have announced plans to deal with Brexit-related traffic at Dublin Port, including turning a Dublin Airport car park into a temporary facility for trucks in order to ease worst-case scenario congestion.
A ‘traffic-light’ system will be in place at the Port to monitor the flow of truck traffic at the port from 1 January, when post-Brexit rules and checks come into force.
Though the UK officially left the EU in January this year, the transition period has meant that the UK remained in the Customs Union and Single Market. From 1 January, it will no longer be adhering to EU rules, and so new checks are needed at ports and airports.
In the event that congestion from Dublin Port spills out onto the surrounding roads, and begins to impinge on the toll plaza, then the Port Tunnel will be closed.
Trucks heading to the Port will be instructed to turn around, and directed to parking spaces for heavy-goods vehicles (HGVs).
The turn-around facility to Dublin PortDepartment of TransportDepartment of Transport
Trucks will be ‘stacked’, or parked, on new motorway slips and in services areas in Lusk as a first port of call, but if the congestion is “particularly prolonged”, then trucks can be parked at the longterm ‘Blue Car Park’ at Dublin Airport.

The Blue Car Park allows for up to 8,000 car spaces; around 250 trucks will be allowed to park there temporarily; the relevant welfare facilities and canteens will be installed in the car park in the weeks before Christmas.
Authorities will gauge how bad the Dublin Port traffic is based on the length of time traffic is at a standstill, and what areas in the Port are backed up.
The plan for Dublin Port also includes enhanced traffic spacing at the northern Dublin Port Tunnel entrance, and a queue management system for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) on the M50 northbound approach to the M1/M50 junction and on the M1 southbound.
Hauliers are being urged to familiarise themselves with the requirements for import and export controls ahead of 1 January, to ensure a smooth flow of trade.
This week, new digital lane control signs will go up on the road signs over the M50 Northbound in order to help clarify which lanes are for trucks.

The ‘traffic light’ system
The Department of Transport, the Dublin Port Company and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have been preparing Dublin Port for the impact of Brexit-related checks, which could severely impact on traffic in the surrounding areas.
It’s expected that businesses will stockpile ahead of the changes coming into effect from 1 January, and that this means the Port isn’t expected to be too busy for the first two weeks of the New Year.
It’s unclear whether congestion issues at Dublin Port will only apply to the first half of the year as officials and hauliers adapt to changes, or whether it will be a more longterm problem.
Related ReadsBrexit trade talks: Boris and Ursula to meet in coming days to discuss final 'significant differences'
There are eight new Brexit-related facilities in six locations at Dublin Port. Customs officials and staff from the Department of Transport will direct trucks to the correct site, depending on the goods being transported.
There are yards that deal with equine, pets and animals; customs checks, an overflow terminal; and further inspections yards. Before trucks arrive at Dublin Port, Revenue will give hauliers either a ‘green route’ (to exit out of the Port) or a ‘red route’ (where checks are needed before exiting the Port).
This is the colour-coded system to deal with Brexit-related traffic:
It should be noted that Dublin Port has been at Status Green or Amber for all this year, and only goes into Status Red in cases such as extreme weather events.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said:
“This traffic management plan, which is the result of close collaboration by many different agencies, is designed to deal with any congestion that may arise due to increased level of checks at Dublin Port and to minimise the impact on the Port tunnel, nearby motorways and the rest of the city.
“We know that Brexit is a challenge for our hauliers, and thank them for their cooperation in ensuring they have the correct documentation to enter the port and that they  follow the alerts and signage provided.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/children-modern-slavery-victims-immigration-brexit-5213442-Sep2020/,"CHILDREN IN CARE and modern slavery victims who are EU citizens could “fall through the cracks” and lose their right to live in the UK after Brexit, immigration experts have warned.
Members of the Roma community and other vulnerable people could also be at risk of becoming irregular migrants if they do not know they need to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to secure their immigration status in the country after freedom of movement ends, a report from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said.
EU citizens and their families are asked to apply to the Home Office’s EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) by June next year in order to carry on living and working in the UK when the transition period with the European Union ends after Brexit.
According to provisional Home Office figures to the end of August, more than 3.9 million applications have been received.
Over half of those, at least 2 million, have already been granted settled status and some 1.5 million were granted pre-settled status, where they would need to reapply again after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence.
But over 10,000 applications were refused, at least 31,000 were withdrawn or void and more than 38,000 were invalid – where the Home Office decides that someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence.
If a significant number of eligible people do not apply by the end of June next year they risk being classed as an irregular migrant – losing the right to live and work in the UK and potentially facing detention and deportation, the report said.
While most EU citizens living in the UK will find the scheme straightforward and easy to apply for, some people may struggle to complete the application, the experts warned.

‘Impossible to know’
Gaps in data provided by the Home Office on how the EUSS is progressing “make it impossible to know whether such citizens who are currently UK residents are not applying for status”, they said.
Dr Marina Fernandez-Reino, co-author of the report, said: “Applying to the EUSS is easy and fast, and more than 3 million applications have been submitted, but our analysis suggests that there could be many who will not apply.
“This could be because they are not aware of the scheme, they have difficulties navigating the process or there is no evidence to prove their eligibility.”
Even if just 1% of the UK’s estimated EU citizen population failed to register for settled status, it would generate more than 30,000 new irregular migrants in the UK, the report indicated.
Fernandez-Reino said: “The sheer scale of the process means that even if we were to see more than 99% compliance with the scheme – a level which is unusual in any sort of bureaucratic process – this could still lead to many thousands of people with immigration problems next year.
“Many of them may be society’s most vulnerable.”
The report highlighted the lack of information from the Government on what could happen to people who fail to apply, although the Home Office previously indicated there could be some form of grace period.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We are working to ensure that all eligible children and families are supported with their applications to the EU Settlement Scheme.”
She added that millions of pounds in funding had been provided to charities across the UK to help vulnerable EU citizens.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-4986885-Feb2020/,"What does Brexit mean to you if you’re from Northern Ireland? Or the Republic?
HereLiz Roche, who’s from the Republic and Nicola Curry, from the North, share their thoughts about the impact of Brexit from each perspective.
They are working together on a new cross border co-production, The Here Trio, which explores boundaries and belonging in a post-Brexit world.
Nicola Curry:‘I thought a bomb was a nuclear explosion’
BOUNDARIES AND BORDERS defined where I belonged when growing up in Armagh city in the 1970s and 1980s.
I had family living on both sides of the Co Armagh and Monaghan border, and crossing the border was a regular occurrence for weekend visits and holidays in Granny’s or to see family in Castleblayney, Dundalk, Navan, Drogheda, Dublin or Cork.
To-ing and fro-ing of movement across the border was normal. But so was division, conflict, checkpoints, car searches, army, guards, uniforms, occasional gunfire and bombs (including one less than 50m from the house that, as a naïve seven-year-old, I thought was a nuclear explosion).
The family members who lived over the border less than 20 miles away were insulated from the reality, fear, horror, and trauma that pervaded those times.
Growing up in those times, the prevailing landscape was a restrictive one. There were areas that you wouldn’t go to, places where you didn’t belong, parts of town that weren’t ‘yours’, spaces that were safe, unsafe, yours, theirs; places you didn’t walk, towns you didn’t shop in.
This landscape of restriction and narrow boundaries of what is safe, what place is yours or theirs, whether you belonged was to be navigated constantly.
Nicola Curry, who grew up in Co Armagh
Dance in my experience, however, knew no borders, division or separation on ‘them’ or ‘us’ lines.
When ballet classes moved away from Armagh, I travelled twice weekly to Portadown to an Orange Hall to learn more about dance throughout the 1980s. Through doing this and participating in cross-community arts projects in Armagh, I met other young people who I would never have otherwise encountered due to a divided education system.
Lines of division and borders have softened here over the past 40 years but with life circumstances and the world rapidly changing, each of us weighs the past, present and future differently.
There are many unknown, unresolved and unsolved aspects of life but boundaries and borders, be they real or imagined, should allow and value individual richness and respect bonds of belonging. My family that grew up in Co Armagh and Co Monaghan have bonds of belonging still stretching across the border but also now across the world from Russia to Hong Kong, Canada to Australia, Sweden to Switzerland to name but a few.

Liz Roche: ‘I remember the tension that crept into the car while approaching the border’
At this time when there has been so much confusion around our shared future on the island of Ireland, it is definitely the right moment to come together as artists and reaffirm our position of openness and interconnectivity.
With Brexit officially after taking place, it’s an interesting time and place to be making a dance show about boundaries and belonging in Northern Ireland.
In my experience, relationships between dance artists and companies, North and South, has always been good. The Here Trio will be our third co-production with Maiden Voyage. We have toured these works together throughout the island, shared resources and continue to support each other as colleagues and friends.
Previous to this we have toured with other Northern Irish artists as part of programmes of Irish contemporary dance abroad, and performed in many venues and festivals.
In short, there are strong relationships there and Brexit won’t necessarily change that, but it does place an initial barrier of confusion and lack of certainty that will take time to work out.
The arts only survive through us all working together, and there are enough difficulties as it is, so for Brexit to potentially add to that is a real concern.
In preparation for the making of The Here Trio I thought first about the history of the actual site of The MAC theatre in Belfast where we will premiere.
Dancers in The Here Trio
I was thinking about all of the traffic of life that passes through a particular point in space over the years, a ‘here’. It made me question what and how things get remembered.
I thought about how physical scars are permanent on the body, acting as triggers for memory, and how that can be in contrast to a site, where the memory can be erased with the destruction of the old structure and rewritten with the construction of the new.
As the research continued childhood memories of the North came back to me. In the mid 80s, my uncle and his family lived in Coleraine, so visits were regular enough at that time.
I remember the tension that crept into the car while approaching the border. My parents played the experience down but as the car passed the signs for exchanging money and then the soldiers appeared, we knew as kids to stop messing.
Soldiers with guns, their boyish faces peering in the window and out from behind hedges. The sight of a real gun was shocking; it still is. Looking back on this time, from the comparatively comfortable distance of Dublin, I realise that I grew up thinking of the situation in the North as quite manageable in comparison to other places in a state of conflict.
Even the reality of the armoured cars, and the walls built across streets and the barbed wire, seemed to be normal enough. And when I look back at those years and time spent later in the North I realise how wrong I was. It’s only as an adult that the full extent of what people lived through really hits home.
In The Here Trio, the dancers movements convey bodies that are agitated and driven, even stressed. Dance captures the body; its patterns, movements, expressions and energies.
A person can say a thing but if their body isn’t behind it, it doesn’t have any weight or conviction. In dance, we highlight what the body does before words are formed.
The Here Trio is part of a double bill of new work performing with BRINK by Eileen McClory. It premieres at The Mac, Belfast (7 -8 February), the Market Place Theatre, Armagh (12 February), Dance Limerick 2020 (23 April), Live Collision International Festival at the Samuel Beckett Theatre (25 and 26 April).

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-6-4985087-Jan2020/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said he is not trying to scare people with his Brexit warnings during the election campaign.
Today, at the final ministerial Cabinet meeting of this government, Coveney briefed his colleagues ahead of Friday’s Brexit deadline.
Speaking to reporters, he said:
“The truth is that Brexit has not been central to the campaign. That may change from Friday on, but we’ll see.”
He acknowledged that voters are “tired” and “fed up” of the Brexit narrative, and the issue hadn’t been featuring on the doorsteps.
However, he said the next year will involve some tough choices for the Irish government, as trade negotiations begin.
Coveney said Boris Johnson’s determination not to seek an extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020 is putting the UK in a straitjacket. He said the European Union will be tailored to a time line that will force choices and a “very intense” negotiation.
Brexit deadline
After Friday, the UK will continue to follow EU rules while talks take place on a free trade agreement over an 11-month transition period.
Johnson has stated he will not contemplate an extension beyond the end of the year.
Coveney acknowledged that the tight time frame to reach an agreement is not ideal, but said it is not his view that Ireland will feel the impact of a hard Brexit.
“We are now moving very quickly in terms of the next stage of Brexit and we have been preparing for that for quite some time,” he said.
“Choices we will have to make is what can we do to limit the damage of not having an agreement by then”, he said, adding that in that scenario, the trading environment would fall into a WTO (World Trade Organisation) style arrangement.

Enormous damage can be done without trade agreement being reached, warned Coveney.
Contingency planning needs to be ramped up not rolled back, he says. On NI protocol,  the infrastructure that needs to ensure there is no hard border - but there will be checks - will need to be worked out in a way that doesn’t stoke divisionspic.twitter.com/G5j3tGwrxI— Christina Finn (@christinafinn8)January 29, 2020Christina Finn/ Twitter

“We need to preparing for a failure in that negotiation,” he said, adding the challenge to come in the next year could be even more challenging than the one already overcome.
Coveney went on to say that after the UK leaves the EU, discussions around the future will begin straight away.
On Monday, the European Commission will publish their draft negotiating mandate which is set to be approved by EU leaders.
He said the “demanding negotiation” will begin with fishing, in his opinion.
This could be the first hurdle, with Coveney stating:
‘Difficult choices’
“I think what will become very clear is that we will have to make some very difficult choices before the summer and what I mean by that is, the European Union has already indicated that there is no way that a full future relationship agreement that involves free trade agreements can be completed by the end of the year, there was no chance.”
Putting on his electioneering hat, Coveney said:
“I ask the question who do you trust to manage all of that because it’s coming at us like a freight train, whether you like it or not?”
When asked whether there should be an all-party agreement on the government’s approach to Brexit after the election, and during the government formation talks, Coveney agreed there should be.
While Coveney wants to get back into power to lead Ireland’s Brexit message, he said:
“We will work of course in the interests of the country and whoever is in the office of the Taoiseach.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-oireachtas-commit-5240325-Oct2020/,"THE CONTROVERISAL BREXIT legislation will not survive because it is a rule of law issue and not a Brexit one, an Oireachtas Committee has been told.
Members of the UK’s House of Lords told TDs and Senators that the contentious provisions in the UK Internal Market Bill were an attempt to force negotiations with the EU.
The British government suffered a defeat yesterday, with peers backing by 395 votes to 169, majority 226, a “regret” amendment, condemning the controversial provisions.
The Oireachtas European Affairs Committee heard one peer describe the disputed legislation as “brinkmanship”.
The legislation gives powers to British ministers to override the Brexit divorce deal.
Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and former Northern Ireland adviser to ex-prime minister Gordon Brown, said that the motion was the “biggest political defeat” since the reform of the House of Lords in 1999.
“If this vote was to be seen as about Brexit it would have limited force, but I think the size of the vote suggests there was a general consensus this is more about the rule of law than Brexit, and that has political force,” he told the committee.

Oireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Former diplomat John Kerr said it is clear the government cannot get the controversial clause of the Bill through.
“This clause cannot survive because of the rule of law issue, not because of the Brexit issue,” he added.
Conservative Baroness Couttie said there is a lack of evidence to back up the government’s claim that the EU is acting in bad faith.
“If they were then that would mean that the Internal Market Bill with Clause 5 within was not in fact breaking international law,” she told committee members.
Asked why the British government refuses to use the dispute resolution process, Baroness Couttie said: “Informally I have been told that the concern was, if the joint committee did classify all agricultural goods and food products moving from the UK to Northern Ireland as being ‘at risk’, this would cause such an impact on the Northern Ireland economy.
She said, however, they have received no evidence to back up those claims.

“There is no doubt about the breach of international law, he added.
He added: “Trust has been undermined. This is probably brinkmanship and attempt to force negotiations – I’m not sure it has been effective.”
Wood said that the controversial clause was included in the Bill as a reassurance mechanism for hardline Brexiteers.
“It was signalling, don’t worry that if you don’t like things that we may have to agree, because ultimately there will be legislative provision that ultimately override things we don’t like,” he told the committee.
“It’s an insurance policy to the Conservative backbenchers.”
However, Baroness Couttie disagreed, saying that she suspects negotiations between both sides got “quite fraught”.
“Someone in the negotiations made some comment about their ability to behave vexatiously and use the joint committee to block goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland as a negotiating threat,” she added.
“The British government’s response to that was Clause 5. They are viewing it as a safety net.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/volume-of-trucks-arriving-in-ireland-lower-than-expected-5328346-Jan2021/,"THE VOLUME OF trucks arriving in Ireland is around 50% lower than in previous years, State officials have said, which is partly due to post-Brexit checks creating an obstacle for deliveries from Great Britain.
This is also partly due to Covid-19 travel disruption: not as many ferries are operating, and shops are closed in Ireland during Level 5 restrictions, and require less goods.
An increase in trading is expected over the coming weeks, officials said.
At a briefing at Dublin Port today, head of Customs Operations at Dublin Port Tom Talbot said that the volumes of trucks delivering goods into Ireland was much lower this year than in the same time period in previous years.
The first freight deliveries being transported into Ireland was mostly perishable goods, media at the briefing were told, and that more goods with a longer shelf life are expected in the coming weeks.

Eddie Burke from the Department of Transport said that the cause of non-Covid delays was a “lack of preparedness, particularly in the UK; in some cases extreme pressure on customs agencies; and the difficulty in some cases in adapting to a new system of customs arrangements”.
Disruption to the food supply chain hasn’t happened partly because of stockpiling done by supermarkets ahead of time, and supplies are still coming into the country.
Talbot said that 80% of trucks have been ‘green routed’ through the Dublin Port in the past few days.
Customs declarations need to be made ahead of time, while a health cert needs to be presented for all agri-food goods. Talbot said that if a truck is orange or green routed, then customs, the HSE, or Department of Agriculture will need to approve the consignment.
As an example, Talbot said that of 26 trucks held in Terminal 11 this morning, and no driver was there for longer than five hours. He said that there have been cases of drivers being delayed for 24 hours, but this has only happened in one, two or three cases.
In response to reports from hauliers of serious disruption and delays, Talbot said they are “not delays per se”.
“Some do leave the Ports [without going through the required checks], it’s not done deliberately, people are learning.”
Related ReadsHow has trade between Ireland and Great Britain been affected in the first two weeks of Brexit?
Hazel Sheridan from the Department of Agriculture said that the volume of calls coming through with questions about the new post-Brexit system have been “quite low”, and encouraged businesses and hauliers to get in touch with their questions.
There have been cases of drivers leaving the Port when checks were required, but these were described as not deliberate. Sheridan said that those incidents were “innocent mistakes more than anything else”.
“The UK left the European Union on 31, so there is no scope for pausing [new checks required],” Talbot said.
Last week, Revenue announced that they would temporarily ease a safety and security requirement (an ENS number, which is needed before boarding a ferry), and businesses will be given a generated one to help continue the movement of goods.
But this is accompanied by the expectation that help will be sought by businesses who have not yet requested one.
Talbot said that they were “absolutely not” at the limit of their flexibility and though they had no plans for easing further checks and requirements, they understand the difficulties faced by hauliers and businesses: “We have legal requirements like everyone else, but we understand that this is new for everybody.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-parcel-delay-why-5319958-Jan2021/,"NOBODY SAID IT would be easy, but one week into the new post-Brexit customs and trade arrangements between the European Union and Britain and already, issues are beginning to crop up.
We haven’t seen anything like the chaos that some people were expecting this week.
But a couple of developments have raised red flags.
Earlier today, Stena Line said that it cancelled twelve ferries between Ireland and Britain due to sail before 12 January.
Citing a combination of Covid-related public health restrictions and new Brexit requirements, the Irish ferry operator said it had observed a decline in both passenger and freight volumes since 1 January.
So what else happened this week and can we expect things to get worse as the new year begins in earnest?
Port traffic and delays
So far, we haven’t had too much of an issue with Brexit-related delays and traffic build-up at Irish ports.
In fact, earlier this week, Dublin Port confirmed that only an “extremely small” number of Irish trucks travelling to the UK have been rejected for having incorrect documentation.
On the other side of the equation, there were only some minor delays for hauliers who did not complete the correct paperwork upon arrival in Ireland from Holyhead.
Revenue gave a stern warning that many businesses “were not as prepared as they thought or significantly underestimated what was involved in being Brexit ready”.
Generally, the first week in January can be a quiet time of the year; New Years Day is said to be the second quietest day of trading of the year. This coupled with pre-Brexit stockpiling by businesses means the ports haven’t been quite as busy as they might be next week or later in the year.
At a Brexit briefing in December, Eddie Burke from the Department of Transport was asked how long it could take for traders to get used to new post-Brexit checks and systems. His answer was that we just don’t know.
But the potential for sudden delays is ever-present, given the new processes and checks that have to be done on goods, particularly on goods entering Ireland from the UK.“Customs and other regulatory checks take time — and some take longer amounts of time than others,” as Revenue Commissioner Gerry Harrahill explained last week.
These aren’t new processes — Irish authorities have been carrying them out on goods coming from ‘third countries’ for years.
But they’ve never been applied to UK goods until now, meaning the overall volume of imports that have to be checked increased basically overnight on 1 January.
Agricultural and food products travelling from the UK into Ireland will have to be checked to ensure they meet European safety standards.
Plant and animal products coming from Britain will have to travel with a health certificate signed by a UK vet and official identity seal.
Farm equipment will have to be checked to make sure it’s not contaminated with soil.
If they don’t have their ducks in a row upon arrival, the consignments can be rejected or unloaded and the individual boxes checked.
So it’s been a quiet week but as Tom Talbot, head of Revenue’s operations at Dublin Port, said this week, “There will be delays as traffic builds but we are confident we can minimise the disruption.”
Post and deliveries
One of the most immediately tangible consequences of Brexit is the extra red tape and costs associated with sending items by post to and from Britain.
Although Brexit hasn’t affected the flow of letters between the two islands or between the North and south of Ireland, Irish VAT now applies on goods from British retailers that cost more than €22.
Additional Customs documentation is also required for parcels sent from the UK to Ireland. Customs fees also apply to some purchases above €150.
Before Christmas, An Post confirmed that customers will have to deal with these extra charges at checkout or, alternatively, through An Post’s website or in a post office.

But extra red tape is already causing trouble for some.
Courier company DPD Britain announcedtodaythat it will freeze its road delivery services from the UK to Europe, including Ireland, until next Wednesday, 13 January to review its processes.
In a statement, the parcel delivery company said, “It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe. This has placed extra pressure on our turnaround and transit times.
“We are seeing up to 20% of parcels having incorrect or incomplete data attached, these will have to be returned to you so that the required data can be provided.
“In addition to this we are seeing delays and congestion at UK ports and more rigid requirements for channel crossings.”
But An Post has confirmed that it is trading “fully and smoothly” with almost all of the UK online retailers who deliver to Ireland.
“While some delays should be expected due to UK retailers bedding in their new data requirements prior to shipping,  the majority of items dispatched through the An Post digital systems are released for immediate delivery on arrival into Ireland,” it said.
Food supplies
A number of pictures shared this week of empty shelves in Irish Marks & Spencer stores had prompted concerns that post-Brexit changes would limit food supplies, at least temporarily.
But the problem seems only to affect M&S at the moment; other supermarkets may have stockpiled items, as pre-31 December queues at the Port of Dover seem to suggest.
A spokesperson for Tesco Ireland said “there is no need for customers to change their shopping habits” at the moment.
“We have seen a slight increase in demand for products over recent days due to Covid restrictions but overall availability is good with plenty of stock to go round,” he said.
Marks & Spencer, however, admitted that swapping to a new post-Brexit system meant that it was taking “a little longer” for products to reach its stores, and it is working to resolve the issue.
There are other issues agreed under the EU-UK trade deal that may cause different problems, as CEO of Marks & Spencer Steve Rowe explained today:
“Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it.”
This means that Percy Pig packets may no longer be available in Ireland, or be more expensive to buy here.
The Newsletterrevealed todaythat in Northern Ireland, Marks & Spencer is temporarily withdrawing hundreds of items from sale as a result of the new customs arrangement under the Irish Protocol.

The limitations on travel from the UK because of the new Covid-19 variant has also had an effect on imports into Ireland, it is understood.
Aidan Flynn, General Manager of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland said that it has been more difficult to get goods into the country rather than out.
The problems are mainly arising, Flynn says, from the new ‘safety and security’ requirements, which document which goods are on what trailer. This information is mandatory to get a pre-boarding number that allows trucks to board ferries.
The problem is further compounded by a communications issue – a different part of the business might be asked for additional information, meaning hauliers might not know why they’re not being let through ports.
He said that it didn’t help that a political deal was done on 24 December, a few days before the new systems came online at 11pm on 31 December.
“There was no transition, they didn’t provide anybody with time. The new system came online at 11pm on 31 December, and it wasn’t available for testing beforehand – so the learning is in real-time.”
He said that the new system was a shock” and that it will take time to come to terms with that: “It’s as close to a hard Brexit as anyone would have thought”.
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said that Brexit preparation was about being prepared for what you can control, but “we can’t control what happens in Great Britain”.
Richmond says the Government must begin to look at alternative routes to Europe, noting that the first four new ferry departures from Rosslare to Dunkirk had sold out.

IT’S OFFICIAL – The clock has struck 11pm and the UK’s departure from the European Union has taken full effect.
Brexit has dominated British politics since the country’s narrow vote to leave the bloc in June 2016, opening deep political and social wounds that still remain raw.
Legally, Britain left on 31 January but has been in a standstill transition period during fractious talks to a secure a free-trade agreement with Brussels, which was finally clinched on Christmas Eve.
The last-minute UK-EU trade agreement saw British businesses breathe a sigh of relief that a no-deal Brexit scenario had been averted.
The deal means the UK has access to its biggest export market tariff-free and quota-free, but the end of the transition period from 31 December will still see companies having to make adjustments to their operations.
The PA news agency looks at some of the issues they face:
Lack of readiness
Earlier this month, before the trade deal was concluded, MPs on the Commons Brexit Committee outlined concerns about the “overall state of readiness” for the end of the transition period.
They said decisions had been made “too late”, communications with businesses were “patchy at best” and the “late delivery” of IT systems for customs made training and testing difficult.
Maddy Thimont Jack, associate director at the Institute for Government (IfG) think-tank, wrote on its website that the last-minute trade deal left “dangerously little time” to prepare for what it meant.
She warned the complexity of rule changes could see businesses “behaving illegally, by accident” if they have misunderstood them.
Extra red tape
Charles Grant, director at the Centre for European Reform think-tank, warned that manufacturers and farmers will face “irksome” checks at borders in relation to customs, VAT, safety and security and plant and animal health.

Hauliers and trade bodies representing supply chain businesses fear this could lead to delays and extra costs that could be passed on to consumers.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove admitted some “bumpy moments” are likely as the new arrangements come into effect.
Thimont Jack said Brexit means “swathes of red tape and additional costs” for businesses.
She said the lack of “blanket mutual recognition of conformity assessments” means many “goods will need to be certified by both UK and EU authorities to have access to both markets”.
She added: “There is also no mutual recognition of the sanitary and phytosanitary regime – which means goods of animal and plant origin will be subject to more checks at the border.
“In some sectors, including pharmaceuticals, automotive, chemicals and organics, there are further facilitations, but for most there will be significant barriers.”
The IfG said that to qualify for tariff-free market access, British goods will need to meet “rule of origin” requirements with product supply chains having to meet percentage thresholds for content.
It said: “Some industries, especially food, will simply be unable to do this: cane sugar imported from the Caribbean and refined in the UK will not qualify for access to the EU tariff-free, nor will basmati rice imported from India and milled in the UK. Any meat product must contain only meat from animals born and raised in the UK or the EU.”
No mutual recognition of professional qualifications
In a blow to the UK’s services sector, the trade deal lacks a mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
Thimont Jack said: “It will be much more difficult for many professionals to deliver services in the EU, with rules differing member state by member state.”
An IfG analysis said there were “enormous numbers” of exceptions covering market access provisions in the trade deal.
For example, it said UK nationals will not be able to sell actuarial services in Italy or construction services in Cyprus, or to be surveyors in Bulgaria or tobacconists in France.
The trade deal includes limitations on activities allowed under permit-free short-term business travelLiam McBurneyLiam McBurney
New rules on business travel
The trade deal permits short-term British business visitors to the EU to stay for 90 days in any six-month period.
Related ReadsA look at the detail: What is in the Brexit trade deal?
But the rules mean that activities allowed without the need for a work permit are limited to such things as meetings, consultations, research, training and trade fairs – with variations between member states also applying.
Selling goods or supplying services to the public are not covered by the short-term business visit provisions.
UK government guidance says visas or permits may be needed for business travel and advises travellers to check each country’s rules.
Potential for disagreement over the rules
London and Brussels agreed a floor for standards for areas like the environment and labour rights, with this level playing field being reviewed in four years.
But Tánaiste Leo Varadkar warned that if the UK deviates too far from EU standards its access to the European market could be threatened, saying it was “not unconditional”.
A European Commission summary of the deal said either side has “the right to take unilateral measures to safeguard their economies against unfair competition from the other party”.
The document said a “dispute settlement mechanism” covers most areas of the trade deal, including the level playing field.
Accompanying “enforcement and safeguard mechanisms” include the possibility of tariffs or quotas being reintroduced for an affected sector.
The deal contains gaps
Two key issues left unresolved by the trade deal are “data adequacy” and “equivalence for financial services”.
The EU is yet to decide if the UK’s personal data protection regime is adequate to allow the flow of information between the two sides. Restrictions in this area could hit British business competitiveness.
Temporary arrangements for a period of up to six months will permit data flows until an adequacy decision has been reached.
There is little detail on financial services, a key UK export, with it yet to be determined if the EU will unilaterally decide the UK’s laws and regulations are equivalent to its own.
The UK and EU have committed to agree a memorandum of understanding on establishing a framework for regulatory co-operation in financial services by March.

The Treasury would not lend support to manufacturers that favour EU rules as the sector has had three years to prepare for Britain’s transition, Javid said in an interview with the Financial Times.
Javid urged businesses to “adjust” and said that while some will benefit others will not.
He added: “There will not be alignment, we will not be a ruletaker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union — and we will do this by the end of the year.
“We’re … talking about companies that have known since 2016 that we are leaving the EU.

“Admittedly they didn’t know the exact terms.”
But the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned that no regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit could lead to price rises.
Its chief operating officer Tim Rycroft added: “Food and drink manufacturers will be deeply concerned by the Chancellor’s suggestion that there will not be regulatory alignment with the EU post-Brexit.
“It will mean businesses will have to adjust to costly new checks, processes and procedures, that will act as a barrier to frictionless trade with the EU and may well result in price rises.”
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said alignment supports jobs and competitiveness for many firms.
Its director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: “Business welcomes the Chancellor’s ambitious vision for the economy and recognises there are areas where the UK can benefit from its future right to diverge from EU regulation.
“For some firms, divergence brings value, but for many others, alignment supports jobs and competitiveness – particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK.”

Javid admitted that some businesses may not benefit from Brexit, but added that the UK economy would ultimately continue to thrive in the long-term.
“Once we’ve got this agreement in place with our European friends, we will continue to be one of the most successful economies on Earth,” he said.
Javid will have the opportunity to sell his vision for Britain’s economy post-Brexit when he travels to Davos next week for the World Economic Forum.
The Chancellor also hinted that there might be tax rises in the March Budget or autumn, telling the Financial Times that he was determined to take the “hard decisions you need to sometimes, especially at the start of a new government”.
But when asked specifically about taxation he said: “You’ll have to wait for the Budget.”","11.37am, 18 Jan 2020",
https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-gove-belfast-brexit-support-5170064-Aug2020/,"UP TO £355 million of taxpayers’ money will be used to help businesses in Northern Ireland cope with additional bureaucracy caused by Brexit.
The funding, announced by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove as he visits Northern Ireland, will help firms deal with the paperwork associated with bringing goods in from Britain or the rest of the world.
The new Trader Support Service is aimed at addressing concerns from Northern Ireland businesses that red tape could disrupt the flow of goods from Britain.
An initial £50 million will set up the service, with the full contract worth up to £200 million.
It will provide end-to-end support to deal with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.
Businesses in Northern Ireland can sign up for further information about the scheme from today, before it becomes operational in September.

A £155 million investment will fund the development of new technology to ensure the process can be fully digital and streamlined.
The measures are needed because the Northern Ireland protocol requires it to remain in alignment with EU rules on goods, effectively creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea from 1 January after the transition period ends.
That means that digital import and safety and security declarations will be needed to avoid tariffs on trade within the UK and that goods destined for Ireland or the EU pay tariffs when they should.
The Trader Support Service will take care of those on businesses’ behalf at no cost, with officials indicating it should be seen as an enduring commitment rather than a short-term fix.
The new service is outlined as part of the publication of new guidance on the protocol for businesses moving goods into and from Northern Ireland.
Further support could be provided to cover health certification requirements for agrifoods.
Separately, a further £300 million has been committed to the Peace Plus programme to support reconciliation projects across the island of Ireland from 2021-27.
Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will promote the package during a joint visit.

“Today’s £650 million investment underlines our absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period,” Gove said.
“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.
“As part of our ongoing engagement with Northern Ireland businesses and the executive, we are also publishing further guidance for businesses on the operation of the protocol.
“As we continue to engage with businesses and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period.”
Lewis, said: “Businesses have always been at the heart of our preparations for the end of the transition period.
“This new Trader Support Service backed by funding of up to £200 million reinforces this approach – it is a unique service that will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-cummings-number-10-jobs-4952293-Jan2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S KEY adviser Dominic Cummings has called for “weirdos” to apply for jobs in Downing Street as he warned of “profound problems” in Government decision-making.
Cummings posted an apparent job advert today saying Number 10 wants to hire an “unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds” to work as special advisers and potentially officials.
The blog post exceeding 2,900 words came amid reports that the Prime Minister is planning “seismic changes” to the civil service.
Cummings, a former Vote Leave director, said he hopes to be made “largely redundant” within a year by the recruitment drive.
He called for officials including “weirdos and misfits with odd skills”, data scientists and policy experts to apply to a Gmail account if they think they fit the bill.

Cummings warned that there is “some profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions” and that he currently makes decisions “well outside” his “circle of competence”.
And he says the need for change comes with Brexit requiring large policy and decision-making structure changes and a Government with an 80-strong majority having “little need to worry about short-term unpopularity”.
Under a subsection on hiring “super-talented weirdos”, he writes that the Government needs “some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole”.
Brexit
Cummings’ post came after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their Whitehall jobs.
Under “seismic” changes being planned by Number 10, she also said that civil servants are “woefully unprepared” for sweeping reforms that Johnson is keen to push through.
Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, warned that it is unclear how the new recruits would be selected or what their roles would be.
Related ReadsLeo Varadkar says he won't 'pooh-pooh' the idea of a Northern Ireland-Scotland bridgeBoris Johnson unveils ‘most radical Queen’s Speech in a generation'
“Civil servants are recruited on merit, not patronage – a critical principle if they are to provide the best impartial advice to ministers,” Penman added.
“It would be ironic if, in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded individuals – recruited for what they believe, not what they can do – and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want.”
Penman also blamed officials’ salary levels as being a restricting factor for recruiting a wider pool of talent.
“Similarly, Cummings’s call to world-class experts to join government may flounder on the pay rates, which are typically half of those paid elsewhere. All senior civil service roles are already open to external competition, yet time and again, government’s failure to pay a market rate restricts the pool,” Penman said.

Johnson has previously said he wants agreement on a free trade deal by the time of next week’s EU summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-international-law-5199144-Sep2020/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Sep 2020
THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Minister Simon Coveney has said his concerns about reports of UK plans to override elements of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement have been “exacerbated” after hearing comments from the House of Commons today.
A British cabinet minister today said he expects the UK would “break international law” with its proposals to change how a key agreement with the EU operates.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told MPs it would be in a “very specific and limited way”, adding there are “clear precedents” for the UK and other countries which need to consider their international obligations as circumstances change.
Simon Coveney said in the Dáil this evening: “If those comments represent the considered view of the British government, then I find them gravely concerning.
“While we still await publication of the legislation, earlier this week we raised the media reports and briefings on this issue with the UK through diplomatic and official channels to express our concerns.
“However, rather than being reassured, my concerns have been exacerbated by additional comments deliberately made in the House of Commons today – openly committing the UK government to legislate to break international law in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement.”
The UK government will introduce the Internal Market Bill tomorrow, which aims to ensure goods from Northern Ireland continue to have unfettered access to the UK market while making clear EU state aid rules – which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland – will not apply in the rest of the UK.
Concerns have been raised that key parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, which sealed the UK’s departure from the EU in January, will be overridden by the legislation.
“Progress of the future partnership is inextricably linked to the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement,” he said.
“Any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern, and a very serious step.

“Northern Ireland does not need this further uncertainty in relation to Brexit.”
Coveney added that “it is surely not too much to ask” that the UK government implement legislation “in full respect of its international obligations”.
NI Secretary Brandon Lewis’  Labour counterpart Louise Haigh described the admission as “absolutely astonishing” and warned it would “seriously undermine” the UK’s authority on the international stage.
Guardian News/ YouTube
Lewis told MPs the government is “fully committed” to implementing the Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol.
But he added the UK is taking “limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net” to allow it to deliver on its commitments to the people of Northern Ireland and keep in line with the protocol should outstanding issues not be resolved in talks with the EU.
Lewis told MPs: “The UK internal market legislation that we will bring forward this week delivers on our commitment to legislate for unfettered access, something Northern Ireland businesses have consistently asked us to do and to ensure that we deliver certainty.
“This will give the certainty that the people and businesses, the economy of Northern Ireland, has been asking for and it supports the delivery of the protocol in all circumstances in line with the approach we set out in our command paper in May.
“The safety net we will implement, and we will outline this week, will deliver on the commitments made also in (our) general election manifesto.
“Specifically we will implement the provision in the protocol that Northern Ireland is fully part of the UK customs territory by ensuring that goods moving within the UK will never even inadvertently have to pay EU tariffs.
“We will ensure that businesses based in Northern Ireland have true unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom without paperwork and we will ensure that there is no confusion about the fact that while Northern Ireland will remain subject to the EU state aid regime for the duration of the protocol, Great Britain will not be subject to EU rules in this area.”
Conservative Bob Neill, chairman of the Justice Select Committee, later asked: “The Secretary of State has said that he is committed and the government are committed to the rule of law. Does he recognise that adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable?
Related ReadsWhy is the UK threatening to roll back on the 'Northern Ireland Protocol' and what does it mean for Brexit trade talks?
“Against that background, will he assure us that nothing that is proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international legal obligations or international legal arrangements that we have entered into?”
Lewis replied: “I would say to [Bob Neill] that yes this breaks international law in a very specific and limited way.
“We are taking the power to dis-apply the EU concept of direct effect required by Article 4 in a certain, very tightly-defined circumstances.”
He added that “there are clear precedents for the UK and indeed other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change”.
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted: “The Secretary of State for NI has just conceded in Parliament that Govt are about to break international law. His defence seems to be that ‘it’s only in a very limited way’.
“I’m not sure you can be a little bit illegal. It’s a bit like being a little bit pregnant.”
Tory former party leader Iain Duncan Smith said the government was “quite within its rights” to revisit the Withdrawal Agreement.
Conservative former minister Sir John Redwood said the EU must abide by its commitment to respect the restoration of UK sovereignty and work for a free trade tariff-free agreement, telling the Commons: “If the EU kept its word on these two colossally important points, the problems they’ve created in Northern Ireland would disappear.”

WITH BRITAIN MIRED in pre-Brexit purgatory in the run-up to an election, Irish businesses could be forgiven for taking a breather.
That would be a mistake, according to Simon Barry, Ulster Bank’s chief economist.
Speaking at a British Irish Chamber of Commerce seminar on business post-Brexit, Barry said that while the Irish economy is doing “really, really well”, there are important risks and “we need to avoid taking our foot off the gas”.
“(Brexit) will potentially cost the economy, maybe one to three years of normal economic growth,” Barry said, adding that while the country might not fall into an outright recession there will still be a shock.
“The focus on whether growth has a positive or negative sign is completely missing the point. The way to think about any economic scenario or any economic shock is the extent to which the economy is thrown off course,” he added.
However, Barry also pointed out that in preparing for a hard Brexit, Irish companies have started noticing opportunities in other markets, such as Germany.
Both Germany and Ireland would face higher import costs from the UK and lower ones from each other. “There are genuine opportunities out there,” Barry said, adding that “it can feel like a pain”, but “people in some cases are regarding Brexit in this way as a strategic opportunity”.
Dublin is less exposed to Brexit risks than the rest of the country, with the bonus of the city potentially picking up “quite a bit of extra FDI” as UK-based firms start to look for somewhere to relocate in the EU.
Citing recent IDA figures, Barry noted that the current running total of investments brought to Ireland because of Brexit risks stands at 70. That amounts to about 5,000 jobs, he added.
“There is a bit of an irony there in that the harder the Brexit, the greater the opportunity in some pockets of the economy depending on how things unfold,” he said.
A sharp drop in sterling in late 2015, just as the referendum result kicked in, saw spending from British visitors to Ireland go from strong growth to rapid contraction.
“That flip was Brexit in motion,” Barry said.
Even though spend from UK visitors has been declining since then, overall tourism spend has continued to rise from other countries.
“That speaks to one potential mitigant when thinking about Brexit. All else being equal we would potentially not expect Brexit to have nearly as much of an impact on other major economies which are important for us in Ireland,” he said.
That’s starting to change a little recently. Spend from European visitors has started to soften in the past few months – and here at home, consumers are spending less than a consistent rise in salaries would suggest.

Recent reports have suggested that the probability of a no-deal Brexit is dropping with UK prime minister Boris Johnson on course to win a December general election.

However, speaking at the event Katie Daughen, the head of Brexit policy at the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, said that there is still plenty to be done before an orderly exit.
“We are in a very uncertain piece. We have a basis from which to work, but the outcome of the election and what happens after is still very much in play,” she said.
“For businesses, there are a number of cliff edges still to be aware (of). There is still the potential for no deal at the end of January. That is the default outcome until the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both sides,” Daughen added.
‘The approach you can’t take’
Businesses have been, and are still, dealing with major uncertainty around the outcome of Britain’s vote to leave the EU, but preparations continue.
Littlewoods Ireland, which is among the country’s biggest online department stores and reports back to a UK parent company, has been Brexit planning for three years. This has been ramped up in the last 18 months, John Goodwin, the finance director of Littlewoods Ireland, said at the event.
“The key risk for us was always about keeping the shop open,” Goodwin said.
The company has been focusing on streamlining returns between Ireland and the UK as free returns is a big part of its offering.
As many of its brands import stock from outside the EU, a major challenge for the company will be the cost of paying double duties in a post-Brexit world.
With some research, Goodwin said the company found out that many of its products come under the low-value goods threshold, so anything under €150 is duty-free.
“There’s an awful lot of scaremongering out there. Educating your customers is very important,” he said.
But some businesses are still not ready for Brexit, he added. “There are household brands out there, that if Brexit went live on March 31, 2019, they would have ceased shipping into Ireland,” he said.
A “wait and see” attitude among Irish companies is a concern for Enterprise Ireland, according to Jonathan McMillan, manager of the Brexit unit at the state body, who estimated that about 20% to 30% of SMEs are taking this approach.
“That’s absolutely, we all agree, the approach that you can’t take,” he said.
He added that there’s a concern around how prepared UK partners are – even if Irish companies are taking necessary measures. But he added that there may also be an opportunity there for Irish businesses to “show that we’re ahead of the game, that we can take a lead in it and take an active role”.
Enterprise Ireland has long been stressing the need for diversification – but this includes diversification within the UK itself, McMillan said. Very few of his clients have more than a 3 or 5% share of their market in the UK and most have plenty of room to grow in Ireland’s closest neighbor.
“There’s there’s real opportunities there in various sectors and geographies,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/central-bank-stability-review-5279372-Nov2020/,"THE CENTRAL BANK of Ireland has warned that disruption to the global economic recovery is the biggest risk to the stability of Ireland’s financial system and its broader economy.
In its latest Financial Stability Review (FSR), published today, the Central Bank outlines key risks facing the financial system and its assessment of the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks.
While the economy has recovered since March, the prolonged impact of the virus presents significant risks.
Speaking at the launch of the report, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf said that “Housing transactions and mortgage activity, have recovered since the summer, but still have some way to go to reach pre-pandemic levels.”
Mortgage lending remains down 18% compared to last year.
As a small, open and highly-globalised economy, Ireland remains particularly vulnerable to international shocks, “including those stemming from Covid-19 and Brexit uncertainties”, the report says.
Global shocks may be transmitted to the Irish economy because of its “over-reliance” on multinational companies.
“Sectors which dominate Irish multinational enterprise (MNE) activity such as pharma, medtech and ICT have been resilient during the Covid-19 crisis. Still, MNEs in Ireland remain susceptible to global economic shocks, including the rise of protectionism,” the report warns.
Accordingly, “political risk” levels relevant to a “large share” of multinationals based in Ireland have increased this year.

So while the pandemic remains the “most salient source” of economic disruption in the near-term, the report emphasises the threat to the Irish economy from a disorderly Brexit in January.
Uncertainty around Brexit has been “elevated since the last Review” published in June, the Central Bank said.
A disruptive Brexit at the end of the transition period — ie one without a trade deal in place between the UK and the EU — “represents the main source of risk to the financial system as a whole,” according to the report.
Government supports
Although emergency policy measures such as the wage subsidy scheme have kept firms and households afloat during the pandemic, a prolonged bout of Covid-linked disruption represents another major risk to the domestic economy.
An upsurge in virus cases since the summer and the consequent tightening of public health restrictions in September have extended the economic impacts of the pandemic, according to the report.
“The revenue shock faced by firms [during the pandemic] has been cushioned by a range of fiscal supports; by the banking system through payment breaks and the drawdown of existing credit lines; and through deferral of repayment of other liabilities such as taxes, rates, rent and trade credit,” the Central Bank says.
These supports have clearly had a positive impact, it says, given the “historically low levels of corporate insolvency” this year.
However, speaking at the launch of the report, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf said that it will “take time” before the “full transmission of this now extended shock” is felt.
“We remain in a position where liquidity challenges have not, as yet, resulted in widespread solvency challenges,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-resume-5135638-Jun2020/,"
THE EU AND Britain will today launch an intense five weeks of negotiations on a deal to define their post-Brexit relations, with London keen to wrap things up quickly.
The new round of talks in Brussels will be the first to be held face-to-face since the coronavirus shutdown combined with the two sides’ entrenched positions to stall progress.
The meetings will alternate weekly between Brussels and London throughout July and at the end of August, as the teams learned yesterday, the British negotiator David Frost will be promoted to become Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s national security adviser.
Some commentators immediately suggested this could break the British side’s focus, but a UK spokesman insisted Frost’s new title does not mean he will be distracted from the ongoing discussions with his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier.
“David will remain chief negotiator for the EU talks until agreement is reached or until the talks end,” the official said.
“This will remain his first priority. As we have made clear we do not anyway wish these talks to run on into the autumn.”
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, said negotiators need to put in place “a way of avoiding a no deal Brexit”.
Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast this morning, Coveney said there has been “no progress” in Brexit trade negotiations in recent weeks, adding that the EU and the UK want “completely different things”.
“The British government has simply moved away from the political declaration they signed only six months ago and the UK has effectively tried to rewrite the rulebook on that negotiation which has been a huge problem,” he said.
Intensification
Hopes are that the intensification of the discussions will make it possible to deliver results after previous sessions, of mainly videolink talks, achieved little.
But tempers have flared in recent days and Johnson insisted on Saturday that Britain will accept the consequences of a no-deal scenario if common ground cannot be found.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel — whose government takes over the presidency of the EU next week — has also sharpened her public stance, questioning whether London actually wants a deal.
“Of course it would be in the interest of Great Britain and all member states of the European Union to achieve an orderly withdrawal,” Merkel told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily.
“But that presupposes that both sides want this,” she added.

Britain left the EU on 30 January and a post-Brexit transition period in which it still benefits from de facto EU membership will come to an end on 31 December.
Without a new agreement, the two sides would see ties reduced to minimum standards set by the World Trade Organization with high tariffs and serious disruptions to business.
London wants to agree on at least the bare bones of a trade deal this summer — at least politically, if not legally — in order to offer businesses clarity well before the end of the year.
The EU is less pressed for time and believes that the necessary ratification by the European Parliament and others would require a deal by late October.
“The faster we can reach an agreement, the better — and there’s no clear reason why the broad outline of a political agreement can’t be reached in the summer,” a Number 10 source told AFP.
‘Constructive, creative’
The format of talks today will be more streamlined than the first rounds, which involved hundreds of civil servants fanned out into separate sessions on various topics.
From now on, Barnier and Frost will lead smaller teams with the political authority to break logjams.
“We will be constructive, as we have always been, and respectful, and we are ready to be creative to find common ground,” Barnier told the European Policy Centre in Brussels last week.
In a tweet, Frost said he was coming to Brussels in “good faith”.
But he warned: “This needs to be a real negotiation and some of the EU’s unrealistic positions will have to change if we are to move forward.”

The discussions will begin with a meeting between the two men at 0800 GMT and will continue throughout the week with short sessions on the most problematic topics.
These include the guarantees of fair competition demanded by the EU in fiscal, social or environmental matters in order to avoid the emergence of a low-regulation economy on Europe’s doorstep.
Other sore points are the role for the EU Court of Justice, access to British waters for European fishermen, as well as the form of the agreement.
This could be either a very broad deal covering all areas of the relationship, as the Europeans want, or a simple trade agreement with small sectoral side deals as sought by London.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-wont-seek-brexit-extension-5121203-Jun2020/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has announced that it has officially told the European Union that it would not seek an extension to the post-Brexit transition period beyond 31 December.
“I formally confirmed the UK will not extend the transition period & the moment for extension has now passed,” senior minister Michael Gove tweeted after a meeting with EU leaders today.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that the union has always been open to an extension of the transition period and today it took note of the UK’s decision not to avail of the option.

“We must now make progress on substance. To give every chance to the negotiations, we agreed to intensify talks in the next weeks and months,” Barnier wrote onTwitter.
It comes despite the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales writing to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today to request an extension to the period.
Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said that it would be “extraordinarily reckless” to end the transition in the new year because of the enormous economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“No-one could reproach the UK Government for changing its position in the light of the wholly unforeseeable Covid-19 crisis, particularly as the EU has made it clear it is open to an extension request,” they wrote.
“We therefore call on you to take the final opportunity the next few weeks provide to ask for an extension to the transition period in order to provide a breathing space to complete the negotiations, to implement the outcome, and the opportunity for our businesses to find their feet after the enormous disruption of recent months,” the letter added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-deadline-arrives-sunday-5298128-Dec2020/,"POST-BREXIT TRADE talks have entered their final day, with the UK and European Union continuing last-ditch efforts to find a breakthrough on a deal before the weekend deadline.
Negotiators were set to carry on discussions into the early hours while Boris Johnson will again speak with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen later today, despite pessimism from both sides.
British negotiator David Frost arrived at European Commission headquarters earlier this morning to see his EU counterpart Michel Barnier.
Sources in the British Government warned the offer on the table from the EU is still “unacceptable” to the UK, with the country teetering on the edge of a no-deal Brexit that is predicted to cost jobs and force food prices to increase.
The trade talks continue to be deadlocked over the thorny issues of fishing rights and the so-called level playing field ‘ratchet’ that would tie the UK to future EU standards.
Johnson and von der Leyen had a dinner meeting in Brussels during the week in which both agreed a firm decision on the future of negotiations was needed by the end of the weekend.

The outlook after discussions yesterday was described as “very difficult” but officials said the prime minister is determined to explore every option to secure a free trade agreement.
A British government source said: “Talks are continuing overnight, but as things stand the offer on the table from the EU remains unacceptable.
“The Prime Minister will leave no stone unturned in this process, but he is absolutely clear: any agreement must be fair and respect the fundamental position that the UK will be a sovereign nation in three weeks’ time.”
The prime minister is expected to give a press conference or issue a recorded statement to update the nation once he finishes a call with Europe’s top official.
Johnson and von der Leyen have warned a no-deal outcome looks more likely than an agreement in the trade negotiations.
With Johnson describing a no-deal as “very, very likely”, the British government has stepped up preparations for crashing out of the single market when transition arrangements end on December 31, with Johnson taking personal control of ensuring the country is ready.
He is leading a ‘Super XO’ committee to oversee preparations as ministers look to ensure food, medicines – including coronavirus vaccines – and other critical goods can continue to reach the country uninterrupted next year.
In a move likely to incense EU leaders, a government spokesman revealed the UK had “run live exercises” that involved scrambling “naval vessels to respond to threats of illegal fishing in our soon-to-be sovereign waters” as part of readiness efforts.

It followsconfirmation from the Ministry of Defenceyesterday that four Royal Navy gunboats have been placed on stand-by to guard British waters from EU trawlers if there is no agreement – an announcement that has been greeted with anger by some senior Tories.
Reports also suggest ministers are considering beefing up Navy powers in legislation to authorise them to board and arrest fishermen found to be contravening post-Brexit rules.
Fisheries
Brussels has called for the status quo on fishing rights to continue for 12 months in the event of no-deal – a request that appears to have been rejected after the Government revealed plans to scale up patrols.
Johnson, in a speech at a climate change summit yesterday, appeared to take a dig at French President Emmanuel Macron over the fishing row.
Macron is said to have threatened to veto a UK-EU deal after expressing dissatisfaction at the new quota terms being thrashed out for French fishermen.
In his closing remarks, Johnson thanked the summit co-host Macron, adding that he knew the president “shares my keen interest in protecting the ecosystems of our seas”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-boris-house-of-commons-mp-vote-4942590-Dec2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Dec 2019
UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson’s Brexit Withdrawal Bill has passed the House of Commons, setting a timeline for the UK’s exit from the EU next month.
The second reading of the bill was passed with a majority of 124, 358 votes to 234, demonstrating the changed parliamentary circumstances following Johnson’s landslide general election victory last week.
Johnson’s previous efforts at passing his deal were frustrated by the numbers in parliament and his predecessor Theresa May also failed to pass a Withdrawal Agreement.
Parliament will now break for Christmas and the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill will return to the House of Commons to be debated between 7-9 January.
The bill will then move to the House of Lords for approval before receiving Royal Assent. This successful passage of the bill would pave the way for Brexit on 31 January.
Speaking as the House of Commons began debating the bill earlier this morning, Johnson said that the UK should “move on” and discard the Brexit “labels” of Leave and Remain.
Instead, Johnson said the county needed to “move forward and speak together”.

Johnson was speaking as the House of Commons began a debate on the bill.
In last week’s election, the Conservative party secured a landslide win and now commands an 80-seat majority in parliament.

Introducing the bill, Johnson said it was time to move on from the Brexit debate.
“Now is the moment as we leave European Union to reunite our country and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share for our European neighbours to find renewed expression in one great new national project of building a deep, special and democratically accountable partnership with those nations we are proud to call our closest friends,” he said.
The UK Prime Minister compared the rivalries implicit in the Brexit debate to Gulliver’s Travels and Romeo and Juliet.
“Because this bill and this juncture in our national story, Mr. Speaker must not be seen as a victory for one party over another or one faction over another,” he said.
“The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on the 31st of December next year with no possibility of an extension,” Johnson added.
Johnson’s ruling out of an extension to the Brexit transition period has led to some surprise in Brussels with EU chief negotiatorMichel Barnier among those expressing skepticismthat a trade deal can be agreed before the period ends.
It raises the prospect of a no-deal break occurring at the end of 2020.
Focusing on what Labour says is its concerns with the bill, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said earlier today that it represents “a terrible deal”.
“We warned before the general election, the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal was a terrible deal for our country. And we still believe it’s a terrible deal today.  It will not protect or strengthen our rights or support our manufacturing industry, or our vital trading relationships or protect our natural world in a time of unprecedented climate crisis,” Corbyn said.
In recent days, Boris Johnson has faced accusations he had “binned” his withdrawal deal compromises in favour of a hard Brexit as MPs prepare to vote on his exit terms.
Critics on the opposition benches said Johnson had “binned” his pre-election compromises on protections for workers and child refugees now that he had been “unbridled” by his crushing win at the polls.
The government, as part of a re-drafted Brexit Bill, looked to have rowed back on an original commitment to strike a deal with the EU so child refugees in Europe can continue to be reunited with their families in the UK, even after free movement ends.

Clause 37 of the Bill replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to “make a statement” on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete.
Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, told the Guardian: “The Tories have torn-up the protections for workers’ rights and child refugees – and watered-down Parliament’s role in the next phase of the Brexit negotiations.”
“It was a bad Bill before the election, and it is even worse now,” Starmer said.
A host of other changes were made to the Brexit Bill since it was last before the Commons in October.
Johnson has inserted a clause that will legally prohibit his government from extending the transition period – the 11-month buffer during which his team will look to negotiate a trade deal with Brussels – beyond 2020.
The legal text will also boost the power of UK courts, giving judges the ability to overrule judgments made by the European Court of Justice.
If passed by MPs, the Brexit Bill will return for its final stages in both the Commons and the House of Lords in the New Year before achieving Royal Assent.
The timetable paves the way for the UK to leave the EU by the 31 January deadline and for trade talks to commence.

https://www.the42.ie/irish-football-brexit-2-5307749-Dec2020/,"AFTER ALMOST TWO years of major internal upheaval, the world may be about to change Irish football from the outside, too.
With Britain transitioning out of the European Union, their football clubs have had to reassess how they recruit players from the EU, including Ireland.
Under Fifa’s rules, clubs can’t sign a player from another country until they turn 18, but there’s an exemption for transfers between one EU country and another. In that instance, players can move when they are 16 once the purchasing club makes a provision for education.
This EU exemption has lighted the well-worn path across the Irish Sea for youngsters for years, and leaving for the UK from 16 has been the surest path to senior international honours for Irish players for generations.
Between 30 and 50 players aged 16 or 17 are estimated to move from Ireland to UK clubs every year, and this has been the avenue even for the freshest batch of Ireland’s top talent, including Troy Parrott (Tottenham), Caoimhin Kelleher (Liverpool), Adam Idah (Norwich), Jason Knight (Derby County), Aaron Connolly and Jayson Molumby (both Brighton.)
But now it may all be about to change. We saymayas this is Brexit we’re dealing with: nothing is ever quite clear-cut.
Indications early this month were that the Republic of Ireland would fall into line with the rest of the EU when it came to sending young players to the UK, and players could not move until they turn 18.
Troy Parrott.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
Some had hoped Irish youngsters would get the same exemption as those over the age of 18, under the Common Travel Area (CTA), an agreement between the Irish and British governments that is separate to the EU and allows citizens to move freely between and enjoy rights within both jurisdictions.
But this is Fifa’s call, and so far, it seems they are sticking with their own rules and not exempting Irish youngsters under the CTA.
A senior English Football League source toldThe42there is no exception for young Irish players, and earlier this month the sports law firm Mills & Reeve reported a Fifa Council meeting on 4 December made no exception for the Republic of Ireland.
But it’s not a done deal. Some UK clubs have continued efforts to recruit in Ireland as normal, and an FAI spokesperson says Fifa have told them the debate is “by no means closed.”
If it does take effect, it will be a profound change for Irish football. Players can still move at 16, though to clubs within the EU – which in itself would be a major cultural change for Irish football – while some in the game believe the UK clubs with EU feeder clubs (like Manchester City and Brighton) will use them to recruit and hothouse EU talent.
If neither of those avenues are pursued, Irish football will be charged with providing for its very best talent for an additional two years, which brings ample opportunities along with fraught challenges.
The UK academy system is absurdly tough and competitive: author Michael Calvin calculated that just 1% of English kids who join academies from the age of nine go on to make a living in the sport.
The League of Ireland is filled with twentysomething-year-olds getting over the disenchantment bred by a difficult spell in England, and that our most talented players would now be going over with more maturity and a solid education behind them is an advantage of this potential new world.
“There are benefits: you’re physically stronger and mentally more mature”, says Patrick Conliffe, head of football agency, Quantum Sport Ireland.

“A 17-year-old who breaks into a League of Ireland first team is probably at more of an advantage than a 17 year old playing U18 or U23 league football in England. There’s no substitute for playing competitive men’s football.”
Those potential positives, however, are dwarfed by the present challenges.
“We don’t have a football industry in this country”, says Alan Caffrey, Head of Youth Development at Saint Kevin’s boys. “Most of the clubs aren’t full time, so if your first team aren’t full-time then you won’t have a full-time schoolboy section with full-time coaching staff at academy levels.
“There has been a lot of talk on social media that the Brexit ruling will be good for Irish football, but we’ll see about that. I don’t think it will. We’re in hard times with the senior international team at the moment, but that will be nothing like what it could be like five years’ down the line.”
Will Clarke is Academy Director at Bray Wanderers, and he says the current structures are not adequate to produce a generation to match those currently breaking into Kenny’s senior international team.
“I don’t think we do at the moment, to be honest with you. We just aren’t set up at the moment to give those kids a chance of developing. While in the short-term we are okay with the [players born in] ‘99s, ’00s, ’01s, but go to the ’03s and younger and I think we are in a little bit of trouble.”
It’s a money problem: Irish football just can’t cope with the chasm to the elite academies of the English Premier League. To qualify for the top Category One status, for instance, English academies must have a minimum of 22 full-time academy staff. That’s more than twice the total full-time academy staff across every club in Ireland.
“Contact time is a big thing”, says Clarke. “There are no full-time academies here for us. A typical week here at U15, U17, and U19 level would be to train three or four evenings a week and then have a game at the weekend. You’re probably looking at around six hours contact time a week for our players who are based here. In the UK you’ll have at least 15 hours contact. English clubs take a multi-disciplinary approach to things, so they have their coaching on the pitch but also an S&C programme, analysis, feedback. Here, we are trying to cram everything in as best we can into three or four evenings a week.
“It’s always struck me as to why they [players at UK academies] were better technically than us, and it’s because they have far more time to concentrate on the basics that we do. Here, because we are trying to cram everything in, sessions can be very generic.
“As an example, I’m taking an U17 team in Enniskerry tonight, we have an hour and a half on half an Astro. I’m putting on a generic session to accommodate 20 kids. The session will be fine and will run well, and the kids will get lots of the ball. But you need to take the time to make it really specific, ‘Okay, we will do some work with our full-backs here, and work with our strikers here.’
“That just takes time. That was one of the biggest learning curves for me. When you go to the UK you’re expecting the sessions to be really top class, but it’s not even that, it’s that they spend more time trying to master the basics. They have more time to concentrate on the individual as opposed to concentrating on the team.
“We are very lucky with the quality of people we have working in youth development in this country, but because it’s not their sole focus, you don’t have enough time and sessions to work with individuals, so that leads to more generic sessions.
“We’ve known that Brexit has been coming down the road, all of a sudden now it’s imminent and we still haven’t put anything in place to compensate for the level of football education kids would receive in the UK compared to here. I hate saying that, but that’s the reality.
“To be fair to the likes of Shamrock Rovers and everyone else, anything positive that has happened has been club-led. It hasn’t been led by the Association. I wouldn’t criticise anyone, but that’s just the fact of the matter.”
The FAI haven’t been able to implement any specific provisions for the potential Brexit challenge as the new regime have spent much of their time and money reckoning with the lousy legacy they inherited from the Delaney Days.
Delaney’s outlook on the Brexit issue was revealed ina 2018 letter to then-sports minister Shane Ross,asking the government to keep the exception for 16-year-old Irish players in mind when negotiating with London.
Now he’s gone and the FAI have greater concerns. They have carried almost €70 million of debts into 2020, and that’s before they account for the ruinous impact of the pandemic. The dysfunction of 2019 had a very direct impact on youth structures: the loss of half a year’s State funding saw money ring-fenced for Player Development slashed from €400,000 to €80,000.
At a time when Irish football should be moving on, it’s instead battling to stand still.
The FAI acknowledged the need to improve structures here when asked to comment for this piece, citing the importance of the Association’s Player Development Plan.
“The Association is conscious of the potential impact of Brexit on our young talent, our clubs and our international teams. To that end, the Player Development Plan is more important now than ever before. It is essential that the FAI continues to grow and improve our academy structures here at home, in association with our League of Ireland and schoolboy and schoolgirl clubs and affiliates, to ensure a clear pathway to the top for our young players. Together, we must also develop our relationships with the game in other EU member states so that there are real options in Europe for our under 18s.”

The Player Development Plan was unveiled in 2015 by High Performance Director Ruud Dokter, and included in it was the introduction of National U13, U15, U17 and U19 leagues along with the fraught and painful amalgamation of schoolboy and League of Ireland clubs to form academies to compete in those leagues.

A member of the Dutch football Hall of Fame, Dokter is well regarded by many at the FAI. He is credited with bringing cohesion to the underage international teams and his contacts book has greatly enhanced the FAI’s Coach Education Programme, which held up as one of the few stable sources of income for the FAI last year.
The FAI have had a battle to keep parts of the Player Development Programme together this year, though, with Gary Owens and Niall Quinn talking the Dublin District Schoolboy League (DDSL) out of a planned revert to 11v11 from 9v9 at U12 level.
Dokter has put a few noses out of joint during his time, and the Schoolboy Football Association of Ireland informed the FAI of a motion of no confidence in him when it emerged this year that Dokter was set for a contract extension.
One of the issues has been a lack of direct contact and engagement with the various grassroots on Dokter’s part, with some long-serving schoolboy coaches feeling disenfranchised in the fusion with League of Ireland clubs.
A lack of consistent engagement has been an issue at academy level, too: the last time Dokter met with all academies at the same time was more than two years ago, in October, 2018.
Though the academy structure in Ireland desperately needs money, Clarke pinpoints a couple of ways in which they can improve without the need for investment. One is that the FAI introduces specific, objective criteria to audit the performance of individual academies.
“It beggars belief”, says Clarke. “If you look at every academy system in Europe, clubs are audited based on their work. That’s how they receive funding. If you’re doing a good job, the Association will give you X amount, and they won’t give as much to those not doing a good job. Until that auditing system is in place and we have criteria in place, it’s all subjective.”
Regardless of whether the Brexit ruling takes effect or not, Clarke also wants the FAI to extend registration periods for underage and amateur players by at least one year, so as to give academies a better chance of making more money. Players are currently only registered for a year a a time, which leaves clubs shortchanged if they can’t sign the player to a professional contract.
“If our best kids are going to England at 16, we need to come up with a mechanism to make sure we have a kid registered for two years, and are registered for their 16th birthday and their 17th birthday.
“So when Liverpool come knocking on Shamrock Rovers’ door looking for a player because he’s 16 now, at least if he has 12 months left on his registration period it gives Shamrock Rovers leverage to turn around to Liverpool to say, ‘Well he’s still registered with us for another 12 months so if you want him now, you’ll have to pay additional money.’
Gavin Bazunu in action for Shamrock Rovers' first team in 2018.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
“The reason Rovers got money for Gavin Bazunu is because they sold Gavin as a professional to Manchester City. That’s what allowed them to generate €500,000. If Gavin hadn’t signed a professional contract with Shamrock Rovers then they would only have been entitled to the Uefa compensation, which would have been roughly €150,000.
“If you look at the Irish players breaking through – Parrott, Knight, Connolly, Idah, Nathan Collins, Molumby – there are probably 20 Irish players who are 18 or 19 and are playing either first-team Championship football or on the fringes of Premier League squads. If that was any other country in Europe people would be saying, ‘Jesus, what’s going on in Ireland? They are obviously doing something right.’
“But we are developing all of these players with little or no resources and we are not getting the value we deserve for it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/impact-of-covid-19-and-brexit-on-irish-economy-5206647-Sep2020/,"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC means a hard Brexit could impact the Irish economy worse than previously feared, according to a new study.
However, the research has found that no sector is severely exposed to both the shocks of the pandemic and a hard Brexit.
Research released today by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and the Department of Finance looks at the impact both shocks could have on the Irish economy.
In a statement, the ESRI noted the pandemic continues to have “a major impact” on the Irish economy.
“In addition, the risks of a hard Brexit without a free trade agreement by the end of the year appears a real possibility.

“While the potential economic impacts of Brexit have been substantially overshadowed by the COVID-19 crisis, layering a hard Brexit on an economy dealing with COVID-19 could make the previously estimated effects of Brexit worse.”
The research has found there is limited overlap between the sectors at risk from a hard Brexit and those currently being most impacted by Covid-19.
Each sector is ranked in terms of its exposure to each shock using three categories: severely affected sectors, moderately affected sectors and unaffected sectors.
The research notes the sectors worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic were wholesale and retail trade; accommodation and food services; construction and industry.
The report notes: “Using estimates based on modelling trade barriers in goods and services, we find that these sectors are fairly limited in terms of their exposure to Brexit.
“The industries Brexit trade barriers would be expected to most strongly impact include agriculture, food and traditional manufacturing as these are all highly reliant on the UK as an export destination. Financial services are also potentially highly exposed to changes in market access between the UK and EU.”

Impact on supply chain
The research states that no sector was found to be in a category that is severely exposed to both the Brexit and Covid-19 shocks.
However, it adds “some sectors did fall into the category of being severely exposed to one shock and moderately exposed to the other, a combination that does leave them at some risk if the two shocks are combined”.
The research also notes the ranking of risk exposure is at a sector level and that impacts on individual firms may differ from this.
The study also looked at supply chain links to examine how sector risks could end up affecting suppliers and purchasers more widely, and found limited exposure of sectors most impacted by Covid-19 being further hit by Brexit.
Martina Lawless, author of the report and a research professor at the ESRI, said: “Overall, these findings suggest that adding the Brexit shock to that of Covid-19 brings a wider range of sectors exposed to economic risk but that they do not layer further substantial risks onto those sectors that have already taken the largest Covid-19 hit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-where-are-we-now-5088017-May2020/,"WE THOUGHT THAT Brexit was an unbelievable, fantastic tale of twists and turns, but it’s been utterly eclipsed by the Covid-19 pandemic – a global moment that could remould our lives and societies.
But Brexit hasn’t gone to ground either, and the processes to make it a reality have been ticking away quietly in the background. At the moment, there’s still a deadline – of 30 June – by which the UK will have to decide if it’s asking for an extension to the time frame for arranging a trade deal with the EU.
Incredibly, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to entertain the idea of extending the transition period, despite a Covid-19 pandemic sucking up government resources.
Almost 50 of the UK’s top civil servants have been taken off the Brexit trade negotiating team, and instead redeployed to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic response in the UK.
Despite this, senior minister Michael Gove has said he would put the chances of securing a free trade agreement between London and Brussels at “better than two to one”.
The trade deal is going to be integral to the UK’s post-EU future: how easy will it be for British companies to export to EU member states? What tariffs will there be on exports into the UK, which Irish companies will be keenly watching?
How strict will customs arrangements be for Northern Ireland, which will ultimately answer the question of whether there will be a hard border down the Irish Sea?
Northern Ireland
Speaking to a Select Committee on the future relationship with the European Union and on post-Brexit negotiations this week, Michael Gove, a UK Cabinet minister who is tasked with Brexit preparation in the UK, was asked why Johnson’s government has opposed an EU office in Northern Ireland.
The EU Commission has requested a technical base in Northern Ireland in order to ensure its custom rules and standards are being adhered to after the transition period closes at the end of this year.
It was revealed last week that British cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt had written to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to reject the EU’s proposal for an EU Commission office in the North.

Speaking about that rejection, Gove said that it “is not necessary” to have a “mini embassy” in the North.
“We hope that we can reach an arrangement that we are doing everything required to make sure the protocol is being adhered to,” he said.
There is a lot we still don’t know about how the Northern Ireland protocol would work in practice – it depends on how close the UK-EU trading relationship will be, and what practice the special committee set up to examine this issue concludes.
For example, it was suggested that tax owed on products destined for Ireland/the EU would be paid to the UK, which would then pass it onto the EU; but it wasn’t clear how much oversight the EU would want, and whether it would need its own officials along the custom and regulatory Irish Sea border.
On this issue, Gove said:

“Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK, so while we’ll make sure the EU has all information it needs, these are checks that will have to be carried out by UK officials.”
Meanwhile, businesses in Northern Ireland are left in the lurch. As Wesley Aston, the CEO  of the Ulster Farmers Union told a UK committee this week:
Precious time
There are just two weeks of negotiations between the EU and UK on trade left.
On 15 April, the scheduled talks between Brussels and London were concentrated into just three weeks, on the weeks commencing: 20 April, 11 May and 1 June.
On the time left to agree a deal, Gove has said: “In some respects it (the outbreak) should concentrate the minds of the EU negotiators, reinforcing the importance of coming to an agreement.”
Michael Gove giving evidence by videolink to MPs during a UK committee about Brexit.PAPA
He said that although a lot has changed, some of the organisations arguing for extensions now, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, had argued for an extension before, “so that while things have changed, they also have not changed”.
“If we accept an extension, the incentive to come to an agreement would dissipate.”
Claiming that extending the transition period would cost “billions” of pounds, he said:
“We’re not going to extend the transition period,” he added definitively.
Other than that, how are negotiations going?
“They regard the UK not as a sovereign state, but on the path to EU membership.”
That is Gove’s impression of how negotiations are going.
The UK has been asking for an ‘off-the-shelf’ trade deal with the EU – instead of negotiating the tiny minutia of what will be allowed to be traded between the two, what will be subjected to high tariffs, and what regulations the two will need to be agreed, etc.
The UK is looking for a trade deal similar to Japan or Canada, if not a bit closer than that, and fishing arrangements similar to that with Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.
When asked how prepared the UK was for a no-deal situation, Gove said that because of the Withdrawal Agreement “there’s no such thing now as a no-deal situation”.
When questioned on what the final date was, whereby businesses would be told if there is to be no trade deal struck, Gove initially said that would be an unhelpful thing to do:
But when repeatedly pressured on it by MP Peter Bone, he eventually admitted:

SINN FÉIN’S JOHN Finucane has been elected MP for North Belfast, unseating DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.
Finucane, the current Lord Mayor of Belfast, was elected in the early hours of this morning.
The SDLPhad pulled outof the constituency to give Finucane and his remain-backing party the best chance of defeating the DUP.
The loss of Dodds, who is the party’s leader in Westminster, is a major blow to the DUP.

Finucane paid tribute to his father Pat Finucane, a solicitor who was murdered during the Troubles.
“I can’t help but think of my father and where we have come from, not just as a family but as a society as well,” he said
The success for Sinn Féin in Belfast caps a good few weeks for the party. In November, the party won the by-election in Dublin Mid-West after a poor showing at the European and local elections in May.
Sinn Féin had put poured significant effort into the constituency, with some campaigners coming from as far as Cork to back Finucane.
“I am absolutely very disappointed, not just for North Belfast, but also for Northern Ireland,” said DUP leader Arlene Foster in response to Dodd’s defeat.
“I think it’s clear the demography wasn’t there,” she said. “The pan-nationalist front has come to fruition again.”
Belfast South
In Belfast South, the SDLP’s Claire Hanna defeated the DUP’s Emma Little Pengelly.
Hanna, who was tipped to win after Sinn Féin pulled out from contesting the seat, campaigned as a strong Remain voice in Westminster.
Little Pengelly took the seat from the SDLP former leader Alasdair McDonnell at the last election in 2017 by only a few thousand votes.
The success is a significant boost for the SDLP, which found itself without any MPs after the 2017 election.
In Foyle, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also defeated Sinn Féin’s Elisha McCallion by 17,110 votes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-defends-brexit-deal-trump-criticism-4874712-Nov2019/,"
DOWNING STREET HAS defended its Brexit deal with the EU, after US President Donald Trump warned it would make it impossible for the two nations to strike a future trade agreement.
The president, whose impeachment in the US has moved a stage closer following a key vote in Congress, waded into the British election campaign yesterday to criticise Johnson’s divorce terms with the European bloc.
“This deal… you can’t do it, you can’t trade. We can’t make a trade deal with the UK,” he said.
But a Downing Street spokesman later said the deal would allow the UK to strike “our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit”.
Trump’s comments appear at odds with his previous pledge in September that he was working closely with Johnson to strike a “magnificent trade deal” once Britain left the EU.
The US president also launched a stinging attack on the country’s main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and urged Johnson to unite with eurosceptic hardliner Nigel Farage, a key figure in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership.

“Corbyn would be so bad for your country,” Trump told Farage during a phone interview broadcast on his talk show on British radio station LBC.
“He’d take you in such a bad way. He’d take you into such bad places.”
“I’d like to see you and Boris get together … I think it’d be a great thing,” Trump added.
Farage, whose new Brexit Party is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU without any deal in place, has urged Johnson to form an electoral alliance but has so far been rebuffed.
He is due to launch his party’s election campaign today.
‘Trump trying to interfere’
Within minutes of the interview airing, Corbyn shot back on Twitter that “Trump is trying to interfere in Britain’s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected”.
Johnson agreed new divorce terms with the bloc’s leaders earlier this month, ahead of the country’s scheduled departure yesterday.

But he was unable to push the plan through parliament and instead opted to hold a snap pre-Christmas election, blaming his Labour rivals for the latest Brexit delay and promising to now take the country out by a new 31 January deadline.
“If you vote for us and we get our programme through, which we will … we can be out, at the absolute latest, by January next year,” Johnson said during a campaign stop yesterday at a hospital.
The Conservative leader is riding high in opinion polls going into the 12 December vote that will be Britain’s third in four years.
But he risks a backlash over his unkept “do or die” promise to deliver Brexit on 31 October – and has again set himself up for another potential fall by promising to meet the next deadline.
Pro-EU campaigners and business executives have breathed a sigh of relief that Britain avoided a Halloween Brexit nightmare that could have seen it crash out of the EU after 46 years without a plan.

Chief executives of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Iceland, Co-Op and Marks & Spencer have written to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.
Depleted shelves have been seen in several supermarkets in the early days of the new year as trade from Great Britain has been affected while firms adjust to new requirements on moving produce across the Irish Sea.

Export health certificates are required for animal-based food products moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland as a result of the region remaining in the EU’s single market for goods.
With Northern Ireland also applying EU customs rules at its ports, customs declarations are needed on products being shipped in from the rest of the UK.
A UK Government spokesperson said: “A new dedicated team in Government has already been set up and will be working with supermarkets, the food industry and the Northern Ireland Executive to develop ways to streamline the movement of goods in accordance with the protocol.”
Northern Ireland is following some of the EU’s rules to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is part of the protocol which the UK agreed with Europe.
The UK Government added: “The grace period for supermarkets and their suppliers is working well, goods continue to flow effectively between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and we are working intensively with industry as new requirements come in.”

British PM Boris Johnson attempted to have his Brexit deal rushed through parliament in a bid leave the EU before the end of the month, but it was shot down by the House of Commons.
The alternative was to seek an extension to give MPs more time to ratify the agreement, and the date now being suggested is 31 January 2020.
Yesterday, Tusk recommended that the EU permit an extension to allow the passage of the bill in Westminster.

In a statement, it was confirmed that Varadkar spoke with Tusk this morning regarding the UK’s request for an extension.
“The Taoiseach confirmed his support for President Tusk’s proposal to grant the request for an extension which was sought by the UK.
“They noted that it would still be possible for the UK to leave before 31 January 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement has been ratified in advance of that date.”
It added the issue would likely be discussed at an EU committee meeting in Brussels tonight.
Johnson said last night that he would press pause on the WAB and that the EU would make a call on how to proceed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/business-and-covid-19-5118170-Jun2020/,"FOR IRISH BUSINESSES, the last few years could be summed up with one word: uncertainty. Since the Brexit referendum, Irish businesses have been unsure to what extent they will be affected.
Four years later, the global Covid-19 pandemic has shaken businesses to their core and changed the world as we know it. As the UK and EU negotiate a future relationship including a trade agreement to come into place in January, there is no guarantee of success.
If no trade agreement is reached, EU-UK trade will be governed by the terms of the World Trade Organisation. This would see tariffs rise sharply and would have a sizeable impact on both the economies of the UK and the EU.
Too close to call
Due to our exposure to the British market and our proximity to the UK, the Irish economy is incredibly vulnerable to any changes in the tariff rate. Over the past years, a huge amount of no-deal Brexit preparatory work was completed by Irish businesses to shelter them from any potential harm.
What no one expected, however, was that a global pandemic would strike and leaving Irish businesses even more vulnerable. With businesses seriously harmed by closures and reduced capacity, a no-deal Brexit would be nothing short of a disaster for Ireland.
Advertisement
In a potential no-deal Brexit scenario, any goods exported from the UK to the EU would be charged the EU’s least preferential tariff rate under the WTO’s most favoured nation rule.
The average tariff rate in the EU is 3.2%, although it varies dramatically. In agriculture, tariffs are on average 8.7%, though one in ten agricultural products have duties of over 25%. With the EU remaining the UK’s main trading partner, this scenario would do serious damage to both British businesses and the EU.
Food tariffs
Ireland’s beef sector relies heavily on the British market, with over half of Irish beef exported to Britain. Undercurrent proposalspublished this month by the British government, tariffs on food imports will be very high with the aim of safeguarding the British agricultural sector.
One option for the UK in a no-deal scenario would be to stop quality checks on imported EU goods. In order to do this, they would have to stop checking goods from every country.
This could lead to a serious drop in the quality of food, animals and electrical products and a favouring of cheap, potentially dangerous goods. In Ireland, we produce high quality, high-value food and products, any change in the valuing of this would be hugely detrimental to our economy.
Extend the talks
A no-deal Brexit and a global pandemic in the same year could be catastrophic for businesses in Ireland and Britain alike. An extension to the talks would give all businesses more time to get their finances in order following this crisis and allow them to prepare for the next.

It would crucially also allow for negotiators to engage properly in the matters at hand. Negotiating a deep trade deal in a short period was always going to be an uphill battle, doing so in an even shorter period of time, via video conference amidst the fall out of a pandemic is an even greater challenge.
The past few weeks have shown us the resilience of the Irish people and businesses in a crisis. We have been quick to adapt to our new normal. This will serve us well as we move forward.
Irish and British businesses are once again facing an uncertain future, one that can be averted should the British Government do the right thing and request an extension to these talks.

BORIS JOHNSON COULD walk away from trade talks with the European Union in June unless there is the “broad outline” of a deal.
The UK’s guidelines for the negotiations, which cover trade and other aspects of the future relationship with Brussels, sets the deadline for progress against a backdrop of deep divisions between the two sides over issues including fish, state subsidies and standards.
The government has set out its plans for the talks ahead of the first round of negotiations on Monday, making clear that it “will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life”.
It clearly states the UK’s intention to rely on World Trade Organisation terms under an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia’s if progress on a comprehensive deal cannot be made.
Whatever the outcome of the talks, businesses have been warned to expect friction at the border from 1 January because the UK will not extend the transition period and will, therefore, be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union.
A high-level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for June, by which time it should be clear whether the Canada-style comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) sought by Johnson is possible by the end of the year.
The negotiation guidelines envisaged the “broad outline of an agreement” by the June meeting, which would be “rapidly finalised” by September.
“If that does not seem to be the case at the June meeting, the Government will need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion.”
In the Political Declaration agreed by the Prime Minister and EU last year, the two sides agreed to work towards a deal “encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field”.

The EU’s mandate called for any agreement to use Brussels’ standards as “a reference point” over time – indicating that the UK could be expected to keep aligned with changes to the rules covering state subsidies, environmental standards and workers’ rights in future, something that would breach Johnson’s red lines.
Downing Street insiders indicated Johnson believes the mandate he won at the general election trumps the declaration, which does not have the status of a binding international treaty.
And they said Brussels had also moved away from the Political Declaration, pointing to the EU’s mandate published on Tuesday going far beyond the agreed terms on the “level playing field”.
Senior Cabinet minister Michael Gove told MPs: “The UK Government seeks a FTA with robust protections for the environment and labour standards.
“But we do not see why the test of suitability in these areas should be adherence to EU law and submission to EU models of governance.
He dismissed Brussels’ arguments that stricter measures are necessary because the UK is closer to the EU than countries such as Canada.
“Geography is no reason to undermine democracy,” Gove said.
In its document, the Government promises to carry out a consultation exercise on the “economic impact of the future relationship”.
But officials acknowledged that whatever the outcome of the talks, there would be friction in trade between the UK and EU.
The UK will be taking steps to prepare for the end of the year, with infrastructure at ports to ensure that checks can be carried out.
Leaving the single market and customs union would require these processes to be carried out, even with a Canada-style deal.
For goods and services crossing borders, there would be new processes in place – although the amount of friction could be reduced by a free trade deal.","7.24am, 27 Feb 2020",27 Feb 2020
https://www.thejournal.ie/bercow-brexit-4868650-Oct2019/,"A SENIOR GOVERNMENT minister in the UK has blamed Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for making it “very difficult” for Britain to leave the European Union in five days’ time.
Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said Bercow had given “unprecedented” powers to opposition MPs, allowing them the opportunity to pass the Benn Act, which demanded Brexit be delayed if a deal had not been ratified by 19 October.
The Prime Minister last week complied with the stipulations of the law by sending a letter to Brussels requesting an extension.
“I think it will be very difficult to leave on 31 October precisely because of the Benn Act, the surrender act, which essentially gave authority to the EU about whether we will leave on 31 October or not,” Mr Kwarteng toldBBC Radio 4’s Todayprogramme.
“It looks like they may well give us an extension.”
‘Foolish’
The Tory MP, who attends Cabinet, also defended a decision to mint hundreds of thousands of commemorative 50 pence coins branded with the 31 October date. The process has since been paused.
Kwarteng said: “I don’t think it looks foolish. I think it was a very sincere aim of the British Government to leave on 31 October.
Deliberations among EU ambassadors over a Brexit delay have continued into the weekend.
A final decision on whether they will opt for an extension until January or a shorter November delay – thought to be favoured by French president Emmanuel Macron – is not expected until Monday or Tuesday.

Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.
The weekend talks among the EU27’s teams are likely to be coloured by a leaked document, seen by the Financial Times, that indicates the government could look to diverge away from the bloc’s rules on workers’ rights and environmental protections after Brexit.
There are fears in some quarters of the EU – and especially in Berlin – that Boris Johnson is preparing to reform Britain into “Singapore-on-Thames”, a low-tax, lightly regulated economy on the edge of Europe, once it has left.
According to the FT’s report, the leaked Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) document said the way the political declaration – the agreement setting out the aims of the future trade negotiations between the UK and the EU – had drafted the workers’ rights and environmental protection commitments left “room for interpretation”.
‘Exaggerated’
Johnson this week told MPs the UK was committed to “the highest possible standards” on both sets of standards – a stance that helped to convince 19 Labour MPs to back his Withdrawal Agreement Bill at second reading on Tuesday.

Kwarteng called the reports “way exaggerated” and would be “completely mad” from the government’s perspective.
“It wouldn’t make any sense at all to dilute workers’ rights in building that coalition to land the bill,” he told the BBC.
The document is said to boast that “UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide level playing-field rules” in the previous deal negotiated by Theresa May’s team, allowing Britain to compete against EU members by possibly watering down rights.
Labour shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said the documents, which reportedly had Downing Street input, “confirm our worst fears”.
She said: “Boris Johnson’s Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up.”

The Prime Minister visited a hospital yesterday and used interviews afterwards to call on opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to “man up” and agree to a general election.
It follows the Conservative Party leader announcing on Thursday that he was prepared to give MPs more time to debate his Brexit deal in exchange for their support for a winter election on December 12.
Corbyn has so far said Labour is awaiting the EU’s decision regarding the length of an Article 50 extension before clarifying whether he would whip MPs to back a fresh poll.
But senior figures in the party have urged him to deny Johnson and instead continue to push for a second referendum and for a no-deal Brexit to be removed as an option.
Both Tony Blair, a former prime minister who won three general elections, and London mayor Sadiq Khan called for him to stand firm.
Khan, speaking to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, said an election prior to a referendum on a Brexit deal would be “confusing”.
The former MP said: “It’s simply not possible to have a general election on one issue.”
The Liberal Democrats, who have also ruled out agreeing to an election while no-deal is an option, look to have amounted a significant war chest to fund their upcoming campaign.
Business Insider reported that the party’s fund-raising board confirmed it had surpassed its £8 million target by raising around £11 million for the next general election – a record haul as leader Jo Swinson targets 80 seats in Remain-supporting areas.","1.16pm, 26 Oct 2019",

Speaking onthe BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Coveney gave a strong defence of the purpose of the Irish protocol, which is in threat of being breached by the UK government’s domestic Internal Market Bill.
Respondinga suggestion made yesterdayby UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the EU could blockade British food to Northern Ireland, Coveney said emphatically:
“There is no blockade proposed, and that is the kind of inflammatory language coming from No 10 which is spin and not the truth.
“That is the whole basis of the Northern Ireland protocol which the UK designed, along with the EU together to protect peace in Northern Ireland… and that the British government is now looking to renege upon, which is why you sense a frustration in my voice.”
Coveney said that Ireland was Britain’s closest neighbour and “arguably, your closest friend”.
This morning, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and European Council President Charles Michel spoke by phone about the diplomatic crisis that has seem the UK threaten to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, which was ratified in January, with a piece of domestic legislation.

Michel said that the leaders of the EU’s 26 other countries are all calling on the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol to be implemented in full by the UK.
Speaking on Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Justice Minister Helen McEntee said that trust had been “damaged” between the EU and UK. She said that the UK needed to withdraw the proposed bill and trade negotiations needed to resume.
The EU would not take action until the Bill had passed through the House of Commons and House of Lords, McEntee said.
Pressure on Johnson mounts
Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Johnson from his fellow Tory colleagues to withdraw the legislation in an attempt to save Britain’s diplomatic reputation.
Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the Andrew Marr that he would resign if international law is broken through this Bill.
It comes as two former prime ministers, John Major and Tony Blair, have called on Boris Johnson to drop the domestic legislation that threatens to undermine the Withdrawal Agreement in an opinion piece for the Sunday Times.
Major and Blair, the former Conservative and Labour leaders, united to condemn Johnson’s controversial UK Internal Market Bill.
“We both opposed Brexit. We both accept it is now happening. But this way of negotiating, with reason cast aside in pursuit of ideology and cavalier bombast posing as serious diplomacy, is irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice,” they said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-meeting-von-der-layent-brexit-transition-period-5122816-Jun2020/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is holding talks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in an attempt to inject new momentum into flagging negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal.
The high level meeting will take place by video conference call after the two sides agreed to an “intensified” negotiating timetable as the clock counts down to the end of the current transition period at the end of year.
It comes after the EU formally accepted on Friday that the UK would not seek any extension to the transition which allows Britain continued access to the EU single market while talks continue.
Johnson is expected to say that the talks need to be “swiftly concluded,” providing the public and business with certainty on the way forward by the autumn at the latest.
While he will insist the UK still wants to strike an “ambitious” free trade agreement, he is expected to make clear that it is ready to start trading on World Trade Organisation rules from 1 January if a deal cannot be reached.

Von der Leyen will be joined on the conference call by European Council president Charles Michel and the president of the European Parliament David Sassoli.
The Cabinet office minister Michael Gove and the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost will be with Johnson.
It will be followed by a series of weekly talks at official level for five weeks commencing 29 June looking at detailed technical issues.
It is hoped that they will for the first time in these negotiations include face-to-face meetings, with both sides acknowledging that the remote discussions, due to the coronavirus epidemic, have gone as far as they can.
Four rounds of video conferencing discussions made only limited progress with a series of major obstacles still to be overcome.
Mostly notably the two sides remain far apart on the issues of future access to UK fisheries and the so-called “level playing field”, the extent to which Britain is required to follow EU rules and standards in return for access to the single market.
The prospect that they will be unable to reach an agreement has alarmed business groups who warn that firms reeling from the impact of the coronavirus lockdown are ill-prepared to with a major upheaval in trading arrangements with the UK’s biggest trading partner.

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-huawei-4968024-Jan2020/,"EU TRADE COMMISSIONER Phil Hogan has said that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambition to get a full trade deal negotiated with Brussels by the end-of-year deadline is “just not possible”.
The former Minister, who is in the US at the moment, also said that threats from the US to stop sharing intelligence with the UK if it took a certain stance towards Huawei was “a bit for sabre-rattling”.
On Brexit, Phil Hogan has said that negotiators were “certainly” not going to be able to tie up everything on the future relationship between the bloc and the UK in the time frame.
The comments of Ireland’s EU commissioner came after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met with the Prime Minister in Downing Street last week.
Hogan said von der Leyen came out of that meeting thinking “we have to prioritise” on aspects of the agreement if the UK is to exit the transition period at the end of 2020.
“Certainly by the end of the year we are not going to get everything that’s in the 36-page document on the future relationship agreed because Prime Minister Johnson decided we are going to have everything concluded by the end of the year,” he said.
Johnson has repeatedly insisted the UK will not ask for an extension by the summer deadline to make that request.

Hogan said the EU was “certainly open to suggestions” on how to manage the situation politically but added that the “wisest thing” would be to not set deadlines.
“I think we’ve seen that putting ourselves into timelines in the last few years have not been that helpful, especially in the way it played out in the House of Commons,” he said.

Hogan made the comments to former EU trade commissioner Lord Mandelson at an event at the RSA in central London, where he was appearing on a video-link from Washington DC.
Hogan has been in the US discussing transatlantic trade with president Donald Trump’s representatives.
He advised that the UK can ignore American threats that it will not share intelligence if Britain accepts technology from Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G networks.
“I think that’s a bit of sabre-rattling. I don’t think that will actually happen at the end of the day,” Hogan told the Labour peer.
“I think everybody has an interest in making sure that we are safe and I think the United States … at the end of the day, you can call their bluff on that one.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-christmas-4904415-Nov2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is promising to bring his Brexit deal back to Parliament before Christmas if the Conservative Party is returned to power in the general election on 12 December.
Johnson will unveil the party’s election manifesto today with a pledge to open a “new chapter” in Britain’s history – ensuring the country is out of the EU by the end of January.
It will include a “triple tax lock” – guaranteeing the rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT will not rise under a re-elected Conservative government.
The Tories are also promising a £1 billion (about €1.2 billion) oost for after-school and holiday childcare with the aim of providing on-site childcare for 250,000 more primary school children over the summer.
The manifesto will commit £6.3 billion (€7.3 million) for energy efficiency measures to cut fuel bills for 2.2 million homes targeting social housing and “fuel poor” families, while maintaining the current energy price cap.
There will be a £3 billion (€3.5 billion) national skills fund as the first step towards creating a new “right to retrain”.
In a clear appeal to motorists, the party is promising the country’s “biggest ever” pothole-filling programme, with an injection of £2 billion (€2.3 billion) as part of the government’s national infrastructure strategy.

Johnson described his decision to re-introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) – ratifying his Brexit deal with Brussels – in December as an “early Christmas present” for voters fed up with the wrangling over Britain’s departure from the EU.
“As families sit down to carve up their turkeys this Christmas, I want them to enjoy their festive-season free from the seemingly unending Brexit box-set drama,” he said in a statement ahead of the launch event in the west midlands.
“The Conservative manifesto, which I’m proud to launch today, will get Brexit done and allow us to move on and unleash the potential of the whole country.”
January deadline
Although the Bill cannot complete its passage through Parliament before Christmas, the move will be seen as a clear sign of Johnson’s determination to get it through in time for Britain to leave the EU by the 31 January deadline.
Following the election, the new House of Commons is due to sit for the first time on Tuesday, 17 December.
The first two days are likely to be taken up with the swearing in of the new MPs, potentially with the State Opening and the Queen’s Speech on the Thursday.
That could mean MPs sitting the following Monday – the start of Christmas week – to allow the WAB to be formally introduced, although it is not clear whether there could be any further progress before the holiday.
MPs in the last parliament voted to back the Bill at second reading, but the prime minister withdrew it after they refused to support a timetable motion to fast-track it through the Commons in just three days.

Johnson said: “It’s time to turn the page from the dither, delay and division of recent years, and start a new chapter in the incredible history of this country, the greatest place on Earth.
“We have achieved amazing things together in the past, and I know we will achieve even more in the future – if only we choose the right path at this critical election.”
The announcement of the tax lock comes after Johnson said last week that the manifesto would include a commitment to raise the threshold for national insurance contributions.
Initially it will go up to £9,500 (about €8,600), saving 31 million taxpayers around £100-a-year (€116). However Mr Johnson’s suggestion it could rise to £12,500 (€14,500) – saving £500-a-year (€580) – is described as an “ambition” and it is unclear whether it will be met in the next parliament.
With older people traditionally more likely to go out and vote, the manifesto commits to maintain the pensions “triple lock”, winter fuel payments and the older persons free bus pass.
There is a commitment to end “unfair” NHS car parking charges for protected groups – including staff working night shifts, as well as disabled and terminally ill patients and their families.
On climate change, the manifesto simply sticks to the existing commitment to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 – a target seen as too weak by many environmental groups.
There will, however, be a ban on the export of plastic waste outside the OECD group of developed nations in an attempt to ensure less plastic is dumped in the oceans.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-breaking-law-5200862-Sep2020/,"HISTORICALLY, RIGHT-WING populist governments have been known to go to great lengths to conceal any contempt they may harbour for the rule of law – while gradually and quietly undermining it through domestic policy.
Their true intentions are often only revealed once those policies and political agendas are sufficiently ingrained into society.
That, however, is decidedly not the case with the British government this week, when Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, confirmed in the Commons that the proposed legislation under the Internal Market Bill would “break international law in a limited and specific way.”
Boris Johnson’s government chose to openly and proudly declare their ambitions to breach international law while in the process of negotiating international trade agreements. His government’s actions are culminating in what is – at best – an incredible act of political self-harm, or – at worst – the first steps toward becoming a rogue state.
It would seem that the UK government, in a bid to place British sovereignty above all else, have prioritised self-interest above that of its own citizens and its international obligations.
The day after Lewis’ remarks, when asked if he was content with breaking international law, Health Secretary Matt Hancock responded in the affirmative, purporting that the government was doing so “to protect the peace process”, referring specifically to the Good Friday Agreement – itself another international agreement. The term “doublethink” came to mind.
We are not pawns
In George Orwell’s foretelling masterpiece, 1984, doublethink was used as part of a large-scale campaign of propaganda and psychological manipulation of the public. The term is defined as the ability to hold two completely contradictory beliefs at the same time and to believe they are both true.
But accusing the British government of doublethink may be a bit too generous considering their habitually duplicitous practices, particularly around Brexit.
When Hancock followed up his audacious claims by stating “I choose peace” in Northern Ireland as reasoning for breaking international law, the very fact that our hard-fought peace is inherently grounded in the foundation of international law seems to have been lost on him.
From the perspective of an Irish citizen in the North, the use of that precious peace as an excuse to break from international norms is alarming and disingenuous.
The Good Friday Agreement is not a bargaining chip, it’s an internationally championed peace accord that brought hope to a region at a time when peace seemed impossible. The agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of the island of Ireland, North and South. Brexit, by contrast, was not.

We’ve been here before
Unsurprisingly, openly declaring an intention to beach international law by undermining the very agreement the UK negotiated and signed has resulted in spectacular political fallout.
Brussels is now warning that it may trigger sanctions if the British government does not abandon its plans by the end of the month.
The European Commission considers the unilateral move to be illegal and does not accept the argument “that the aim of the draft [internal market] bill is to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement. In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite.”
There are themes this week that are reflected inmy own case, where many of the rights-based provisions remain either misimplemented or unimplemented entirely.
I was born in Derry and won a case against the UK Home Office in 2017 after it had deemed that I was British when my US-born husband Jake applied for a residence card. I had identified as Irish, the only identity and citizenship that I have ever held.
I eventually withdrew my case after a significant concession from the Home Office that placed the GFA definition of a person of Northern Ireland into UK law for the first time and finally, accepted me as Irish.
The position the British government clung to throughout has highlighted serious shortcomings in their adherence to the Good Friday Agreement – and therefore their ability to be entrusted with upholding all commitments which they’ve signed in any accord they’re a party to – past, present, or future.
The majority of political parties in the north and south contended that their stance disregarded the Good Friday Agreement, but Britain nonetheless pursued the case for nearly half a decade.
They must be held to account
They conceded the case to us only when they were under political pressure and their fear of losing in the higher courts posed too great a risk.
There are clear parallels between the government’s argument in our case and those put forward by the Attorney General, Suella Braverman in relation to this plan to overwrite parts of the Northern Ireland protocol.

Both defences concern themselves with the supremacy of parliament and cite the recent case of Gina Miller – whochallenged the UKin the courts over various technical moves in relation to Brexit – as justification for breaching the UK’s obligations under international treaties. Neither holds up logically or legally.

Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt cited our case as “a reason for the absolute need for safeguards”, and whilst the unjust corruption highlighted by our case differs subtly from the recently addressed illegality of the UK’s current position, it was – for many – a harbinger of dangers looming on the horizon.
Ignoring the law
When our case began, the British government had two choices: amend domestic UK legislation in accordance with its obligations under international law, or repudiate them. Choosing the latter, the British government opted instead to try and rewrite their obligations unilaterally in lieu of implementing the provisions into law.
The difference between our case and the scandal surrounding the withdrawal agreement is that we were dealing with an unincorporated provision of a treaty, whereas the withdrawal agreement has been incorporated into domestic UK law.
Nevertheless, the government’s principal motive in both instances is the same: a bid to assert British sovereignty above all else, including signed treaties and international obligations.
There are many parliamentarians aghast at the British government’s proposal to breach international standards, after all – how could the UK reproach any other country for failing to adhere to standards it proudly breaks?
The irony here is that far from becoming more global, the UK is becoming increasingly more insular. The fallout from the UK’s attack on the rule of law is set to continue with Michael Gove rejecting the EU’s calls for the UK to withdraw the legislation, and Irish American leaders warning that any undermining of the Good Friday Agreement will have serious consequences in future trade talks.
One has to wonder- what does the British government believe they stand to gain from continuously pursuing such a reckless path? It’s hard to see how any Brexit deal can be reached when one side simply can’t be trusted.
Emma DeSouza is a citizens rights campaigner for the Good Friday Agreement and is Vice-Chair & NI spokesperson forVotingRights.ie. She recently successfully challenged the Home Office to assert her right to identify as Irish.

TheUK Treasury had said in Augustthat it was planning to mint “millions” of the coins with the Halloween date, which was to be the latest Brexit deadline after two earlier extensions.
Previous plans were for the coins to be produced for the original Brexit deadline of 31 March but as this date was extended the coins were never issued.
When Sajid Javid became Chancellor of the Exchequer in July, it was reported that production of the coins was to be ramped up so that they would be “ready to spend” by 31 October.

Johnson, who is spending New Year with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds on the private island of Mustique in the Caribbean, said the “first item” on his agenda remained his commitment to take Britain out of the EU by the end of January.
At the same time, he said that he was determined to be a “prime minister for everyone”, including the millions who backed Remain or did not vote Conservative in the general election.
“If you are one of them, I want to reassure you that I will be a prime minister for everyone, not just those who voted for me,” he said.
“I know that you love this country no less, simply because you voted for another party or wanted to Remain.
“More than that, I want to work with you, as friends and equals, as we build the future this United Kingdom deserves.

“The loudest message I heard during the election campaign is that people expect us – expect me – to protect and improve the NHS,” he said.
“The NHS is a wonderful British invention, there for us and our families when we are ill, whatever our background and regardless of ability to pay. So the NHS will always be my top priority.”
The Prime Minister said that he was also determined to make the UK “the best place on Earth” for “quality education and cutting-edge science”.
“Our vision is clear: to unite and level up across the whole United Kingdom – spreading opportunity more fairly – with better infrastructure, superb education and high technology,” he said.

A UK CABINET minister has admitted that trade talks with the European Union are in a “difficult phase” after Government sources suggested hopes of a deal were diminishing.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there were “a number of tricky issues” still outstanding, but stressed that the UK negotiating team was working hard to seal a deal.
His remarks came as reports suggested Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, would remain in London to continue talks over the weekend, having initially planned to travel back to Brussels on Friday.
The European Commission would not confirm Barnier’s weekend travel plans and said only that a “full day of negotiations” was expected on Friday.
Brexit talks are continuing today amid warnings the prospect of a breakthrough is “receding”.
Sharma, speaking to BBC Breakfast, confirmed that gaps remained between the two sides.
Fishing and the so-called “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on state subsidies and standards remain the main issues to be resolved in the talks.
“We are committed to reaching an agreement with the EU on this particular discussion that we are having,” he said.

Negotiations between the UK and EU seemed to stall yesterday – with Britain claiming Brussels was calling for fresh concessions at the 11th hour.
And with the Brexit transition period due to end on 31 December, there is little time to get a deal agreed by negotiators and approved by the EU’s leaders, Westminster and the European Parliament.
A senior UK government source said: “At the 11th hour, the EU is bringing new elements into the negotiation.
“A breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding.”
Fishing and the so-called “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on state subsidies and standards remain the main issues to be resolved in the talks.
European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer, asked for an update on fishing rights, told reporters in Brussels: “Today is still a day for negotiations, they are ongoing, so we can’t make any comments on the contents of what is being discussed.”
Earlier yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said there was a “good chance” of a trade deal.
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will press ahead with plans allowing ministers to tear up the Brexit divorce deal he has already agreed, despite the current round of UK-EU talks being at a critical stage.
The UK government will ask MPs to reinstate controversial legislation giving ministers the power to break international law by ignoring provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland.
MPs will vote on the UK Internal Market Bill on Monday, potentially throwing the talks on a UK-European Union trade deal into deep crisis unless an agreement can be reached by then.

The EU has already taken the first steps towards legal action over the legislation.
The UK government will also introduce the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill, which reportedly includes measures to override parts of the divorce deal struck by the Prime Minister and the EU in 2019.
MPs will be asked to reinsert the controversial Northern Ireland provisions into the UK Internal Market Bill after the Lords voted to remove them.
Meanwhile, Labour is split over how to respond to a deal if it reaches the Commons, with senior figures at odds over whether to support it or abstain.
Keir Starmer has confirmed there are differing opinions within the party on its approach to voting on a Brexit deal, but stressed that a trade agreement with the European Union was “in the national interest”.
And Labour former prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC’s Newscast podcast that “Brexit as a political argument is over” and that “there’s no point in raising (the) spectre” of a bid to rejoin the EU.
Blair said: “Brexit as a political argument is over, but you can’t pretend it’s not a big event that’s about to happen in practical terms and therefore short-term it’s going to be very challenging for the country, especially in combination with Covid.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/final-day-of-campaigning-kicks-off-as-threat-of-hung-uk-parliament-looms-4927013-Dec2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2019
BORIS JOHNSON STARTED the final day of campaigning with a photo-op that saw him  delivering milk, with the Prime Minister also entered a fridge to avoid a live TV interview.
Both the Conservative leader and Labour’s  Jeremy Corbyn are planning to criss-cross the UK as a fresh poll suggested a hung parliament could still be on the cards.
YouGov’sconstituency-by-constituency poll predictsthe Conservatives are on course for a 28 seat majority – but the margin of error and unknown impact of tactical voting means a hung parliament is still a possibility.
The pollsters, who have analysed more than 100,000 voter interviews over the past week, predicted the Tories will win 339 seats and Labour 231.
The poll was released last night with Johnson campaigning early this morning in the Conservative-held marginal seat of Pudsey in West Yorkshire, insisting he was “fighting for every vote”.
“This could not be more critical, it could not be tighter – I just say to everybody the risk is very real that we could tomorrow be going into another hung parliament,” he told reporters.
As Johnson was walking towards one of the milk vans at the photo-op, Good Morning Britain reporter Jonathan Swain attempted to speak to him and asked would he appear on the programme.
Johnson said he would before walking off towards a storage fridge.

Corbyn started his last day of campaigning in Glasgow South West – where Labour is hoping to overturn an SNP majority at the last election of just 60 – with a promise of “real hope” for voters affected by years of austerity.
“They need a UK government that will invest all across the country and give real hope and real security to people,” he said.
“That is the offer that Labour makes and we’ve carried that message all across the country during the last 51 days of this campaign.”
Last night’s Yougov poll narrowed its predicted Conservative win, more thanhalving a previous prediction made two weeks ago of a majorityof 68 to 28.
A 28-seat majority would be the best Tory result since Margaret Thatcher’s showing in 1987.

Chris Curtis, YouGov’s political research manager, said: “The margins are extremely tight and small swings in a small number of seats, perhaps from tactical voting and a continuation of Labour’s recent upward trend, means we can’t currently rule out a hung parliament.”
The result will be a worry to Johnson as he prepares for a final blitz across the country as the campaign enters its final full day, with Tory gains off Labour reduced from 44 to 29 since the November 27 findings.
The Tory leader told journalists at an event at JCB’s Cab Manufacturing Centre in Staffordshire yesterday he was “absolutely not” guaranteed victory on Thursday.
“This is a very close fought election and we need every vote,” he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson drives a Union flag-themed JCB, with the words “Get Brexit Done’ inside the digger bucket, through a fake wall.
Johnson will spend the final day of campaigning in Labour marginals in Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales, before finishing the day with a rally near London.
While the polls have improved for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, the haul of 231 seats would mean a loss of 31 seats compared to 2017’s outcome – its worst result since the 1980s.
According to YouGov, Labour could be set to make two gains, pulling off a Cabinet minister scalp by taking Chipping Barnet, the constituency currently held by Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is in trouble to the Liberal Democrats in Esher and Walton, while former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green is clinging on by only two points against Labour, the poll result indicates.
Putney could also go red but YouGov continues to predict a tough time for Labour in its heartlands in the North and Midlands.
Veteran MP Dennis Skinner’s Bolsover seat could be taken by the Tories, as could constituencies such as Great Grimsby, a Leave-voting town represented by Labour since the Second World War.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn joins a phone banking session with party activists at the Scottish Labour Party headquarters in Glasgow.
The SNP would win 41 seats – up by six – and the Liberal Democrats 15 if the prediction bears out.
Plaid Cymru would hold onto its four constituencies and the Green Party its one, while Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party would finish the election empty handed,  polling predicts.
YouGov uses multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) to form its predictions – a model that predicted 93% of constituencies correctly in the snap election two years’ ago.
The polling company first models voting preferences based on age, gender, education and previous votes, along with local political circumstances, before applying MRP, a technique which adds local factors and individual characteristics of each of Great Britain’s 632 constituencies to come up with its final result.

The poll results followed a day full of twists and turns on the campaign trail in which:
Ashworth was recorded saying the situation facing Labour was “abysmal” because voters “can’t stand Corbyn” and think the party has “blocked Brexit”.
He told LBC radio during an evening phone-in on Tuesday that he had been “taking the piss” with his friend.

Corbyn is expected to tour the Midlands and Yorkshire on Wednesday in a final attempt to deny the Tories an overall majority.
In a hard-hittinginterviewwith Sky News, Dave Merritt – father to 25-year-old son Jack who died alongside Saskia Jones, 23, in the attack by Usman Khan during a prisoner rehabilitation near London Bridge last month – accused Johnson of having “exploited” the tragedy.
Johnson did not back down in the aftermath of the interview, however, instead telling the Daily Telegraph how he would look to extend jail terms for violent criminals.
He told the right-leaning newspaper the justice system “isn’t delivering” and that it was still “too weak” when handling the worst offenders.
Johnson also revealed the six-weeks of living on the road during the campaign had taken its toll more than just politically.
He told a Sun-reading family in marginal seat Darlington: “I am so fat, I must lose weight”.
The Prime Minister also hinted he could propose to girlfriend Carrie, telling the Parker family he was “very happy” with the 31-year-old.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-deal-progress-5300053-Dec2020/,"POST-BREXIT TRADE deal negotiations between the UK and European Union are continuing in Brussels amid reports that progress in the talks could see a deal agreed this week.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is said to have told diplomats the UK had moved towards the bloc’s demands on the level playing field, according to the Daily Telegraph.
It said Barnier told ambassadors the UK accepted a “rebalancing mechanism”, meaning it could face tariffs if it moves too far away from EU rules.
The Guardian reported that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said there had been “movement” and talks were “on the very last mile”.
Negotiations between the two sides were extended on Sunday after Boris Johnson and von der Leyen agreed to continue the process despite major differences remaining.

Barnier updated diplomats from the 27 EU states about the progress before resuming negotiations with his UK counterpart Lord Frost on yesterday.
Negotiations will continue in the Belgian capital on today.

For months the talks have been deadlocked on the issues of fishing rights, the “level playing field” to ensure neither side can unfairly compete with the other on environmental standards, workers’ rights or state subsidies, and the legal mechanisms to govern any deal.
Barnier said the “next few days” are important if a deal is to be in place for 1 January.
“It is our responsibility to give the talks every chance of success,” he said.
“Never before has such a comprehensive agreement (trade, energy, fisheries, transport, police and judicial co-operation etc) been negotiated so transparently and in such little time.”

A spokesman for the grouping of EU ambassadors said there is “full support for the resilient and persistent” negotiating team led by Barnier.
The UK’s current trading arrangements with the EU expire at the end of the month, meaning any new deal would have to be in place by 1 January.
If not, tariffs and quotas will apply and bureaucracy will increase, causing further damage to an economy already ravaged by coronavirus.
The need for any deal to be approved by the UK Parliament means talks cannot continue until New Year’s Eve, but MPs are braced for the prospect of sitting over the festive period.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-optimistic-over-brexit-trade-deal-5286785-Dec2020/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson remains “optimistic” that Britain can get a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said amid warnings talks with the EU have reached a “make or break” point.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has briefed ambassadors from the 27 member states on the latest negotiations amid little sign of progress on the key issues.
He was said to have warned that significant differences remain over fisheries, state aid rules and the governance arrangements for any agreement.
The German MEP David McAllister, of the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordination group – which also met Barnier, said they had reached a “critical moment” in the negotiations.
He said agreement needed to be reached “within very few days” if the parliament and the member states were to complete the necessary “procedures” before the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of the year.

“This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework,” he tweeted.
The Prime Minister’s press secretary Allegra Stratton said Johnson still had the “greatest confidence” in the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost.
However, she said that he remained “comfortable” that Britain would continue to thrive if it failed to get an agreement and was forced to move to dealing with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms.
“The talks are right now ongoing and he has greatest confidence in David Frost and the team,” she told a briefing for Westminster reporters.
“He is optimistic but he has also always said that’s he is confident and comfortable that we would be okay without a deal.
“If a deal can be struck that is all to the good but he is also confident that we can move towards trading on what he calls Australia terms.”
Fishing rights

While both sides have acknowledged that time is running out, there has been no sign that either is prepared to make a decisive move that could resolve the issue one way or the other.
French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday sounded a warning that he would not accept an agreement that “would not respect our interests in the long term” amid concerns in Paris that Barnier is preparing to give ground over fishing rights.
Stratton meanwhile said no consideration had been given to any possible resumption of trade talks with the EU next year if they fail to reach agreement by 31 December.
“We have a negotiating team working really hard right now to get a deal and until it is clear that they have or haven’t that is not something anybody in this building is thinking about,” she added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-fishing-brexit-5332523-Jan2021/,"IRISH FISHERMEN ORGANISATIONS said today that they did not need the sympathies and kinds words of TDs and politicians, but action if the Irish fishing industry is to be saved.
The EU is telling Irish fishermen they are being “put out to pasture and future generations too”, CEO John Ward of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation told the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee today.
Due to the Brexit deal, one in four fishermen are being pointed at and told their job is gone, “not because the fish is not in our waters but because we have to give them away for the benefit of others”, he said.
The committee was told today that the government is to set up a task force involving seafood industry stakeholders to work out how to best support the sector and the local coastal communities.
While the groups welcomed the news, they said action is needed in the here and now due to the upfront cut to their stocks of around 60%.
The reductions across the different stocks will be felt immediately by Irish fishing industry when the full annual quotas for 2021 are determined in March.
“If it this goes ahead as we fear, this is going to lead to job losses,” said Ward.
“We can’t have a fishing industry that doesn’t have enough fish to catch,” he added.
In 2006, Ward said there were 280 Irish vessels registered, and there are just 164 registered now. How many of these will have to be sacrificed, he asked.
“These are real jobs, real people and real communities,” he said, stating that if no changes are made now, it will mean the closure of many Irish coastal communities.
Decimation of coastal communities
Seán O’Donoghue of the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation said the Brexit deal saw a British windfall that essentially consists of a staggering €42 million of Irish fish.
“This is a completely disproportionate hit when compared to the eight other EU coastal states. €26 million of this relates to our vital, highly-valued mackerel catch while Dublin Bay prawns – our second most valuable fishery – is set to hemorrhage €7 million,” he said.
“Alas, the injustice doesn’t stop there. We have taken a very heavy loss in our whitefish stocks (cod, haddock, whiting monkish and megrim), particularly in the waters off Donegal and in the Irish Sea as well as a massive cut of 96% of Irish Sea herring,” he added.

Ward said said future generations will not be able to enter the sector due the narrowing of the stock and capability for fishermen to make a living.
‘Very bad deal’
O’Donohoe said the task force cannot be a “talking shop” as this”very bad fisheries deal is hitting us here and now”.
The fishing sector will not accept it is a decommissioning of vessels, “we are decommissioning communities”, he said.
“Our first priority here is we need to to get our fish back that we unfairly lost in the trade deal – it has to come from the other member states as we cant get it from the UK,” he said.

Any financial package for fishermen, such as a fund for €100 million, “is just peanuts”, said O’Donohoe.
“We are begging at this stage,” said Ward, who appealed to ministers and TDs at the committee to make progress urgently.
Agriculture, Food and the Marine Minister Charlie McConalgue told the committee today that analysis of reduction of fisheries quota shares document shows that Ireland contributed approximately 15% of the total value of our 2020 fisheries quotas to the Agreement.
“For other Member States this figure is considerably less,” he said.
“The quota transfers required of Ireland are clearly disproportionate and the outcome is inequitable, in terms of burden sharing,” added the minister.
He said he met with Michel Barnier, the EU Fisheries Commissioner Sinkevičius and the Ministers of the Fisheries Group of eight Member States on fisheries related matters post-Brexit yesterday.
“At the meeting, I made it clear that Ireland considers that the transfer to the UK involves a very high share of some of our most important stocks.
“I pointed out that within the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland contributes by providing rich fishing grounds for EU Member States and our Exclusive Economic Zone provides spawning and nursery grounds on many of the core stocks,” he said, adding that he made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing “to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly”.
The minister said a mechanism must be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/corbyn-election-labour-resign-4931144-Dec2019/,"THE UK ELECTION result looks set to be the worst night for the Labour party this century and is likely to herald the end of the Jeremy Corbyn era.
The exit poll, released at 10pm on Thursday night, suggests that the party’s Brexit strategy has failed miserably, with Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party predicted to gain a large majority.
Speaking on the BBC, shadow chancellor and Corbyn ally John McDonnell called the result “extremely disappointing”.
As for Corbyn himself, speaking after his re-election in Islington, he signalled that he would step aside after a “process of reflection” – not quite a resignation but an indication that his leadership is coming to an end soon.
Ahead of the election, the focus had been on the‘red wall’, a block of seats across the north of England that were traditionally Labour but largely voted Leave in 2016 – and whether voters could be tempted to vote Conservative.
While not all results are in, it does seem that Boris Johnson, with his none-too-subtle message of Get Brexit Done, has successfully breached that Labour wall.
The projected results – the worst for Labour since 1935 – suggest that Corbyn will be forced to resign, setting up a battle for the future direction of the party.
The rise and fall of Corbyn
Corbyn, a left-wing backbencher who has represented Islington North in London since 1983, was elected as leader of the party in 2015 on a surge of grassroots activism that rejected the New Labour tagline of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years.
It was a shift from ‘third way’ politics that few expected. For some Labour members, it was a long-awaited renaissance, while for many Blairites it was a fundamentally misguided mistake.
After surviving an attempt to remove him as leader, Corbyn headed into the 2017 general election with the polls suggesting his prospects were poor.
He didn’t win, but he also didn’t suffer the humiliating defeat many predicted.
Instead Labour won 40% of the vote and managed to deprive Theresa May of a majority.
There were hopes that the party would do one better this time and return to government for the first time since 2010.
However, as 12 December drew nearer, it soon became clear that the chances of a Labour majority were falling fast.

The Corbynmania of 2017 seemed to have largely dissipated, while the polls consistently predicted that the Conservatives would emerge yet again as the largest party.
The coming days will bring more analysis and discussion of what exactly went wrong, but even in the hours since the exit poll data was released, all indications suggest that the Labour’s Brexit gambit failed to pay off.
So what was that gambit and how did the party get it so badly wrong?
Labour had been hoping that a comprehensive, costed manifesto would win over voters. From promises of a ‘green new deal’ to a reinvigorated NHS, Corbyn had tried to fight the election on his party’s strengths, as opposed to Brexit.
But the challenge for the party was to satisfy two key constituencies – the young, urban voters who largely voted to remain and supported Corbyn personally, and the older working class communities in the north of England that voted to back Leave.
Blythe Valley, one of the earliest seats to declare a result, seemed to represent the nature of Labour’s problem. A forming mining community that had never elected a Tory candidate, tonight it flipped to hand the party a majority of several thousand.
Later, Workington – a key target Leave-voting Labour seat – fell as feared to the Tories.
Since 2016, the quandry had been clear, with both sides of the party trying to force Labour to adopt a clear position on an issue that had split the country.
Slowly, and against the better judgement of some more radical activists, the party shifted towards a more explicitly Remain position, going as far to promise a second referendum on a new Labour deal with the EU.
“We must fight with every fibre of our beings to say between now and 31 October, and afterwards if there is a general election, that any terms of departure, from any government, must go back to the British public for the final say,” Labour’s foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told her party conferenceback in September.
Still, Corbyn’s own opinion remained under scrutiny. Never a natural Europhile and indeed more of a EU sceptic, the Labour leader had promised to take a neutral stance in any future referendum.

It was an ambivalence his opponents had seized on and in recent weeks Corbyn had fixed on a soundbite to defend his position.
Repeatedly, he said that “the country has to come together”.
Tonight’s exit poll suggests that voters didn’t buy it.
Not just Brexit
Tonight, Corbyn and his allies were quick to blame Brexit.
Related ReadsUK exit poll: Conservatives set for huge majority and mandate for Brexit
Brexit, he said, “has contributed to the result the Labour party has received across this country”.
Still, he remained defiant: “The fundamental Labour message, about justice and equality in our society, will be there for all time.”
However, some MPs and candidates instead viewed Corbyn himself as the problem.
Scottish Labour MP Ian Murraytweetedon Thursday evening:
Gareth Snell, a sitting MP admitted live on the BBC that he would lose his seat – and suggested that Corbyn and O’Donnell should go.
His opponents have said the same. Former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne tonightcalled Corbynthe “handmaiden to a Boris Johnson landslide”.
Certainly, it was a difficult election for Corbyn. Accusations of anti-semitism and a sluggish response to the issue had dogged the Labour leadership for months, while the drumbeat of Brexit made it difficult for the party’s messages on the NHS and nationalisation to cut through.
More recently, Johnson had accused Corbyn of supporting the IRA – a claim that could have potentially cut throughwith voters.
Not just Corbyn?
While Corbyn and his leadership team will no doubt receive the major share of the blame, it’s also a fact that the ‘red wall’ was wobbling well before 2015.
Ahead of the election, Guardian journalist John Harris travelled across the UK talking to voters.
“Once a culture of industry, trade unionism and reflex Labour-voting had started to wane, people in post-industrial England felt increasingly cut off from politics,”he wroteat the start of December.
Now, the party will have to make a choice – whether to ditch Corbyn or Corbynism in general. And the option they’ll choose is not immediately clear.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-changes-5324709-Jan2021/,"WE ARE TWO weeks into the new Brexit checks needed for trade between Ireland and Great Britain after the UK left the EU’s Custom Union and Single Market.
In that time, we’ve seen empty shelves in Northern Ireland, trucks queuing to travel between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, and British companies such as DPD and Lloyds stopping their services to Ireland.
Though disruption was predicted, the scale or duration of it is still an unknown; a Department of Transport official said that it wasn’t clear how long it would take for traders to get used to new post-Brexit checks and systems.
The political deal for what would replace the UK’s membership of the EU was only struck on Christmas Eve, giving businesses and hauliers just 8 days to prepare.
TD and former president of the Road Haulage Association Verona Murphy told the Dáil this week that there had been “utter disruption” in the supply chain since the end of the transition period, with truck drivers being stuck in ports for up to five days.
“The consumer will pay a hefty price in their shopping basket if this is to continue, particularly those on low incomes,” she said.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said that the new infrastructure, systems and staff put in place to prepare for Brexit “are working as expected”, and they are working to resolve any issues that may be caused by businesses not logging paperwork before goods travel.
This is the ‘lasting change’ of Brexit
Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne toldTheJournal.iethat there has been no disruption to direct trade between the EU and Ireland.
But he said that there was “undoubtedly” less products coming into Ireland from the UK, which he is concerned about.
“We were told that there would be ‘lasting change’ after Brexit – that is what’s happening,” he said, asking businesses and hauliers affected to engage with Revenue and the HSE, as the volume of calls to those arms of State are not in proportion to the scale of the disruption.
It’s not yet clear whether disruption to trade between Ireland and Great Britain is businesses adjusting to new processes, or permanent delays to do with post-Brexit paperwork.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said that more than 70% of trucks are completing paperwork before moving goods, and are being ‘green-lighted’ to leave ports without checks.
“State Agencies are working 24/7 to ensure trade can flow to the greatest extent possible but industry also has to do its part to make this work,” the Department said. “The best way to ensure that goods as pass smoothly and efficiently as possible through our ports is to correctly complete the required paperwork in advance of moving those goods.”
It’s unknown how many deliveries are simply no longer being sent to Ireland due to the post-Brexit checks required.
It’s been suggested that some UK exporters were unprepared for the dramatic changes in processes post-Brexit, which has lead to some delays for hauliers.
Disruption due to the travel restrictions prompted by new Covid-19 restrictions, brought on by a surge in cases and the UK and South African variant, have also disrupted supply chains and transport routes.

About the deal
The Brexit trade deal struck by the UK and EU is viewed as a ‘hard Brexit’ – financial services in the UK cannot continue as they could before, for example, and Great Britain has left the Single Market and the Customs Union, as was the aim of the British negotiating team.
Northern Ireland is under the Irish Protocol for the next four years, after which the Stormont Assembly will vote on whether to keep the customs and trade agreements.
Supermarkets sending agri-foods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland havea three-month ‘grace period’from needing a health export certificate, which was agreed to try to help ease the bureaucratic burden placed on Northern Ireland in trying to keep it in the UK customs territory while remaining aligned to the EU’s Custom Union.
Retailers have warned that shops in Northern Ireland could face further problems in April unless the EU is prepared to extend this grace period.
What checks are required?

The European Union has strict health cert requirements for agri-foods – meat and dairy products, for example – and customs checks on third-country exports into any of its 27 EU member states. This is what is causing the majority of the delays.
Northern Ireland follows EU customs rules and imposes EU duties in some cases.
It carries out sanitary and phytosanitary checks on agri-foods, and regulatory checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Northern Ireland is also following EU Vat rules in relation to goods, but not services.
Import declarations and entry summary declarations are required for goods going from GB to NI, with “light-touch” infrastructure between the two regions to carry out physical customs checks.
‘Teething problems’
Boris Johnson admitted there are “teething problems” in the post-Brexit trade relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as industry experts warned there could be fresh shortages on supermarket shelves.
Westminster’s Future Relationship with the European Union Committeewas told that there are less ‘teething problems’ with imports to the UK than with exports.
This means that products being sent from the EU into the UK are travelling relatively seamlessly, while products going from the UK into the EU are being held up.
PA ImagesPA Images
Hauliers have given some insight into what the exact problems are with trade between Ireland and Great Britain.
Aidan Flynn, General Manager of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland said that it has been more difficult to get goods into Ireland than out.
He toldTheJournal.iethat the problems were mainly to do with the new ‘safety and security’ requirements, which document which goods are on what trailer. This information is mandatory to get a pre-boarding number that allows trucks to board ferries.
The problem is further compounded by a communications issue – a business exporting products may have several departments, meaning hauliers might be waiting for some time before knowing why they’re not being let through ports.
In a letter sent to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and the Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, the President of the Irish Road Haulage Association Eugene Drennan said that hauliers are now facing in excess of eight new checks or customs requirements since 1 January.
Related ReadsSupermarkets call for urgent intervention over Northern Ireland's food suppliesDutch officials confiscate ham sandwiches from UK visitorsWhy is Brexit impacting deliveries to Ireland, and what else is being held up?
The manner in which some of these requirements are being imposed is not practical and not working, he said.
Drennan said a requirement for hauliers to log onto the customs and excise website 30 minutes before arriving in Irish ports to see if they need to undergo an inspection is “deeply flawed and not working in practice”.
“It ignores technical and practical obstacles for drivers accessing the Revenue website as a vessel approaches Irish waters,” he wrote to both ministers.
In an interview with the Financial Times, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that some things have “changed for good” because of Brexit.
He said that other problems and “glitches” were to do with adapting to new systems.
“The Government is not stopping goods or undertaking checks for no reason,” the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement toTheJournal.ie.
“The checks in place are required to meet our obligations to the Single Market and to protect public health, food safety and product standards. Some businesses were experiencing a particular difficulty in lodging their ‘safety & security’, or ENS declarations.”
“Users of this temporary code are signalling to Revenue that they need support. An expert Revenue team is in place to ensure all businesses currently experiencing these difficulties can develop the capability to lodge a full ENS declarations.”
Are there food shortages?

Speaking at the Westminster Brexit committee this week, Andrew Opie, director of the British Retail Consortium asking for a slimmed down customs approach and a digitalised system:
“Frankly the problem remains that the European system is not easy to adapt to, it’s extremely complex. It treats every consignment as if it’s the first time you’ve sent it to that country…
In the same committee, Ian Wright of the Food and Drink Federation said food deliveries to Northern Ireland would possibly be limited because of additional checks:
“No one wants Northern Ireland to go from a colour TV to black and white.”
The First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said that it wouldn’t be a bad thing if more Northern Ireland products were used in supermarkets as a result of the new Brexit-related checks.
“…If they’re increasing the number of products from Northern Ireland in their supermarkets in Northern Ireland, I think that’s a really good thing actually because it shows that our produce is being able to take advantage of that,” Foster said on Wednesday.
“What I wouldn’t like to see is that consumers have a reduction in the number of ranges that they’re able to access and I think we’ve seen a little of that happening, and it’s something that we’ll be engaging with the supermarkets on.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rules-of-origin-eu-brexit-dairy-5279653-Nov2020/,"AFTER BREXIT’S ‘TRANSITION period’ ends on 31 December, Northern Ireland products and materials will no longer be considered as being of EU origin.
This could cause problems for all-island industries, particularly the dairy industry which represents one of Ireland’s most valuable exports.
Ireland exports 85% of all its dairy products – milk, cream, butter, cheese and baby formula – making it the 10th largest dairy exporter in the world. Milk, cheese and butterare worth€2.4 billion to the Irish economy while total dairy exports are worth €4.4 billion.
It had been highlighted previously that not having the highly regarded ‘of EU origin’ label on dairy products from the island of Ireland may damage the products’ value when exported abroad – particularly for powdered milk used as baby formula.
As reported previously,the Irish government has highlightedthat Northern Ireland products and materials won’t be of EU origin after 31 December.
A spokesperson said:
This wasn’t just for agri-foods like dairy and beef, but would include any products that are produced on one side of the border, but that source materials from the other side of the border.
Lorcan McCabe, a Cavan dairy farmer, toldTheJournal.iethat this would “pose huge problems” for the dairy sector.
McCabe, who is also deputy president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), said that a lot of milk comes into his farm from Northern Ireland.
“If that is the case, sure it’s going to have to be segregated, and that’s physically not possible. The capacity is not within the processes to allow that to happen.
He said that during the month of May, there’s less than a 1% capacity in the system.

There are 180 different standards and regulations that dairy farmers in the EU must adhere to, which McCabe says is part of what makes an EU-origin product so valuable.
“Some might find it onerous on farmers, but it gets us markets all over the world. EU standards are vital for us.”
He says that if Northern Ireland can prove they maintain these standards post-transition period, “it shouldn’t be a big deal”.
“It’s as bad for the Northern Ireland farmers or maybe worse than for the southern farmers, no question about it.”
MEP Seán Kelly believes that an EU-UK trade deal will be done at the “last minute”, and so details like the rule of origin would not be included.
But Kelly adds that he thinks a solution to the problem will be found, because “that’s part of the intention behind the Protocol in Northern Ireland, that we would have the all Ireland economy”.
“I think it’s a question of getting over the technicalities,” he said, “and once they define it and limit it to the goods that we’re talking about, then I think that we’ll get a way around it.
Kelly said that this was a good example of why trade deals take so long to agree – and that there was a “danger” that if a trade deal is struck, it would be too “general” to make these kinds of allowances for Northern Ireland.
A change to EU origin rules
New EU rulescome into effect on the 1 April which means that where the country of origin of a food is given and where this is not the same as the origin of the main ingredient of that type of food, then the origin of the main ingredient must also be given.
Here’s the example the FSAI gave:if the origin of a chicken curry is declared as Irish on the label but the chicken is not Irish, then it will be a legal requirement to also give the origin of the chicken on the label, “to ensure the consumer is not mislead”.
Origin can be indicated on a label by statements or words, pictures, symbols, or colours/designs that refer to a geographical origin.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-plan-5103720-May2020/,"THE UK HAS published its proposal for the Northern Ireland protocol and how trade could operate between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and Great Britain after the Brexit transition period.
Announcing that the document had been published, senior British minister Michael Govetold the House of Commonsthat the “command paper” implements the protocol “in a way that will protect the people and economy of Northern Ireland”.
The plan outlines four main aspects to the UK’s plan:
1. Unfettered access:Trade going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK to “take place as it does now”. There should be no additional process or paperwork, and there will be no restrictions on Northern Ireland goods arriving in the rest of the UK, which is referred to as “unfettered access”. This would be enshrined through legislation by the end of this year, Gove said.
The document says that “it makes no sense” for NI businesses to have to fill out an export or exit summary declaration, which is taking a jab at a request from EU negotiators for this to be included.
2. No tariffson goods going from GB to NI. “We will not levy tariffs on [Great Britain] goods remaining within the UK customs territory,” the document states. “Only those goods ultimately entering Ireland or the rest of the EU, or at clear and substantial risk of doing so, will face tariffs.”
However, therewillneed to be declaration on goods as they move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, Gove told MPs. “These systems will be electronic and administered by UK authorities… It would be [up to] our authorities to determine any processes required using technology, risk and compliance requirements,” he said.
What Gove means by this is that the Protocol would see UK authorities applying EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. If they remain in Northern Ireland, businesses will be reimbursed any tariffs paid on goods. If the goods continue on to the Ireland/ the EU, then the tariff costs remain.
This seems to be an admission that there will be checks of sorts between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but they will be “light-touch”.

3. No new customs infrastructurewill be involved in the implementation of the Protocol, both Gove and the document said. For agrifood and live animal movements, they may require building on what “already happens” at ports in Larne and Belfast, he added. “There is no such case for new customs infrastructure,” Gove said.
4. Trade with Northern Irelandfrom third countries: Where the UK has new Free Trade Agreements with other countries, Northern Ireland businesses “will benefit” from preferential tariffs just as the rest of the UK will, the document says.
When asked about the cost of the new checks, Gove said that he was working with to make sure they are as “light-touch, effective and unobtrusive” as possible.
He said that Northern Ireland’s position in the United Kingdom was “constitutionally secure”.

And this is why whatever@michaelgovesays today, it has to remove friction from getting goods to and from NI. Quite simply NI families cannot afford cost rises that come from checks, delays etc. This is not just an economic issue but a standard of living issue.https://t.co/vLC0lff4ht— Aodhán Michael Connolly (@MichaelAodhan)May 20, 2020Aodhán Michael Connolly/ Twitter

In response to a question from former Prime Minister Theresa May, Gove says Northern Ireland will be asked to abide by some EU regulations on certain goods until 2024 at the earliest, and potentially indefinitely.
Gove also replied to this that they would have the option of voting these measures down in 2024, if they proved ineffective or obtrusive.
Tommy Sheppard from the Scottish National Party has said that Scotland would “happily” take the arrangements organised for the North “if they don’t want it”.
According to figures in the paper, nearly 23,000 NI businesses trade to and from Great Britain, and Northern Ireland goods sales to Great Britain are worth £8.1bn. Trade with GB comprises 56% of Northern Ireland’s total external trade in goods – making it its largest market.

NORTHERN IRELAND’S HOSPITALS and schools risk running out of food when post-Brexit Irish Sea trade arrangements are fully implemented, a Stormont minister has claimed.
A grace period that limits the level of red tape required to move retail food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland runs out at the end of March.
Once that exemption expires supermarkets will have to comply with more rigorous animal health certification processes under the terms of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
With depleted supermarket shelves already in evidence in Northern Ireland with the lighter-touch trade controls, Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots warned of a “major crisis” once the grace period ends.
“It was made very clear to us by the suppliers to both hospitals and schools that if the current arrangement for supermarkets isn’t extended in a few months’ time that they will not be able to supply our hospitals and schools with food,” he told BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show.
“That is a major crisis and I have raised this with (senior Cabinet minister) Michael Gove.
“Seriously, are we going to have a situation where our hospitals and schools are not able to feed the children at school, they’re not able to feed their patients?
“That is an outrageous situation that we in Northern Ireland have been put in as a result of the protocol negotiated between the UK Government and the European Union.”
This morning, LIDL supermarket chain said shelves at its stores in Northern Ireland are fully stocked.

Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the region has remained in the single market for goods. That requires strict health checks on animal-based food products being shipped from Great Britain.
Some products are prohibited from entering Northern Ireland at all under single market rules.

Sausages and other chilled meats, which are on that banned list, have been granted a six-month grace period to enable their import from GB to continue until June using temporary Export Health Certificates.
Northern Ireland also applies EU customs rules at its ports, requiring customs declarations on goods moving from GB.
Poots rejected suggestions his party was partly to blame for the situation, given its support for Brexit and its opposition to the withdrawal deal negotiated by former prime minister Theresa May.
May’s version of Brexit did not include the same economic barriers on GB-NI trade, with the Northern Ireland Protocol later negotiated by her successor Boris Johnson.
Poots insisted those who advocated the protocol, as a means to keep trade flowing freely across the Irish border, should shoulder responsibility for the “unmitigated failure” of the new trading arrangements.
He singled out the Irish Government, Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance Party for criticism.
Senior DUP figures have urged the UK Government to invoke the Article 16 mechanism within the Northern Ireland Protocol to halt its operation.
The Prime Minister has said he will not hesitate to invoke the article if the protocol is causing economic harm, however he has characterised the disruption witnessed since the end of the transition period as “teething problems”.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has denied the existence of a new Irish Sea trade border.
Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard accused Poots of “talking up a problem”.
“He’s peddling panic needlessly to divert the gaze of angry supporters who are angry at Irish Sea Border,” he tweeted.
Earlier, DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson warned that the disruption risked breaching the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
Donaldson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy and if it damages the Northern Ireland economy it actually undermines the Good Friday Agreement.
“And furthermore, that agreement makes clear that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of the United Kingdom unless the people of Northern Ireland vote otherwise.
“Therefore this breaches a fundamental element of the Good Friday Agreement by increasingly separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain in trading terms – our biggest trading partner, our biggest trading market, and that simply doesn’t help anyone in Northern Ireland.”

DOWNING STREET HAS said a no-deal Brexit was a “possible” outcome from the EU trade talks, signalling that there had been some improvement since Boris Johnson said it was the “most likely” scenario yesterday.
“Obviously no-deal is a possible outcome, as the Prime Minister has said himself,” Johnson’s official spokesperson said.
“But we have been clear that we will continue to work and hope to reach a free trade agreement.”
Johnson and EU chief Ursula van der Leyen pledged to “go the extra mile” yesterday as they side-stepped a self-imposed cut-off point to end talks if there was no progress towards a pact.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier this morning signalled that there was a “narrow path” to a trade deal with Britain.
An EU diplomat said following a briefing from Barnier that “there might now be a narrow path to an agreement visible – negotiators can clear the remaining hurdles in the next few days”.
“There has been some progress in the negotiations over the last few days, but – sometimes substantial – gaps still need to be bridged in important areas like fisheries, governance and level playing field,” the diplomat said.
An EU source said there had been “fragile” progress.
Barnier was setting out the state of play to ambassadors from the EU’s member states in Brussels this morning.
The ongoing talks have fuelled speculation that Parliament may be forced to sit over the festive period to vote on any agreement.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he was hopeful negotiators can strike a deal in the coming days but that significant challenges still remained on the key sticking points.

“I’m hopeful but I don’t want to understate the very significant challenges that face both the UK side and the European Union side on this level playing field issues and the fishery issue. They are significantly difficult issues,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme.
Former chief whip Mark Harper, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour, said: “It depends on when it is concluded, but many of us are fully anticipating it’s entirely possible we might be returning to Parliament between Christmas and New Year to scrutinise this and vote it through if a deal is done.”
Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour was “minded” to vote for a deal in a sign that, should consensus be reached in Brussels, the terms of any future relationship with Britain’s largest trading partner would face little opposition in Parliament.
‘Most likely scenario’
This morning’s comments from Downing Street appear more positive than yesterday’s stance when Johnson continued to warn that a no-deal outcome was still the most likely scenario.
He said yesterday the country should get ready for the breakdown of talks, resulting in tariffs under World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms from 1 January – a move that is predicted to cost jobs, cause food prices to rise and wipe £45 billion off the economy next year.
“The most likely thing now is, of course, that we have to get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms,” UK the Prime Minister said.

The agreement to continue talking beyond yesterday’s deadline set by Johnson and von der Leyen does indicate that progress could still be made.
The pair agreed to “keep going for as long as they still think a deal is possible”, a UK source said.
A joint statement issued by the two leaders said: “Our negotiating teams have been working day and night over recent days.
“And despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations, despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile.”
After updating the Cabinet on his talks with the commission chief, Johnson told reporters the UK would be “as creative as we possibly can” in search of an agreement but stressed that there were fundamentals that could not be compromised, such as “being able to control our laws, control our fisheries”.

“I think our friends get it, and we remain willing to talk and will continue to do so,” he added.
The major sticking points in the negotiations – as they have been for months – are on fishing rights and the “level playing field” which Brussels wants to prevent unfair competition from the UK undercutting EU standards and state subsidy rules.
Johnson has said that no prime minister could accept a situation where the EU could automatically “punish” the UK if it failed to follow future regulations from Brussels.
If that “ratchet clause” was watered down, there could be the possibility of a deal – the UK side has already indicated it would not regress from existing EU standards on issues such as workers’ rights and environmental protections.
The Times reported that chief negotiators Lord Frost and Michel Barnier are discussing what role independent arbitration could have in resolving disputes in a potential sign that a compromise could be in the offing.
The pair are due to continue talking in Brussels today.
On fishing rights, the row over what access EU trawlers would have to UK waters dramatically escalated over the weekend, with Royal Navy vessels on stand-by to patrol the seas around Britain if there is no deal.
Despite his talks with Mrs von der Leyen in recent days, the Prime Minister remains frustrated that he has not been able to speak directly to key EU national leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron.
Brussels insists that the commission is leading the negotiations on behalf of the 27 member states so Johnson should continue dealing with von der Leyen.

https://www.thejournal.ie/important-dates-coming-up-5007305-Feb2020/,"IT TOOK 63 DAYS to form the last government, in a confidence and supply arrangement that wasn’t expected to last as long as it did.
That was a Fine Gael-Independent Alliance government, with a few independents, propped up by Fianna Fáil in a Confidence and Supply Agreement that was to last three budgets – in the end, we got three budgets and a bit.
The next Irish government could be anything from a reverse Confidence and Supply agreement (meaning Fine Gael propping up Fianna Fáil et al), with Fianna Fáil and the Greens in power, a grand coalition, or a left-wing government led by Sinn Féin.
With complications attached to all of these options, it could be weeks before we know what’s next. If the parties cannot agree, we might have another election before the end of the year.
Although we have a new set of TDs, those who held government positions are still constitutionally in those roles, holding all the same powers that that role entails. This means that Leo Varadkar is still the Taoiseach, Simon Ross is still Transport Minister, and Mary Mitchell-O’Connor is still Minister of State for Higher Education, etc.
So with a couple of important engagements coming up, we might see some former TDs carry out their duties for a little bit longer. Here are some of those dates.
Next Thursday is whenthe new Dáil convenesfor the first time: a vote, or votes, will be held on who should be the next Taoiseach.
The British are coming: Prince William and Kate Middleton will be arriving in Dublin on 4 March for athree-day royal visit. The two are scheduled to head to Galway on Thursday, for their final day in Ireland.
When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle visited Dublinin July 2018, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met them at Áras an Uachtaráin.
St Patrick’s Dayis just a month away. The arrangements for last year’s State trips, where ministers flew all over the world to represent Ireland on the day it is celebrated, were announced at the end of January.

Some St Patrick’s Day arrangements have been made. For example, it’s expected that the traditional trip to Washington – where the Taoiseach hands the US President a bowl of shamrocks – will go ahead.
If a government hasn’t been formed in time for St Patrick’s Day, it’s expected thatsomething similar to 2016will happen and Leo Varadkar will travel to the US. In 2016, Enda Kenny flew to Washington to meet with then-US President Barack Obama for a St Patrick’s Day press event.
On theBrexitfront, there are a few deadlines coming up (surprise, surprise).
Trade talks are due to kick off at the beginning of March, but Ireland doesn’t necessarily need a government in place for that yet – it will mostly be handled by the EU’s Brexit negotiation team, headed up by Michel Barnier.
Ireland also has representation in the EU in the form of the EU’s Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan, who will be heavily involved in the trade talks. There are also 13 Irish MEPs (one of this number, Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy, has been elected as a TD and will need to be replaced).
Where Ireland will be missed is at the European Council, or the meeting of the leaders of the 27 EU countries. The next European Council summit is on this Thursday 20 February (the same day that the new Dáil meets).
The likelihood is that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will attend the council, which is being called to announce the EU’s budget. The next two Council summits will be on 26-27 March, and 18-19 June.
By 1 July, the UK government must decide whether they’re extending the Brexit transition period, which is to last until 31 December 2020.
If the UK requests to extend the transition period, that request will most likely be voted on at the June European Council summit.
If this is the case, it will be important to have a Taoiseach who has a mandate from the people to take a vote on that decision.
If Varadkar is still Taoiseach by then, he will still have all the powers he had before to act as Taoiseach; it’s likely that he would confer with the leaders of the other political parties to develop a position for Ireland collectively.

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-brexit-fisheries-eu-boris-johnson-deal-trade-5141451-Jul2020/,"IRELAND’S EU TRADE commissioner Phil Hogan thinks that there will still be a deal with the UK on Brexit – but that the ball is in Boris Johnson’s court.
Hogan made the comments on RTÉ Radio One’s Brendan O’Connor programme with Damien O’Reilly.
“I still believe there will be a deal. The ambition of that deal on the European Union side is real. I don’t see the same ambition on the UK side, so the ball is in the UK’s court. If they want a deal, there is a deal to be done,” he said.
The fourth round of Brexit trade talks ended a day early this week, with both sides warning that major differences remain.

The meetings in Brussels were the first held face-to-face since the coronavirus shutdown, adding to hopes that substantial progress would be made.
This transition period comes to an end on 31 December, by which time it is hoped an EU-UK Free Trade Agreement, ratified by the EU and UK parliaments, will come into effect.
Hogan said that divisions remain between the two sides on issues like fisheries and the role of the European Court of Justice in dispute resolution. However, he said that the EU was willing to compromise and that it wanted to get a deal that could be approved by both the House of Commons and the European Parliament.
“Boris Johnson has explicitly stated that he wants a deal, so we need to see movement on the UK side soon or else it’s going to be too late.”
If issues aren’t resolved, he said, there will be no deal by the time the transition period ends.
“Very little has happened in the last few months and there’s a frustration on the EU side about the fact that the good faith in terms of the negotiations that’s required on both sides is not happening to the extent that it should,” Hogan said.

“Not any old deal will do,” he added.
Earlier this week,Hogan announcedthat he would no longer be contesting the race to be the new boss of the World Trade Organisation.
“I had to make a choice about whether I was going to be involved in a long-drawn out process or do we clarify the situation,” he said.
“We need a global referee that is effective and efficient and that is a challenge I would have liked to take on,” he added, referring to the need to reform the organisation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-uup-ulster-north-fermanagh-tyrone-4894800-Nov2019/,"A SINN FÉIN candidate in one of Northern Ireland’s hardest-fought election battlegrounds has predicted that unionist farmers will help her retain the seat.
Michelle Gildernew insisted many pro-Remain unionists in Fermanagh and South Tyrone see her as a better option than her Leave-voting unionist rival, Tom Elliott.
Ulster Unionist Mr Elliott, a unionist farmer himself, said he is still a “soft” leaver but agrees with his new party leader, Steve Aiken, that remaining in the EU would be better than the terms of the withdrawal deal.
However, he believes a no-deal exit would also be preferable to the proposed agreement.
With the constituency having been decided by the narrowest of margins in recent history – a solitary vote in 2010 and just 53 in 2001 – incumbent MP Gildernew claims the backing of pro-Union voters could be key on 12 December.
“The Brexit thing is having an impact and people who maybe still wouldn’t necessarily agree with me on a constitutional position, agree with what I’m saying and what Sinn Fein are saying on the Brexit issue and they will vote,” she said.
“People are really, really concerned. Unionist farmers are looking at their future in a post-Brexit UK, and they’re frightened, and they’ve very good right to be.”
The republican went a step further, claiming some of those same unionists are also now reconsidering their views on the union itself.
“People who couldn’t comprehend it a few years ago are genuinely examining it and asking themselves those questions now and that’s very healthy, that’s to be welcomed,” she said.

“And Brexit has done that. People now know, if I have to choose which union I am going to be part of, I might pick the European Union in a united Ireland rather than the union with Brexit.”
Elliott, who won the seat from Gildernew in 2015, only to see her regain it in 2017, naturally offers a very different analysis of the contest.
He does not believe Brexit is the issue per se, rather the length of time the process of leaving the EU has taken.
“The difficulty is how long it has taken to get there,” he said.

“I always felt there was an easier resolution to the whole Brexit issue – and that was by the European Union giving special status to the Republic of Ireland to trade freely with a UK which includes Northern Ireland, and vice versa, and I think that would have resolved a lot of issues because we are two islands. They would have been a much simpler outcome to it.”
Elliott backed Leave in 2016 despite his party’s pro-Remain stance.
After the referendum, the UUP changed position and urged support for an EU exit, insisting the democratic vote had to be respected.
It has since moved again, with recently-appointed Aiken signalling a return to a pro-Remain position, arguing that staying in the EU would be much better than leaving on the terms agreed by the prime minister.
There has been speculation over whether Elliott is in tune with his new leader.
He said he agrees that remaining would be better than Boris Johnson’s deal, but adds a caveat – that a no-deal exit would also be preferable to the current deal.
“Boris Johnson’s deal is a bad deal for Northern Ireland overall, economically and for businesses, simply because it puts a regulatory position between Northern Ireland and GB and that’s difficult, that’s difficult for businesses today,” he said.
“So I have to say I don’t like Boris Johnson’s deal and I think, probably, in the end I would prefer almost any deal apart from it, including to remain or including, in the end, no deal at all, because, you know, it’s just not a good deal overall.”
For the fourth general election in a row, the DUP has stood aside in the constituency.
The party backed a unionist independent in 2010 but in 2015 and 2017 it supported the UUP as part of wider pacts which saw the Ulster Unionists reciprocate elsewhere in the region.
It has made for a somewhat awkward alliance in Fermanagh, given that current DUP leader Arlene Foster is a local MLA who defected from the UUP in acrimonious circumstances back in 2004.
This time round, the current Brexit deal is another factor that could make for an uneasy link-up.
The UUP has been highly critical of the DUP’s handling of its Westminster partnership with the Conservatives, claiming it only served to deliver a deal that could spell disaster for the Union.
And while the DUP remains committed, publicly at least, to Brexit, the UUP is now aligning itself with the Remain side of the debate.
Elliott rejects the suggestion that the tie-up with the DUP undercuts his party’s efforts to blame them over Brexit.
Countering Gildernew’s assertion that unionists will decide their vote on Brexit, Elliott believes the preservation of the union will trump all other issues, and see UUP and DUP voters unite behind him.

“Clearly what people recognise is, above all, the union of the United Kingdom is the most important thing here,” he said.
“What we want to do is try to ensure that we maintain that, that we strengthen that and we build on that because we’re part of the fifth largest economy in the world being part of the United Kingdom.”
Elliott claims Sinn Fein’s Westminster abstentionist policy is also a turn-off for voters, who he says crave proper representation to deal with issues such as spiralling hospital waiting times.
It is an argument Gildernew dismisses, insisting that Sinn Fein’s seven MPs would not have made a “button of difference” in any of the Commons votes on Brexit.
“If we had gone into some of those votes, took the oath of allegiance to the British Queen and went in and voted, the seven of us would have been ruled out by seven or 17 or 70 people who had decided to go one way and then refused to go into the same voting lobbies as us.
“I think it would have been counter-productive. And I think we wouldn’t have made a difference.
“English MPs wouldn’t have let Irish MPs change the course of English history.”
She said her party has instead made its voice count where it “matters” – Dublin, Brussels and Washington.
Since his defeat in 2017, Elliott has stepped away from the political spotlight, dividing his time between his farm, working part-time in the UUP’s Enniskillen office and his role as chairman of his beloved Ballinamallard FC.
He insists his return is not a reluctant one.
“I’m someone who’s fairly practical and I get on with whatever I’m doing,” he said.
“Whenever I was involved in frontline politics, you put your heart and soul into it and put everything into it, and once you’re out of it you get on with other things, so obviously I’m having a go at getting back in.
“If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, but I’ll make a go of whatever it is.”
The other candidates running in Fermanagh and South Tyrone are the SDLP’s Adam Gannon, the Alliance Party’s Matthew Beaumont, and independent Caroline Wheeler.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-does-the-uk-election-mean-for-brexit-4931631-Dec2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Dec 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson says he now has a clear mandate “to get Brexit” done after a thumping victory in the UK General Election.
As soonas the exit poll was announced, the scale of the victory for Johnson was clear. The Conservative leader had succeeded where his predecessor Theresa May had failed and won a majority for his party to legislate for Brexit.
The majority for the Conservatives means that Brexit looks set to become a reality, with a vote on Johnson’s Withdrawal Deal possible this side of Christmas.
After months of paralysis in the European Parliament, EU leaders will likely welcome what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday said he hoped would be a “decisive” result in the UK election.
The Taoiseach said certainty was paramount “so we know where we’re going over the next few months”, adding that talks on a post-Brexit trade deal will be “crucial for Ireland”.
So what does Johnson’s victory means for Brexit and what could happen next?
‘Negotiations’
“We are ready for the next steps and we will see if it’s possible for the British parliament to accept the Withdrawal Agreement and take a decision,” European Council President Charles Michel said yesterday.

Boris Johnson – charged with a clear mandate to “get Brexit done” – could now work to set the agenda for future trade negotiations with the EU.
EU leaders, however, will likely resist attempts by the UK to lead that charge.
Congratulations to@BorisJohnsonon his victory in the UK General Election. The Irish government and my department now stand ready to seize the moment and focus on getting#Stormontup and running for all the people and parties in Northern Ireland.— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney)December 13, 2019Simon Coveney/ Twitter
Congratulations to@BorisJohnsonon his victory in the UK General Election. The Irish government and my department now stand ready to seize the moment and focus on getting#Stormontup and running for all the people and parties in Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, Johnson’s massive majority ensures that the confidence-and-supply arrangement negotiated between the DUP and Theresa May in 2017 is now unnecessary, erasing any real DUP influence over what happens next in Brexit.
Not that this reality has destroyed all traces of optimism. Sammy Wilson, the party’s Brexit spokesperson, suggested that Johnson may still find himself needing DUP support in the months to come.
Assuming the British Parliament will sit in early January following its Christmas recess, MPs will have just weeks to pass legislation to meet the 31 January deadline, set by the EU following an extension in October.
Once Parliament ratifies legislation in both the Commons and the House of Lords, the European Parliament will ratify the deal on the EU side paving the way for the UK to leave by the end of January.
Ifthat happens, the planned “transition period” for the UK’s exit kicks in.
Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement contains a hard deadline of 31 December 2020 to secure a Free Trade Agreement with the EU.
EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier – among others – has said it’s unlikely a Trade Agreement could be achieved by then.
Related ReadsElection results bring Irish unity and Scottish independence back to the fore
If the deadline is not extended – possibly to late as December 2022 if both sides agree to extend – Britain faces a No-Deal Brexit on 1 January 2021 when the “transition period” ends.
Assuming a Brexit deal is ratified in January 2020, it’s then over to the UK’s negotiating team to begin creating a trade deal with the EU – and other countries – forming the basis of its future relationship with Europe.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump congratulated Boris Johnson on his election victory today – adding the UK and US will be free to strike a “massive” new trade deal after Brexit that has the potential to be “far bigger and more lucrative” than any deal which could have been made with the European Union.
It’s worth noting the transition period means current trading arrangements between the UK and the EU will remain in place as the UK works out what kind of future relationship it wants.
Of course,all of thisis dependent on Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement being passed. Yet with a 76-seat Tory majority in the Commons it’s all but certain at this stage.
Speaking this morning, the EU’s Michel congratulated Johnson on his election victory and said the EU expects a vote on Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement “as soon as possible”.
“The EU is ready for the next phase,” said Michael. “We will negotiate a future trade deal which ensures a true level playing field.”
The EU will be watching closely for Johnson’s next move in the great game.

Additional checks on animal-based products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are required under the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Treaty.
Officials have already warned that new buildings and infrastructure required to conduct the monitoring at ports and airports will not be ready by the end of December when the Brexit transition period ends.
Andrew McCormick, Stormont’s lead official on EU exit, said there remained “confidence” that the SPS check (sanitary and phytosanitary) could still be conducted, even if the physical structures were not in place.
Giving evidence to the Executive Office committee at Stormont, McCormick said London and Brussels were watching the development of the facilities “very, very closely”.
“This all matters immensely,” he said.

“And I think very hard work is being undertaken by colleagues in the DAERA (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) and the sooner these things are established the better in terms of just giving assurance and confidence to all concerned, not least the business community so they know where they stand and what they have to do.
“I think the fact of the matter is that there will be still some work to be done post-New Year, but the key thing is to ensure that we have something which is operationally effective.
“Sanitary and phytosanitary checks are needed to protect health, animal health, plant health and human health.
“So what matters most is having the staff and systems to facilitate that work.
“That’s really good work being done very rapidly and the time pressure is immense but it’s progressing and there is confidence that a result can be delivered.”
Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is contained in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods when the transition period ends.
That will require additional regulatory checks for animal-based food products entering the region from Great Britain.
UK and EU negotiators are still trying to hammer out the details of how the protocol will operate amid efforts to minimise the checks required.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-deal-5110528-May2020/,"THE TÁNAISTE WILL seek approval from Cabinet today for a new Brexit Omnibus Bill to be drafted and will advise ministers on the possible outcomes if there is no extension to the transition period past 31 December.
Yesterday the UK’s chief negotiator said any request for an extension to the Brexit transition period from the EU will be rejected.
David Frost said that the government’s position on the issue is “pretty clear”, and that negotiators are working towards an end of year deadline.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney will bring a memo to Cabinet today outlining preparations for the rest of the year in relation to Brexit, including the position of talks on the future trade deal between the EU and UK.
There have been three rounds of talks already, led by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. A fourth round of talks is scheduled to take place, with a high level summit to follow before the second part of the year.

Coveney’s memo will state that the government does not believe the UK will seek an extension to the transition period past 31 December and there are therefore two possible scenarios at the end of this year:
If there is no trade deal, the UK and EU will be trading on World Trade Organization terms from 1 January 2021.
All government departments are now preparing for both scenarios, though the preference for Ireland and the rest of the EU is a trade deal that keeps the UK as close as possible.
The memo will also seek approval for a new Brexit Omnibus Bill to be drafted to cover the needs of eight government departments. Last year’s omnibus bill covered a no withdrawal agreement scenario and since a no-deal situation was averted new draft legislation is required.
Coveney’s memo will also seek approval for a new communication campaign with key stakeholders including business and citizens to be ready for whatever scenario.
The memo will note the UK’s commitments last week to the Withdrawal Agreement and the Irish protocol which guarantees no return to a hard border on the island regardless of the outcome of the trade talks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-general-election-2-4871437-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|29 Oct 2019
MPS IN THE House of Commons have voted to hold a general election.
The British public will go the polls on Thursday 12 December.
A late amendment from Labour had sought to change the date to Monday 9 December but that failed by 315 votes to 295.
In the end, MPs voted for an election by 438 votes to 20.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to regain the Conservative majority in the Commons that was lost after an election called by his predecessor Theresa May in 2017.
He had previously said he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than the UK not leave the EU on 31 October.
Johnson secured a last-ditch deal with the EU that involved compromise on the Northern Irish backstop, but this deal was defeated by MPs in the Commons.

Legislation passed by the opposition with the help of rebel Tories forced Johnson to seek an extension in lieu of a deal passing through parliament.
The EU has formally accepted this request for an extension and the new date set for Brexit is 31 January 2020.
How that will proceed will depend greatly on who’s in government by then and who – if anyone – has a majority.
If Johnson wins a majority, he’ll seek to push through his Brexit deal and should be successful in doing so.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats have repeatedly said they would seek a second public vote on Brexit with the latter party totally opposed to the UK leaving the EU.
If one or both of these parties win power, then Brexit may be cast in doubt altogether.
Reaction
With the election now on the horizon, Johnson told reporters this evening that it’s time for the country to “come together to get Brexit done”.
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn has called the election a “once-in-a-generation” chance to “transform” the country. He also doesn’t mention Brexit in his statement.

“We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen,” he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the election is the “best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit”.
She added: “This country deserves better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.”
Also reacting to the news early, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the election would be an opportunity to defend the interests of people, businesses and communities in the North.
He said: “This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down… Bring it on.”
DUP leader Arlene Foster said that it’s right that people “have their say through the ballot box” and added that her party have a “record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster.
“Unionists need their strongest team returned to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next parliament,” she said. “That team is the DUP.”
The December vote will be the first time since Britons have gone to the polls in a general election in that month since 1923, the second such election to not include MPs across most of the island of Ireland following the creation of the Irish Free State.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-weather-forecasting-brexit-ireland-5212139-Sep2020/,"THERE ARE FEWER things that Irish people love talking about more than the weather, so it is no surprise that Ireland will formally bid to get the European centre for weather forecasting relocated from the UK to Dublin.
As a result of Brexit, EU-funded activities of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) will have to move from its current location in Reading to a European Member State.
Cabinet today agreed the government’s submission to have the centre located to Ireland.
If successful, the centre would be in a new facility in Cherrywood, Dublin.
The relocation would result in 250 jobs.

The deadline for submissions is the 1 October, with the winner due to be announced in December 2020.
Ireland is up against nine other Member States that are also participating in the competition.
The centre is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing weather predictions for European countries.
It also specialises in global weather forecasting about 2 weeks ahead of time, as well as producing longer-range forecasts for up to a year ahead, with varying degrees of detail, according to its website.
The centre has one of the largest supercomputer facilities and meteorological data archives in the world. It also uses an advanced computer modelling technique to analyse observations and predict future weather.
It is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 34 Member States.
Government sources are hopeful that Ireland will be successful in the competition, stating that it would align with the Irish Government’s Global Ireland strategy to increase the country’s “pull factor” for the creation of new green economy jobs.

During peak periods, more than 5,800 applications were submitted from around the world in a single day, and total monthly applications exceeded 100,000 in January, March, April and May in 2019.
March was the month where the highest number of applications for Irish passports were received; 112,920 were submitted in that time.

There were “a significant number of applicants” from Northern Ireland and Great Britain; over 94,000 first-time applications were received from people born in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, representing just over 10% of the total.
Last year,this figure was 22%.
The oldest online applicant was 101 and the youngest was just five days old.
The most popular baby girls names were Grace, Emily and Anna; while Jack, James and Noah topped the baby boys’ list.  The most common surname for applications for Irish passports worldwide was Murphy.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney said that 2019 was “another bumper year for the passport service”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-interview-3-4946807-Dec2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said Boris Johnson could still seek an extension for Brexit trade talks after 2020 despite legislation.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Coveney said putting down such a tight deadline for a trade deal between the EU and the UK to be agreed is all part of the British Prime Minister’s twin narrative of ‘Getting Brexit Done’ and ‘No More Delays’.
Johnson has altered his own Brexit Bill to make it unlawful for the British Government to extend the trade talks into 2021, giving negotiators just 11 months to thrash out a deal.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that Johnson looks likely to embark on a “harder Brexit than we anticipated” and says he fears the UK will want to “undercut” its European rivals on food, health and product safety after exit day.
Speaking about the tight deadline for talks, Coveney said the next phase will be “difficult”.
“I think he may regret doing that, by passing legislation, which effectively requires them to have everything done by the end of 2020, when they have the option to extend for a year or two years if they want to. It is effectively tying their own hands,” he said.
“I think the EU isn’t going to be rushed here, they’ll negotiate a trade deal, as they always do. They’ll try to do it in as timely manner as we can, because everybody wants to get this behind us and to move on. But they’re not going to rush the deal and certainly Britain are not going to get a better deal because the EU are being rushed. If that is the strategy, I don’t think it’s going to work.”
Seeking an extension past 2020
Coveney added that he wouldn’t, at this stage, ‘read too much’ into the legislative manoeuvre.
“There’s nothing to prevent Boris Johnson, if he wants to, of seeking an extension and changing the law if has to. I mean, he has a large majority that can allow him to do it… He still has options. But from our point of view, we would want to try to be part of a negotiation that results in the closest possible relationship between Britain and Ireland, and Britain and the EU. We think that’s good for all sides,” he said.
In terms of Ireland’s priorities heading into the talks, Coveney said he doesn’t want to see any “race to the bottom” in terms of standards and regulations, which the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier raised this month.
If that is where Johnson is heading, then there “won’t be tariff-free or quota-free trade” according to Coveney, who added that such free trade remains the stated objective of both sides.
He said the aim is to have a trade relationship that is going to be as free as can be, with “some limited checks at the border”.
“If that is the objective, then there’s going to need to be very comprehensive level-playing field agreement across multiple sectors, from workers rights, to environmental standards, to consumer protection, to animal welfare, to food safety, and a whole range of other areas.
“What the EU will certainly not allow is that the UK will be able to trade freely into the EU single market, but not actually have equivalent standards, in terms of cost production and so on. I mean, that’s essentially creating a competitive advantage by deregulating and then expecting that you can trade without any cost to that, that’s a non starter,” he said.

A race to the bottom?
Explaining further, he noted that if Britain’s plan “is to essentially deregulate, to move away from the kind of structured market that we have in the EU and to undermine standards and consumer safety by doing that, and environmental protections by doing that, well, then the chances of getting a trade deal that doesn’t involve tariffs and quotas is going to be very difficult”.
However, he is still hopeful of a pragmatic approach that could end up in a deal suiting both parties.
Fishing is one sector that could prove difficult in that task, he admitted.
It is a priority, he said, as a “significant percentage” of Ireland’s catch is taken from British waters.
“They come into our waters too,” he added. “And we will want to try to get a comprehensive agreement on fishing between the UK and the EU that protects our fishing industry, which I think is going to be challenging.
“But again, as part of an overall trade agreement, I think it’s possible to do, whether it’s possible to do it all in 11 months, I think it is a very tough ask. And that’s why I think at the end of this process, we may need to seek more time, but let’s wait and see how that develops.”
A bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland
Johnson has also thrown out an “interesting idea”, as he describes it, of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Would such an idea be a runner?
“I mean, anything is possible, it’s certainly a hugely expensive project,” said Coveney.
“I mean, that’s a matter for the UK, if it’s possible to do it, certainly we wouldn’t have any objections,” he added, but stated that Ireland would not be paying anything towards the project, if it were ever to be given the green light.

Another issue that has kept the Tánaiste busy in recent months is getting Stormont back up and running.
TheDUP prevented a pre-Christmas dealto restore Stormont power-sharing and release extra British government cash for the struggling health service, the Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has said.
The British and Irish governments and at least three of the main Stormont parties including Sinn Féin want to re-establish the devolved institutions immediately and end a three-year hiatus which has seen public services suffer.
So is all blame rightly on the DUP?
“We reached a point last Thursday where four of the five parties were willing to close out the deal before Christmas, on the back of what the government were proposing, which is to essentially introduce a text or a paper that could be the basis for a foundation to reestablish a functioning Executive and Assembly.
“And the DUP weren’t able to commit to that timeline, they felt there was more work needed, more compromise needed in some of the areas that they were concerned about. We felt we simply needed to be honest with the public in terms of what the hold up was, because the other four parties certainly didn’t want to be blamed for not doing a deal before Christmas. So we simply had to call it as we saw it, that doesn’t mean that it’s not possible to do a deal,” said Coveney, who still “absolutely” believes that agreement can be reached before the 13 January deadline.

Getting Stormont up and running by January
He said work will continue over the Christmas period in order to make progress.
Reflecting on the last year in the North, Coveney said that both unionism and nationalism “have been under a lot of strain, because of the pressures that Brexit has created”.
“Northern Ireland is actually something that I think about a lot in terms of trying to manage responsibly, the legitimate aspirations of so many people in Northern Ireland whether they be unionist, or nationalist or the increasing number of people who no longer want to be categorised as either. I would like to be a positive force in terms of improving relationships in the coming year,” he said.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin recently ruled out the possibility of a border poll for at least five years if he was Taoiseach. Coveney agrees with his thinking.
When it comes to the North, things should be done “one thing at a time”, he said.
Conversation about Ireland’s future
However, the Tánaiste acknowledged that a conversation about the future is needed, but other matters must be prioritised first.
“I think we need to try to create a period of some calm in Northern Ireland. We need the institutions functioning again, we need to create some trust between the parties and the political leaders in Northern Ireland as there has been a real absence of that in recent years.
“And certainly, you know, at some point in the future, we need to have the conversation around what the future of the island of Ireland looks like and how we try to accommodate the different perspectives,” he said.
“I’m not going to agree to any specific timeline, but I think, for me, it’s about trying to solve big problems one after the other, as opposed to try to do everything at the same time, which I think would be a recipe for a lot of division and difficulties in the North.”
Ambitions of leadership?
Simon Coveney and Leo VaradkarPA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
Would Coveney like to leave Brexit behind one day and take another shot at the Fine Gael leadership?
“I don’t really spend any time thinking about that, to be honest. I mean, I’m one of these people who looks forward, and takes things in context. I have a huge responsibility at the moment, particularly on Brexit and the North. I’m very focused on that and on my own constituency, obviously, in terms of getting local things done.
“But Brexit and the North have taken up a huge amount of my time. And hopefully I’ve tried to protect the country and Irish people through that. I mean, I haven’t even focused hugely on the general election, quite frankly. I want to see Brexit out in January, in terms of the first round of negotiations, I want to be there to see Stormont functioning, again, after three years of stagnation and tension. And, that’s really what keeps me driven.
“I’m not trying to manoeuvre my way into a new leadership contest or anything like that in Fine Gael. I think Leo is likely to lead the party for quite some time in the future, and I’ll support him in that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-exit-poll-4931119-Dec2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2019
BORIS JOHNSON IS set to remain as UK prime minister with a huge parliamentary majority for his Conservative party, tonight’s TV exit poll has predicted.
The exit poll is predicting that the Tories will win 368 seats, a majority of 86 seats and an increase of 50 on the previous general election in 2017.
A result along these lines represents a massive win for Johnson and the best for his party since Margaret Thatcher’s victory in 1987.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party looks set to lose up to 71 seats, a disastrous result that will leave it with 191 MPs and far short of what Corbyn would require to even consider forming a government.

Figures from the exit poll were borne out when the first results began to come in after 11 pm, with the Conservatives winning the Blyth Valley constituency in the north-east of England after a 10 point swing to the party.

The apparent election result means that Johnson has been handed the mandate to lead the UK out of the EU next month.
The Tory platform argued that the Brexit deal struck between Johnson and EU leaders was being held up by the lack a parliamentary majority.
The exit poll suggests that the party’s focus on decisively ending the Brexit impasse by leaving the EU was a successful one.
For Johnson, the exit poll suggests this is a pinnacle of his almost 30 years in British public life with a crushing victory in his first general election as Conservative leader.
Related ReadsWhen the bells chime: Why the exit poll has become such an iconic moment in UK elections
The exit poll also leaves Corbyn’s future as Labour leader on life-support after one of its worst ever electoral performances.
The prediction suggests Labour will lose seats across some of its traditional heartlands and there will be much soul-searching about whether the party’s approach to the central question of Brexit lead to today’s electoral disaster.
It will also lead to wider questions about the direction that party has taken since Corbyn became leader in 2015.
In Scotland, the exit poll is also predicting that the SNP couple win 55 seats, only four short of a clean sweep, bringing the issue of Scottish independence to the fore once more.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-uk-ireland-trade-deal-brexit-4944211-Dec2019/,"A TRADE DEAL between Ireland and the UK has been made more difficult because the Prime Minister is “fixed on a harder Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.
Speaking at a media briefing in Dublin, Leo Varadkar said that the Government’s top priority in the new year will be guiding Ireland through the UK’s exit from the UK, due on 31 January.
Varadkar says the deal negotiated with the UK gives Ireland important guarantees, including preventing the re-emergence of a hard border between North and South, however trade remains an open question.
“What is still, of course, wide open, is what will happen on trade, when it comes to the future trading relationship between the EU and Ireland on one hand, and the UK on the other, and that is really so important,” he said.

“It is going to be difficult to secure a good trade deal for Ireland, principally because Boris Johnson has fixed on a harder Brexit than we anticipated under his predecessor, or at the time of the referendum, and that is one where he talks very much about divergence.
“You’ll see what’s happening in Westminster at the moment, where the guarantees on workers rights, for example, are being deleted from the agreement, and that’s a real concern for us.
“A common set of standards that we all sign up to, we don’t want to trade with a Britain that undercuts us, that has lower financial standards, has lower product standards, lower health and safety standards.
“The whole point of the European Union has been to have convergence and fair competition, more competition, but also people converging upwards in terms of labour rights and standards, environmental standards, over the years.
“The British Government have to work very hard to maintain the unity of European 27 to make sure that we have a level playing field on the common core standards.”
The second reading of Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement was passed with a majority of 124 – 358 votes to 234 – in the House of Commons today, but Varadkar added he was still concerned about Brexit, despite the Withdrawal Agreement being ratified.

“The harder approach being taken by Prime Minister Johnson is a risk to us and that is evident,” he said.
“At the same time, what he has said is that he wants to have exactly what we want, which is quota-free, tariff-free access to each other’s markets with the minimum amount of bureaucracy and checks.
“What he has said is that he doesn’t want there to be alignment. However there are different ways of achieving things than alignment.
“There is also equivalence and there is also the possibility of a common minimum floor of standards. That is the kind of thing that we are going to have to work on.
“It is going to be a tall order to get that agreed and ratified by the end of 2020.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-extension-3-4867061-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|25 Oct 2019
EU AMBASSADORS HAVE agreed in principle to a Brexit extension but have postponed a decision on exactly how long it will last for.
Their final decision has been slated for early next week but it may not come in time for UK politicians to make a decision on holding an election.
The EU is keen not to appear to be influencing House of Commons votes but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party has said it must first know what kind of extension is being granted.
While no decision has been made on the length of an extension, it’s believed that EU leaders are looking at a so-called ‘flextension’ to the end of January 2020, allowing the UK leave the bloc when there is agreement in parliament.
A vote on whether a UK election is to be held is to be taken on Monday.

In Brussels, diplomats from the 27 member states agreed that the final decision could be made by written procedure, meaning there will be no emergency summit to discuss the matter.
After a meeting between the diplomats and EU negotiator Michel Barnier this morning, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said “work will continue in coming days”.
“The EU 27 ambassadors just finished their meeting and indeed the attendance of the Commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier,” she said at a short briefing.
Two diplomats told AFP that the ambassadors set an informal deadline of late Monday or early Tuesday to decide — just two days before the current Brexit deadline of 31 October.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk has recommended EU leaders approve an extension until 31 January 2020.
But, with France pushing for a shorter delay to keep the pressure on Westminster, and Germany and Ireland backing a three-month pause until 31 January, the decision is not done.
“Depending on how things evolve in the UK, we’ve given ourselves until the start of next week,” a senior diplomat said.

“It’s clear that if a decision is taken in the UK on whether or not to hold an election — the date of the election will weigh on the consultations,” he said.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbynhave been trading barbs over the UK airwavestoday as Johnson seeks to win support for the holding of a December election.
Labour looks set to block Johnson’s bid for a pre-Christmas election with Corbyn arguing that a no-deal Brexit must first be taken off the table.
The stalemate has led to a situation where the UK parliament is waiting for an extension decision while EU leaders are waiting on parliament’s decision before making their own.

The Northern Celt vessel was boarded by officials from the agency responsible for Scotland’s fisheries yesterday and skipper Adrian McClenaghan was told that he can no longer fish within 12 nautical miles of the disputed outcrop.
“We were fishing in Rockall and members of the crew from the Jura boarded us. They informed us that we could no longer fish inside the 12-mile limit of Rockall,” McClenaghantold RTÉ News.

A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs toldTheJournal.iethis evening that is in contact with Scottish and UK authorities about the matter.
“We are aware of contact between an Irish fishing vessel and a Marine Scotland patrol vessel yesterday, 4 January. We are in contact with the Scottish and the UK authorities on this,” the spokesperson said.
Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock that sits approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.
It has been a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the UK for several decades.
The UK claimed sovereignty over the tiny islet in 1955 and purported to annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.
Related ReadsExplainer: Where is Rockall and why has it sparked tensions between the Irish and Scottish governments?
Ireland has never recognised British sovereignty over the outcrop.
Last year, Scotland threatened action if Irish vessels continue to operate in the zone around Rockall.
On that occasion the Scottish government said it was defending the interests of its fisheries against “illegal activity”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-uk-leaving-eu-single-market-5313478-Dec2020/,"
BREXIT BECOMES A reality today as Britain leaves Europe’s customs union and single market, ending nearly half a century of often turbulent ties with its closest neighbours.
The UK’s tortuous departure from the European Union takes full effect when Big Ben strikes 11pm in central London, just as most of the European mainland ushers in 2021 at midnight.
Brexit has dominated British politics since the country’s narrow vote to leave the bloc in June 2016, opening deep political and social wounds that still remain raw.
Legally, Britain left on 31 January but has been in a standstill transition period during fractious talks to a secure a free-trade agreement with Brussels, which was finally clinched on Christmas Eve.
Once the transition ends, EU rules will no longer apply, with the immediate consequence being an end to the free movement of more than 500 million people between Britain and 27 EU states.
Customs border checks will be back for the first time in decades, and despite the free-trade deal, queues and disruption from additional paperwork are expected.
Symbolic departure
Britain – a financial and diplomatic big-hitter, and major NATO power – is the first member state to leave the EU, which was set up to forge unity after the horrors of World War II.
The EU has lost 66 million people and an economy worth $2.85 trillion, but Brexit, with its appeal to nationalist populism, also triggered fears other disgruntled members could follow suit.

Leaders in both London and Brussels signalled their wish to draw a line.
“It’s been a long road. It’s time now to put Brexit behind us. Our future is made in Europe,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, as she signed the trade pact.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Brexit was designed to resolve “the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedevilled our post-war history”.
Today “marks a new beginning in our country’s history and a new relationship with the EU as their biggest ally,” he said after British parliament voted to back the trade deal.
‘New beginning’
Unlike in January, when flag-waving Brexiteers led by populist anti-EU former lawmaker Nigel Farage cheered, and pro-EU “remainers” mourned, no formal events are planned for the end of the transition.
Public gatherings are banned due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed more than 72,000 lives and infected more than 2.4 million in Britain, including Johnson himself.
But Johnson is looking not only to a future free of Covid but also of rules set in Brussels, as Britain forges its own path for the first time since it joined the old European Economic Community in 1973.
Yesterday, he hailed regulatory approval of Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine, and a “new beginning” for a prosperous, more globally focused Britain.
As well as ensuring tariff- and quota-free access to the EU’s 450 million consumers, Britain has recently signed trade deals with countries including Japan, Canada, Singapore and Turkey.
It is also eyeing another with India, where Johnson plans to make his first major trip as prime minister next month, and with incoming US president Joe Biden’s administration.

Practical application
In the short term, all eyes will be closer to home and focused on how life outside the EU plays out in practical terms.
That includes disruption at the ports, which have stoked fears of food and medicine shortages, as well as delays to holidaymakers and business travellers used to seamless travel in the EU.
British fishermen are disgruntled at a compromise to allow continued access to EU boats in British waters.
The key financial services sector also faces an anxious wait to learn on what basis it can keep dealing with Europe, after being largely omitted from the trade deal.
Northern Ireland’s border with the Republic will be closely watched to ensure movement is unrestricted – a key plank of a 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of violence over British rule.
And in Scotland, where most opposed Brexit, Johnson faces a potential constitutional headache from a resurgent independence movement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-deep-regret-brexit-4877289-Nov2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has claimed he feels “deep regret” over the failure to implement his promise of Brexit by Halloween.
Johnson replied “of course, of course” when asked if he will apologise to those Conservative Party members who voted for him as they believed he would deliver the UK’s exit from the EU by 31 October.
The Prime Minister also said he can see “no reason whatsoever” about why the UK should extend the Brexit transition period beyond December 2020, adding: “If you get the right Parliament anything’s possible.
“But what you can do from the beginning is, of course, you can begin negotiating, not just with the EU but with countries around the world, and that’s one of the great opportunities that we have next year.”

Johnson earlier said the UK has secured a “great new deal”, telling Sophy Ridge this morning on Sky News: “We got Parliament to say it was a good deal, but then they refused to implement it.
Told he needed to take responsibility and could not just blame other people, Johnson said: “Well, I do. I do and I’m deeply, deeply disappointed.”
Asked if he was sorry, the Prime Minister said: “Yes, absolutely.”

“What we need to do now is get on and do it and the difference between this government and any other party is that only this government offers a deal that is ready to go and a way of delivering it immediately in the middle of December, if we’re lucky enough to get a majority, and, of course, it’s a big if and we’ll be working very hard,” Johnson said.
The Prime Minister added that it’s “necessary” to have a election because he’s “afraid, otherwise, what was going to happen was Parliament was going to rope-a-dope us”.
“They were going to say, ‘OK, you know, we’ll agree this, we’ll agree that’, but they weren’t actually going to give final approval, not to, by new year, not by 31 January, and then we would have had to go for another extension, and the reason why … it’s so painful to have these extensions, it’s not ‘cause of, you know, my promises or my ego or whatever, it’s because the uncertainty that it means for the whole country,” Johnson said.
“People just don’t know when Brexit is going to be done,” he added.
“That’s why I think that the offer from the Labour Party is so crazy and so debilitating because what they’re saying is have another referendum and keep the whole thing going.”

IT WAS SIMPLE, in the end.
As the opposition balkanised over how it would handle the country’s most divisive political issue in modern times, Boris Johnson - who this week alonepocketed a reporter’s phone,hid in a fridgeandcartoonishly bulldozed a polystyrene wall- managed to persuade voters to back his party with three short words: “Get Brexit Done”.
The result will see the Conservative Party re-elected with a majority of dozens of seats, and gives the Prime Minister a clear mandate to take the UK out of the EU by 31 January.
The fallout for Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who each supported different options to remain in the EU beyond that date, will continue long after the Brexit deadline passes.
Their defeat echoes the tepid Remain campaign during the 2016 referendum, when a lack of cohesion and failure to convince voters of the alternatives to leaving the EU swung the vote.
By contrast, Johnson’s oft-repeated – if somewhat meaningless – election slogan presented voters with a much more obvious choice.
Even Leo Varadkar, who did not endorse Johnson’s vow to “get Brexit done”, stressed the need for a decisive verdict ahead of an EU summit in Brussels yesterday.
“Obviously, it’s entirely a decision for the people of the UK to elect whatever government they want and I just hope the result is decisive so that we know where we’re going over the next few months,” he said.
That’s something which Simon Usherwood, a politics professor at the University of Surrey, identified as a huge positive for Johnson’s three-word catchphrase.
He toldThe Washington Postthat the slogan is “clear, memorable” and “taps into that sense of frustration that others feel that this is dragging on and on”.

Easy solutions
Curiously, Usherwood also said the phrase was “not inviting people to think about how it is done, or where it might lead” – not unlike Donald Trump’s successful 2016 slogan ‘Make America Great Again’.
During Trump’s presidential campaign, he offered easy solutions to complex issues, such as building a wall along the Mexican border, paid for by Mexico, to stop illegal immigration, and to bring jobs back to the US through unspecific trade deals.
Johnson’s pledge to “Get Brexit Done” offered equally obscure hope to voters in the UK.
Despite the wording of the Prime Minister’s promise, the 31 January deadline is only the end of the beginning of Britain’s departure from the EU.
Johnson still has to negotiate a new economic partnership with the bloc – Britain’s biggest trading partner – and he has given mixed signals about what he wants to achieve.
He had promised to forge a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, which would give Britain greater freedom from EU rules but would involve more barriers and costs to trade.
But campaigning at a factory in northeast England this week, he sought to reassure workers, saying his Brexit plan would “protect supply chains” and ensure a “zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship” with the EU.

Whatever the deal entails, Johnson has also insisted that he will reach it within a post-Brexit transition period scheduled to end on 31 December next year, which is seen as a very challenging timeframe.
It’s possible that he will extend this period, but if not, some experts have suggested that a limited trade deal is likely.
Of course, none of this nuance came through in the slogan Johnson has repeated ad nauseum over the last number of weeks.
Confused opposition strategies
But the Conservatives were arguably allowed to get away with such vagueness because of their rivals’ confused election strategies.
Jeremy Corbyn’s focus on the economy and public services like the NHS saw Labour eclipsed by Brexit -one analysis of social mediashowed that it was still the biggest issue for voters, despite the party’s efforts.
Related ReadsBoris Johnson has led the Tories to a thumping victory. Here's everything you need to knowUnseated: the high-profile losers in the UK election (including Jo Swinson and Nigel Dodds)Jeremy Corbyn says he intends to step down as Labour leader
This non-committal position gave voters no alternative, aside from the promise of another divisive referendum on the issue, a position infamously encapsulated by Corbyn during the election campaign when he refused to be drawn on how he would vote if a second plebiscite took place.
Moreover, by attempting to move the election away from the EU debate, the party lost an opportunity to scrutinse what Johnson really meant by “getting Brexit done”.
The Lib Dems, meanwhile, pledged to cancel Brexit altogether without a vote, which even some pro-EU supporters believed was undemocratic.
The party offered a complicated option to renegotiate Brexit with Brussels, and then put their deal to a public vote alongside an option to remain.
Simon Hix, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, described the tactic as a “disaster”.
“They already had all the hardcore remainers, they weren’t going to get any more,” he said.
Tony Travers of the London School of Economics attributed this dual failure of the “remain” parties to a split in the vote between them, giving the Tories the bulk of the Leave vote.
“The pro-Brexit Leave vote was always a bit more determined than the Remain vote. The Leave vote just wanted to go, didn’t like the EU. That’s played itself out again tonight.
“In the end, the Leave vote is more solid and more committed.”
Crucially, it was also clearer. That’s all it needed for Johnson to get this election done.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-commission-legal-action-uk-internal-market-bill-5219691-Oct2020/,"THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has begun legal action against the UK government over domestic legislation that threatens to overwrite the parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
In a statement issued this morning, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the bill was a breach of “good faith” provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement (Article 5), and would be “in full contradiction” of and “flagrantly violate” the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The European Commission said that representatives of the UK government has acknowledged this violation, and that its purpose was to allow it to depart “in a permanent way” from the obligations stemming from the Protocol on Northern Ireland.
A letter of formal notice has been sent to the UK government, which marks the beginning of a formal infringement process against the United Kingdom. It has one month to reply to today’s letter.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is in Brussels today for a special meeting of the European Council, toldRTÉ Newsthat the action was “to be expected”.
The legislation in question,the Internal Market Bill, threatens to overwrite elements of the Withdrawal Agreement and give unilateral power to a British minister to allocate State aid to firms in Northern Ireland, and decide what goods need customs declarations.

As part of the Withdrawal Agreement, the European Union needs to be consulted on these two issues to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted in the House of Commons that the bill “does break international law in a very specific and limited way”. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the bill would only be used as a “safety net” if the EU did not act in good faith.
Speaking toTheJournal.ieearlier this week, Fine Gael TD Neale Richmondsaidthat the EU will pursue “all legal options” if needs be.
“The EU can pursue and win a legal challenge – but the EU isn’t talking that up because we don’t need two loaded revolvers on the table.”

Reacting to today’s news, Richmondsaidthat the infringement action was “regrettable but inevitable”, and that international responsibilities “are binding”.
The Withdrawal Agreement provides that during the transition period (31 January – 31 December 2020), the Court of Justice of the European Union has jurisdiction in relation to the United Kingdom, as well as how the Withdrawal Agreement is interpreted and implemented.

The Internal Market Bill
On Tuesday, MPs passed the Internal Market Bill, meaning it progresses to the House of Lords as the next step. The Bill needs to be passed in both Houses to become law. But the Tory party don’t have a majority here, and so are expected to make substantial changes to the bill which would pass it back to the House of Commons.
Today Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, a Labour peer, said members of the House of Lords had “huge experience from being involved in the international domain”, and could reject the Bill as being a “step too far”.
Asked if peers will seek to amend the legislation, she said: “Forget about amending it, we are going to be voting against it and there will be opportunities to do that.”
She said the legislation represents a “flagrant breach of international law”, and accused Boris Johnson’s government of acting like US President Donald Trump’s administration in how they were “tearing up” the law.
“This is Trumpism, this is what this is, this is Trumpism, which is you tear down the very things that have been built up in the rules-based world since the end of the Second World War,” she told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-talks-virtually-impossible-coveney-5094670-May2020/,"TANAISTE AND FOREIGN Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said the Covid-19 pandemic has made the timeline for a UK-EU trade deal “virtually impossible”.
The UK government has insisted the transition period will not be extended beyond 2020, despite officials in London and Brussels admitting there has been little progress in the two rounds of formal talks held so far.
31 December is the deadline for the end of the transition period unless the UK agrees by June to extend it.
Coveney said the Covid-19 pandemic means the UK should seek an extension and progress so far this year has been much slower than the EU had hoped for.
“Covid-19 has made what is already a very, very difficult timeline to get agreement virtually impossible,” he said.
Asked if the UK government could be persuaded to extend the timeline, he said: “I think anybody looking at this from the outside could only conclude it makes sense to look for more time but the British government has decided that’s not what they want and they have made that very clear both publicly and privately.
“I wouldn’t be raising expectations around the British government agreeing to seeking more time.
“If we’re going to have any chance of persuading them to take more time then we need to be careful about how we do that because demanding it from them … almost as a concession to the EU, is certainly not the way to do it.”
Coveney was speaking at a video-conferencing seminar on the EU hosted by the International Institute of European Affairs (IIEA) today.
‘Break free from the EU’
He said the UK wants to “break free from the EU” and forge its own future.

“Talking about the UK being fully autonomous, protecting sovereignty … I get that language, that is what has driven Brexit in many ways,” he said.
“Breaking free from the European Union, not being a rule taker, that’s fine from a political narrative perspective.
“But you can’t have quota-free, tariff-free trade unless there is a level playing field.
“The EU can just never facilitate that and why would they … This is essentially the crux of the issue and if we can’t resolve it, there isn’t going to be a deal.”
He warned the Covid-19 pandemic means the “the path ahead is not clear” for the future of the bloc.
“This is a profound shock that has a direct impact on the life of every European,” he said.
“Even after the virus is defeated, its aftershocks and the new constraints it imposes will define what member states and the union do for the next decade.”
In terms of Brexit, he said June will be a “key moment” in the negotiations.
“Two further negotiating rounds will take place in the coming weeks,” he said.
“Michel Barnier has been very clear that we need to see much better engagement from the UK in these rounds.”
“At a high level conference, the EU and UK will jointly consider the progress made at that point and what this means for the period after. The end of June is also the last point at which the Joint Committee can decide to extend the transition period.
“This would have to be a decision made by the EU and UK jointly.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/1-6-million-christmas-bonus-this-week-5291811-Dec2020/,"THE DEPARTMENT OF Social Protection has issued the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to 348,256 people this week.
There are 3,168 less people on the PUP this week compared to last week, and the cost has decreased from €103.65 million to €102.67 million.
The sectors with the highest number of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment hasn’t changed since Level 5 restrictions were eased: accommodation and food service activities (101,335) followed by wholesale and retail trade (55,173) and other sectors eg, hairdressers and beauty salons (31,008).
This week’s figures are in addition to the 194,058 unemployed people who are on the Live Register as of the end of November.
All Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments issued will be in recipients’ bank accounts or at their local post office tomorrow.
Back to work
In the past seven days, some 28,682 people closed their PUP claim, with 25,350 stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work.
It is expected that many more people will return to work in the coming week; almost two thirds of these are female (16,876).

The top sectors from which employees closed their Pandemic Unemployment Payment to return to work are Wholesale and Retail Trade (7,298), Other Sectors e.g. hairdressers and beauty salons (6,635), Accommodation and Food Service Activities (3,968), and Administrative and Support Service Activities (1,077).
Dublin had the greatest number of people closing their claims (6,441), followed by Cork (3,265), Galway (1,458), Kildare (1,244) and Wexford (1,019).
Christmas Bonus Payment
Also, this week, just over 283,000 PUP recipients will receive the Christmas Bonus payment totalling €83.14 million.
The Christmas Bonus payment (an extra week’s payment) is normally made to people who are in receipt of long-term social welfare payments and who are entitled to a normal payment in respect of the week that the bonus is paid.
People who are unemployed for less than 12 months do not normally receive this payment. As an exceptional measure this year, the bonus payment will be made to people in receipt of PUP or a jobseeker’s payment for at least 4 months (17 weeks).
Social Protection Minister Humphreys said: “This week, the Christmas Bonus will be paid to over 1.6 million social welfare recipients, with payments totalling €390 million. This includes €83 million that is being paid to people receiving PUP payments alone.
“In total, over a half a billion euro has been paid out by the Department in the form of the Christmas bonus and PUP arrears.
“I am again encouraging people to spend this money locally. That way, you are helping your local economy and supporting small businesses.”
The Covid payment will be available until March of next year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/level-playing-field-uk-eu-talks-5099714-May2020/,"EU NEGOTIATOR MICHEL Barnier has said that no progress has been made between the EU and UK on the issue of the level playing field provision, and fisheries also remains a major stumbling block to a post-Brexit trade deal.
The UK negotiator David Frost said something similar: “I regret however that we made very little progress towards agreement on the most significant outstanding issues between us.”
This week marks the end of the penultimate round of Brexit talks, with a final week of talks planned for 1 June.Two of the EU’s red linesin going into trade talks – the level playing field and fisheries – now are the two biggest hurdles to an agreement before the end of the year.
The UK has until 30 June to decide if it will request an extension to the transition period, where it remains in the Single Market and Custom Union, and which is due to end on 31 December.
If no trade deal is struck, trade between the UK and EU will commence under harsh WTO terms from 1 January 2021.
Frost said in a statement that agreement could be found on the topics of law enforcement, civil nuclear, and aviation, but that there were other “major obstacles”.
“[These include] a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called ‘level playing-field’ which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes, in a way that is unprecedented in Free Trade and not envisaged in the Political Declaration.”
The ‘level playing-field’ provision had been a legally binding commitment in the Withdrawal Agreement, later moved to the Political Declaration, aimed at creating a base level of standards for labour rights, the environment, tax and state aid rules.
This is so that state aid rules aren’t used by either side to boost their own companies; labour rules aren’t lowered in order to increase company profits; or environmental standards aren’t reneged upon in order to become more competitive post-Brexit.

Frost said:
On this issue, Barnier said that “Open and fair competition is not nice to have, it is a must-have”.
He added that the UK referred to precedent during negotiations, asking for a ‘Canada-style’ deal. “But in many areas, it is demanding a lot more than Canada,” he said.
Fisheries is the other major stumbling block. Frost said that “the EU continues to insist on fisheries arrangements and access to UK fishing waters in a way that is incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state”.
Barnier said that the UK-EU’s “future partnership will be shaped by the choices we make this year together. The EU will not act in haste”.
EBS LiveEBS Live
In other parts of his statement given this afternoon after talks concluded, Barnier said that senior British minister Michael Gove had written to the EU regarding “concerns about the treatment of UK citizens in the EU”.
He also asked the UK to lay out its approach to fulfilling the Irish Protocol: “I would like to see that the approach would uphold the Good Friday Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions.”
Both Frost and Barnier agreed that there would need to be a change in approach before the next round of talks.
Frost said: “We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on 1 June. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s Member States and interested observers can see our approach in detail.”
And Barnier’s take was: “The next round must bring new dynamism, lets make a success of June by making the tangible progress we need. Until the very end, the EU will remain calm, firm on principles, and respectful.”

POST-BREXIT TRADE talks will continue as the European Commission President said it is “responsible at this point in time to go the extra mile”.
In a joint statement, Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to continue negotiations.
Earlier this week, theyset today as the deadlinefor reaching a decision on the future of trade negotiations.
Boris Johnson has suggested there is still hope of a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, but the two sides remain “very far apart”.
“I had a constructive and useful phone call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” von der Leyen said this afternoon.
She said they discussed the “major unsolved topics” hindering an agreement. These include fishing rights and the so-called level playing field ‘ratchet’ that would tie the UK to future EU standards.

“Our negotiation teams have been working day and night over the recent days,” she said.
She added that despite missing deadlines “over and over”, both leaders believe it is “responsible at this point in time to go the extra mile”.
The negotiations will continue in Brussels and von der Leyen said they will determine “whether an agreement can even at this late stage be reached.”
Johnson said the UK would not be walking away from the negotiating table and “where there is life, there is hope” but a no-deal outcome was still the most likely scenario.
He said the UK should get ready for the breakdown of talks, resulting in tariffs under World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms from January 1.

“The most likely thing now is, of course, that we have to get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms,” the Prime Minister said.
He also confirmed he has been rebuffed again in efforts to speak with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.
The Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the joint statement is a “good signal”.
“I think both sides do want a deal and they want a deal now to provide certainty for so many people who have been waiting for it for years,” said Coveney, speaking onThis Week on RTÉ Radio One.

Coveney believes that there are signs that both sides are working together to find a way forward, such as the change in language used by von der Leyen and Johnson.
“The fact that they had a joint statement today as well, is a sign that they are working to try to find a way forward together.
“It’s not going to be done simply by one side outmaneuvering the other, with a clear winner and a clear loser,” he said.
Earlier today, the Taoiseach Micheál Martinsaid it would bean “appalling failure of statecraft” if a trade deal is not reached.
On 31 January this year the UK officially left the European Union, resulting in its MEPs leaving the European Parliament and the UK no longer having an EU Commissioner.
Between that date and 31 December, known as the “transition period”, it remains part of the Single Market and Customs Union.
Trade talks have been ongoing during that time in London or Brussels.Over 95%of the issues have been agreed upon and drafted into a legal text.

Perhaps surprisingly, the possibility of the UK ever rejoining the EU has been discussed even among the pro-Brexit news outlets this week.
Unsurprisingly, the likes of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express say it’ll never happen butthe pro-remain Independent yesterday reportedthat “there are plausible cases to be made both for rejoining the bloc being a certainty and for a ‘Bre-entry’ being inconceivable”.

Brexit is back in the news this week after news broke about the latest trade talks between the EU and the UK.
Senior EU figures were dismayed after suggestionsemerged in the Financial Timesthat new Brexit legislation to be introduced tomorrow could override key elements of the Withdrawal Agreement brokered by Johnson last year.
The UK government will introduce the Internal Market Bill tomorrow. It aims to ensure goods from Northern Ireland continue to have unfettered access to the UK market while making clear EU state aid rules – which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland – will not apply in the rest of the UK.
Despite concerns being raised, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman insisted the “limited clarifications” in the legislation were necessary to ensure the gains from the Good Friday Agreement can be preserved in the event talks fail.
But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned there could be no backtracking by the UK on its previous commitments if it wanted to reach a free trade agreement. And Minister Simon Coveney warned that abandoning the agreement would be “a very unwise way to proceed”.

So things aren’t looking rosy in the run-up to tomorrow. In addition, the UK’s legal head Sir Jonathan Jones resigned over the issue.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION CHIEF Ursula von der Leyen has expressed “serious concern” over whether the bloc could conclude a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain within the 2020 deadline.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on 31 January, but will remain in a transitional arrangement until the end of next year while negotiators debate future trade ties.
“I am very worried given the little time we have,” von der Leyen told France’s Les Echos newspaper in an interview published today.

“It’s not only about negotiating a free trade deal but many other subjects. It seems to me that on both sides we must ask ourselves seriously if all these negotiations are feasible in such a short time,” she said.
“I believe that it would be reasonable to review things in the middle of the year, if necessary to see if an extension is needed.”
Under the withdrawal agreement which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has agreed with Europe but not yet pushed through parliament, the UK could ask for a one or two year extension.
But Johnson, who won a comfortable majority in the UK general election this month, insists he will not ask for more time and is preparing legislation to forbid such a move.
In this case, negotiators will only have 11 months to conclude a trade agreement, a task that officials on both sides have warned is extremely ambitious.

And if 2020 comes to an end with no deal concluded, Britain will sever ties with the huge EU single market with no follow-on deal to protect jobs and trade on both sides.
EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier this week that drafting and ratifying a post-Brexit deal by next year was an “immense challenge but we will give it our all”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-delays-irish-businesses-survey-customs-5280497-Nov2020/,"IRISH BUSINESSES HAVE been urged to step up Brexit planning after a survey found that only 42% believe they are fully prepared for customs changes.
A poll conducted among businesses by Enterprise Ireland revealed 44% of respondents have yet to decide how to pay customs charges, while 30% have yet to decide who will manage customs procedures.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has appealed to businesses to seek Government help if they need it, with just 35 days left until the Brexit changes kick in.
“This year has been devastating for many business owners. It would be understandable if Brexit was the last thing on their minds,” he said.
“However, Britain leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year will bring major changes. There is a real risk of delays and loss of income, which would be really damaging for any business.
“We are appealing to businesses to get ready now. There is a lot of help available.”
The survey of 600 companies showed that while more than half (52%) viewed customs and logistics as a priority, only 42% felt they were significantly or fully ready.

Over a fifth (22%) were still figuring out what they need to do in relation to priority issues.
Half of those businesses have yet to determine the potential tariff on their goods.
Trade Minister Robert Troy said he was concerned about reports from the Revenue Commissioners that significant numbers of businesses that trade with the UK have not registered for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number.
He said EORI numbers are “the first basic step needed to trade with the UK” and without them “they will simply be unable to transact business with the UK”.
He added: “Businesses need to devote time to take this first step and to decide how to manage their customs overheads from January 1.
“There are supports available to help businesses with customs which I urge them to explore, such as Enterprise Ireland’s Ready for Customs grant, which provides up to 9,000 euro per employee engaged in customs work.
“I strongly encourage businesses to learn about the options available to them and to consider availing of them.”
Varadkar added: “I know there has been a huge amount to contend with this year already, but I really urge businesses to prioritise getting ready now and use the help that is there.
“There are 35 days left until the end of the year and time is of the essence.”

A commemorative Brexit coin will come into circulation on exit day, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to be one of the first people to receive one of the newly-minted 50p pieces.
Johnson will chair a special meeting of his Cabinet in the north of England on 31 January. He will then make a special address to the nation in the evening.
The British government revealed the plans after coming under intense pressure to back a bid for Big Ben to chime at 11pm on 31 January.
Johnson said on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong” after Commons authorities ruled out the proposal because it could cost £500,000 (about €586,000).

Johnson has been accused of misleading the public over his “bung a bob” suggestion, after more than £245,000 (about €287,000) as donated to the campaign.

At 11pm, the Brexit transition period ends and the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union.
After this period a number of changes come into force, including that British driver licences used by those living in the State will no longer be legally recognised by Irish authorities.
As of October, an estimated 10,000-17,000 people were expected to make an application at the last minute to exchange their British driving licence for an Irish one.
Since 2018, the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) said that around 53,000 UK licences have been exchanged for the Irish version.
The mechanism that has allowed for the recognition and exchange of UK licences for an Irish licence expires tonight.

This evening, Eamon Ryan confirmed that he has signed an agreement with the UK to allow this exchange to continue.
“This agreement will be of particular benefit to anyone planning to live in Ireland as it will allow them to exchange their UK licence for an Irish driving licence,” the Department of Transport said in a statement.
However, anyone living in Ireland who has not yet exchanged their UK licence will no longer have a valid licence to drive here after tonight’s deadline.
The UK licence will only be valid for exchange purposes and the department said “it is imperative that it be exchanged immediately”.
The change only applied to UK licence holders living in the Republic of Ireland, not people living in Northern Ireland or people visiting or driving in the State.
People with an Irish driving licence who are resident in the UK don’t need to take any action as the UK accepts any EU member state driving licence as valid.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-uk-no-deal-eu-boris-johnson-5196903-Sep2020/,"THE UK’S CHIEF negotiator has said that the government is not “scared” of walking away from talks with the European Union without a deal and vowed not to blink in the final phase.
David Frost is due to hold another round of key negotiations in London with his counterpart Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief negotiator, next week as they look to agree a trade deal before autumn sets in.
In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Prime Minister’s Europe sherpa said the UK was preparing to leave the transition period “come what may” – even if that meant exiting with no deal, which officials have dubbed a so-called “Australian-style” arrangement.
Informal talks this week between Barnier and Frost failed to find a breakthrough ahead of the eighth round of formal negotiations, which begin tomorrow.
Both sides want a deal agreed next month in order to have it signed off by politicians on both sides of the Channel by the end of the transition period on 31 December.
Differences remain between the pair on issues such as fishing and the level of taxpayer support the UK will be able to provide for businesses.
Frost told the newspaper the UK would not agree to being a “client state” to the EU and said Theresa May’s administration had allowed Brussels to believe there could be an eleventh hour concession on a trade deal.
He said: “We came in after a government and negotiating team that had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments and the EU had learned not to take our word seriously.
“So a lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously.”
The former diplomat, who is soon to add national security adviser to his portfolio, continued: “We are not going to be a client state. We are not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws.”

He ruled out accepting level playing field terms that “lock us into the way the EU do things” and argued that wanting control over the country’s money and affairs “should not be controversial”.
“That’s what being an independent country is about, that’s what the British people voted for and that’s what will happen at the end of the year, come what may,” Frost added.

The Mail on Sunday reported that Downing Street has created a transition hub, with handpicked officials across government departments working to ensure the UK is ready to trade without a deal when the transition period ceases on 1 January 2021.
The unit will work with Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who has led the government’s work on no-deal preparations since last year.
“Obviously, lots of preparation was done last year, we are ramping up again and have been for some time under Michael Gove’s authority,” Frost said.
“I don’t think that we are scared of this at all. We want to get back the powers to control our borders and that is the most important thing.
“If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that.”
His comments came as the EU sought to dismiss a report in the Telegraph that Barnier would be “sidelined” before the talks were over so European leaders could thrash out a deal before the deadline.
But EU spokesman Sebastian Fischertweeted out yesterday: “Whoever wants to engage with the EU on Brexit needs to engage with Michel Barnier.
“He is the EU’s Brexit chief negotiator and enjoys the full trust, support and confidence of the EU 27.
“He has a proven track record of leading successful Brexit negotiations on behalf of the EU.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ian-blackmore-scottish-independence-westminster-5041233-Mar2020/,"THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL Party must take a “legitimate and legal route” for Scotland to gain independence, the party’s Westminster leader has said.
Ian Blackford has dismissed some calls from within the SNP for a “plan B” in the face of the UK Government’s continued refusal to allow a second independence referendum.
Long-serving MP Angus MacNeil has argued an SNP majority victory in next year’s Holyrood election should be seen as a mandate for independence if Boris Johnson continues to block a second referendum.
Speaking about Scottish independence at a London School of Economics (LSE) debate society event, Blackford stressed to “see this through” the party would have to adopt a “legitimate and legal route”.
He said the “path and destination of Scotland’s independence can only ever be found through the democratic will of our people”.
Blackford said it was via this “path of persuasion” that a majority of Scots would come round to leaving the rest of the UK.

He also said the UK “in its entirety, is immersed in a constitutional crisis” as a result of Brexit.
The Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP added: “The United Kingdom that Scotland voted to remain part of 2014 no longer exists.
“The union on these islands, as once was, is simply no more.”
Warning a no-deal Brexit was “still very much hanging over our people and our businesses”, Blackford said: “Scotland’s economic interests are no longer served by being a part of this union.
“The landscape of the last decade – of austerity, of Brexit, of deep uncertainty and instability – has come at a great cost.
“It is therefore little wonder that more and more of our citizens are seeking to escape that prolonged austerity and escape Brexit.
“Rather than the instability and limitations offered by the UK, an independent country now offers the Scottish people both stability and opportunity.”
He added: “If the 2016 Brexit referendum was the moment when our political futures met a point of divergence, we are now at the cusp of a moment of decision for Scotland’s people.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/immigration-uk-britain-5012840-Feb2020/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Feb 2020
CHANGES TO THE UK’s immigration rules could “spell absolute disaster” for the care system and risk farmers, builders and hospitality businesses being hit the hardest, industry leaders have warned.
The British government came under fire for telling employers they will “need to adjust” after deciding it will not offer visas to low-skilled migrant workers after Brexit.
A policy statement outlining plans for a new points-based system after freedom of movement ends said the economy needs to move away from a reliance on “cheap labour from Europe”.
The changes are designed to cut the number of low-skilled migrants entering Britain from the beginning of next year but aim to make it easier for higher-skilled workers to get UK visas.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned care, construction, hospitality, food and drink companies could be most affected by the changes.
Industry leaders hit out at the lack of provision for low-paid workers in the proposals while lawyers urged the Government “not to turn the tap off overnight” if companies struggle to recruit staff under the new system.
Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said the plans “spell absolute disaster for the care sector”.
Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, raised concerns that the proposals will “not meet the health and care needs of the population”.
The UK Homecare Association said it was “dismayed” by the Government’s decision, adding: “Cutting off the supply of prospective careworkers under a new migration system will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care.
“Telling employers to adjust, in a grossly underfunded care system, is simply irresponsible.”
National Farmers’ Union president Minette Batters expressed “serious concerns” about the Government’s “failure to recognise British food and farming’s needs” in the proposals.

“Firm and fair”
Mark Harrison, of the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), raised concerns about bakers, meat processors and workers producing food like cheese and pasta not qualifying under the new regime.
The “firm and fair” system will instead “attract the high-skilled workers we need to contribute to our economy, our communities and our public services”, according to the policy paper published on Tuesday evening.
But it added: “We will not introduce a general low-skilled or temporary work route.
“We need to shift the focus of our economy away from a reliance on cheap labour from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation.
“Employers will need to adjust.”
The EU Settlement Scheme, designed to give EU citizens permission to stay and work in the UK after Brexit, will “provide employers with flexibility to meet labour market demands”, the paper said.
Expanding a seasonal workers scheme and arrangements with eight countries to welcome young people to the UK will also help employers but they are expected to take “other measures to address shortages”, the paper said.
The document added: “We recognise that these proposals represent significant change for employers in the UK and we will deliver a comprehensive programme of communication and engagement in the coming months.
“We will keep labour market data under careful scrutiny to monitor any pressures in key sectors.”
“Full control”
Employers have until January 1 2021 to meet the requirements and ensure their staff have a right to work in the UK.
The plans will see the UK have “full control over who comes to this country” for the “first time in decades”, according to the paper.
EU and non-EU citizens will be treated equally with criminal background checks carried out on everyone coming to the UK – affecting applications of anyone who has been given a prison sentence of 12 months or more.
People who want to live and work in the UK will need to gain 70 points to be eligible to apply for a visa.

Points will be awarded for key requirements like being able to speak English to a certain level, having a job offer from an approved employer, and meeting a minimum salary threshold.
“Top priority” will be given to those with “the highest skills and the greatest talents”, like scientists, engineers and academics – who may not need a job offer to be allowed in.
Other points will be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation.
Announcing the policy during a visit to Imperial College in west London, Home Secretary Priti Patel told the PA news agency: “It is right that people should speak English before they come to our country, that they should have a sponsored route, whether it’s through employment or a sponsored route through an academic institution.”

Defending her government’s new immigration system this morning, Patel refused to be drawn on whether her parents would have been allowed into the UK under them.
Appearing on LBC this morning, host Nick Ferrari put it to the Patel that her parents who came from Uganda to the UK to become newsagent owners would not have qualified for a visa.
“The policies are changing. This is the point, we are changing our immigration policy, one that is fit the purpose for our economy that is based on skills. This is not about refugees and asylum and people that have been persecuted around the world, we must differentiate between the two,” Patel said.
The Liberal Democrats have claimed the proposals were based on “xenophobia” and not the “social and economic needs of our country”.
While Labour criticised the post-Brexit immigration system, saying it would need so many exemptions it would be “meaningless” and could make it difficult for the UK to attract workers.
The salary threshold for skilled migrants will be lowered to £25,600 for those coming to the UK with a job offer and there may be concessions for those earning no less than £20,480 as long as they still meet certain requirements or their occupation is short of staff.
Fees for work visas are expected to remain largely the same at around £1,200.
Last month, independent adviser the Migration Advisory Committee said replacing freedom of movement with a points-based immigration system after Brexit could cut economic growth and may have “zero effect” on providing more British jobs for British workers.

THE EU HAS rejected the latest UK offer on fishing but is ready to pursue a post-Brexit trade deal even beyond the end of the year, diplomats have said.
The EU’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier gave an update of the trade negotiations to ambassadors from the 27 European Union nations. He told reporterstodaythat “we are really in the crucial moment”.
According to sources at the meeting of ambassadors, Barnier said he could not guarantee there would be a deal, but that the EU’s “door will remain open”.
“EU negotiators are in a last push now to make progress and to clinch a deal acceptable for both sides,” Barnier said, according to several European diplomats.
According to the diplomats, Britain had suggested EU access to UK fish stocks be reduced by 35%, phased in over three years.
The EU had suggested a level of 25%, and over six years.
But crucially the British offer did not include ‘pelagic fish’ – those that swim freely away from coasts or the seabed – and had not addressed inshore fishing at all.
If the loss of access to pelagic species is included, the EU would lose 60% of its current catch, they said.
“In other words quite far outside the mandate of the EU negotiator,” one EU source said, adding: “Barnier has not asked for his mandate to change.”
Member states with northern fishing fleets like France, Denmark and the Netherlands are holding strongest on fish, but the EU remains broadly united, sources said.
EU and UK leaders ‘in close contact’
Earlier today, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in “close contact” with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen as the time to strike a post-Brexit trade deal.
Sources said the pair were speaking “from time to time given there isn’t long left” until the end of the Brexit transition period next week.
Barnier also briefed MEPs today as efforts continue to reach an agreement with the UK before the current trading arrangements expire on 31 December.
The deal needs to be ratified by the European Parliament and the House of Commons before it can be implemented from 11pm on 31 December. The deal also needs to be translated for MEPs before they cast their vote on it.
Around 97% of the trade deal has been agreed and drafted into a legal text; the outstanding issues are under the headings of governance (a way of resolving trade and standards disputes), fish (quotas and trade into the Single Market) and the level-playing field (fair trade rules and standards).
Reports have indicated that progress has been made on the level-playing field, and that attention has turned to overcoming differences on the number of fish EU boats will be allowed to capture in UK waters. Fisheries makes up less than 2% of the UK economy, but fishing villages around the UK represent Brexit strongholds.

Negotiations
Johnson has continued to insist the UK will “prosper mightily” without a deal, despite warning that it could add further damage to an economy already ravaged by coronavirus.
The UK leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December and will face tariffs and quotas on trade with the EU unless a deal is reached.
But talks in Brussels remain difficult, with “significant differences in key areas”, including fishing rights and rules on maintaining fair competition (known as the ‘level playing field’).

Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was asked on RTÉ’s Prime Time last Thursday whether there was ‘grandstanding’ by the British side over the state of negotiations.
He said that “there’s always a little bit of brinkmanship, there’s always a certain degree of political theatre” in trade talks.
Fisheries deal
Johnson spoke to European Commission chief von der Leyen yesterday, according to Politico, although No 10 would not publicly confirm the call or what they discussed.
The two leaders reportedly spoke about fresh proposals on fishing rights.
Downing Street insiders flatly rejected reports that there has been a breakthrough in the row over quotas.
Reports suggested the UK had offered a cut of around a third in the amount of fish EU vessels catch in British waters over a five-year period.
That is down from an initial demand to cut it by 60% over three years but the compromise was reportedly rejected by Brussels.

A Number 10 insider described the reported compromise as “bollocks” and officials have warned that significant differences remain between the two sides.
Barnier will update EU ambassadors at 3pm before addressing MEPs at 5pm.
At a press conference yesterday, Johnson said the position is “unchanged” and insisted the UK will thrive without a deal, relying on World Trade Organisation terms.
“There are problems. It’s vital that everyone understands that the UK has got to be able to control its own laws completely,” he said.
The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that a no-deal outcome could result in a 2% hit to gross domestic product – a measure of the size of the economy – in 2021.
That would equate to around £45 billion being wiped off the value of the UK economy.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-fisheries-5280827-Nov2020/,"BREXIT TALKS ARE to continue over the weekend after an offer was made by the EU in an attempt to resolve one of the three main obstacles remaining to an EU-UK trade deal.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier will return to London to pursue face-to-face trade talks, in what he described as a ‘last chance’ for a deal.
UK negotiator David Frostsaidthat talks were continuing because they still want a deal, but added that “for a deal to be possible it must fully respect UK sovereignty”.
“That is not just a word – it has practical consequences. That includes: controlling our borders; deciding ourselves on a robust and principled subsidy control system; and controlling our fishing waters.”
This afternoon,RTÉ News reportedthat Barnier offered the value of between 15-18% of the fish quota caught in UK waters by EU boats to the UK under a trade deal.
This would mean that EU fishers would retain 80% of the current catch in UK waters.
This offer was reported bythe UK Sun tabloid on Sunday, where it reported that the fisheries arrangement would be reviewed in several years’ time as part of the offer – but that the UK would reject the offer.

Talks this weekend
The UK leaves Europe’s trade and customs area in just five weeks on 31 December.
Although over 90% of matters have been agreed and drafted into a legal text, but trade talks are still stalled over fishing rights and fair trade rules (aka, the level-playing field).
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been resisting signing up to the EU’s vision of a level playing field, which would have trade penalties if either side diverges from the agreed standards.
He has also balked at giving EU fishing boats access to British waters.
Michel Barnier was expected to brief fishing ministers from the countries most affected by the issue, before heading to the British capital.
In a tweet, Barnier warned that the “same significant divergences persist” before he briefed a meeting of EU envoys carrying the same downbeat message.
“We are not far from the take it or leave it moment,” Barnier told ambassadors from member states, a European source familiar with the closed-door meeting told AFP.
Without a change of heart from London, “reaching a deal will be all but impossible,” another diplomat reported Barnier as saying.
Sources said EU ambassadors urged Barnier to update the EU’s “no-deal” contingency measures, with scenes of backed up lorries at the UK border points widely expected if talks fail.
In London, Johnson said it was up to the Europeans to make the move and claimed that Britain was quite ready if talks collapsed.

The “likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU,” he told reporters.
“Everybody’s working very hard, but clearly there are substantial and important differences to be bridged, but we’re getting on with it,” he said.
Time is running out
If a deal cannot be signed and ratified by 31 December, cross-Channel trade will face a tariff barrier and businesses on both sides will suffer.
The talks have already pushed on much longer than expected and time is running out for ratification of any deal by the European Parliament by the end of the year.
Members of the European Parliament, who will also confer with Barnier on Friday, have expressed frustration with the delays and may have to ratify a deal between Christmas and the New Year.
Despite the urgency, France on Thursday warned that the EU must not be “intimidated” by Britain’s refusal to compromise or lose its resolve in the final stretch.
“The British need an agreement more than we do. Europeans must be convinced of this, and convinced of their strength in these negotiations,” France’s Europe Minister Clement Beaune said.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT has sealed Britain’s departure from the EU, voting overwhelmingly to back Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.
MEPs, sitting in Brussels, voted by 621 to 49 in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, paving the way for Britain to leave on Friday with a deal in place.
There were emotional scenes in the parliament as the result was announced with MEPs linking hands to sing a final chorus of Auld Lang Syne.
In contrast, Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragewas greeted by cheers and the waving of Union Flags by his party’s MEPs as he declared Britain was “never coming back”.
It follows the completion last week of the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the British Parliament at Westminster.
It was formally signed by the presidents of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in Brussels and Johnson in Downing Street.

The agreement settles the terms of Britain’s departure, including future citizens’ rights, the arrangements on the Northern Ireland border and the UK’s divorce settlement.
It also allows for an 11-month transition period, during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules while talks take place on a free trade agreement.
Johnson has said he wants a comprehensive deal – covering all aspects of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, including security – by the end of the year.
He has been adamant that he will not contemplate any extension of the transition period beyond the end of 2020.
However, senior EU figures have repeatedly warned that reaching such a wide-ranging agreement will not be possible within such a tight timetable.
They have cautioned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy the “highest quality access” to European markets if – as Johnson is insisting – it refuses to align with EU rules after Brexit.

Speaking in Dublin, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the UK is very unlikely to seek an extension of the transition period by mid-summer which is when they would have to do it.
“Because of that timeline, the UK effectively decided to put themselves in a straitjacket in terms of time.

“The approach to the negotiations from the European Union will be tailored to that time and that will force choices, but it will also force a very intense negotiation very quickly.“The second point is that we are now moving very quickly in terms of the next stage of Brexit and we have been preparing for that for quite some time.”
Coveney went on to say that after the UK leaves the EU, discussions around the future will begin straight away.
He added: “On Monday, the Commission will publish their draft negotiating mandate, that will need to be approved by the EU leaders on 25 February, and that mandate will be wide ranging.
Frances Fitzgerald MEP / TwitterFrances Fitzgerald MEP / Twitter/ Twitter
Following today’s vote in the European Parliament, there will be a farewell ceremony for the British MEPs leaving for the last time.
Irish MEP Frances Fitzgerald said today’s vote represents “a distinct sadness for the European Union, a sadness shared by many UK citizens and Irish citizens”.
“Through today’s vote in the European Parliament, the UK’s membership of the EU will be brought to an end after 47 years. That is 47 years of cooperation and partnership, 47 years of breaking down borders and barriers, 47 years of working together for better social cohesion.

https://www.thejournal.ie/diplomat-rent-the-rising-dollar-and-a-brexit-inspired-passport-boom-behind-dfa-request-for-extra-e50-million-in-2020-4968469-Jan2020/,"INCREASED RENTS FOR diplomats, the rising dollar, a Brexit-inspired passport boom, and Ireland’s bid for the UN Security Council were among the reasons given by the Department of Foreign Affairs as they sought an extra €50 million in funding for this year.
The Department were in the end granted an extra €21 million for their main operating budget, with the possibility of a further €2 million if Ireland gains a seat on the UN security council in elections this June.
Records obtained under FOI reveal how they had originally looked for €50.1 million to respond to Brexit, pursue the government’s Global Island strategy, and for paying contributions to international bodies like the UN.
‘Tight fiscal position’
Correspondence with the Department of Public Expenditure shows how they were cautioned this amount would be “challenging” especially given the “extremely tight fiscal position” ahead of Budget 2020.
In a submission last September, Foreign Affairs had said they were looking for €7.3 million to maintain a “strong and adequately resourced” network of embassies and missions around the world.
They explained how they had been badly hit by foreign exchange losses with the value of the euro against the dollar falling by almost a quarter over the past five years.
“The Department buys the equivalent of €50 million US Dollars annually,” they said, “this change has resulted in cost increases of circa €12 million [annually].”
They said the decline in sterling could have balanced it out but that much of their passport income comes in pounds. They had not therefore “got the full benefit” of the “favourable movements” of sterling.
The Department also said they were paying rent of €17.5 million for ambassadors and diplomats across the globe and were faced with increased lease costs in many countries.
Local staff costs were also rising with an “average cost of living pay increase of 3%” predicted.
Of the €7.3 million they had looked for overall in this category, €3 million was allocated in the budget.
UN Security Council
The Department also wanted €6.5 million to cover the cost of increased passport demand due to Brexit with applications from the U.K. and the North predicted to continue growing.
They said staff would be needed to operate telephone and online customer support with new passport applications considered “more complex than the more straightforward renewals”.

The department also said they wanted to avoid a repeat of major passport delays in 2018 which ended with “an appearance” before the Public Accounts Committee to explain what had happened.
Operating costs were also rising, and the Department said that any increase in the budget for the passport service would be cost neutral as income from applications rose.
Of the €6.5 million that was looked for, €2 million – or less than a third – was granted according to figures provided by the department.
Another €4 million was requested to continue running citizen and business information campaigns surrounding Brexit and its aftermath.
The Department said: “Following review internally in the Department and emerging clarity on Brexit timelines this request was reviewed and €2 million was provided in the Budget allocation.”
A one-off payment of €4 million was granted in full for Ireland’s participation in EXPO 2020, which will be held in Dubai this October.
According to the submission, this will involve “delivering a facility and event space in Dubai with appropriate activities to promote Ireland in this significant international forum”.
The Department also looked for €2 million to bolster Ireland’s bid to become a member of the UN Security Council.
They said this would be used to support embassies in New York, Geneva, and also in Dublin to help mount a “strong and vigorous campaign”.
In a statement, the Department said these costs would only arise if Ireland was successful in its bid.
“As we will not know whether this funding will be required, it was agreed that this should not be provided at this stage,” they said.
Peacekeeping budget
A significant increase in Ireland’s contributions to international organisations was also predicted with the country’s fast-growing population and economy partly fuelling the rising costs.
The Department said the UN peacekeeping budget was particularly volatile with peacekeeping operations getting expanded and reduced.
In a statement, they said their budget for 2020 reflected the best estimate of how much Ireland would have to pay in contributions this year.
The Department added: “[Our] internal budgetary process commenced in August 2019 and an initial request to DPER [Dept of Public Expenditure] was submitted in early September 2019.
“The Department continued to work on refining and clarifying its Budget request right up until early October 2019.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-von-der-leyen-4967379-Jan2020/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that there has to be a level playing field in the Brexit negotiations to ensure the single market and customs union are “not diluted”.
The Taoiseach said there must be a common minimum standard so the United Kingdom does not attempt to “undercut” the EU over its labour and environmental standards.
Varadkar said the Brexit negotiations has reached the halfway point, adding that the next step is to negotiate a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.
He made the comments as the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen visited Ireland for the first time in her current role.
Varadkar said he wanted to restate Ireland’s appreciation for the EU’s solidarity on Brexit.
During this evening’s discussions – which took place in Government Buildings with protesting farmers making a raucous noise outside – Varadkar and Von der Leyen will discuss Brexit and the European Green Deal.
Varadkar said: “I really want to restate Ireland’s deep appreciation and thanks for the solidarity from the commission and the European institutions and other member states.
“Only as a result of that, we have a Withdrawal Agreement which assures us there is no hard border, that citizens’ rights are protected and the travel area between Britain and Ireland remains in place and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected.

“We saw a real demonstration of that in the fact that the institutions in Northern Ireland are now back up and running.
“I always felt removing uncertainty around Brexit was one of the crucial ingredients that is required to get the parties together again,” Varadkar said.
“The next step is negotiating a free trade agreement with the UK. When it comes to Brexit it is only half-time, and the next step is to negotiate a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.
“There also has to be a level playing field so that the single market and the customs union are not diluted.
“We must have common minimum standards so that the UK doesn’t attempt in any way to undercut the EU when it comes to labour and environmental standards.”
Speaking in Government Buildings in Dublin, von der Leyen said the UK will leave the EU in two weeks.
“There’s almost no other country in the European Union that is more affected by this decision than Ireland,” she added.
“That’s why Ireland and Northern Ireland were one of our top priorities during the withdrawal negotiations.
“We do not want a hard border, we delivered that. We’ve said that Ireland will stay at the heart of the European Union.
“I think the withdrawal negotiations and agreement were successful. The EU negotiated respectfully and fairly as we wanted an orderly exit. It’s very important to protect citizens’ rights.

“There are 3.5 million European Union citizens working and living in the UK.
“It’s very good that we have the reassurance that those people can live and work until the end of their lives in the UK.
“This was very important and one of the top priorities was to ensure peace and stability on the island.”
She thanked Varadkar for his work and leadership in the Brexit process, adding that the EU will watch over the implementation of Brexit “very closely”.
Von der Leyen added: “We have a wide-ranging (Brexit) agenda.
“We will have around eight months because the negotiation talks will start at the end of February or beginning of March.
“It’s not only trade, there are a lot of other topics too, including security.
“We have a plan but we have to work very hard to reach our goal.”

BRITISH AND EU negotiators will resume talks in Brussels in a “final throw of the dice” as they try to secure a post-Brexit trade deal.
With time rapidly running out before the Brexit transition period concludes at the end of the month, Lord Frost and Michel Barnier will meet in a last-ditch attempt to resolve the remaining issues.
Their return to the negotiating table follows an hour-long call on Saturday between Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, in which they agreed on a final push to get an agreement.
Ahead of the meeting however, British sources warned there was no guarantee they would succeed.
“This is the final throw of the dice,” said one UK source close to the negotiations.
“There is a fair deal to be done that works for both sides, but this will only happen if the EU is willing to respect the fundamental principles of sovereignty and control.”
In a joint statement following their call, Johnson and Von der Leyen acknowledged “significant differences” remained on the key issues of fishing rights, competition rules and the governance arrangements for any deal.
“Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved,” they said.
“Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved.
“We are therefore instructing our chief negotiators to reconvene tomorrow in Brussels. We will speak again on Monday evening.”
Continuing anger
The call took place after Mr Barnier and Lord Frost announced on Friday that they were putting the talks on “pause” after the latest round of negotiations failed to achieve breakthrough.
Lord Frost is now travelling back to Brussels with a small team of negotiators to attempt to work through the remaining issues.
While in the past much of the focus has been on the differences over fisheries, British sources indicated they would be looking particularly at the so-called “level playing field” rules on issues like state aid for business.
While the two sides have been circling round the key issues for months, it was is unclear from the statement whether either – or both – of the two leaders had been prepared to shift ground in a way that would enable them to bridge the gaps.

On the UK side there was continuing anger at what were being described as the EU’s “unprecedented and last-minute demands” which, it was said, would have tied Britain to EU regulations “in perpetuity”.
There were accusations that the EU was pursuing an “unrealistic” negotiating mandate and that the talks had got as far as they could without high level political intervention.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney warned that MEPs may not pass a post-Brexit trade deal if Westminster votes to pass two controversial bills.
He told RTÉ’s This Week programme that he could not see how the European Parliament would ratify a trade deal if MPs passed the Internal Markets Bill and the Taxation Bill this week.
“I think the British government understand that; I see this as a negotiating strategy to try to gain leverage in these negotiations,” he said.
“Instead of being distracted by those two pieces of legislation, I think the EU and the UK negotiators need to focus on getting a deal here that’s in the interests of both sides.”
Earlier, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called on negotiators to honour the Irish protocol in any deal that was agreed.
“We must continue to ensure that a final agreement defends the interests of the people of Ireland,” she said in a statement.
“Regardless of the outcome of these negotiations, it is essential that the Irish Protocol is fully honoured and implemented.”
Complicating factor
If there is no agreement, the UK will leave the European single market and customs union on 31 December and begin trading with the bloc on World Trade Organisation terms, with the imposition of tariffs and quotas.
EU leaders are due to meet on Thursday for a two-day summit in Brussels – their last scheduled gathering of the year – when they could sign-off on any agreement.
Time then has to be found for both Houses of Parliament in the UK and the European parliament to ratify it before the transition period expires – although there have been suggestions that could slip in the EU side.
In a further complicating factor, the UK Government is bringing back to the Commons legislation enabling it to override elements of Johnson’s “divorce” settlement with Brussels in breach of international law.
On Monday, MPs will vote on whether to overturn amendments by the House of Lords which removed the provisions in the Internal Market Bill relating to the Irish border.
MPs will then go on later in the week to consider the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill which contains further similar provisions.
The legislation has infuriated the EU and – if it is passed – could further sour the mood in the negotiations making a deal harder to reach.

https://www.thejournal.ie/anna-soubry-harassed-amy-dalla-mura-4936449-Dec2019/,"A BREXITEER WHO repeatedly harassed former MP Anna Soubry before standing against her in the general election has been jailed for 28 days.
Amy Dalla Mura, 56, targeted Soubry between January and March this year, turning up at events and calling her a “traitor” on live television, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.
Former MP Soubry, a Remainer who lost her Broxtowe seat while standing for the Independent Group for Change, said she was left “frightened” following the incidents.
Dalla Mura, of Eton Villas, Hove, claimed that her behaviour was politically motivated and did not accept it was frightening, despite standing in the general election in the same constituency as Soubry.
There were shouts of “democracy is dead” and “shame on you” from Dalla Mura and a packed public gallery when Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot gave her sentencing remarks today.
“Ever since the murder of Jo Cox, MPs no longer feel able to put up with sustained intimidation,” she said.
“You showed an obsession and fixation with Soubry which has led you to bullying and intimidating, and harassing, this now-ex MP for Broxtowe.”
Judge Arbuthnot told Westminster Magistrates’ Court the actions “stop ordinary, decent people” becoming MPs.
“This damages our democracy. Because who wants to put up with this sort of harassment?” she added.
Ahead of the sentencing, Judge Arbuthnot questioned why Dalla Mura had chosen to stand in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, just days after Soubry told the trial she feared for her safety following the defendant’s actions.
“It was hard to see how (Dalla Mura) couldn’t have understood it was frightening,” Judge Arbuthnot said.

“Your client then stood against her in Broxtowe. That was the most serious point, that someone had been fixated not with Brexit but with Soubry.
She added: “Anyone with any sense would say it’s not a good time. I don’t mind standing in Hove but certainly not in Broxtowe.”

Soubry, who became a target for Brexiteers after quitting the Tory party earlier this year, lost her seat to Conservative candidate Darren Henry after coming third in the general election, receiving some 4,668 votes.
Dalla Mura stood for the English Democrats and received 432 votes.
On 23 January, Dalla Mura disrupted an event where Soubry was speaking, repeatedly interrupting her and live streaming the event on Facebook.
Dalla Mura had to be escorted from the premises – the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel in central London – before the event could continue.
A second incident involved the 56-year-old branding Soubry a “traitor” as she gave a live television interview to BBC’s Newsnight in Parliament’s Central Lobby, while once again using her mobile phone to video her.
The defendant was asked to stop filming in the premises, as it is not permitted, and left after police officers attended the incident on 14 March.
A week later, on 22 March, Dalla Mura tried to intercept the MP outside the Cabinet Office in Westminster saying she wanted to “have a word”, but did not manage to find her.
Dalla Mura, who denied harassment but was found guilty following a trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, is banned from contacting Ms Soubry under a three-year restraining order.
Commander Adrian Usher, from the Metropolitan Police’s Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team, said: “Today’s outcome demonstrates the Met’s commitment to dealing robustly with incidents of harassment and abuse against MPs.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has attempted to heap more pressure on Labour and Jeremy Corbyn into agreeing to support a December election.
Labour look set to block Johnson’s bid for a pre-Christmas election with the Labour leader saying the threat of a no-deal Brexit has not yet receded.
Johnson said yesterday eveningthat he wanted to be “to be reasonable with parliament” and give it more time to scrutinise Brexit legislation if MPs submitted to a 12 December general election.
On the two previous occasions Johnson has attempted to call an election, Corbyn said Labour would back an election only if the threat of a no-deal Brexit is removed.
Last night he said last night that this is still his position.
“Take no-deal off the table and we absolutely support an election. I’ve been calling for an election ever since the last one because this country needs one in order to deal with all the social injustice issues, but no-deal must be taken off the table,” Corbyn stated.
Speaking onBBC’s Today programme this morning, Labour’s Diane Abbott said that the party wanted an “explicit commitment” that no-deal was of the table, adding “that might mean further legislation in parliament”.

Responding this afternoon, Johnson attempted to drive a wedge through Labour by saying the party is split on the question of holding an election.
“What we have is a great deal on the table. It’s a deal that’s been approved by parliament. And what I’m saying is that it’s up to the opposition, it’s up to Jeremy Corbyn to decide whether he wants to get this deal done or not,” Johnson told Sky News.

Speaking on ITV’s This Morning programme, Corbyn said that he’s happy to have an election but that the UK must first be protected from a damaging EU exit.
“He has got to understand that the protection of jobs, the protection of the peace process in Northern Ireland are very, very important. His proposals don’t do any of that,” Corbyn added about Johnson’s deal.
The space for an election is subject to the EU’s approval of another Brexit extension, which could come on Monday.
Earlier today,EU ambassadors agreed in principleto a Brexit extension but have postponed a decision on exactly how long it will last for.
The diplomats set an informal deadline of late Monday or early Tuesday to decide — just two days before the current Brexit deadline of 31 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lee-child-irish-passport-brexit-4905161-Nov2019/,"BRITISH WRITER LEE Child, creator of the Jack Reacher thriller series, is reportedly applying for an Irish passport due to Brexit.
Child, whose real name is James Grant, is a best-selling author of thriller novels, who has sold more than 100 million books.
He lives between the UK and the US but is entitled to an Irish passport as his father was born in Belfast.
The author said he wants an Irish passport to avoid the possibility of post-Brexit travel restrictions in Europe.

“I haven’t got the passport yet but I will do very soon, it feels like I’m cheating to be honest as I will get in the back door,” Child told the Irish Times.
He was speaking in Berlin as part of a European “Friendship Tour”, where Child and fellow British authors Kate Mosse, Jojo Moyes and Ken Follett spoke out against Brexit.
“It’s a silly and frustrating country, which is why I moved to America,” Child said.
He also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson, portraying him as an elitist:
The author’s pen name “Lee” comes from a family joke about a heard mispronunciation of the name of Renault’s Le Car, as “Lee Car”. The surname “Child” places his books on bookstore and library shelves between crime fiction greats Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie.
Child’s new book, Blue Moon, has just been released.

The Labour leader was questioned over fears for businesses, anti-Semitism, misogyny, freedom of speech and his support of ousted Bolivia president Evo Morales during a special episode of BBC’s Question Time tonight.

As they try to tip the balance in the campaign for the December 12 General Election, each leader was being quizzed for half-an-hour during the show hosted by Fiona Bruce in Sheffield.
Mr Corbyn, who plans to re-nationalise key utilities and increase corporation tax, went first and faced a barrage of tough questioning and groans.
He made his clearest comment to date over how he would act in another referendum, which Labour plans to hold between a new deal and the option to Remain within six months of taking power.
Having been asked how anyone could vote Labour without knowing what outcome he would campaign for, Mr Corbyn said that he would start by negotiating a “credible” Leave deal before he was interrupted by laughing.

“My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it,” he continued.
“And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit.”","7.46pm, 22 Nov 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-plan-4920988-Dec2019/,"JEREMY CORBYN SAYS he has obtained a confidential report which “drives a coach and horses” through Boris Johnson’s claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea under his Brexit plan.
The Labour leader said the leaked document, marked “official, sensitive”, provides the “cold, hard evidence” that the Prime Minister has been “misleading” people about his withdrawal deal.
Brandishing a document, titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UK Internal Market, at a press conference in central London, Corbyn said it was proof that there would be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit.
“What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson’s own government, marked ‘official, sensitive’, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,” he said.
“This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country.”
The 15-page document appeared to be a slideshow prepared by the Treasury and is titled “NI Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UKIM”.
It came as the Tories were dealt a blow by former British prime minister Sir John Major who endorsed three ex-Conservative independent candidates running against Labour in the election.
Corbyn said Johnson’s Brexit deal will be “disastrous for businesses and jobs all across the UK” and claimed the Government’s confidential report “confirms this”.
The document, he said, paints a “damning picture” of the Prime Minister’s deal, especially when it comes to Northern Ireland.

“We have now caught Johnson red-handed misrepresenting his own Brexit deal,” he told journalists.
No checks

Johnson had said there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain under his exit terms, but Corbyn said the document suggests that is not true.
The Labour leader said page five of the document states: “There will be customs declarations and security checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”
He added: “It is there in black and white. It says there will be customs declarations, absolutely clearly, for trade going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.
“The Government cannot rule out regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, and animal and public health checks also.
“For trade going the other way, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there will be all of the above plus potentially damaging tariffs.”
Corbyn said the report claimed Johnson’s deal will be “highly disruptive to the Northern Irish economy”.
“It says this deal will be the equivalent of imposing tariffs on 30% of all purchases made in Northern Ireland,” he said.
The Labour leader also said the document warns of the potential for fraud, saying Northern Ireland could become a “backdoor into the GB market for the avoidance of import duties”.

Deal
Last month Johnson suggested his Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had been wrong to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the Brexit deal struck with the EU.
Barclay previously told MPs that “some information” and “minimal targeted interventions” would be required on goods travelling between the two areas of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels’ trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items as part of the exit terms.
The news today comes ahead of the final scheduled head-to-head debate between Corbyn and Johnson this evening, and after the PM wasberated by Andrew Neilfor refusing to do an interview on his BBC show.
Neil said that if the Prime Minister is expected to face the likes of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin then he should be able to sit down for a half-hour interview with him.
Johnson has been accused of “running scared” from scrutiny by avoiding in-depth questioning from the veteran broadcaster, even though rival leaders, including Corbyn, have taken part.
The Prime Minister, who has also refused to do an interview on ITV’s Julie Etchingham, will debate with Corbyn on the BBC tonight, with less than a week to polling day.
Some 6.7 million people tuned in when the pair took part in a head-to-head debate on ITV last month.

CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATION THAT would override elements of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal with Brussels and breach international law will be published later today.
Downing Street had insisted changes in the Internal Market Bill were simply “limited clarifications” to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if they failed to secure a free trade deal with the EU.
But Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis provoked a furious reaction when he confirmed to MPs yesterday that the legislation would breach international law in a “very specific and limited way”.
The bill, which will be tabled this afternoon, is intended to ensure Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy unfettered access to markets in the rest of the UK.
Speaking on Newstalk and RTE’s Morning Ireland today, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said that the comments were “extraordinary”.
He said that the remarks set off “alarm bells” in Dublin, and believes that the comments have backfired.

Governments around the world are scratching their heads wondering if they should enter contracts with the UK if this is their attitude, Varadkar said.
“You either adhere to the rule of law or you don’t, and you respect international treaties or you don’t. There’s no middle way.”
“To me, Britain is a country that’s always been an honorable country, and is inhabited by very honest people – it’s not a rogue state. It’s pretty extraordinary, the most benign interpretation I can put on it is that it’s gamesmanship,” Varadkar added.
Varadkar said that the “government in Britain a year ago showed its ability to play hardball, threatened to go Kamikaze in order to help secure the withdrawal agreement which is part of negotiation, it might just be another manifestation of that”.
“I hope that’s what it is,” he said.
Lewis said the powers the government was taking would enable ministers to “dis-apply” the EU legal concept of “direct effect” – which requires the enforcement of EU law – in “certain, very tightly defined circumstances”.
His admission led to Conservative former prime minister Theresa May warning the government was in danger of losing the trust of other countries that it would honour its international agreements, while Labour described the admission as “absolutely astonishing”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer urged Johnson not to “reopen old wounds” and to instead “get a deal, move on and concentrate on defeating [coronavirus]”.

The row erupted as the pound plummeted against the US dollar amid fears that Johnson’s chances of securing a post-Brexit free trade deal with the EU were diminishing.
It followed the shock announcement that the head of the UK government’s Legal Department Sir Jonathan Jones had become the latest senior civil servant to quit his post.
No reason was given for his resignation, but the Financial Times reported that he was “very unhappy” with the proposed changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I can confirm that he is stepping down and we would thank him for his years of hard service and wish him well for the future.”
Meanwhile, the latest round of talks on a post-Brexit trade deal continue in London between the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the UK’s David Frost.

The Prime Minister refused to apologise over his use of language and defended Tory austerity during a special episode ofBBC’s Question Timethis evening.
In their campaign for the 12 December General Election, the leaders of the four main political parties were quizzed for half-an-hour apiece during the programme. The highest levels of groaning and jeering were reserved for the frontrunners in the Sheffield studio.
Johnson was asked to apologise and admit he had personally contributed to “racist rhetoric” during his journalistic work.

Johnson said: “I have written many millions of words in my life as a journalist and I have… genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that is my intention.
“What I will say because I think you are referring to a particular article of a year or so ago,” he said.
The audience scoffed after Johnson continued: “If you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases, there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that.”
Earlier during the programme, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn pledged to adopt a “neutral stance” in another EU referendum under the party. He was questions over fears for businesses, anti-Semitism and freedom of speech.
Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon said she would never put a Conservative prime minister into power – saying she could “not in good conscience” ever put Boris Johnson into Number 10.
Sturgeon  said she doesn’t believe Scottish independence from the UK is “turning our back” on the close ties between the nations.
Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson ruled out any coalition between her party and the Conservatives, saying the party was “off with Nigel Farage” and “so far off the chart”. She previously said the party would not put Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10.","10.15pm, 22 Nov 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-boris-johnson-4923788-Dec2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS been accused of breaking his word over his commitment to protect the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by DUP leader Arlene Foster.
As the Prime Minister faced fresh questions over trade within the UK after Brexit, Foster said government officials had told her there would need to be checks.
Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about the sense of some in the unionist community that Johnson’s deal was a “betrayal”, she said: “I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the prime minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland.
She said the DUP had been told by UK customs officials before the PM announced his deal that there would be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.
Foster said a lack of free-flowing trade would cause “economic instability in Northern Ireland, which will lead to higher costs for retailers which will lead to less choice for our consumers in Northern Ireland”.
“And all of that leads me to say that we need to – after this election is over, and I’m not prejudging the election in any one way, every vote will count – but what is important is that we have a strong team of DUP MPs back in Westminster to speak up for Northern Ireland.”
Foster has kept a low profile in the election campaign thus far, and her intervention will be seen by some as an attempt to highlight a need for the DUP’s role in holding sway in the event of a hung parliament.
Her comments came afterLabour released a leaked government report last weekthat concluded customs checks and possibly even tariffs could be required on goods travelling in both directions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

But Johnson told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme over the weekend that the report was “wrong” and added that the six counties would have “unfettered access” to the UK market.
TheJournal.iepreviously factchecked Johnson’s claim and found that while checks may be avoided going eastwards, it’srather impossible to say the same about goods going in the opposite direction.
With just a few days to go until polls open, the Johnson is embarking on a blitz of Labour’s heartlands, attacking  Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position.
After previously vowing that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October, he has now vowed to leave January 31.
Johnson also says he will finalise a trade deal with Brussels within 11 months to meet the transition period deadline.
Arrangements would also need to be signed off that allow Northern Ireland to continue to follow Brussels and Dublin rules on the trade of goods to ensure there is no hard border.
But a Whitehall report seen by the Financial Times highlights the difficultly involved for the UK government in bringing in the infrastructure in time for the UK to leave when the PM has pledged.
A Department for Exiting the European Union document, according to the FT, states that: “Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the (Northern Ireland) protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have agreed to decide by Sunday whether their Brexit talks are worth continuing, Downing Street said, noting “very large gaps” still remain.
The two leaders met this evening to try to salvage negotiations following stalled talks just weeks ahead of the end of the transition period on 31 December.
Over a lengthy dinner in Brussels, the two leaders “had a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations”, a senior Number 10 source said.
“Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged.”
The leaders agreed to further discussions by their negotiating teams “over the next few days”, the source said.
“The PM does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested.
“The PM and VDL agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks.”
In a statement after the meeting, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said: “We had a lively and interesting discussion on the state of play across the list of outstanding issues.
“We gained a clear understanding of each other’s positions. They remain far apart.
“We agreed that the teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues.
“We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend.”

Stumbling block
The so-called level playing field has been a key stumbling block in the talks, as has the extent of EU access to British fishing waters.
Johnson said Brussels’ proposals on fishing would mean Britain would be “the only country in the world not to have sovereign control over its fishing waters”.
“These are not terms that any prime minister of this country should accept,” he told MPs in his weekly question and answer session.

Britain formally left the EU on 31 January, nearly four years after a referendum on membership that divided the country and paralysed politics.
The end of a transition period, designed to allow both sides to thrash out the terms of their new relationship, is approaching on 31 December, making agreement on a deal more urgent.
Whatever happens, Britain will leave the European customs union and single market. Johnson said deal or no deal, the country will “prosper mightily”.
By retaking control of UK money, borders and laws, “we will seize all of the opportunities that Brexit brings”, he said.
But Johnson is under strong pressure from businesses, which want greater clarity on the new rules that will apply from 1 January.
Dinner
TwitterTwitter
The Prime Minister and the EU chief were to discuss ongoing attempts to reach a breakthrough on a post-Brexit trade deal, although the meal was a formal negotiating session.
Ahead of the meeting, Von der Leyen said that she was “looking forward” to welcoming the British Prime Minister, tweeting: “We will continue our discussion on the Partnership Agreement.”
Downing Street hoped the dinner could pave the way for talks between negotiators Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost to resume, but there were warnings that Johnson and von der Leyen must find the will to break the deadlock first.
However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil yesterday that the move should not be interpreted as a signal that a deal was imminent.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that yesterday was a “historic day” that would ensure the Northern Ireland Protocol would be respected regardless of the outcome of trade talks.
The Fine Gael leader also said he agreed with a previous suggestion by Martin that there was a “50-50″ chance of a deal being reached.
“I think that assessment is correct,” Varadkar said.
At the Fine Gael parliamentary party tonight, Varadkar said the divorce deal agreed with former Prime Minister Theresa May three years ago had proved to be bulletproof.
This is based on there being no hard border on the island of Ireland and access to the European Single Market and Common Travel Area have been protected.
The Fine Gael leader told party colleagues that this progress was made because of EU solidarity and unity.
Varadkar added that there may not be a breakthrough on trade negotiations tonight, but negotiations would continue.

The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned the bloc’s foreign ministers that he now believes a no-deal Brexit is more likely than a trade agreement being reached by the end of the transition period on 31 December.
Leaders of the EU’s 27 member states will gather in Brussels tomorrow for a two-day summit, potentially giving further political impetus for a deal.
Senior UK Cabinet minister Michael Gove said this morning that the EU will have to give ground if there is to be any hope of a breakthrough in the crunch talks.
Asked about Barnier’s assessment, he said: “No, I don’t think it is right to say that yet.”
“I think that tonight there is an opportunity for the Prime Minister and Ursula von der Leyen, and they have a good relationship, to thrash out a potential way through,” he told BBC Radio 4.
Gove also said that von der Leyen would “want to ensure that all EU member states recognise that a deal is in everyone’s interest and that will require a degree of movement for some on the EU side”.
That comment could be seen as a reference to French warnings that President Emmanuel Macron could veto a deal, with Paris especially concerned about the issue of fishing rights – one of the main obstacles to an agreement
Talks paused
The EU and UK are hoping to establish a trade relationship with zero tariffs and zero quotas, which would avoid further disruptions from 1 January.
Talks between Frost and Barnier paused after both sides moved as close towards a deal as political red lines would allow.
Though a deal is reportedly 97% agreed, political leaders must make decisions on the final issues.
Negotiations have faltered on the same issues that have plagued negotiations from the start: fishing rights; the level playing field measures aimed at preventing the UK undercutting the EU on standards and state subsidies; and the way for trade disputes to be discussed and resolved.
Johnson said yesterday that trade talks with the EU are proving “very tricky”, but that he hoped the “power of sweet reason” would triumph.
A spokesperson for the Prime Minister also said that Frost was set to return to London last night to discuss the remaining differences in reaching a free trade deal with Johnson.
Today’s meeting between Johnson and von der Leyen follows an announcement yesterday by the UK that it would drop clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would have allowed ministers to break international law.
It means that the Northern Ireland Protocol – which would mean goods travelling from Britain to Ireland via the North will be checked after they cross the Irish Sea – can be implemented in practice.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-uk-house-of-lords-5111417-Jun2020/,"THE CONCERNS OF businesses in Northern Ireland were not sufficiently addressed in the UK’s protocol plan for trade within the island of Ireland and the UK after the Brexit transition period, the EU committee in the British House of Lords has said.
Today the committee published its report on the protocol. It said the British government’s proposal “failed to provide the clarity that Northern Ireland needs”.
Almost two weeks ago, the UK published its proposal for the Northern Ireland protocol and how trade could operate between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and Great Britain after the Brexit transition period.
The House of Lords committee is now asking the British government and the EU to address the concerns of businesses in NI about customs processing on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.
It said that uncertainty and lack of time, combined with the “shock” of the pandemic, pose a “potent threat to economic prosperity and political stability” in the North.
The committee said the British government has yet to explain what any new customs checks and regulatory processes on goods moving from Britain to NI will mean for businesses and transport providers.
Speaking on the day the protocol proposal was released, senior British minister Michael Govetold the House of Commonsthat the “command paper” implements the protocol “in a way that will protect the people and economy of Northern Ireland”.

The main aspects of the proposal focus on unfettered access from NI to the rest of the UK, no tariffs on goods going from Britain to NI, no new customs infrastructure and preferential tariffs from any new free trade agreements the UK makes with other countries.
However, there will be declaration on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The UK left the European Union in January this year and it is due to enter a new relationship, if an agreement is formed, on 1 January next year.
Chair of the House of Lords EU committee, Lord Kinnoull,said it is still not clear what the protocol plan will mean for businesses operating in or trading with NI seven months ahead of it potentially taking effect.
“Two weeks ago, the government published a command paper to explain its approach to the protocol,” he said.
Kinnoull said the committee warned in 2016 of the danger of NI becoming “collateral damage”of Brexit.
He added that the EU and the British government need to “urgently” work together to provide clear guidance and a “proportionate approach” to applying the protocol.
“Failure on either side would threaten Northern Ireland’s prosperity and stability,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-cummings-set-to-leave-downing-street-by-christmas-5265222-Nov2020/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S MOST senior adviser Dominic Cummings is reportedly set to leave his Downing Street position by the end of the year.
Cummings told the BBC that “rumours of me threatening to resign are invented” after speculation that he would follow communications director Lee Cain in leaving Number 10.
However, he said that his “position hasn’t changed since my January blog” when he wrote that he hoped to make himself “largely redundant” by the end of 2020.
The BBC also quoted a Downing Street source as saying Cummings would be “out of Government” by Christmas.
It comes just a day after a bitter power struggle in Number 10 led to the resignation of Cain.
He had been offered the post of chief of staff but a backlash among Tories and Johnson’s inner circle ultimately led him on Wednesday to announce his departure from Number 10 rather than a promotion.
Cummings and Cain are close political allies, having worked together since the Brexit campaign. Cummings was said to be unhappy with the way his friend had been treated.
The Telegraph reported an “associate” of Cain as saying the communication chief’s departure was the “beginning of the end for Dom”.
“Lee is the person who has been covering Dom’s flank 24 hours a day and he will soon be gone,” the source told the paper.

Conservative MPs have urged Johnson to use events to reshape the team inside Downing Street and reconnect with the parliamentary party, some of whom feel he has been “lost” to advisers over the past year.

Charles Walker, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Two’s Newsnight: “If Boris, the Prime Minister, gets the chief of staff position right – he gets the right person in that position – he will plant his standard firmly back in the middle of the Conservative parliamentary party.
“We feel we’ve lost him for the last year. We want him back – he belongs to us, he doesn’t belong to the advisers, he belongs to the parliamentary party that elected him and he got elected at the last general election.”
The infighting spilling into the open sparked criticism from Tory MPs.
Conservative backbencher Sir Roger Gale told the PA news agency: “The Government, and Downing Street particularly, should be concentrating all of its efforts on the pandemic and on the end game of Brexit, and frankly this is a distraction that cannot and should not be allowed to take place and the Prime Minister has got to get a grip on it.”
And senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood told Sky News: “Let’s move a little bit away from Eastenders and more to the West Wing.”
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman James Slack, who confirmed he would be replacing Cain when he departs in the new year, insisted that Johnson was not being distracted from the national crisis by the bitter row.
“You’ve seen from the Prime Minister this week that he’s absolutely focused on taking all the steps that are required to equip the country to beat coronavirus,” the spokesman said on Thursday.
Slack, a former Daily Mail journalist who also served as Theresa May’s official spokesman when she led the country, said he would remain a civil servant when he succeeds Cain.
In his resignation statement, Cain confirmed he had been offered a promotion to the key position of the Prime Minister’s chief of staff.
The move – which would have meant he was one of just a handful of people in No 10 with direct one-to-one access to Johnson – was seen as entrenching the grip of the Vote Leave faction on the Downing Street operation.
However, it ran into immediate resistance, with Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds – who has clashed in the past with Cummings – reportedly strongly opposed to the appointment.
Symonds is a former Tory press chief who has served as a special adviser in previous governments.
Allegra Stratton, the former broadcaster brought in to host televised No 10 news conferences from next year, was also said to have objected to the appointment.

https://www.the42.ie/league-of-ireland-brexit-5000986-Feb2020/,"THE IMPACT OF Brexit on Irish football remains to be seen, but there is a growing sense that it may not necessarily have a detrimental effect.
One of the potential ramifications is that promising young players won’t be allowed to leave the countryuntil their 18th birthday.
The Football Association of Ireland’s Interim Deputy CEO, Niall Quinn, says he is as in the dark as everyone else in terms of what will happen next.
However, the former Arsenal, Man City and Sunderland forward has routinely talked up the benefits of young Irish footballers completing their Leaving Cert and prioritising education over their careers to a degree.
“Personally, I want to see any young person who leaves here to go to England with an education,” Quinn said recently.
“I was robbed in some ways of my education. I was in sixth year when I left, I could have stayed, but I didn’t. And I always regret that — I’ll get back and do it one day.
“So I don’t have the correct answer for that right now [how the FAI will address the footballing ramifications of Brexit], but I would welcome a lift in the age to 18 of any player that goes over to sign full time.”
Dundalk boss Vinny Perth also believes British football’s difficulty could be the League of Ireland’s opportunity.
The coach says that the Lilywhites’ performances in Europe in recent years, and particularly their memorable 2016 Europa League run, has raised the profile of the league elsewhere.
“I spoke to many players in the off-season, I spoke to an agent from Serbia and Croatia, and a lot of the players on his books know who Dundalk are, because of what we have done in Europe.

“As a league, we are known in Europe and people will see it as an opportunity, particularly with Brexit. I think we are on the cusp of a wave. Obviously off the pitch it has been a horrendous 12 months for Irish football but I think that on the pitch it has been a great 12 months and now we can kick on if we do our business right.”
Perth therefore agrees that Brexit could potentially be beneficial to Irish football.
“It can be, yes. But what we have tended to find — we have a young guy called Mark Hanratty, he’s been in and around the first team. He’s from Malahide, never been capped underage, but he has come in to the first team and trained with us and really flourished. So I would say to you that this country seems to be really good at developing late developers, if that makes sense, and we need to be careful.
“You look at the Kevin Doyles, I’m going to forget some here but, your James McCleans, people who have been great for Irish football over many years, we have to be able to develop them. But I think there’s the money and I think there would be the appetite to create an U23 league and even, God forbid we’d mention it, it could be developed with the north and it could be a starting point for people looking for competitive games for players. Both of us are in the same boat and for me, that would be a great starting point for where we go with Irish football, both north and south of the border.”

Ronan Finn is one of those who went to England at a young age, but returned after it didn’t work out. Having departed Cambridge United, he studied in UCD and has enjoyed a successful League of Ireland career since then. Now 32, he is captain of Shamrock Rovers, having also had stints at UCD, Sporting Fingal and Dundalk.
“As I kid I would have been [playing in England]. I then came back and did my degree in UCD. It went from there. I did a route of education, combining it with football, which for me was the right way to go. Everyone has different ways of getting to the top in the League of Ireland.
“Luckily, I’ve always played at a club in the last 10 years that’s wanted to achieve success. I’m at a club now, we’re in a really good place on and off the pitch, and it’s good times to be a Shamrock Rovers player.”
St Kevin’s Boys youth product Robbie McCourt spent three years in West Brom’s underage set-up before returning home, signing with Bohemians initially before joining Waterford ahead of this season. He suspects Brexit will have a positive impact on Irish football
Personally, I think it’s not such a bad thing. The league is getting better and there are more players coming back from England, so if you have young lads coming up and training with League of Ireland first teams, it can only help them, because there’s nothing more a young lad wants to do then play first-team football, whatever level it is.”
Conversely, Bohemians’ Danny Grant was one of those who never made the move to England, and doesn’t feel especially worse off as a result, even if it was somewhat frustrating at the time seeing friends move abroad while he stayed in Dublin.
“When you’re that young, you’re not really as well educated as you should be, and everybody kind of just wants to get across the water, rush it, and they want to go as soon as possible.
“But I don’t think that’s the right move for everybody. You see so many people come back and it’s probably benefited me in a way, that I didn’t go over that early — the opportunity is still there to go over.

“I would like to go over, when I’m maybe 22-23. I’ll get my college degree done and then maybe if I can get a move, that’d be great. But you know so many young people go over and end up coming back, so you’re not really mature enough for me, at 13-14, going over to England.
“It is getting better [in terms of the education offered to young footballers in Britain], but I think it’s important for boys to have an education, because at the end of the day, football might not last forever.”
Alex O'Hanlon signed with Liverpool as a youngster but has since moved back to Ireland.EMPICS SportEMPICS Sport
One player who did move to Britain at a young age and now partially regrets that decision is Alex O’Hanlon.
The Blanchardstown native spent a couple of years at Liverpool, before ultimately being let go. Since then, the 23-year-old has had brief stints at St Patrick’s Athletic and Glentoran, and is currently on the books at Shelbourne, while undertaking a FÁS course in his spare time and possibly looking at a degree in Business Managament thereafter.
“I started playing football at five. All I knew was football. That’s all I was really good at,” he recalls.
“I started out with Huntstown Villa. Then I moved to Home Farm when I was nine. I played for Shels when I was 10. Then I went Kevin’s when I was 13. That’s when I got my move to Liverpool.
“I was going on trials to other clubs. I played in the Hibernia Trophy for Ireland. Luckily for me, I played really well in most of those games and that’s how I got most of my trials in England.
“You need to have something to fall back on. You can’t just have football. That’s what I kind of regret.
“Coming back now, I’m starting the college route and the education route all over again. [Staying in Ireland before turning 18] is something that would be good for players now, going over with their Leaving Cert behind them.”
Adapting to the challenges of the League of Ireland isn’t always easy, particularly when youngsters have grown accustomed to the less pressurised environment of U23s football.
“You have to bring yourself down, because over in England, the players are at a higher level.

“When I came back, I had very high standards of training. It’s very hard to bring yourself back down, but that’s what you have to do when you come [back to Ireland].”
And did it take O’Hanlon a while to get used to this different environment?
“Yeah, because 23s football over in England is kind of fake. You’re playing for nothing. You’re just playing for yourself really.
“League of Ireland is harder than people think. People think they’re going to come back and rip it up. But it’s better than people give it credit for.”
And as for advice to other aspiring young footballers, who may or may not end up going to Britain?
“Just keep your head down and never doubt yourself. If a manager says that you’re not good enough, always believe in your ability.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/scottish-independence-irish-unity-election-4931694-Dec2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON MAYhave clinched the Tory majorityhe wished for, but results in Scotland and Northern Ireland bring the future of the UK back into focus.
The SNP made a series of gains in Scotland, with leader Nicola Sturgeon declaring that she has a “renewed, refreshed and strengthened” mandate for a second vote on Scottish independence.
And in the North, the DUP had a disastrous result with deputy leader Nigel Doddslosing his seatin an unprecedented defeat to Sinn Féin’s John Finucane.
The success of the SNP in Scotland, and nationalists and republicans in the North, is likely to put the issue of Scottish independence and Irish unity near the top of the agenda.
Scottish First Minister Sturgeon said it had been an “exceptionally good night” for her party following a campaign based on stopping Brexit and pursuing a fresh independence referendum.
Sturgeon will write to the Prime Minister before Christmas to formally demand Holyrood be given the power to hold a second vote on independence.

While Johnson has made it clear he will block such a ballot, Sturgeon said the Tories must “reflect very carefully” on the result of the election.
She said: “Scotland can’t be kept in the UK against its will. It can only do that by consent, therefore Scotland has to have the ability to decide that question.
In the North, the DUP lost two of the ten MPs it entered the election with and, symbolically,there are now more nationalist and republican membersof Parliament from Northern Ireland than unionists.
Dodds’ loss will represent the DUP’s biggest wound, with the long-standing MP who led the party at Westminster falling in the most high-profile contest of the election.
The Tory majority at Westminster will also see the DUP lose its influential position as Westminster kingmaker.
Sinn Féin believes Brexit offers fresh opportunities for a United Ireland if Remain-supporting Northern Ireland is taken out of the EU against its will.
The Northern Ireland Secretary can call a border poll if he or she deems it likely that a majority in the region would vote to leave the UK and form a united Ireland.
The Republic of Ireland would then vote depending on the result of that referendum.

A poll in September showed there is a slight majority for Irish unification among people in Northern Ireland.
The survey asked voters for their preference “in the event of a referendum on whether or not Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom”.
A total of 45% told the Lord Ashcroft poll they would vote to stay in the UK and 46% said they would choose to leave and join the Republic.
Meanwhile a poll last week showed that support for independence in Scotland has fallen.
A total of 56% of respondents to a YouGov survey for the Times said they would vote No in a future independence referendum, with 44% voting Yes.
Separately, talks to get the administration at Stormont back up and runningare due to reconvence on Monday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/suggestions-from-the-public-to-avoid-a-hard-border-4961150-Jan2020/,"A CUSTOMS CENTRE on the Isle of Man, and banning trade across the Irish border by road, and sending it only by sea or air, were among the suggestions sent to the Irish government on how to avoid a hard border.
A number of suggestions were sent to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney in September last year on how to avoid a hard border while also protecting the island of Ireland against smuggling.
These emails and documents have been released toTheJournal.ieunder a Freedom of Information request, and so the senders’ names and details are redacted.
These ideas were sent in when UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was saying that the backstop needed to be scrapped, and when the Irish government was saying that there was no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop.
In October, a customs arrangement was struck where Northern Ireland would be aligned to the European Union’s Custom Union, but would remain in the UK’s custom territory, and so would benefit from any future trade deals.
The practicalities of this are complicated and still to be ironed out in the trade talks phase, but it’s likely that goods travelling to Northern Ireland would initially pay tariffs, but would be reimbursed if it was proven that the goods remained in that territory.
In September last year, there were rumours that the UK had suggested customs checks between 1-5km on either side of the Irish border as a solution to avoiding hard border infrastructure.
In one email sent to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, this idea is called “crazy”.
“A no man’s land scenario. I could see that being a massive problem, perhaps a criminal element would take advantage of this ‘not defined’ area, it would be a disaster.”
Advertisement
“Buffer zones are a very very bad idea,” the emailer wrote.
Among the correspondences are suggestions on what could replace the backstop.
These include a proposal sent from a person who claims to have worked for transport and distribution, as well as security industries.
This person suggested locating a customs centre both the Isle of Man and the Isle of Wight to monitor containers travelling from Ireland to the UK and vice versa.
“Point should be checked by Customs officials at an agreed distance point away from Crossing to ensure all documents and container seals are in order, and any defaulter shall be sent to a terminal parking space so that their documents can be rectified.”
Another person, in an email with the subject line ‘Solution to the Backstop’, wrote that the governments should “erect poles at every road crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the South”.
They should then “position the cameras and video cameras pointing in both directions”, and create a website where hauliers can log details of the goods they would be carrying from the two countries, with the tariffs they’ve paid as well.
Another suggestion, sent on 1 October by “an English member of the public”, suggested that Ireland and the UK trade “as if it were one country”.
“A producer in ROI wants to sell to the UK. In order to do this it stamps its goods with ‘for sale and consumption in UK only and not for further international distribution’. The UK producer would stamp the same but to ROI in this instance.
“The ROI producer would still sell goods into EU exactly as they do now.”
It’s worth noting that this is not entirely unlike the arrangement that is planned for Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-government-update-brexit-deal-5311157-Dec2020/,"MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has expressed hope that this week’s agreement on a post-Brexit deal will mark the beginning of a new relationship between the UK and Ireland.
The EU and the UK published full 1,246-page text of the treaty yesterday, less than a week before the deal is due to be implemented.
Cabinet is set to be updated on the deal on Tuesday, before the official end of the Brexit transition period on New Year’s Day.
Expressing relief at the agreement of a deal, Coveney said issues specifically relating to Ireland – including the NI border, the peace process and tariffs – had all been “put to bed”.
“When you weigh up the enormous damage of a no deal, I think Ireland has defended itself against the vulnerabilities Brexit forced upon us,” the minister said.

“The protection from the Irish protocol and this deal is beyond what many predicted would be possible.”
Coveney also warned that there would still be changes from next week when the UK fully exits EU, and confirmed that Cabinet would discuss supports for the most affected sectors as a result.
But he said his feeling upon agreement of the deal was one of “relief… tinged with regret” because the UK is set to leave the EU.
“Ireland is now focused on building a new relationship with the UK outside of the EU. Personally I hope talk of ‘Brexit’ will fade away,” Coveney added.
The deal is yet to be ratified by the EU’s 27 Member States and by the UK’s House of Commons.
However, member states have indicated they will formally back the deal within days, while British MPs and peers will are expected to pass the deal on 30 December, when the Conservatives will receive support for the treaty from opposition Labour MPs.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-organised-crime-bonanza-border-5270783-Nov2020/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S JUSTICE Minister has urged that a Brexit deal be agreed, warning of a potential “organised crime bonanza”.
Naomi Long described “huge uncertainty” for justice agencies with just weeks to go until the end of the transition period.
She singled out extradition as a particular area of concern, telling a Westminster committee that the justice system could be left using 1950s mechanisms for extradition.
“We can’t combat 2020 crime and security threats using 1950 tools,” she said.
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee previously heard that instead of six to eight weeks under the European Arrest Warrant, extradition could take up to two years.
Giving evidence to the committee today, Long said it is “imperative” that the UK and EU agree a future security partnership.
“However even if they do, it will not have the same breadth of measures to which we currently have access, the outcome will be sub-optimal unless we have the same access to current IT systems, legal instruments and EU agencies that we currently enjoy,” she told MPs.
“We cannot really afford to lose those key EU measures, if we – tragically in my view – exit without a deal then it is imperative that bilateral arrangements are put in place to bridge any gaps in capability.

“There is huge uncertainty for justice partners, there are only weeks to go until the end of the transition period yet we do not know what beyond that will look like.
“Planning can only go so far in that context. We do now urgently need detail on the outcome of the negotiations and clarity, in particular as to how the Northern Ireland Protocol will be implemented in practice to try to embed a culture of compliance and a culture of lawfulness.”
Long said anything less than a good security partnership between the UK and EU, or a substantial bilateral agreement between the UK and Ireland, would be a “failure of policy making and negotiation”.
Alliance Party leader Naomi LongPA ImagesPA Images
‘Politically disturbed’
Long also raised the potential for unrest if people are “politically disturbed” by the outcomes of Brexit, as well as potential for the expansion of black market activity in a scenario of different tariffs on either side of the border.
She said:
DUP MP Ian Paisley queried if Long’s department had a “can-do” attitude towards Brexit planning.
She responded saying it is for the UK government to have a can-do attitude in the negotiations with the EU.
“If we’re not able to data share, we are not able to do our jobs on a cross-border basis. Optimism will take you so far but unfortunately you can’t cash cheques on that basis… I am not going to try to gloss over the difficulties that this will create, the challenges it poses to law enforcement because that is not my job, my job is to respond to the reality.”

Joe Biden
DUP MP Gregory Campbell asked Long if she has reached out to US President-elect Joe Biden, and suggested she advise the US consul that the new administration “treads very carefully” around Northern Ireland politics.
He referenced a photograph of Biden with former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and veteran republican Rita O’Hare which he said “a lot of people would have taken deep offence” at.
Long said there is “nothing new” in US presidents being pictured with high-profile Irish republicans and others, adding there are photographs of President Donald Trump at a fundraiser for Sinn Féin in the US.
She added that she has not yet been in touch with the president-elect, but said she would “always caution any politicians from outside the jurisdiction to tread lightly around issues that are highly political”.
“I generally find the US consul general to be someone who is very supportive of the peace process, very supportive of the rule of law and very respectful of some of the sensitivities of our past,” she said.
The session was the third of the committee’s inquiry into cross-border co-operation on policing, security and criminal justice after Brexit.

THE UK HAS officially left the European Union, three years after the EU referendum where 51% of the population voted for Brexit.
In that space of time, we’ve witnessed the UK lurching from one Brexit policy to another, shifting Prime Ministers and Brexit secretaries, and making last-minute highwire decisions on what’s the biggest change in Europe since the reunification of Germany.
Nothing will seemimmediately differentnow that the UK has left: this is because the UK will remain in the Customs Union and Single Market until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020 (unless PM Boris Johnson changes his mind and asks for an extension).
This means that although UK citizens will no longer be EU citizens, they will still enjoy the EU rights they had before until the transition period ends.
The UK will now lose its 73 MEPs, and won’t be allowed to reverse Brexit by revoking Article 50 – if it wants to rejoin the EU, it will have to reapply.
“We’re disappointed that the UK is leaving, but that’s what they’ve decided,” Ray MacSharry said, who was a member of the European Commission, European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
I profoundly regret that the UK is leaving the EU but I absolutely respect their decision to do so.  I’m certain, that both Ireland and the EU more broadly - will continue to have an abiding friendship with the UK, a real partnership in terms of politics, security & the economics— Leo Varadkar (@LeoVaradkar)January 31, 2020Leo Varadkar/ Twitter
I profoundly regret that the UK is leaving the EU but I absolutely respect their decision to do so.  I’m certain, that both Ireland and the EU more broadly - will continue to have an abiding friendship with the UK, a real partnership in terms of politics, security & the economics
So tonight marks a symbolic end to the UK as a member of the European Union: but what does that mean for the EU, and for Ireland’s future?
The UK’s place in the EU
The UK and Ireland have been members of the EU since 1973. The UK joined the EU, and held a referendum on whether it should stay as a memberin 1975.
At the time, there was a split within all the parties on whether they should be a member of the EU: in the end, they favoured the economic benefits but there has never been a whole-hearted view of the project from political quarters.
Despite the ever-present scepticism, the UK has been an integral part of the construction of the EU: PM Margaret Thatcher, armed with Whitehall’s highly competent British civil servants, was an architect of the Single Market.

At Parliament level, Irish MEP and the First Vice President of the European Parliament Mairéad McGuinness says that British MEPs have made a “significant contribution to a whole range of legislative issues”.
She said that the UK has contributed significantly to the EU in its 40 years as a member.
“For example, on the update of the medical devices regulation, which I was involved in, I experienced how the UK made invaluable contributions and UK experts provided a lot of input into developing a robust regime.
“The UK leaving will be a loss to the EU – but the UK will also lose out on thecollaboration that the EU enables.”
RTÉ Europe editor and Brexit behemoth Tony Connellysaidthat the UK had been an active, energetic participant of the EU.
“The UK was seen to have a very professional civil service, that was not as political as those in other European countries. Officials would write up very detailed dossiers, and the Irish government appreciated those efforts,” Connelly said.
Friends or foes
A number of EU officials, and have said that the UK was a big brother to Ireland within the EU. If disagreements took place among European Commissioners or within the European Council (the gathering of the 27 EU countries’ leaders), it’s often been said that Ireland would let the UK do the arguing on its behalf.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, former EU Commissioner MacSharry disagreed with the suggestion that Ireland has been “running on their coattails” of the UK for years.
He says that during his time as EU Commissioner for Agriculture, the UK “didn’t want Common Agriculture Payment (CAP) at all” and “opposed everything” that Ireland had been trying to work towards.
He said that when he was Minister for Agriculture in the ’70s and ’80s, farmers’ unions in the North had “pleaded” with him to pursue for the North what Ireland had been asking for in the South, which he did.
The UK has opposed CAP because it’s seen as an expensive feature of the EU: the fund for CAP is worth half of the EU’s total budget. This is justified because it secures a food supply within the European Union:
EuroParl / Budget at a GlanceEuroParl / Budget at a Glance/ Budget at a Glance
As Ireland is a small agricultural country, it gets its money’s worth from being a member of the EU. That being said, as the UK was the third greatest contributor to the EU’s budget, the fees that each member state pay the EU for membership is almost certain to increase post-Brexit.
Currently we pay €2 billion a year into the EU; for this we get free movement of people through the EU for citizens; decreased tariff rates for business; CAP for farmers; and legislation, such as this proposal fora common EU smartphone chargerto try to cut down on electronic device waste.

In an example of how the UK pushed back against this system, British PM Margaret Thatcher had been against increasing funding for CAP payments down through the years.
She argued that they were putting “too much in and not getting the same amount out”, MacSharry says, adding that “they weren’t really an agricultural country”.
He says that Thatcher once “burst up the whole meeting looking for her money back” and “didn’t get it”.
When asked whether the EU would miss Whitehall officials, who have been labelled as superb by those within the EU, MacSharry says: “No doubt about that, but to think that they would be on the Irish side, I wouldn’t go along with that too much.
AVoteWatchanalysis of European Parliament votes indicated that of the votes that the UK took part in, Britain was the country that was on the losing side of votes the most – but it was on the winning side in 92% of votes, which indicates an active member state, but also, perhaps, an increasingly frustrated one.
What’s next
“I remember making a speech when the referendum passed…” says Ray MacSharry, who has pursued private business interests since leaving politics.
“…Particularly, [I remember] how much it would affect our food and drinks industry. We were exporting €5 billion food and drink to the UK – but they were exporting €3 billion to us.
On the Irish protocol, which is to kick-in by 1 January 2021, MacSharry says “we’re assured that there will be a Single Market in the 32 counties in Ireland, and that there will be checks along the Irish Sea”.
He acknowledged that there were some concerns being expressed about the Irish Sea border now, but said: “I’ll tell you, there won’t be a word about it three months after it starts. There has to be checks somewhere.”
He says that the UK will want access to the Single Market, because the whole point of the UK joining the EU in the first place was to get access to that market.
On whether Brexit has damaged Anglo-Irish relations, MacSharry is dismissive:
“Not in the least. We have always had that friction for 100s of years. I’ve worked well with representatives from Labour and the Conservative Party. There will be good relations, there’s no question about it – we’re neighbours.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has rejected Donald Trump’s advice of forming a Brexit pact with Nigel Farage ahead of the UK general election.
The US president staged a major intervention by calling for Johnson to team up with the Brexit Party leader to form an “unstoppable force” for the 12 December vote.
However Johnson has declined to take up the advice of Trump, a close ally.
Stating that a vote for another party increased the likelihood of a Labour government, Johnsontold Sky News: “I’ve ruled out a pact with everybody because I don’t think it’s sensible to do that.”
He also rejected the US president’s criticism of his Brexit deal which Trump claimed would prevent trade with the US.
“I’m afraid I don’t wish to cast any aspersions on the president of the United States but in that respect he’s patently in error, anybody who looks at our deal can see that it’s a great deal,” he said.

During the interview Johnson apologised to the Conservative Party members who elected him as their leader for breaking his promise to deliver Brexit “do or die” by the 31 October deadline, which he was compelled to extend to 31 January.

“It’s a matter of deep regret. All we need to do now is get on and do it,” he said.
Johnson, in a separate interview withBBC News, welcomed Trump ruling out the NHS being part of any trade deal. However he did not rule out expanding private provision within the NHS, which is a key battleground in the election campaign.
Leave alliance
Earlier in the day, Farage launched his party’s campaign with a call on Johnson to ditch his deal and form a “Leave alliance” to deliver a “stonking majority”.
The long-standing Brexit campaigner threatened to field candidates in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales in a move Tories fear could damage their chances of electoral success by splitting the Leave vote.
MEP Farage said his party would form a “non-aggression” pact if Johnson scrapped his deal and echoed the words of Trump by saying the agreement would hinder trade with the US.
The US president’s extraordinary intervention came in an interview with Farage on his LBC radio show yesterday.
“He has a lot of respect and like for you, I just wish you two guys could get together – I think it would be a great thing,” the president told Farage in a phone call.
Explaining his idea of a non-aggression pact, Farage told the PA news agency: “There are seats in which we would not stand and there are some seats in which the Conservatives would not stand.
Steve Baker, a key figure as chairman of the European Research Group of hardline Tory Brexiteers, also rejected Farage’s idea.
“It is completely inconceivable that the Conservative Party would now go for no-deal and a pact,” he told PA.

Contradicting the president, a Number 10 spokesman denied Johnson had discussed the deal with Trump and said the agreement would not hinder trade.
“The PM’s deal takes back control of our money, laws and border, and allows us to do trade deals with any country we chose – including the US,” the spokesman said.
Trump had said “under certain aspects of the deal … you can’t do it, you can’t do it, you can’t trade”.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Trump’s intervention, saying the US president was “trying to interfere” to “get his friend Boris Johnson elected”.
ITV News today confirmed it would broadcast a head-to-head debate between Johnson and Corbyn on 19 November.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this weekruled out a pre-Christmas general electionin Ireland. Speaking at Government Buildings on Wednesday, Varadkar said it was not in the best interest of the public to go to the polls at this time.
“It is my prerogative to ask for a dissolution of the Dáil if I thought it was the right thing for the country. I don’t think it’s the right thing for the country, not with the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” Varadkar said.
It is understood that May 2020 remains his preferred date for a general election here.

The Rock’s status was not covered in the trade agreement reached by Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve, prompting concerns about what would happen when the transition period ends at 11pm today.
Gibraltar, whose sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain, will remain subject to the rule of the free-travel Schengen area, Spain’s foreign minister said.
Arancha Gonzalez Laya announced that the “agreement in principle” means people in Gibraltar “can breathe a sigh of relief”.
She said that further details on the agreement would be published in the New Year.

Johnson said: “I wholeheartedly welcome today’s political agreement between the UK and Spain on Gibraltar’s future relationship with the EU.
“The UK has always been, and will remain, totally committed to the protection of the interests of Gibraltar and its British sovereignty.”
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab added: “Today, working side by side with the chief minister of Gibraltar, and following intensive discussions with the Spanish government, we reached agreement on a political framework to form the basis of a separate treaty between the UK and the EU regarding Gibraltar.
“We will now send this to the European Commission, in order to initiate negotiations on the formal treaty.
“In the meantime, all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the transition period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides.
“We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty. I am grateful to foreign minister Laya and her team for their positive and constructive approach.
“We have a warm and strong relationship with Spain, and we look forward to building on it in 2021.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-ireland-4986524-Jan2020/,"IN NOVEMBER 1942, following the British rebuff of the German army at El Alamein in Egypt, then-UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill proclaimed this victory as a major turning point in the Second World War.
His words are by now well-worn:
The United Kingdom leaves the European Union tonight, but Brexit does not end there. The conclusion of the withdrawal phase is only the end of the beginning.
This is because the UK and the EU enter a transition phase on 1 February, during which little should change in daily life even though the UK will no longer hold EU membership.
The EU and UK must now negotiate agreements on their future relationship, covering a range of areas from security to trade.

An ambitious timeline
The British government says it would like to conclude these negotiations by the end of this year. Many on the EU side think this is much too short a timeframe.
International trade deals, for instance, usually take years to conclude, and Brussels would, therefore, like to extend the transition period by two years (as provided for in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement).
London, however, is currently adamant it will not agree to any extension of the transition, during which it remains aligned to EU laws and pays into the EU budget.
Both sides must take a decision on extending the transition (or not) by the end of June 2020, so the Brexit clock is already ticking again.
The core issue in those negotiations will be the trade-off between open access for the UK to the EU single market, and ongoing UK alignment with EU rules.
Crudely put, the British government must choose between a narrow interpretation of “sovereignty” and the ongoing prosperity of the UK economy.

May not be so easy
“Taking back control” of laws may appeal in principle, but in practice, almost half of UK trade is with the EU.
Brussels has offered tariff and quota-free trade to the UK, on the condition that it remains aligned with EU rules, in areas like industrial support, labour protections, product standards etc., to ensure a level trade-playing field.
The difficulty of that trade-off might explain why mixed messages have been emerging from London recently.
On 17 January the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, told the Financial Times that British business should forget staying close to the EU: “There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule-taker.”
On 22 January Javid told a business audience in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, that “We won’t diverge just for the sake of it”.

For some harder Brexiteers, aligning with EU rules is akin to a “Brexit in name only” and better to trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms – which would result in more barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, than a more open trade deal with the EU.
If the EU and UK are unable to agree on a way forward by the end of this year, those harder Brexiteers will have their WTO-only wish.
One way around this, if both sides are unable to agree on extending the transition period by mid-summer, might be to agree on a so-called skeleton trade deal by the end of the year, containing basic objectives, and perhaps continue more detailed sectoral negotiations thereafter.

This “bare-bones” free trade agreement (FTA) would cause less friction for EU-UK trade than the WTO-only route, but it would still mean more friction than today.
A mountain to climb
No matter what happens this year, on 1 January 2021 there will more barriers to trade between Ireland and the UK, the question is how many more.

Moreover, negotiations on future EU-UK relations could take years. Even after framework negotiations conclude, in some ways Brexit will never end.
Like other non-EU European countries Switzerland and Norway, the UK will be continuously negotiating with the EU in some form or another, on one subject or other.
The EU, including the Irish government, has consistently said it wishes to have as close a relationship with the UK as possible after Brexit. It has never offered, for example, a quota and tariff-free trade deal to any other country.
True, that offer is conditional, partly to ensure that the UK does not have easier access to the 450 million-strong single market than EU members have.
As the EU member with the closest relationship with the UK, a cooperative EU-UK relationship is much more desirable for Ireland than a competitive one.
A lot hinges, therefore, on the choices the British government will make this year.
“Brexit day”
While today, “Brexit day”, is only the end of the beginning, Winston Churchill would probably have been most impressed with the emergence of such a strong European Movement in the UK.
He, after all, was one of the founding fathers of what became the European Movement International (and its British branch) after World War II.
Today, 31 January 2020 will be a sad day for all pro-Europeans, but British friends should remember Churchill’s advice to the Congress of Europe in 1948:

Noelle O Connell is Executive Director of the European Movement Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-port-brexit-2-5315710-Jan2021/,"AN “EXTREMELY SMALL” number of consignments looking to travel to the UK have been refused since new Brexit regulations kicked in on 1 January.
Tom Talbot, head of customs operations for Dublin Port, said today that just four vans looking to travel to the UK with Irish Ferries were turned away yesterday.
The vans had turned up at the port without the correct documentation, he said. They were told to return when they had the correct documents, and officials were in contact with them, walking them through the new process, said Talbot.
Giving an update to reporters today, Talbot said it will take time for drivers and hauliers to get used to the new post-transition period procedures.
On 1 January, ferry operator Stenasaid that six freight loads bound for Ireland had to be turned away at Holyhead as they did not have the correct references.
Revenue has urged all freight operators and drivers looking to travel to the UK or from the UK to ensure they had their PBNs ready ahead of check-in for the sailing.

A Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN) is needed before a lorry can get onto a ferry to cross the Irish Sea, as the UK is now considered a third country for trade purposes.

Talbot said that if all the correct documents and declarations are in place, then drivers will get a green light that will allow them to pass through the port.
Up to 92% of drivers are getting green lights to travel, he said.
Dublin Port is still seeing very low level of trade due to the time of year, but there is a “slow steady build up” to and from Great Britain.
“We are seeing a little bit of more orange checks at the moment, but that’s because it is bedding in, but you get your green and that’s all you have to do,” said Talbot.
With over a billion euros spent on Brexit-related infrastructure, the port is in a good position to keep delays at a minimum, reporters were told.
However, he said he wanted to be clear that delays can be expected, stating that the UK is now a third country having left the EU.
Related ReadsThe Brexit transition period has ended - here are the challenges facing UK businessesA look at the detail: What is in the Brexit trade deal?
Green-approved lorries will take just minutes to leave the ferry and the port, he said, with those given orange or red lights taking more time due to customs checks.
“That investment we put in is there for a reason and will minimise delays. There will be delays, we are now dealing with a third country but we want to minimise those delays,” he said.
“Even for businesses that are familiar for a number of years with dealing with third-country trade, the fact that this trade never arises on roll-on and roll-off traffic is a new feature,” he said.
He urged drivers to check their documentation and follow the clear and simple steps put in place by the authorities which will allow for a clear transition.
“To date there has been really good engagement with both trade and business and that will continue to ensure that smooth flow, and I am confident that will continue in the days and weeks ahead,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-survey-4886552-Nov2019/,"A MAJORITY OF Remainers and Leavers would be prepared to see Northern Ireland leave the Union in order to achieve their preferred Brexit outcome, a survey has found.
Around four in 10 Britons said they cared little or not at all about the region.
Unionists in Belfast are opposed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposed Brexit deal which they believe would create a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
It would involve the region following some of the rules of the EU’s single market to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland but including a new regime for goods crossing the Irish Sea.
Research carried out by the YouGov polling organisation suggested:

A total of 1,641 adults on mainland Britain were asked about the issue between 23 and 24 October.
The organisation said: “New YouGov polling today exposes the weaknesses in the link between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
“YouGov asked mainland Britons how much they care about Northern Ireland, how they’d feel if it left the Union and whether getting their own way on Brexit was more important than keeping the UK together.”
It said its results showed that 41% say they “would not be bothered” if Northern Ireland left the UK.
A further 41% said they would be “upset” if it broke away, while only a minority of 9% would be “actively pleased to see them go”.
The referendum divide does not make a difference, with 58% of Remain voters and 64% of Leave voters saying they’d rather have their own way on Brexit than see the Union preserved.
YouGov added: “As with so much, however, Brexit takes precedent.
Related ReadsFactCheck: Will there be checks between the North and the UK after Brexit?
“Given the choice between having their preferred outcome on Brexit and Northern Ireland staying in the Union, a majority of 58% chose the former and only 18% the latter.”
The Irish border has been one of the key sticking points in the Brexit negotiations.
The polling organisation added: “Even those Britons who say they want Northern Ireland to stay part of the UK tend to be willing to sacrifice it for the sake of Brexit.
“Almost half (47%) chose their preferred Brexit option, compared to 35% who chose the Union.”

Martin said there was still the “potential for a deal”, but warned that the government’s controversial legislationwhich enables the UKto break international law had “eroded trust”.
He told the i newspaper in an interview to be broadcast at the Liberal Democrat conference today that theUK Internal Market Bill“damaged the credibility” of agreements already entered into.

Asked if he believes a free trade agreement is likely, he said: “I’m not that optimistic, if I’m honest. Just to let you know that the [Irish] government is preparing its budget in three weeks’ time on the basis that there will be a no-deal Brexit.
“That’s the basis on which we’re preparing the budget and we’re warning and alerting businesses to that terrible reality.
“I think progress has been slow in the talks so far, I think there is still potential for a deal, I believe a deal is the sane and sensible thing to do, and I think all of us as politicians have an obligation to those we represent – and in terms of Brexit that means the least damage possible to workers, to employers and to business and economy.”
The ninth round of trade deal negotiations between the UK and EU will begin tomorrow in Brussels, but the time left to reach a deal is dwindling.
There are fewer than 100 days until the transition period, in which the UK remains in the single market and continues to follow EU law, ends on 31 December.

PASSING A LAW to prevent the extension of Brexit negotiations will not force the EU to rush into a deal, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said in a BBC interview.
Coveney said the EU felt the end of 2020 deadline set by Boris Johnson was “ambitious, if not unrealistic”.
He added that there are “consequences” for a country when it decides to leave the EU and that “maybe the penny is finally dropping” in the UK about this.
Coveney said he felt it would take longer than 12 months, as he highlighted the deal encompassed much more than trade and included areas like aviation, fishing and data.
“When people talk about the future relationship, in the UK in particular, they seem to only talk about a future trade agreement, actually there’s much more to this than that – there’s fishing, there’s aviation, there’s data and so many other things,” he said.
“I know that Prime Minister Johnson has set a very ambitious timetable to get this done. He has even put it into British law, but just because a British parliament decides that British laws say something doesn’t mean that that law applies to the other 27 countries of the European Union and so the European Union will approach this on the basis of getting the best deal possible – a fair and balanced deal to ensure the EU and the UK can interact as friends in the future.

“But the EU will not be rushed on this just because Britain passes law.”
Asked about the possibility of a series of side deals on specific areas if time ran out to strike a comprehensive agreement, Coveney raised concerns.
“We would certainly much rather negotiate a comprehensive deal that deals with all of these things collectively and together,” he told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
The Tánaiste also expressed concern at the tone of media coverage in the UK, highlighting attempts to frame the engagement as Britain trying to defeat or stand up to the EU.
“This is the language of enemies, not friends, and we need to move away from that,” he said.
“Both sides in this negotiation in the next stage of Brexit has a vested interest in working together – not to try to outmanoeuvre each other.”

A key issue in the negotiations will be how the financial services industry in the City of London will be able to serve clients within the EU.
Amid concern the EU might limit the City’s access to its European markets, outgoing Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that it would not be appropriate for the sector to be regulated by Brussels.

Coveney said it would be impossible to maintain the system as it presently operates.
“Maybe the penny is finally dropping that when you leave a union that you have been a part of for 45 years that things don’t remain the same and that is inconvenient and it has consequences for the UK,” he said.
“The UK has decided to move in a different direction, no longer as part of the European Union and the collective shelter of that and opportunity that comes with that.
“No way of the UK in this negotiation maintaining the relationship we have today while outside of the European Union, and that’s the reality of Brexit I’m afraid.”
Asked whether the EU was committed to agreeing a security partnership with the UK, regardless of the fate of trade negotiations, Coveney said the bloc would approach the issue “responsibly”.
“Certainly I think security is something the EU wants to get an early agreement on with the UK and I think that makes sense for both sides,” he said.
“But again this is something that Boris Johnson is saying he wants to do in less than 12 months and I think the European Union has constantly warned that that timeframe is ambitious if not unrealistic.
“So from an EU perspective we will try to approach all of these really important and sensitive areas with a sense of partnership and friendship, but at the same time they are complex and we will need to work through all of them, hopefully in parallel, but in my view it is probably going to take longer than a year, but we’ll have to see.”
