https://www.thejournal.ie/government-seeking-early-warning-system-on-use-of-article-16-5350126-Feb2021/,"THE GOVERNMENT IS to seek an “early warning system” on the use of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol on Brexit.
London, Belfast and Dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the European Commission to invoke Article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to Europe.
The Article overrides part of the Northern Ireland Protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used.
The European Commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the North.
European Affairs Minister Thomas Byrne said the Government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events.
He told the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs: “The reaction of Government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned.
“We had spent the previous few weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement.
“And not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.”
He said the Government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the European Commission and the UK Government to find a resolution.
Byrne added: “What the Government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place.
“There is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the Commission made a mistake, yes the Commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now.

“Clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.”
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the EU.
He said: “I think the damage has been lasting. I think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made.
“Are the British government now in danger of pushing this too far? We see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger Article 16.
“We look at the, albeit typical British newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed.
“I’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.”
But Byrne said that despite the damage caused, Article 16 will not be removed from the protocol.
He said: “Even the Article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol.
“The protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market of the European Union.”
Irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the European Commission on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the Article 16 affair.
Byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”.
He added: “There will be ongoing engagements. We may not have resolution on this today, but I think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rishi-sunak-northern-ireland-protocol-deal-imminent-5997518-Feb2023/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Feb 2023
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has travelled to the North ahead of talks with Stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the UK and EU over the controversial post-Brexit Protocol is imminent.
The Tory leader is joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Sunak will hold talks with Stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow.
He last visited Northern Ireland in December and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days.
A spokeswoman for Sunak said: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.
“The Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.”
However, a senior DUP figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of EU law in Northern Ireland in any new UK/EU deal on post-Brexit trade will ensure Stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues.
Nigel Dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the UK Government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the region.
While it is understood the EU and UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce Protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of EU law in the region.
The EU contends a fundamental plank of the Protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in region.
Speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week.

Following his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.
Dodds, a former deputy leader of the DUP who now leads the party in the UK’s House of Lords, said the continued application of EU law in Northern Ireland would not be acceptable to his party.
His comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the EU and UK may not ultimately be enough to convince the DUP to return to power-sharing at Stormont.
The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in Belfast in protest at the protocol.
In 2021, the DUP set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. Those tests did not include a specific reference to ECJ oversight.
Nationalist MP Claire Hanna from the SDLP said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of Ireland.
She said it looked like an EU/UK deal on the protocol was “imminent”.
“I think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and I think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so I think that’s a win for this region,” she said.
Hanna told BBC Radio Ulster that the DUP should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if EU law was removed in Northern Ireland.
“What they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our MLAs, it means no dual market access that even the DUP lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said.
“It essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.”
She added: “I think there are people in the DUP who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley.
“We know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”","8.01pm, 16 Feb 2023",16 Feb 2023
https://www.thejournal.ie/migration-uk-eu-after-brexit-5561000-Oct2021/,"IT’S NOW OVER five years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, a result partly driven by concerns over immigration. So what’s happened with migration since then?
The honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. The number of British citizens in the EU is contested, while the UK’s Office for National Statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”.
EU free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. There are some restrictions – the Irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen EU citizens from the country every year -  but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures.
Brexit heralded the end of free movement between the UK and the EU. Or rather, most of the EU: free movement between Ireland and the UK continues under the Common Travel Area.
Unlike the EU version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. But while some expertsworrythat the Common Travel Area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen EU-UK free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for Irish citizens moving to Britain and vice versa.
Although the vote for Brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 June 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 December 2020. Until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period.
The very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “Brexodus” of Europeans from Britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place.
“Within our own membership many people left the UK and returned to the EU”, says Luke Piper of EU citizens’ campaign group The3Million. “The UK’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”.
Researchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in Brexit Britain. In onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the UK”.
However among an overall EU population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘Brexodus’”, says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Most EU citizens in the UK are settled, have jobs and lives in the UK, and have remained, despite the political changes”.
While British migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. In the year to March 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 EU citizens departed. That rose to 250,000 in the year to March 2020.
Meanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the EU Settlement Scheme. Not all still live in the UK – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme.
As one European residenttold researchersat the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank:
“I am against Brexit. I think it will be horrible for the economy. But I will go down with the ship. This is where I feel at home and I would be devastated if I had to leave”.
Estimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000.
Again, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. But even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more EU citizens came to the UK than left, despite Brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some.
“Overall”, says McNeil “the UK’s EU migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”.
The combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. Putting it all down to a direct Brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020.

“Factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the Euro and the Zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various EU member states, including Poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the UK after Brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, McNeil tellsThe Journal.
“There is no particular evidence that post-Brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”.
The British authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. The Office for National Statisticssays: “There has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly EU citizens – leaving the UK to go and live elsewhere. Did this actually happen? Simply put, we don’t know yet”.
That’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to Covid.
Professor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the UK fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some European workers have returned home”. On the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system.
The latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer EU workers in the UK than pre-pandemic, while the ONS hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020.
But because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the Migration Observatory’s Madeleine Sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”.
If EU migration to the UK is a bit hazy, the picture for British migration to and from the EU is a positive pea-souper fog.
“We just don’t know that at the moment”, laments Professor Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, an expert on British emigrants. “At the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”.
According to the European Parliament, EU records showed “about 857 000 UK citizens in the EU at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million UK nationals in the EU”.
The 1.2 million figure comes from the United Nations. The British ONS doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. Benson’s “Brexit Brits Abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million.
Disagreement on the number of British citizens living in the EU at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to Brexit.
A good chunk of the British emigrant population lives in Ireland – over 100,000, Benson says. “The only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the British in Ireland was Polish”.
Thanks to the Common Travel Area, that cohort has been largely spared the Brexit worries of their counterparts in France and Spain.
British residents of mainland European countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. In some, including Spain, Germany and Italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply).
In France and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the UK. All have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021.
But the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-Brexit right to hop from country to country within the EU. British nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
Not everyone seems prepared for that reality. Piper recounts “a conversation with a Brit who is wanting to move to Greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. I asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. They were astonished”.
“The fact that Britain has left the European Union is not going to stop people moving”, Benson says. “It’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”. How exactly remains to be seen.

Figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from Ireland last year. This is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2%) over 2020.
Medical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate Ireland’s trade, accounting for 38% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion.
The most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from Northern Ireland. Imports from the North rose by 65% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54% to €3.7 billion.
The statistics arefurther evidenceof Brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border.
Meanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from Britain fell by 13% to €15.4 billion. Exports to Britain – which make up 9% of Ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17% to €14.4 billion.

Due to the Northern Ireland Protocol of the Brexit agreement, trade with Britain is subject to customs checks.
However, the protocol effectively means Northern Ireland remains within the European Union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the UK customs territory.

Exports to EU countries – which account for 37% of Irish exports – fell by 4% to €61.5 billion. Ireland still exports far more to the EU than it ships in as EU imports rose by 13% last year to €24.3 billion. This accounts for 33% of all imports.
Exports to non-EU countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6%). The USA was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32%) of total exports.
Imports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18% to €102 billion. It is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year.
The amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into Ireland increased by 82% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened.
Imports from non-EU countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20%) on 2020.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-bill-visa-non-eu-citizens-northern-ireland-border-5625136-Dec2021/,"TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said he will raise concerns with the UK government over proposed post-Brexit arrangements to cross the Irish border.
Under the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including Northern Ireland.
The bill is currently going through the House of Commons.
Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty raised the matter with Varadkar in the Dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents.
“It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area and Ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a Tory government in Westminster that doesn’t give a damn about Ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said.

He pressed Varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the British government that this is not on”.
The Tánaiste said the Irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the UK.
“Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said.
“If you recall, part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the European Union, and this is part of the outworking of that.
“It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the United Kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the European Union.
“Ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. But we will absolutely be making our views known.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-extension-brexit-residency-scheme-uk-5474654-Jun2021/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT will not be extending the deadline for the EU settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said.
Any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to Kevin Foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic.
EU citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by 30 June, in order to continue living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.
Speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, Foster said: “The EUSS has been open publicly since March 2019. We believe this has given people plenty of time to apply.
“The sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this.
“I want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. Put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.”
His comments came after Downing Street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of Europeans living in the UK who are yet to apply for the post-Brexit residency scheme.
This followed concerns that many EU citizens – as well as nationals of Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline.
Number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded.
Ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the UK, or how many could remain in the country undocumented.
Advertisement
Around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the Home Office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day.
Foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”.
The UK Government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal.
Those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, Foster said.
It typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed.
The Home Office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 June and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline.
These include:
Late applications can take place years afterwards. For example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented.
Addressing claims EU citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 July, Foster said: “We are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application.
He revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. This will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme.
These may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses.
Questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-protocol-5579506-Oct2021/,"THE CYCLE OF Brexit related disputes should be familiar to us all by now. They heat up in October around the Conservative Party conference, involve the UK government proposing radical new ideas they expect the EU to concede to immediately, and sometimes they result in the EU juggernaut moving, but only by an inch or two.
This month, the UK government ratcheted up its demands regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol. In effect, it wants the Protocol to be re-written. In response, the EU has proposed a series of targeted measures they believe will make it easier to move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Businesses will likely welcome the proposals made by the EU. The UK government will most likely reject them, not because they fail to make it easier to move goods, but because the UK government’s real concern is that the Protocol, in their view, encroaches on UK national sovereignty.
It is this focus on sovereignty that is driving the UK government’s approach. They were elected to “get Brexit done”, and for them, that means the UK having full sovereign control over all the laws in all of the UK, with only UK courts overseeing them.
For the Protocol to be acceptable to them, there would have to be no oversight role for the European Court of Justice (EJC) (one of the UK government’s demands), and no EU rules or standards would apply in Northern Ireland.
The Protocol
Only this version of the Protocol would satisfy a government that wants absolute control. Of course, this version of the Protocol would also be completely unacceptable to the EU. So, we are stuck.
Advertisement
Within the crucible of Northern Ireland, the EU’s fundamental principles and this UK government’s Brexit ideology are repeatedly clashing. The Protocol, as written, represents a compromise between these two opposing outlooks.
Since it is impossible for the UK government to hold true to its Brexit ideology and accept the continuation of the Protocol in any form that might be consistent with the EU’s fundamental principles, it would be fair to assume that its ultimate aim is to scrap the Protocol altogether.
It will not do this immediately. First, it will make a set of proposals that it knows are unacceptable to the EU. It will then reject the EU’s counter proposals, arguing that they have failed to engage with key UK demands, notably those related to the role of the ECJ.
Contrary to the rhetoric, triggering Article 16 does not lead to the unilateral suspension of the Protocol, but further talks between the UK and the EU. These will follow the familiar pattern, with the UK making demands it knows the EU will never accept. When the talks fail, there will be only one step left – the UK’s unilateral withdrawal from the Protocol.
For Brexiteers, the decision to leave the EU was a revolutionary moment, a chance to take the country back, to have absolute sovereign control over UK affairs, not just in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland as well.
This is the perspective of this UK government, and for them, the continuing existence of the Protocol is evidence that the Brexit revolution is still not done.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION President Ursula von der Leyen has said she “deeply regrets” a decision to propose invoking Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a row over Covid-19 vaccines.
The proposal was withdrawn hours after being made public, and following much criticism from Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain.
Speaking at a European Parliament meeting today, EuroParlRadio reported that von der Leyen said: “The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision, and I deeply regret that.
“But, in the end we got it right. And I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace of Northern Ireland, just as it has done throughout the entire Brexit process.”
Article 16 overrides part of the NI Protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure only to be used in “serious” circumstances.
A spokesperson for the Commission suggested to TheJournal.ie that the triggering of Article 16 wouldn’t have resulted in checks on the island of Ireland, but would require documentation before vaccines are shipped to Ireland.
European Affairs Minister Thomas Byrne yesterday said the Irish government is seekinga new safety clauseto prevent other suggestions for using Article 16.
Von der Leyen is attending the European Parliament today to face questions from MEPs about the EU’s plan to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine.
Four Irish MEPs addressed the European Commission chief in the European Parliament today, with all MEPs raising the Article 16 blunder.
Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher said that the “how, who and why” around the decision needed to be answered.
“I also need to ask you three questions: how was the decision arrived at, who made the decision, and why.
Green MEP Grace O’Sullivan said that, despite von der Leyen’s assertion that “we got it right in the end”, that the Commission “did not get it right”.
“What concrete steps will you put in place to ensure the people of Ireland, north and south, that the delegate situation is never threatened again?”

Sinn Féin’s Chris MacManus said that it was “unacceptable” that the implications of suggesting to trigger Article 16 wasn’t foreseen, and asked for assurances that the “fiasco wouldn’t be repeated”.
Fine Gael’s Sean Kelly said that assurances were needed that this would not happen again, “because it must not happen again”.
Europe has logged a third of the more than 2.3 million lives lost globally to the virus, which is spreading rapidly despite the start of vaccinations in many nations and forcing the reimposition of unpopular and economically punishing restrictions.
Leaders of the European Union have been engaged in bitter public rows with pharmaceutical firms over supply shortages, as they faced public anger and scrutiny over slow vaccination rollouts in member states.
Vaccine supply issues have already caused a diplomatic row after AstraZeneca said it would not be able to immediately ship the doses it promised to Britain and the EU.
At the same time, the resurgence of infections across the continent is adding to the pressure on EU leadership.
A stricter lockdown will be imposed in Greece from tomorrow, in particular in the Athens region, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, warning that his country was facing a third Covid-19 wave.
Wary of infection numbers exploding again, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will seek to extend strict curbs at least until the end of February as fatigue grows with the partial lockdown in Europe’s top economy.
The heaviest snow in years also added to woes in Europe with transport and infrastructure hit in Germany and Britain.
Some coronavirus vaccination centres in England were forced to close — including major hubs in Ipswich and Colchester.
No breakthrough on virus origin
A much-anticipated World Health Organization inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus wrapped up its mission in China yesterday. They failed to identify which animal may have passed it to humans.
The experts said there was “no indication” the virus was circulating in the ground-zero city of Wuhan before December 2019, when the first official cases were recorded.
WHO expert Peter Ben Embarek also scotched a controversial theory that the virus had leaked from a Wuhan lab, calling it “extremely unlikely”.
China has been ramping up efforts to highlight its role in overcoming the pandemic, including the development of Covid-19 vaccines that have helped start shots in many parts of the world — including hard-hit South America.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-donaldson-taoiseach-5675244-Feb2022/,"DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has called on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give a firm commitment that he will trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol if agreement cannot be reached with the European Union.
However, the Taoiseach says the benefits of the protocol to Northern Ireland are not getting the recognition they deserve.
It comes as the DUP have threatened to walk away from powersharing if issues with the post-Brexit agreement are not resolved to their liking.
Micheál Martin noted that unionist leaders have not called for an end to access to the EU’s single market, which is facilitated by the protocol.
“What I want to say to the unionist political leaders is, there is a deep understanding and recognition of the issues that they have raised about the protocol and how it operates,” Martin said onRTÉ’s This Week radio programme.
“No one in Northern Ireland, and I do appreciate it Jeffrey Donaldson himself has said this and Doug Beattie has said this, nobody has said that they do not want continued access to the European single market.
“It will benefit Northern Ireland. I understand they need access to the United Kingdom market, of course, that’s obvious.
“But I think there are benefits and advantages to the protocol that are not getting… the recognition that it deserves.”
The Taoiseach also criticised the DUP for pulling down the Stormont Executive, after Paul Givan stood down as First Minister earlier this week.
The move was part of the DUP’s escalating protest strategy against the post-Brexit trading arrangements that have created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Givan’s resignation automatically removed Sinn Féin deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill from her position.
Other Stormont ministers can remain in post but the Executive can no longer meet and is unable to take significant policy decisions.
Martin said such moves cause people in Northern Ireland to lose faith in the institutions.
“Pulling down the Executive or undermining the Executive for short-term electoral tactical purposes is not, in my view, acceptable,” he said.
“There has been this sense in Northern Ireland from since the Good Friday Agreement onwards, that we’ve had the institutions operating, we’ve had them suspended, on quite a number of occasions now.
“To such an extent that people in the North have lost faith and confidence in those institutions, which is I think a great pity.

“There are many politicians who want to work those institutions. I think all politicians should say, whatever happens, the Executive continues, the Assembly continues and fulfils its mandate.
“I think a lot of people in Northern Ireland want their politicians to fulfil their electoral mandate.”
An Assembly election is already scheduled for May.
Givan’s departure has led to speculation that the poll could be brought forward several weeks.
Donaldson has suggested his party would only return to an Executive if its concerns around the post-Brexit trading arrangements are addressed.
Donaldson today called on Johnson to give a firm commitment that he will trigger Article 16 of the protocol if agreement cannot be reached with the European Union.
The DUP leader urged Johnson not to be distracted by controversies within Downing Street and to give problems in Northern Ireland “the attention they deserve”.
PAPA
He told Sky News: “It disappoints me that our Prime Minister cannot give a firm commitment today that if there is not agreement reached with the European Union, he will take the steps that are necessary to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.
“Let’s get our political institutions restored on the basis of sound foundations, that means dealing with the protocol, making these issues our priority so that the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy a strong, stable government.
“That’s what we expect of a prime minister. We can’t go on like this. We can’t go on with a situation where serious problems like we have here in Northern Ireland are not getting the attention they deserve.”
The protocol was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but has created new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain in the Irish Sea.
The use of Article 16 could result in elements of that agreement being suspended.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic are set to meet again in London next week to continue negotiations aimed at reducing the red tape associated with the protocol.
Donaldson called on the Prime Minister to take action “to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK”.
He added: “We can’t have political stability when the concerns of unionists are being completely ignored, when this protocol is harming our relationship with the rest of the UK and the Government is failing to act.”
Donaldson insisted he is committed to powersharing with other parties in Northern Ireland.
He denied the DUP would use the protocol to block a Sinn Féin first minister if it became the largest party after the election.","3.35pm, 6 Feb 2022",

This article is part ofThe Good Information Project, a new initiative from The Journal to help create greater understanding of big issues we face. This month we are focusing on the question ‘What could a shared island look like?’
BEFORE THE BREXIT vote, Northern Ireland was on a more stable trajectory.
The Scotland independence referendum had been defeated, the power-sharing Stormont Executive was still operating, somewhat effectively, and any references to a united Ireland were relatively fleeting.
A ‘Northern Irish’ identity – as distinct from an Irish or British identity – was developing, and the political support of the Alliance Party was growing apace.
The demographics of Northern Ireland have been slowly shifting from a Protestant majority to a Catholic one. “Of course there was always going to be a focus on partition again when the balance of forces were altered,” political historian Dr Éamon Phoenix toldThe Journal.
But there is no doubt that the Brexit vote has accelerated that process, and there is now an economic angle to the Irish unity question: full European Union membership.
Though Northern Ireland has been at the centre of the Brexit debate for the past four years, during the campaigns ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, discussions of how Brexit could affect Northern Ireland were non-existent, or periphery at best.
A portion of the blame for this can be leveled at the Irish government – it didn’t take the threat seriously enough to campaign for Northern Ireland to be a core part of the debate, which it quickly became only after the vote.
And that thrusting of Northern Ireland into the centre of the Brexit spotlight created another split: along with nationalists vs unionists, Catholics vs Protestants, there’s a new divide: those in favour of Brexit and those against it (along with all the different shades of what ‘Brexit’ could be).
SDLP MLA and Chair of the Executive Office Committee Colin McGrathsaidat an Oireachtas committee that “there is always a difficulty here in Northern Ireland that any issue that we take instantly comes green or orange, and it becomes one side of the community or the other”. Brexit was no different.

Instead of it being a question of what logistically and financially works best for businesses, it often became a question of loyalties, unities, and political allegiances.
He said there needs to be a collective approach to this, as “the bottom line is the sale of a potato or a pencil”, and it doesn’t matter who it’s being sold to.
But there was some evidence of the traditional green-orange split blurring in the case of Brexit: staunchly unionist groups such as the Ulster Farmer’s Union have vocally opposed Brexit. A unionist farmer who was used in a video by the DUP to voice his support Brexit for Brexit,later said he regretted his decision.
Economics can be the driving factor in these issues, Dr Phoenix argues: “I spoke to a very senior policeman from a unionist background as Brexit was being debated, and he said to me ‘Certainly, we’re getting the best of both worlds’.”
At the Brexit negotiating table, meanwhile, elected representatives of Northern Ireland were left out, at a discussion that ended up dealing with very detailed aspects of how Northern Ireland trades and how and where its people travel.
The UK government, the authority that governs aspects of how Northern Ireland operates – such as finances and electoral law – decided that Brexit meant the UK would leave the Single Market and Customs Union.

This massive policy decision, which seemed to be createdon a whim, would create problems for Northern Ireland no matter what side of it a border would end up, and would lead to the Protocol being required.
Those who were at the negotiation table did field concerns from ‘stakeholders’: the UK government listened to concerns from the DUP, its partners in government; and the EU listened to Ireland’s and nationalists’ concerns about a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The Northern Ireland Protocol was invented to solve the latter concern, and its in operation today as a result. But in an attempt to keep two sides happy, it is a confused, complicated pilot project that has lead to awkward blocks to trade of things like potted plants and pets going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The clunky ways in which it has been implemented – with the EU and Ireland admitting that the Protocol could work more smoothly – is proof of that.
But it is still just three months into the Brexit process, which is a short amount of time in business and trading terms.
“There have been phyto-sanitary checks around the island of Ireland since famine times,” Dr Phoenix said of the requirement for health certificate checks on live animals and animal- and plant-derived products going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
But Northern Ireland hasn’t yet crossed its last Brexit hurdle.
The consent mechanism
PA ImagesPA Images
In four years’ time, Northern Ireland’s Stormont Assembly will have to vote on whether to stay in the EU’s Single Market and keep the current Brexit regulatory checks in place, or to opt out.
There’s a possibility that the ‘opt out’ option will be more detailed by December 2024, but as of now it’s a one-option question. As wasthe criticism of the EU referendum poll, this may be too complicated an issue to pose as a yes-or-no question.
Under the Withdrawal Agreement, the Northern Ireland’s MLAs will be asked, every four or eight years, to consent to the trading arrangements in articles 5-10 of the Protocol for as long as they are in place.
The vote in December 2024 will be on whether Northern Ireland wants to remain in the EU’s Single Market, remembering that Great Britain has already left it.
While the industries of Britain, Ireland, and the rest of the European Union will quietly adjust to the new Brexit rules, Northern Ireland will be facing yet another Brexit debate, as part of a greater one about what direction it wants its economy to go in.
Other articles of the Protocol, like guarantees to rights and equality; the Common Travel Area and North-South co-operation, will remain without the need for a consent vote.
And if the Assembly does vote against the current Brexit arrangements, it could see discussions return about a regulatory border on the island of Ireland. That could mean hard infrastructure.
Controversy over the vote would work
Consent can be given if a simple majority of the Northern Ireland Assembly vote in favour. This is unlike usual practice in the Assembly, where decisions are normally subject to a mechanism called the ‘petition of concern’.
The Petition of Concern is a notice signed by at least 30 MLAs and presented to the Speaker. It usually expresses concern about a motion before the Assembly. If the Speaker rules that the petition of concern should apply to a motion, the vote will require cross-community support.
This type of majority could be either of two things: parallel consent, requiring over 50% support from designated unionists and nationalists; or a weighted majority, meaning at least 40% unionists and nationalists, and 60% overall.

The UK government has argued that as the Brexit consent mechanism vote is on a matter which is usually in the competence of the UK government (ie, not a devolved matter),  normal Assembly procedures will not apply, and so the petition of concern does not apply.
During Brexit talks, Ireland and the EU expressed concern at the idea of giving Northern Ireland a vote that could be effectively vetoed by a minority of MLAs through the petition of concern.
“I think at the end of the day, several things will be in the balance,” Dr Phoenix says of the vote in over three years’ time.
“What will the impact of Brexit have been? How will the economists view Brexit next year, the year after that, as it impacts on Ireland and Britain in particular?

“Many young people are inclined, like idealistic young people everywhere, to vote for radical, ‘green’ parties, and parties like Alliance, which transcends the sectarian divide.
“That sort of middle ground of the Alliance, Greens, People Before Profit, they have been attracting the votes of younger people.
“Their votes will be reflected in the Assembly going forward, and that opens up several possibilities. One is that the emphasis on North-South cooperation is going to increase because there’ll be less opposition to it within the Assembly.
“Alliance is a pro-European party, the SDLP is a pro-European party, Sinn Féin have transformed themselves into a pro-European party.
“I think at the end of the day, if you could look forward 10 years, we would see an Assembly that will be transformed. And by that stage we will know the true impact of Brexit,” he said.
The Scottish Parliament elections are to be held on 6 May this year, where the performance of the Scottish National Party will be closely watched to gauge interest in a second Scottish independence referendum.
“I would see a generation growing up in the shadow of power-sharing arrangements, and possibly in the shadow of a Brexit – which is not going badly for the UK, but a deal that has benefited the North because of access to the EU,” Dr Phoenix said.
“A united Ireland, if it’s ever achieved, is going to be achieved by economic means – it’s going to be a situation where people buy into it.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-trip-to-scotland-in-pandemic-5337712-Jan2021/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S VISIT to Scotland to promote the Union is “absolutely essential”, Cabinet member Michael Gove has insisted after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon questioned whether the trip is necessary during the pandemic.
Amid signs of rising support for Scottish independence, the Prime Minister is visiting Scotland on today to argue that the Union has been integral in administering the Covid-19 vaccine, providing coronavirus testing and giving economic support.
Sturgeon said Johnson’s visit to Scotland is “not essential” during the current lockdowns, arguing that politicians have a “duty to lead by example” as the public live under strict restrictions.
There are growing concerns in Westminster about support for Scottish independence, as Sturgeon argues there would be grounds for a new referendum if her SNP party wins a majority in the Holyrood elections scheduled for May.
Ahead of the visit, Cabinet Office minister Gove told BBC Radio Scotland: “He’s the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it’s absolutely essential that the Prime Minister is there to see how on the front line we are progressing in our vaccine delivery and rollout programme.

“It’s critically important that the Scottish Government and the UK Government are working together to do everything we can to support the rollout and see what we can do to improve it.”
Gove insisted there is “no substitute for a leader better than being there”, when questioned why he did not speak to people remotely.
He said the visit will present “no danger to anyone’s health”, adding “the Prime Minister will be operating in a Covid-secure way”.
But concerns have been raised that Johnson may not be the best figure to champion the Union, with polls suggesting support has risen amid a backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and of Brexit, a campaign the Prime Minister fronted, while Scotland backed remaining in the EU.
Gove insisted on BBC Breakfast that the Prime Minister is “a huge asset” for the Union, when challenged over his handling of Brexit and Covid-19.
Downing Street, which has insisted it is key for Johnson to remain “visible” as the “physical representative” of the UK government, plans to stress the benefits for Scotland of being in the UK.
Officials said Westminster has delivered more than one million rapid lateral flow test kits to Scotland so far and is funding testing sites across the country – including seven drive-through centres, 27 walk-in sites and 21 mobile testing units, along with the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.

Westminster cash has provided 62% of testing kits in Scotland, No 10 added.
Speaking ahead of his visit to Scotland, the Prime Minister said: “Mutual cooperation across the UK throughout this pandemic is exactly what the people of Scotland expect and it is what I have been focused on.
“The people of the UK have stood together during this pandemic: from our doctors and nurses in our hospitals to our shop workers, scientists, lorry drivers and teachers – working together as one truly United Kingdom is the best way to build our Covid recovery.”
But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown said the Prime Minister’s trip is evidence that he is in a “panic” about the prospect of another referendum.
The MSP said: “Clearly, Boris Johnson is rattled. By branding this campaign trip as ‘essential’, this is clearly a Prime Minister in panic, who knows the Tories are losing the argument on independence.
“Twenty polls in a row have shown that a majority of voters believe Scotland’s future should be in Scotland’s hands – not Boris Johnson’s.”

European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said Brussels would “spare no effort” to reach a settlement with the UK on the contentious post-Brexit trading arrangements.
As Sefcovic made his comments in Brussels, the UK Government made clear that “significant work” was still required before an agreement could be reached.
The updates from both sides came amid intensifying speculation about an imminent deal to cut bureaucracy on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Sefcovic told a press conference in Brussels that “intensive scoping” to find joint solutions was continuing.
“The Commission and the UK Government are working closely and constructively. Progress is being made but difficulties remain,” he said.
“President (Ursula) Von der Leyen has a trusting relationship with UK Prime Minister (Rishi) Sunak.
“And the same goes for my relationship with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, as well as Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.
“We agree that joint solutions are needed to respond to the real-life concerns of all communities in Northern Ireland.
“So, all in all, it is not an easy exercise, but it is certainly a necessary one, and the commission will spare no efforts to agree a joint way forward.”
A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment on the latest reports that a breakthrough had been reached on reducing checks on Great Britain goods whose end destination was Northern Ireland, and differentiating between those and Great Britain products due for onward transportation across the Irish border into the EU.

He added: “There is still significant work to be done and there will be further talks this week across all areas.”
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 as a way to unlock the logjam over securing a Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Designed as a means to keep the Irish land border free-flowing, it moved regulatory and customs checks on goods to the Irish Sea, creating economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Many unionists in Northern Ireland are vehemently opposed to arrangements they claim have weakened the region’s place within the union.
The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of powersharing at Stormont and has made clear it will not allow devolution to return unless major changes to the protocol are delivered.
An agreement between the EU and UK would not guarantee the restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland, as the DUP may ultimately reject it and continue with its Stormont boycott.
The DUP has made clear that any deal would need to go further than just reducing red tape on trade.
The party says Northern Ireland can no longer remain subject to EU law or the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
DUP MP Ian Paisley said any deal between the UK and the EU also had to deal with the role of the ECJ as the final arbiter in protocol-related trade disputes.
He told the BBC Nolan Show that the protocol must be replaced by arrangements that unionists can support.
“I believe that until we have this protocol replaced, the border removed in the Irish Sea, we have ourselves subject only to UK rule then there will be no powersharing,” he said.
“It is either protocol or powersharing. We can’t have both.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-5361837-Feb2021/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has insisted the Northern Ireland Protocol offers many benefits and opportunities for the region as he stressed the importance of its full implementation.
Martin welcomed efforts by the UK and EU to find ways to resolve some of the trading problems created by the protocol since it came into force at the start of the year.
Addressing the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (Bipa), the Taoiseach said it is critical that those efforts are undertaken in a context where both sides have underlined their commitment to the full implementation of the new Irish Sea trading arrangements.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to keep the Irish border flowing freely post-Brexit.
It achieved that by creating an economic border in the Irish Sea, with new regulatory and customs processes required on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
This has caused some disruption to trade since the start of the year.
It has also stirred unionist and loyalist anger in Northern Ireland amid concerns that the region’s place in the UK has been undermined by the arrangements.

Several unionist parties areinvolved in initiating legal proceedingsagainst the government, arguing that the protocol breaches both the Act of Union and the 1998 Northern Ireland Act, which gives legislative effect to the Good Friday peace agreement.
Martin’s opening address to the Bipa came ahead of a virtual debate at Westminster on the protocol.
The debate, convened by a select committee, has been tabled after a DUP e-petition gained more than the 100,000 signatures required to secure parliamentary time to consider an issue.
While the protocol has created new processes on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, goods moving the other way are largely unfettered.
Goods moving from Northern Ireland into the EU are also unfettered as a consequence of the region continuing to apply the bloc’s regulatory and customs rules.
Advocates of the protocol contend that Northern Ireland finds itself in an unparalleled economic position as a result, with free access to sell into the UK internal market and the EU single market.
The Taoiseach acknowledged the disruption caused by the protocol in its early weeks of operation but highlighted the advantages it could ultimately deliver.
“We are seeing changes, since the beginning of this year, on flows and supply chains between Great Britain and Ireland, and indeed between all EU countries and Great Britain,” he told the virtual gathering of British and Irish parliamentarians.
“This brings serious new complexities and challenges, but Britain is and will remain a key trading partner and an important market for Ireland. It is in all of our interests to help our businesses manage this change.

“And that is why, as we navigate our way through these changes, I warmly welcome the work between Brussels and London to move forward and to find ways of easing implementation.
“Critically, this is being done in a context where both sides have underlined their commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and the full implementation of the protocol.
“There are many benefits and opportunities inherent in the protocol for Northern Ireland and so it is right that we all work closely together to ensure that the protocol works and that disruption is minimised to the greatest extent possible.”
Martin told the 60th plenary session of the Bipa that Brexit would have a profound impact on the relationship between the islands.
“While, of course, we cannot replace the daily interaction and shared policy agendas that we naturally enjoyed through the European Union, we need to think afresh about how we can renew and strengthen those connections,” he said.
“We should be ambitious about what we can achieve across these islands in order to deliver real and meaningful benefits to all our people.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-talks-5612653-Nov2021/,"THE EU AND UK are resuming talks in a bid to settle the dispute between the two parties over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the aftermath of Brexit.
The UK’s Brexit negotiator David Frost and the European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic are set to focus on the Northern Ireland Protocol in fresh taks, although the subject of fishing licences may also come up as French fishermen plan to protest.
Frost has insisted that the UK Government is committed to the equality and human rights safeguards within the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Brexit minister sought to make clear his attempts to secure changes to the protocol are only focused on the trade-related elements.
Article 2 of the protocol commits the UK to ensuring that Brexit will see “no diminution” of the extensive rights provisions that were enshrined in Northern Ireland as a result of the Good Friday peace agreement.
EU law underpinned many of the equality and anti-discrimination laws that flowed from the 1998 accord.
Amnesty International wrote to Frost expressing concern that Article 2 could be jeopardised if the UK Government follows through with its threat to suspend elements of the protocol amid its dispute with the EU over post-Brexit Irish Sea trade disruption.
In the letter, which was also sent to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, Amnesty raised concerns that additional commitments on rights contained in the Brexit trade agreement could also unravel if that deal collapses as a consequence of the protocol row.
Frost has now replied to the human rights in a letter, seen by the PA news agency, where he said the government is “firmly committed” to Article 2 of the protocol.
“The Government has always strongly supported Article 2 of the protocol, which became operational when the protocol was signed,” Frost wrote.
“Since that point, the Government has worked closely with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland to set up the dedicated mechanism, funding and supporting both commissions and creating a system in which rights are safeguarded,” he said.
“We have absolutely guaranteed that there will be no diminution of these rights as a result of the UK leaving the EU.”
He said the UK proposals for securing significant changes to the protocol would leave Article 2 “unchanged”.

“The focus of those proposals is on the arrangements covering trade in goods and on the governance arrangements put in place by the protocol,” he added.
In regard to the “non-regression” commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) on rights such as labour and environmental, Frost said: “The TCA provides an excellent framework for managing all these issues and is working well.”
Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty’s programme director in Northern Ireland, said while he welcomed Frost’s commentsm he retained concerns.
“We welcome these assurances from Lord Frost. However, we remain concerned that any unravelling of agreements between the UK and EU threatens all the guarantees within the protocol, including essential human rights protections for people in Northern Ireland,” Corrigan said.
“Like a game of Jenga there’s a real worry that taking out one vital piece could bring the whole thing tumbling down.”
He said other moves by the Government – such as commissioning a review of the UK Human Rights Act and a proposal to prohibit future prosecutions for Troubles-related crimes – heightened Amnesty’s concerns about the potential consequences of the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute escalating.
Elsewhere, French fishermen are preparing to blockade the Channel Tunnel and major ports today in a protest over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The fishermen’s national committee said it would stage protests at the tunnel and the Channel ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham.
In a statement it said the action, which will take place over a few hours, was intended to be “symbolic and non-violent” but any protests could have a major impact on cross-Channel trade and Downing Street urged the French authorities to prevent disruption.
The Commission has stepped up pressure on the UK in the fishing dispute, setting a 10 December deadline to resolve the row.
The No 10 spokesperson said the Government continued to engage with the commission on the subject.
He said Britain had issued almost 1,700 licences to EU boats where they could provide evidence of past fishing activity in UK waters in line with the terms of the TCA.
“We continue to abide by the TCA and work with fishermen if they have any further evidence they wish to submit as part of their application,” the spokesman said.
“We will continue to give licences where that evidence can be met.”

A spokesperson for the PSNI said that the police stations will now be recommended for “disposal”.
The police stations are in Castlederg and Aughnacloy in Tyrone and Warrenpoint in Down.
None of the three stations are currently in use and no PSNI officers are based there.
PSNI had said in 2018 that the sale of the three stations would be halted as a “precautionary step” amid negotiations about the UK’s exit from the EU.
“We regularly assess our resources to ensure we are equipped as well as possible to keep people safe,” Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton said in a statement.
“Castlederg was one of three stations which had previously been considered for disposal (Aughnacloy and Warrenpoint were the others),” Singleton said.
“In 2018, because of the uncertainty around EU exit, we looked at that decision and decided to pause their disposal,” he added.

Singleton said that decision has been “kept under review and with the changing circumstances of EU Exit, particularly in relation to UK/Ireland border arrangements, an operational review has recommended that the disposal of Castlederg, Aughnacloy and Warrenpoint stations can now recommence”.
“On August 18 we wrote to the Northern Ireland Policing Board in their role as the owner of the Police estate and in approving these stations for disposal to update them on this development,” he said.
Questions over the Irish border dominated the Brexit negotiations and led to the UK and the EU agreeing to the Northern Ireland Protocol as a way to avoid a hard border on the island.
The protocol, part of the Brexit divorce deal agreed by the UK and Brussels, effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
This means checks on goods being sent from Great Britain into the single market.
The protocol was put in place to ensure there would be no hard border with Ireland, but it has instead effectively placed a trade barrier in the Irish Sea.
The protocol is deeply unpopular with unionists, who have insisted it should be removed.
It remains unclear what will happen to the police station sites or when they might be sold.
Earlier this year, Derry City and Strabane District Council members voted to consult with the Northern Ireland Policing Board over the future of what it called the “dilapidated PSNI barracks” in Castlederg.
Councillors expressed concerns over the presence of the now-closed police station in a “prime town centre location”.
Last week, a row erupted after Northern Ireland’s police chief launched the report containing 50 recommendations, including closing down the heavily fortified Crossmaglen police station, closer working relations with An Garda Síochana and exploring the relocation of memorials to fallen officers.

UNIONIST LEADERS WHO negotiated the Good Friday Agreement have written an open letter calling for the suspension of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The letter has been sent to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and Maros Sefcovic of the European Commission.
It is signed by, among others, David Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist Party leader who was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, alongside John Hume, for their efforts in securing peace in Northern Ireland.
The letter states that unionists involved in negotiating the peace deal secured community support on the basis that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland would not be changed without their consent.
It adds: “The imposition of the Northern Ireland Protocol has breached all of these core guarantees and safeguards of the agreement.
The Protocol has been the source of tension in unionist communities for months because it places a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, in the Irish sea.

They accuse the leaders who have implemented the Protocol of “exceptional anti-democratic behaviour”.
“A fundamental principle of international law is respect for the territorial integrity of a country,” it states.
“The Protocol completely disrespects the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom.
“Consequently, you are collectively guilty of exceptional anti-democratic behaviour, of breaking a fundamental principle of international law and are imperilling the very peace process you claim to want to protect and preserve.”
The Protocol was negotiated and implemented by Boris Johnson as an alternative to the “backstop” for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The letter concludes: “We expect you to now suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol forthwith and engage with the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland to agree new arrangements which are consistent with the guarantees and provisions of the Belfast Agreement and which command the support of both communities in Northern Ireland.”
Other signatories include Lord Maginnis, Lord Empey, Lord Kilclooney, Dermot Nesbitt and David Campbell, who were all in the Ulster Unionist Party at the time of 1998 agreement.
It was also signed by Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist Party and Gary McMichael, former leader of the now defunct Ulster Democratic Party.

Addressing a meeting of party activists in Co Armagh, O’Neill said a pragmatic approach was required by all political parties to “get down to business”.
As O’Neill was delivering her speech, DUP party members were gathering in Lurgan for a meeting of their party executive.
Leader Jeffrey Donaldson made no comment to waiting media as he arrived at the venue in the Co Armagh town this evening.
While Donaldson has insisted the meeting will deal with routine business, it comes amid ongoing discussions between his party and the government over concerns about the Windsor Framework.
The DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan in February 2022 in protest at the internal UK trade barriers created by Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
The UK and EU agreed the framework earlier this year in an attempt to address unionist concerns.
However the DUP has indicated it will not return to the Stormont Assembly until the UK Government provides further assurances over Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market.
One of the main parts of the framework – the green/red lane system for the movement of goods – became operational at Northern Ireland ports on Sunday.

O’Neill said for “not a month longer” should the powersharing institutions be in shutdown while families carry the burden of a cost-of-living crisis.
She said: “Where inflation and higher mortgage interest payments are stretching household budgets, where energy costs and food prices all remain outrageously high.
“Where public services we all rely on are in crisis with people crippled as they wait for basic treatment and surgery but can’t get off a waiting list.
“It is unacceptable there is nobody at the wheel and no ministers running departments.”
O’Neill referred to a US trade delegation being brought to Northern Ireland later this month by special envoy Joe Kennedy.
She said: “This includes American investors from different sectors who want to create jobs here and give our young people new opportunities.
“We must not allow these opportunities to be squandered.
“Political stability, maturity and a pragmatic approach is required by all political parties at Stormont to work together to get things moving and get down to business.”
She added: “Time and space has been given by everyone, but there are clear limits to the public’s patience and the endpoint to that is upon us.

She was speaking following the first day of the EU Council – the first such meeting since the introduction of the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement at the beginning of May.
A new raft of post-Brexit checks on GB-to-NI goods at the ports of Belfast and Larne, which are contained in the Protocol, have sparked anger among unionists and loyalists who feel Northern Ireland is being separated from the rest of the UK.
Some have also claim that the tensions are caused by other factors separate to the Protocol.
Loyalists recently told a Westminster committeethat there was “seething anger” at Boris Johnson’s broken promise of unfettered GB-to-NI access, and that violence might be used as a “last resort”.
Westminster politicians have, in recent weeks, called for the Protocol to be pared back from what was originally agreed; Minister of State David Frost said during a trip to Northern Ireland that “common sense” must be used to solve the issue quickly. He also said recently that the UK’s relationship with Brussels will be “a bit bumpy for a time”.
Von der Leyen said yesterday: “The beginnings are not easy, tensions are being felt around the access, for example, of EU fishing boats, or tensions are without any doubt there around the implementation of the Protocol of Northern Ireland.”

While talks are continuing between the EU and the UK Government to solve some of the issues linked to the Protocol, both the outgoing DUP leader Arlene Foster and her incoming successor Edwin Poots have insisted it must be scrapped.
During the recent DUP leadership context, promising to remove the Northern Ireland Protocol became a crucial issue for the party’s elected representatives.
But von der Leyen said yesterday that this would not happen, adding: “There should be no doubt that there is no alternative to the full and correct implementation of the Protocol.
“If we see problems today we should not forget that they do not come from the Protocol but they result from Brexit. That is the reason why the problems are there.
“Now, it’s our common duty with the United Kingdom to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland and that is why we are exploring practical solutions to help to minimise the disruptions to the everyday life in Northern Ireland.”
Poots has claimed recently that the Northern Ireland Protocol is“undeliverable”and indicated he may order officials to halt border checks if the issue is not resolved.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveneyhas saidthat the checks on goods going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain could be reduced by 80% if the UK agreed on common standards for veterinary practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards on food. The UK refused this option during Brexit negotiations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/liz-trust-eu-article-16-brexit-northern-ireland-5649629-Jan2022/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Jan 2022
UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Liz Truss has warned she is prepared to unilaterally override parts of the post-Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland if the negotiations she is newly leading fail.
Truss said she will suggest “constructive proposals” to her EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic this week during their first face-to-face talks.
But she said she is “willing” to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which would suspend parts of the treaty designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland if a deal cannot be struck.
Truss was handed responsibility for the negotiations after David Frost resigned as Brexit minister last month.
She is hosting Sefcovic, a European Commission vice-president, at the Chevening country retreat afforded to the UK Foreign Secretary when he visits on Thursday.
Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she said it is her “absolute priority” to resolve the “unintended consequences” created by the protocol to maintain peace in Northern Ireland.
“When I see Maros Sefcovic this week for our first face-to-face talks, I’ll be putting forward our constructive proposals to resolve the situation.”
The current issues are “myriad and manifest”, she argued, citing issues such as bureaucracy on sending parcels between Northern Ireland and Britain and problems procuring kosher food.
“I am prepared to work night and day to negotiate a solution,” Truss continued.
“But let me be clear, I will not sign up to anything which sees the people of Northern Ireland unable to benefit from the same decisions on taxation and spending as the rest of the UK, or which still sees goods moving within our own country being subject to checks.
“My priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland. I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions including Article 16, I am willing to do that.”
Welcomed by DUP
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson welcomed the pledge by Truss to suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol if a deal cannot be reached with the EU.
It comes after Donaldson reiterated his threat to withdraw his ministers from the Stormont Executive if progress is not made on the protocol.

However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemned threats to invoke Article 16 as being “as tired as the DUP and Sinn Fein threats to collapse Stormont”.
“It solves nothing, it helps nobody, it will only make things worse,” he said.

Donaldson is due to meet Truss this week, and welcomed her latest statement.
“She is right that unionists do not consent to the protocol and we need the Government to follow through on their commitment to safeguard the Union and protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK Internal Market,” he tweeted.
Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie also welcomed Truss’s latest comments as a “way forward in dealing with trade issues with the EU”.
“It is perfectly reasonable that goods from Great Britain which are destined to stay in Northern Ireland should not be subject to checks, and those goods destined for the EU market can be checked at our ports. We have already recommended legislation to make this workable as far back as 2019,” he said.
“It would go a long way to easing a difficult situation and should form the basis for constructive talks with Maros Sefcovic this coming week.
“Multiple engagements with businesses and business representative bodies see this as a pragmatic and sensible solution. Common sense is needed to de-escalate this issue.”
However, he was critical of Sir Jeffrey’s threats to withdraw his ministers from the Executive.
“Further engagement and negotiations are the way forward. We do not need threats to pull down the Stormont institutions in the middle of a pandemic, but instead we need sensible, clear thinking,” he said.
“Constructive engagement will always work better than megaphone diplomacy.”
Dublin Rathdown TD Neale Richmond was critical of the threats to invoke Article 16, saying that it helps no one.
“The decision by the UK’s Foreign Secretary to pre-empt her first meeting with European Commission Vice President, Maroš Šefčovič, by stressing her preparedness to invoke Article 16 in the British press helps no one,” said the Fine Gael TD.
“Ultimately the Protocol is something this British Government negotiated, ratified and campaigned on in a General Election; it is not a foreign construct or a handy distraction to misuse for domestic political gain.
“There is a window now to iron out the implementation of the Protocol. Constant threats to invoke Article 16 or indeed to collapse Stormont help no one.”
He called for all parties to focus on the negotiations rather than threatening to pull out of Stormont.
Last week, Sefcovic warned that “the foundation of the entire deal” brokered between the UK and the EU would be jeopardised if Truss takes the drastic step.
“This is a very distracting element in the discussions. You try to achieve something together and – bam – there’s the threat of Article 16 again,” he told German newspaper Der Spiegel.
“It touches on the fundamentals of our relationship.
“The Northern Ireland Protocol was the most complicated part of the Brexit negotiations, and it is the foundation of the entire deal. Without the protocol, the whole system will collapse. We must prevent that at any cost.”

Foster wants the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol to be replaced because of disruption to trade from Great Britain to the region.
She said some parcels were still not getting through and major retailers like John Lewis were not delivering despite an extension to light-touch regulation in some areas until October.
The Stormont First Minister said: “There is damage happening to the Belfast Agreement and its successor agreement.
“It has also damaged the UK internal market by putting in place a system to protect the EU single market.
“What we are doing is damaging our own country.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in “listening mode” as he visited Northern Ireland on Friday and met business leaders and the First Minister to hear their concerns about trade.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill refused to meet him.
Stormont’s Agriculture Minister has stalled work on permanent border checkpoints for food entering through Northern Ireland’s ports from the rest of the UK.
Foster told Times Radio: “The Agriculture Minister (Edwin Poots) is looking at all of these issues.
“He is taking legal advice and speaking to officials as to what needs to be done.”
She said food from Great Britain heading for Northern Ireland, like lasagne, would be marked for sale in sterling so posed no risk of entering the Republic of Ireland where euros are used.
She said the EU was imposing third-party checks, similar to if somewhere like China wanted to send goods into its single market.
The DUP leader added: “It is completely disproportionate to what is necessary.”

The Northern Ireland Assembly will be able to vote on whether to scrap the protocol in 2024.
Foster said it needed to take action sooner because the economy was suffering.
She added: “We need replacement of the protocol and a much more sensible way to deal with the risk to the (EU) single market.”
Johnson has said the protocol was not operating in the way he envisaged.
The Prime Minister said he did not think arrangements he agreed with the EU would involve restrictions on the movements of food products such as sausages, on parcel deliveries and on soil from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland.
He said the protocol was operating in an imbalanced way and was causing irritation to the loyalist and unionist community in Northern Ireland as a consequence.
Johnson said the protocol was necessitating more processes and checks than it should and that is why the British government moved to delay its implementation until longer-term solutions are found with the EU.","3.07pm, 14 Mar 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/biden-visit-ireland-6033862-Apr2023/,"WHEN A GRINNING president-elect Joe Biden told a BBC reporter, teasingly, “I’m Irish!” back in 2021, Nigel Farage nearly had a fit.
He called it “proof that Biden hates the UK”. Biden’s often lumpish fetishisation of his Irish heritage notwithstanding, a return to a rational, rules-based world order was an affront to the medieval death cult which had formed around Brexit.
A UK-US trade deal – the Holy Grail for Brexit’s high priests – was off the table until London sorted out its Northern Ireland problem.
Ireland’s remarkable soft power in America was a hindrance that Leavers wilfully ignored until stung by its sticky reality. Republicans and Democrats are even more bitterly divided than their equivalents in the United Kingdom, and yet an affinity for the Irish Free State is something that they still broadly agree on.
In a country organised more like an anarchic patchwork of city-states than a cohesive cultural whole, Americans have often sought out a sense of personal identity in their ancestral origin stories.
Ireland has been quicker to embrace some American Presidents than others.Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States, was born in the Carolinas in 1765 to Scotch-Irish planters from County Antrim. Styling himself as an anti-establishment figure, he railed against the elites of the day.

He is probably most remembered for his role in the ‘Trail of Tears’, where over 60k Native Americans were removed from their lands. A populist slave owner with a penchant for ethnic cleansing, his name is not likely to be invoked at the lucrative fundraising events held in America by Irish political parties.
Donald Trump is another President that the Irish collective imagination would rather forget. Trump, anunashamed Jackson stan, was similarly impressed by Boris Johnson and the diplomatic asbestos he brought to Brexit negotiations. His visit to Ireland in 2018 was aloof to the point of parody.
A painting of President Andrew Jackson is pictured, as U.S. President Donald Trump hosts the Minority Enterprise Development Week White House awards ceremony, at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - Image ID: 2CPC29BAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
He first suggested that his meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar take place at his golf resort in Doonbeg, but the Irish government refused. A compromise was reached whereby the two men sat uncomfortably in front of a makeshift curtain in a regional airport lounge. Trump spoke to journalists and likenedIreland’s border with the UK to the US border with Mexico. It’s unclear who he considered being the Mexicans in the Anglo-Irish situation.
The nation’s preference for a Biden victory in 2020 was fairly unambiguous. In County Mayo, the win was celebrated like that elusive All-Ireland cup triumph. Ballina, the birthplace of his great-great-great grandfather, was resplendent with the smiles of distant relatives and hangers-on, boasting to television cameras against the backdrop of a technicolour Biden mural.
The small town of Moneygall was similarly transformed after an Obama visit in 2011, even erecting the Obama Plaza (a petrol station with a chipper and Papa John’s attached) in his honour.

I suppose you could say people got carried away. But the upset amongst some in the Luddite wing of the Conservative and Democratic Unionist parties was similarly delirious. In the binary world of nationalist ideologues, a positive inclination towards Ireland is the same as outright hostility towards Britain.

The reality is that Biden’s often tongue-in-cheek affection for his lineage is just political theatre. The President’s genealogy was never going to have a serious influence over matters of foreign policy and international trade. What counts in that world are treaties and the rule of law, and Britain had displayed a galling contempt for both under Johnson.
Britain’s current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, by contrast, might just be a man with whom the world feels it can do business. In reaching an agreement with the European Union on the Irish border, the new Conservative leader signalled to the world that he takes international law seriously. He ought to be rewarded for good behaviour.
Biden’s forthcoming visit to Belfast for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement is a perfect opportunity for Broken Britain to rebrand itself. If a trade deal is what Sunak needs, then why shouldn’t Dublin leverage its unique relationship with Washington to help him on his way? A politically stable, economically prosperous neighbour is in the Irish national interest, after all. What an irony it would be if it is Ireland that finally gets Brexit done.
That is not to say that there won’t be some choppy waters on the way there. Biden’s plain, sometimes clunky enthusiasm for his ancestry may yet provide some delightfully uncomfortable moments for both Irish and British politicians. He made headlines on St. Patrick’s Day 2015, when he welcomed then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny to his home,joking to cameras‘if you’re wearing orange, you’re not welcome here!’. Somewhere President Jackson, the son of Antrim Presbyterians, was spinning in his grave.

Johnson insisted solving the problems with Brussels “still seems possible”, but said the UK could trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol “reasonably and appropriately”.
European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said yesterday that if the British Government suspended the protocol, it would have “serious consequences” for the region and Brussels’ relationship with the UK.

During a speech to business leaders and diplomats at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London, Johnson said: “Let me say – given all the speculation – that we would rather find a negotiated solution to the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol – and that still seems possible.
“But if we do invoke Article 16 – which by the way is a perfectly legitimate part of that protocol – we will do so reasonably and appropriately, because we believe it is the only way left to protect the territorial integrity of our country, and meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland under the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.”
Earlier, No 10 said there were still “significant gaps” between the two sides and that the conditions to invoke Article 16 – which would in effect suspend elements of the arrangements that prevent a hard border in Ireland – had been met.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman would not put a deadline on how long talks would continue, but said: “We are going to be continuing talks, intensified talks, between the two teams to try and find a consensual solution.”
He added: “I wouldn’t seek to put a time limit on it. I think the most important thing is to not place a time limit on it which could hinder potential progress.”

Speaking to politicians here, Sefcovic said he would not speculate on whether the UK will trigger Article 16.
“However, it is clear that if they were to do so, the EU would have to consider all tools at our disposal,” he added.
“It would also have serious consequences for Northern Ireland and for our relationship with UK.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/high-demand-irish-passport-applications-5621664-Dec2021/,"THE DEPARTMENT OF Foreign Affairs warned it could have to process 1.75 million passport applications next year, having never even reached an annual figure of one million before.
In a pre-budget submission, the department said “significant pent-up capacity demand” for passports was the single biggest operational challenge they would face in 2022.
It said it would likely need an extra €18 million in funding to pay for 300 staff and is already in discussions with the OPW about fitting out extra office space.
The department also warned it was facing a significant bill for its annual contribution to the UN, for which it would require an estimated €12 million.
Another €1.75 million would be needed to open new consulates in Lyon, Toronto, and Miami, as well as the full-year costs of very recently opened missions in Manchester and Tehran.
The department said it was also likely to be hit with a bill of €3 million for running the long-awaited referendum on voting rights in presidential elections.
It said it wanted another €900,000 to set up a Global Ireland Media Challenge Fund to enhance “citizen engagement” around Ireland’s membership of the UN security council.
Correspondence with the Department of Public Expenditure reveals, however, that a massive backlog in passports was its primary concern.
A letter from Joe Hackett, the Secretary-General at the Department of Foreign Affairs, said: “As international travel reopens at an increasing pace every day this will create a significant surge in passport applications over the next 12 months as citizens plan and organise foreign travel.
“A mid-level estimate is that there could be 1.75 million passport applications next year. To put this in context, the highest number of applications previously processed was in 2019, pre-Covid-19, when circa 950,000 applications were received. This is nearly a doubling of applications.”
A breakdown of its €18-million request suggested €9 million to pay for 300 extra full-time and part-time staff and another €9 million to cover passport books, stationery, postage, extra building operating costs and other administrative bills.

Hackett also warned there was a significant backlog in the processing of foreign birth registration applications, the system by which Irish citizenship can be awarded by descent.
A request for funding said that over the past eighteen months, only emergency applications had been processed leaving a “build-up of 30,000 applications”.
It said many of these involved UK citizens that were looking to exercise their right to Irish citizenship because of Brexit.
The department also said that increased investment in overseas development would reap significant benefits for Ireland, particularly as the pandemic drags on.
Hackett wrote: “The international bill for mitigating Covid-19 globally remains high and largely unfunded.
“Ireland will come under additional international pressure during 2022 to step up its contributions to global efforts to reduce the incidence of the virus, especially in developing countries, including vaccine sharing.”
Other requests for funding by the department included an extra €3.5 million for commitments relating to Northern Ireland.
This was made up of €1.5 million for the New Decade New Approach Agreement and an increase of €2 million for the International Fund for Ireland.
A further €1.25 million was sought as part of a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in EU institutions.
It said it was of vital importance that Ireland’s representation on bodies including the EU Commission, the EU Council, the Court of Justice, and other bodies was improved.
The department’s submission said: “They are useful contact points for Irish government officials on EU matters and can help to inform Departments on the internal functioning of the Institutions and upcoming developments.
“They can also give early warning to the Irish system on significant upcoming policy or legislative decisions taken by the Commission that could have an impact on Ireland.”
Asked to comment on the records, the department said it had nothing further to add.

BRITAIN HAS SAID that it is considering an easing in visa access to help address labour shortages, which have been partly sparked by its tighter post-Brexit immigration rules.
The UK government adopted a points-based immigration model following its exit from the EU in January 2021.
“We work … to ensure our points-based system delivers for the UK and works in the best interests of the economy, by prioritising the skills and talent we need and encouraging long-term investment in the domestic workforce,” a government spokesperson said.
“This includes reviewing the shortage occupation list to ensure it reflects the current labour market.”
The shortage list seeks to relax visa access for professions in short supply.
Many British companies have long called for the government to ease its visa policy.
The hospitality, road haulage and agriculture sectors have been hit particularly hard by European labour shortages sparked by Brexit and exacerbated by Covid fallout.

The UK currently has about one million unfilled jobs, according to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
That figure has been pushed higher by including numbers of Britons choosing to leave the labour market as a result of long-term illness or early retirement.
The ONS published survey data today showing that more than a quarter of UK firms with 10 or more employees were experiencing shortages in late February. That was broadly the same as in late January.
“Many (businesses) will have little option but to increase wages to attract and retain staff,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown.
“This piles on yet more pressure at a time when higher energy costs and rising prices of goods are still causing headaches.”
The UK government and the Bank of England have urged employers to show restraint, warning that big pay hikes would jeopardise attempts to tame inflation.
Strikes have, however, multiplied in Britain in recent months as workers protest over salaries that have failed to keep pace with decades-high consumer price inflation, worsening a cost-of-living crisis.

Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan told lawmakers that the coronavirus pandemic had so far helped in “moderating people’s behaviour in terms of the desire to protest”.
“Were we not in this current environment, we would probably see a more visible outworking of that on the streets,” he said.
Unionists are angry over the new customs checks and regulations required on goods travelling across the Irish Sea, complaining there is now a border between the region and Great Britain.
Discontent in the Protestant, unionist, loyalist community is being expressed in graffiti and on social media, McEwan told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.

The new checks came into effect as a result of the Brexit deal struck between the UK and the European Union on Christmas Eve, taking effect on New Year’s Day.
Northern Ireland is still in the EU’s Single Market for goods, enabling it to keep a soft border with the Republic of Ireland.
However, the rest of the Britain has left the Single Market so checks are now needed when shuttling goods across the Irish Sea.
Some Northern Ireland politicians have warned that the new arrangements forced by Brexit could shatter the delicate peace that has held for over two decades.
In the past four years since the Brexit vote tool place, a lot of emphasis has been put on preserving the Good Friday Agreement, which brought about peace after decades of political upheaval and violence.
Because of this, the Irish government called for a border along the island of Ireland to be avoided at all costs, and this was included in the Withdrawal Agreement in the form of the Northern Irish Protocol.
In four years’ time, the Northern Ireland Assembly will vote on whether to keep or reject the current trading arrangements.","3.16pm, 27 Jan 2021",

EU COMMISSION PRESIDENT Ursula von der Leyen quoted “the great Irish band” the Saw Doctors in her address to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas stating that when the EU sits down with “our British friends” it will be done with an “honest heart and an open mind”.
The lyric comes from the song ‘To Win Just Once’ from the 1996 album Same Oul’ Town.
“I’m glad that today our talks with London are marked by a new, more pragmatic spirit because the European Union and the United Kingdom are still members of the same extended family, even if we no longer live in the same house,” she said.
By applying “common sense and focusing on the issues that really matter in Northern Ireland”, von der Leyen says she believes progress can be made in resolving the practical issues surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“We’re listening closely to the business and civil society stakeholders in Northern Ireland, but the consequences of Brexit and the kind of Brexit chosen by the UK cannot be removed entirely.
“The solutions we find must ensure that the single market continues to function in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union.
“I think if both sides are sensitive to this careful balance, a workable solution is within reach. I believe we have a duty to find it,” she said.
No hard border
She received a round of applause when she told TDs, senators and MEPs her contact with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been “encouraging”.
Von der Leyen also said that the consequences of Brexit are most “deeply felt” on the island of Ireland.
“Europe’s role in the peace process brought Europe right back to its roots and this has made Brexit even more painful for all of us,” she added.
She said Europeans understood at the onset of Brexit how important it was to preserve peace on the island of Ireland.
“One thing is absolutely clear. Brexit will not become an obstacle on the path of reconciliation in Ireland,” she said.
Ireland’s success story
Speaking about the European Union, she said Ireland has been a success story in the union.
“Joining the European Union has unleashed Ireland’s immense potential and has profoundly transformed this country in 1973.
“Ireland’s GDP per capita was around half the European Union’s average. Today, it is double the average and this is thanks to our unique single market and thanks to the ingenuity of the Irish people.
“You have just made the best of all the opportunities that are there and that comes with a freedom of trade, to travel, to study, to work all across the European Union.
“Irish society has blossomed too. When I was a teenager, married Irish women were banned from working in the public sector for whatever reason, but because of your accession to the European Community in 1973, this parliament passed its first gender equality legislation.
“Since then, the rights of women in Ireland have come such a long way.”

The EU Commission president also said that Ireland has gone “above and beyond” in its support for Ukraine.”
Speaking about the “five Irish virtues” that will help the EU face our common challenges ahead, von der Leyen said the first is the “Irish passion for freedom”.

“This country knows what it means to struggle for the right to exist,” she said.
“Today another European nation is fighting for its independence. Of course, Ireland is far away from the frontline in Ukraine, but you understand better than most why this war matters so much to all of us,” she added.
“Just like our friends in Eastern Europe, you know that in Ukraine there’s more at stake than the future of one country only.
“Ukraine is fighting for freedom itself, for self rule for the rules based global order and Ireland has gone above and beyond in its support to Ukraine.”

Energy security
Speaking about energy security, she said “we are safe for this winter”, but added that Ireland is an important player in moving towards sustainable energy supply, stating that Ireland is a “wind energy superpower”.
Responding to von der Leyen, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the war in Ukraine has only reinforced the need to step-up investments in energy infrastructure, including interconnections.
“There is no time to waste. Last week in Paris we signed contracts for the Celtic Interconnector project. A remarkable 575km of cable will link Cork to Brittany. Over half a billion euro has been contributed through the EU Connecting Europe Facility, and the interconnector will bring real benefits to the citizens of both France and Ireland.
“It is a further practical demonstration of the mutual benefits of cooperation through the European Union,” he said.
On Ukraine, he said the Irish people have, in the face of this destruction and devastation, opened our communities, our homes and our hearts to more than 65,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Ireland since the end of February.
“We remain unswerving in our political support for Ukraine, including in championing Ukraine’s path towards EU membership,” he said.
Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald thanks the EU Commission president for Europe’s steadfast support in protecting the Good Friday Agreement.
“We must see calm and clear leadership from those at the negotiating table. We’ve heard words from the new British Prime Minister Sunak is committed to restoring the political institutions and resolving issues around the implementation of the protocol and of course, those words are very, very welcome. But they must be matched by action and by meaningful talks between the British government and the European Commission,” said McDonald.
She also raised the issue of Ireland’s neutrality, stating the presence of military neutrals and the non-aligned can be a critical players in the work of peace, disarmament, and social justice. The next step is the recognition and acknowledgement of military neutrals and the non-aligned within the European treaties, said the Sinn Féin leader.

People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett said he would not be thanked if he used his time to continue with the “backslapping”, stating that he wanted to raise some necessary criticisms of the EU.
Speaking about the the EU should take responsibility in the austerity that it “rammed down the throats” of the Irish people which has resulted a “devastating” homeless and housing crisis.
Boyd Barrett said he welcomed von der Leyen’s calls for a tribunal into war crimes committed by Russia, however he called for consistency in Europe’s foreign policy.
He said a similar tribunal should take place into the war crimes committed against the Palestinian people by Israel.
Europe cannot call for an investigation into Putin’s war crimes, while “remaining silent” on the criminal actions by Israel, he told the EC president. Instead of sanctions for Israel, we given them favoured trade deals and deepen their relationship with the EU, said Boyd Barrett.
He also called out the EU’s use of oil from Saudi Arabia, stating that while the EU cuts ties with Russian oil, it is replacing it with the oil of “one of the most brutal dictatorships”.
If the EU is “going to condemn war crimes of Putin, we must simultaneously condemn all war crimes”, he said, even those that are perceived allies of the EU, added Boyd Barrett.
“We have to have consistency in our foreign policy in our ethics and in our morality if we are going to be taken seriously as defenders of human rights and opponents of war,” he concluded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-row-eu-left-in-a-bind-5372059-Mar2021/,"THE LATEST BREXIT row is not entirely surprising, as we have had hints that this would be a hostile partnership between the EU and UK – remember the Internal Market Bill?
But when the UK unilaterally announced that it would extend one of the several grace periods in place, waiving certain Brexit checks required between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it raised concerns about how this latest row could escalate.
Despite an EU-UK Joint Committee set up to encourage dialogue to avoid this exact problem, the UK decided on Wednesday to go on a “solo run”.
The next stage of this saga will see the EU taking legal action“very soon”for a breach of the Northern Ireland Protocol; while the UK could take more ‘unilateral’ actions as soon as this week.
Northern Ireland, meanwhile, is left caught in a technical quandary about how its trade should flow, all to the backdrop of its own heated, historical, political debate.
What are these ‘grace periods’?
A ‘grace period’ in this context is an agreement to waive customs or regulatory obligations for a limited amount of time.
These were agreed to because of the last-minute nature of the Brexit trade deal – but only on the basis that the UK would implement a number of measures in return, such as giving the EU real-time access to its IT systems. It’s understood many, if not all of these, haven’t yet been put in place.
Although the grace period that was extended by the UK government this week only relates to the requirement of health export certificates for agri-food products being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there are other checks that have been waived.
As it stands now, Northern Ireland checks on the following have been waived until:
The UK has requested that several of the above grace periods be extended, however.
UK GovernmentUK Government
On 2 February, in the wake of the EU’s rescinded suggestion that Article 16 be triggered to protect the bloc’s Covid-19 vaccine supply, British minister Michael Gove wrote to European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič asking for the grace periods for agri-food checks, parcel deliveries, chilled meats, and medicines to be extended until “at least” 1 January 2023.
He also made requests relating to problems with the trade of seed potatoes and plants, professional qualifications, pet travel, and steel trade to Northern Ireland.

Although the agri-food health certificates are the only sector of the above to receive an extension by the UK, the statement released on Wednesday by the UK government also said that ”further guidance will be provided later this week” on parcel deliveries and for problems with soil attached to trading plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.
It’s understood that a meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee was suggested for mid-March, where an extension of the grace periods would have possibly been discussed.
Where did these ‘grace periods’ come from?
On 8 December, Gove and Šefčovič agreed to a grace period for “trusted” supermarkets and retailers exporting agrifoods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as well as the other grace periods listed above.
European Commission Vice-President Maros SefcovicPAPA
In essence, this was in response to concerns raised from businesses and hauliers about how late in the day the Brexit trade deal was being left, putting them in an awkward position to change how the region’s trade flows.
The EU-UK trade deal was finally agreed toon 24 December, which meant that both sides avoided tariffs being added to customs and regulatory checks that result from the UK leaving the Single Market and Customs Union.
This gave businesses, workers, and hauliers a matter of days to read and understand the document – though they would have known the UK was leaving the Customs Union and Single Market for some time.
A few months earlier in June, the UK had refused to extend the transition period by six months, arguing that this time pressure would speed negotiations with the EU up. It could be argued that these grace periods are mini extension by another name.
What’s going to happen next?
The UK’s latest decision has left the EU in a bit of a bind. If they reject the UK’s extension of the grace period, it will court no favours with the people of Northern Ireland.
The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium haswelcomedthe extension of the grace period “even if it is unilaterally, to allow us to continue to give NI households the choice and affordability”.
It’s not yet clear whether the European Commission’s planned legal action will mean them challenging the extension itself, or the way in which it was done.
The European Parliament has also postponed its vote on ratifying the Brexit trade agreement, which was due to happen on 26 March. The trade agreement is being applied in principal at the moment – again, due to the last-minute nature of the deal.
PAPA
If the EU accepts the extension of six months, it may give the UK more of an inclination to do something similar again, and the longer these checks are put off being implemented, the greater a threat it is to the EU’s valuable Single Market.

This is despite this being a row of the UK’s own choosing: Theresa May announced in a 2017 speech that Brexit meant leaving the Single Market and Custom Union –seemingly against the wishes of those in her own party– and a UK negotiation decision to pursue and agree to this arrangement, that has landed Northern Ireland in this position.
As trade expert David Henigsaid: “The UK government chose to minimise regulatory alignment with the EU in the full knowledge this would mean greater checks on Great Britain – Northern Ireland food trade”.
This also raises concerns for the future dialogue between the EU and UK - Šefčovič is no longer in discussions with Michael Gove, who reportedly got on well together.
In the past week, former Brexit negotiator David Frost has been appointed to the role and has been suggested as the driving force that “upped the ante” through Wednesday’s unilateral decision.
Coveney said yesterday morning that this relationship was “really important for Ireland”:
The huge problem the North faces
If and when the grace periods are eventually lifted, it’s going to cause a lot of administrative problems for Northern Ireland – particularly for those agri-food certs.
Speaking at a Stormont Agriculture Committee yesterday, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) Denis McMahon said that food and plant safety checks currently only applied to 30% of the agri-food goods, thanks to the grace period.
“We’re achieving this ahead of a major change when the retail grace period ends, and there will be a huge increase in demand, building on current levels, which will not be sustainable with the staff and resources currently available to Daera.”
Stormont’s chief vet Dr Robert Huey said when the grace period for supermarket goods expires, the number of regulatory agri-food checks required in the region will be close to the number currently processed by the whole EU.
Dr Huey said that using Ireland-bound lorries as a guide, he calculated that 1,350 NI-bound loads from GB currently covered by operator declarations would require 20-30,000 certifications when the grace period ends.
“That’s a huge challenge, that’s approaching the same number of CHED-P (Common Health Entry Document) checks that are done for the entire European Union,” he said.
“That’s where we find ourselves. So the extension of the grace period, if that is what occurs, is welcomed but it’s not the solution. And we need to use that and if we do get the extra time we need to use that to work our way towards a better solution.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-anti-brexit-protest-5600833-Nov2021/,"A SERIES OF demonstrations will be held along the Irish border next week telling Boris Johnson to “back off” on plans to trigger Article 16.
The group Border Communities Against Brexit (BCAD) is set to protest at five locations on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in support of the protocol.
It has accused the British Government of damaging the peace process with its threats to suspend elements of the treaty, which has prevented a hard border in Ireland but created trade barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland.
Speaking today, chairperson Damian McGinnity said: “Boris Johnson’s Government has been pursuing a reckless course in negotiations with the EU around the protocol, including threats to trigger Article 16.”
“Recent British Government statements and actions are posing a very direct threat to the peace process, the all-island economy and raising once again the horrific prospect of a return to a hard border in Ireland,” McGinnity said.
“We are calling on Boris Johnson to back off, and to protect and implement the protocol.”
McGinnity said many in Northern Ireland believe the protocol is working, and has protected the region from the worst impacts of Brexit.
“Communities, businesses, workers, farmers and students along the border want the protocol to be implemented in order to protect jobs, livelihoods and community life on this island,” he said.
“Businesses, manufacturers and farmers are benefiting from the protocol and thousands of jobs are being created and secured as a direct result of it.
“The protocol has mitigated the worst effects of Brexit for communities such as ours.
“The majority of people and political parties in the North opposed Brexit and support the protocol as the key mechanism to prevent a hard border and protect the all-island economy and Good Friday Agreement.”

He criticised the British Government’s approach to the issue as damaging to the peace in Northern Ireland.
“The dangerous and inflammatory rhetoric emanating from Boris Johnson’s Government is now undermining all of the progress we have made in recent years,” he said.
“They need to listen to the concerns of border communities, to businesses and to farmers who will be devastated by any triggering of Article 16.
“We will not allow any reimposition of a hard border and the untold social and economic damage this would cause. We will not allow the peace process to be undermined.”
BCAB will stage demonstrations at Flurry Bridge in Carrickcarnon, Belcoo/Blacklion, Moybridge in Aughnacloy, the Lifford Bridge and Bridgend in Derry from 3pm on November 20.
McGinnnity said: “We are asking everyone living along the border, on either side, to make an effort to attend their nearest demonstration.
“We are calling on all trade unions, representative groups, civic leaders, sporting organisations and citizens to join with us on Saturday 20th November at 3pm to say loudly to Boris Johnson to back off and protect the protocol.”
Talks between London and Brussels over the contentious protocol remain deadlocked and there is speculation that the UK is poised to trigger Article 16 in the coming weeks.
The UK Government has set a December deadline for a resolution in talks on the protocol.
The arrangement effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market for goods, resulting in some checks for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit negotiator David Frost have argued the EU’s interpretation of the deal has led to difficulties.
The EU has presented a package it believes will eliminate the need for 80% of checks, but the UK has insisted the oversight role of the European Court of Justice is removed, a move Brussels firmly rejects.
Frost called for “new impetus and energy” to be brought to negotiations, which will continue in Brussels next week.

PROTESTERS HAVE CONDEMNED the UK government’s decision to start sending migrants to Rwanda from next week.
Demonstrators shook the outer fence of an immigration removal centre in protest at the  policy — and people inside the facility appeared to be shouting back.
Scores of activists marched to the Brook House Immigration Removal Centre, close to Gatwick Airport, near Crawley, West Sussex.Demonstrators condemned the government’s plansVictoria Jones / PAVictoria Jones / PA / PA
A High Court ruling on Friday paved the way for a flight to the east African country to go ahead on Tuesday, but an appeal against that decision is due to be heard tomorrow.
The immigration policy has come in for criticism from various groups, with even Prince Charles said to be “more than disappointed” by it, amid reports that he privately described the move to send migrants to Rwanda as “appalling”.
Clarence House has insisted Prince Charles “remains politically neutral”, despite reported private comments criticising the policy
At the protest, teacher Jane Fisher, of Croydon, south London, who volunteers with Care for Calais, which delivers emergency aid to refugees, told the PA news agency: “There is a young boy called Sami and he was from Afghanistan, his parents and his sister were blown up in a car bomb and he is 17 and he has come across.
“He is really frightened he is going to be sent to Rwanda.
“He keeps asking about it because the refuges don’t know what is happening.
“I meet some amazing people and all of them have got horrible stories.”
Abbas Artan, 24, an asylum seeker originally from Somalia who crossed from Calais to the UK in a small boat in October, says he has been living in limbo at the Radisson Red hotel near Gatwick Airport for the past eight months.
The boss of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), which represents more than 80% of Border Force staff, said the “legality of these proposals” must be tested, but added there is also a need to debate “the morality and lack of humanity that the Government is demonstrating” with its approach.

Up to 130 people have been notified they could be removed, and on Friday the court in London heard that 31 people were due on the first flight, with the Home Office planning to schedule more this year.
The first claim against the policy was brought by lawyers on behalf of some asylum seekers alongside the PCS, as well as groups Care4Calais and Detention Action, which are challenging the policy on behalf of everyone affected.
Mr Justice Swift on Friday ruled against granting a temporary block to the policy until a full hearing next month, but granted the claimants permission to appeal against his decision, suggesting Court of Appeal judges would hear the case on Monday.
PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: “We hope we win tomorrow in the Court of Appeal to stop the flight (on Tuesday).
“But, of course, the legality of these proposals will only be tested out at the full court hearing in July.
“We’re absolutely confident that in July, in line with what the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) said very graphically in court, we believe these proposals will be found to be unlawful.”
He said Home Secretary Priti Patel would not ask civil servants to carry out the policy before its legality had been tested in court if she “had any respect, not just for the desperate people who come to this country, but for the workers she employs”.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis defended the government’s policy, saying it aims to “break” the “business model” of people smugglers.
Asked if he was personally comfortable with the policy, he told the same programme: “Yes, I am, actually.”
He said: “The reality is this is a policy that is going to deliver to ensure that modern slavery and these people smugglers know that their criminal methods will be broken down, and saying to people around the world ‘if you are a refugee, if you are an asylum seeker, if you are a legal migrant coming to this country, we want to give you the support to properly help you be part of the UK economy, part of the UK way of life, which is what you want’, and that’s right.”
He said it would not be “appropriate” to comment on “rumoured” criticism from Prince Charles.
Rwanda’s lead negotiator for the deportation agreement with the UK has said the country is ready to accept people in “tens of thousands”, but will start on a gradual basis.
She also defended Rwanda’s human rights record and said it was not illegal to be homosexual.
“Not at all, actually based on our history we understand the importance of protecting anybody from hate speech and discrimination, this is not tolerated in our society, the freedom from discrimination due to sexual orientation of a person is guaranteed in our constitution and the rule of law is there to enforce that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-mps-debate-northern-ireland-protocol-bill-amendments-5816011-Jul2022/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Jul 2022
UK MPS HAVE voted against several proposed amendments to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill following an extensive debate in the House of Commons today.
The Bill began its committee stage of the debate in the House of Commons today, which allows MPs to vote on amendments to it.
It proposes giving UK ministers the power to change almost every aspect of the post-Brexit deal and effectively scraps customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.
It also proposes creating green and red channels for traders to differentiate between goods that remain within Northern Ireland and those destined for onward transportation across the border into the EU.
The European Union has strongly condemned the Bill and has warned that it could take further action against Britain if it enacts the legislation.
The SDLP, Alliance, Labour and the Liberal Democrats had proposed a number of amendments to alter the Bill, but none of them were successful during the debate.
MPs voted 313 to 231 to reject a Liberal Democrat amendment which sought to require British ministers to set out the legal justification for altering the effect of the Northern Ireland Protocol in domestic law.
They also voted 308 to 230 to reject an SDLP amendment which had sought to protect the part of the Northern Ireland Protocol linked to democratic consent.
Labour’s clause 10, which had sought to prevent ministers from deviating from the Northern Ireland Protocol unless it had been agreed by both the UK and EU, or the UK had followed the procedure for unilateral action, was also rejected by 300 votes to 229.
Debating the Bill earlier today, Conservative Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill said the UK Government must allow MPs to consider any basis for changing Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade arrangements, ministers have been told
Neill said the Bill was “exceptional” and not in a “good way”, with the Government considering the “very grave and profound step” of withdrawing from the protocol unilaterally.

Reputational consequences
“The point of these amendments is to say that… if the Government or any government were to take that step it should do so upon the most compelling grounds so that the factual basis for their actions meet the legal test,” he said.
“The reputational consequences, politically, internationally and legally are very significant and therefore it should only be done when that is thoroughly tested and set before this House to be tested.”
Neill also said that a change of prime minister may help to ease tensions between the EU and UK.
On Boris Johnson’s resignation, he said: “I very much hope that one consequence of what has happened is it may be easier to rebuild and repair relationships and trust and that could then lead to a negotiated change which would mean this legislation wasn’t ever necessary.”
“If the Bill is to be taken forward it seems to me that we have to have proper safeguards to ensure proper parliamentary and democratic oversight of the way that it is taken into force.”
Intervening, Labour MP Stella Creasy said that so-called “Henry VIII” powers in the Bill could “set a precedent” for giving ministers more delegated power in future laws, stressing the need to “uphold the primacy” of the Commons.
Henry VIII powers are clauses in a bill that enable ministers to amend or repeal provisions in an Act of Parliament using secondary legislation.
Neill replied that all governments use Henry VIII powers, adding: “But the reality is there are ‘Henry VIII powers’, and ‘Henry VIII powers’, and this is Henry VIII, the six wives, Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell all thrown in together pretty much, as far as I can see.”
“We all know that governments come and go and once you set a precedent that gives very sweeping powers to a government you may happen to agree with, there may and indeed inevitably there will be, as night follows day, be a day when a government which we do not agree with comes in and uses those powers in a way which we might wish to object to.”
Conservative former minister Jesse Norman said the Bill is a “contravention of our constitution” and that it is “not the answer”.
“It has been properly pointed out that the doctrine of necessity does not apply in anything like the way the Government described. I am not a lawyer myself, but even I can see it when the minister at the despatch concedes that immediacy is not at stake, and not implied by the conception of urgency that he wishes to deploy, or that the Government wishes to deploy,” he said.
“In breaching international law for the reasons the former attorney general has set out, the Bill breaks the general principle that promises must be kept.
Stormont executive
Commenting on whether the legislation will lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told the Commons: “I believe this legislation, if enacted, will help us to achieve that objective.

“I’m absolutely convinced of that and my party has stated clearly that if this Bill becomes law, we believe that provides the basis for restoring the political institutions in Northern Ireland, including the executive, and I’ve already committed to leave this place and to return to Stormont as the deputy first minister as part of that executive.
“Therefore I have a personal commitment to the restoration of the political institutions, as does my party.”
Tory MP Bill Cash said: “The fact is in Northern Ireland, the people, the voters are being subjugated to the laws of the European Union in a manner which is inconsistent with our leaving the European Union.”
Donaldson said there is a “risk to the union” in relation to how the Protocol is being applied in Northern Ireland.
“Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland have stated that the Protocol subjugates Article Six of the Act of Union itself, and that article confers on Northern Ireland citizens the right to trade freely within their own country,” he said.
“It states that there shall be no barrier to trade between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom and no one could reasonably argue that the protocol doesn’t put in place barriers to trade. It most certainly does.”
He said the Protocol has had an economic impact in Northern Ireland, and said there is also “the potential for that to lead to societal problems”.
Leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood asked Donaldson if he accepted that “very clearly written” into the Good Friday Agreement is the principle of consent.
“It basically means that no matter how much I want it, we can’t change the constitutional position of Northern Ireland until the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the Republic of Ireland vote for it,” he said.
Donaldson replied that there is a difference of view “as to how you interpret what is required in terms of consent”.
A second day of debate is due to take place on Monday 18 July, with plans to conclude committee stage of the Bill on Tuesday July 19.

https://www.thejournal.ie/international-fund-for-ireland-paddy-harte-brexit-northern-ireland-peace-5587750-Oct2021/,"THE HEAD OF a major peace fund has warned of growing alienation after the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit.
International Fund for Ireland (IFI) chairman Paddy Harte said it is impossible to rule out future disorder such as the scenes at the Lanark Way peace line in west Belfast in April.
Harte also warned that paramilitary groups on both sides of the divide are gaining support from vulnerable communities who feel they have been let down by the peace process.
He said recent recruitment by dissident republicans was “alarming” as well as loyalists capitalising on anger at the Northern Ireland Protocol, seen by that community as a border in the Irish Sea.

He said a huge amount of work had gone on behind the scenes earlier this year to quell the serious disorder that erupted at a gate in the peace wall between the Falls Road and Shankill Road.
The violence stopped after several consecutive nights of violence.
“We were able to put in a fairly rapid response to enable our community workers to work together to ensure that there were young people with credentials there to persuade as many as they could not to get involved,” Harte said.
“It was night and day work… had it not been for the presence of our groups and others, that could have spun out of control, there could have been fatalities – it’s not magic that things didn’t start up again, because people stayed on top of it.”
The efforts included groups of young people from across the divide attending the Uefa Super Cup clash between Chelsea and Villareal in July at Windsor Park as part of new relationships being built.
Significant work also went on behind the scenes at the North Queen Street/Duncairn interface in north Belfast after tensions rose over the siting of a loyalist July 11 bonfire.
However Harte warned: “There is only so long society can expect volunteers and community workers to continue to do this.
“It’s very, very possible (violence could erupt again) however the connections that we have within communities and the networks that we have means that we could respond again, but it would be very naive for anyone to think that Lanark Way wouldn’t happen again.

“We are dealing primarily with generations of quite appalling conflict.
“Brexit has brought up issues of culture and identity, and raised old sores that had gone well into the background. The protocol has brought up this threat to the union and opportunity for a united Ireland – that sort of binary position is something that us and others have worked for years trying to show there are much more significant things to deal with.
“When we lay Covid on that, that restricted if not stopped opportunities for discourse around these things that helped us in our challenging conversations to work through concerns people were having.”

He added:
“Covid also brought into play Covid nationalism, for want of a better word, that people started to compare what was going on in Ireland with what was going on in Britain, and on one side of the border and the other people started to label people again in a way that had gone into the background.”
Raising the marking of a number of centenary dates, Harte said there are “lots of things that are coming together at the same time that make our work quite challenging and the consequences of all those things are that people have gone back into traditional positions”.
“The middle ground is smaller now than it has been for the last 15 years,” he added, referring to a recent survey which found growing alienation in society.
The fund also supports work around peace walls, with recent progress around barriers at Bishop Street in Londonderry and the gates at Flax Street in north Belfast.
Harte was speaking as the fund launches its new four-year strategy which says renewed efforts to build cross-border relationships are “critical to achieving long-term sustainable peace”.
Connecting Communities includes four programmes to empower marginalised communities. The strategy has been welcomed by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
Lewis said the fund has done “unparalleled work to build and sustain peace by promoting and facilitating reconciliation and by tackling the underlying causes of violence and sectarianism”, adding it “continues to have a vital role to play”.
Coveney added: “As the world recovers from the social and economic effects of the Covid pandemic, and as Northern Ireland and the border counties continue to deal with the legacy of the past and the impact of Brexit, the work of the fund, through its engagement with the young and the most marginalised, is greatly needed in the period that lies ahead.”
The IFI was set up by the British and Irish governments as an independent organisation in 1986. It delivers a range of peace and reconciliation initiatives across Northern Ireland and the southern border counties.

DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has said Northern Ireland’s relationship with the Republic of Ireland as well as Great Britain has been harmed by the Protocol but that he believes there is a solution.
Speaking on Sky News this morning, Donaldson also said that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “needs to recognise” the Protocol is a concern to unionists for constitutional reasons as well as trading ones.
The Protocol essentially means that EU regulatory and customs checks take place between Britain and the island of Ireland, instead of along the border in Ireland.
Unionists across the spectrum in Northern Ireland have voiced objections to the Protocol, saying it makes trade more difficult for businesses as well as weakening Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom.
Nationalists and the Irish government have argued that the Protocol is an instrument made necessary by Brexit, which was supported by the DUP but not a majority within Northern Ireland.

Donaldson’s appearance on Sky News’ show Trevor Phillips on Sunday comes following a number of Brexit developments this week.
The EU this week decided to extendthe grace period allowingchilled meats to be sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, endingthe so-called ‘sausage war’.
Also this week, a court challenge brought by unionists that argued that the Protocol contradicts the Good Friday Agreement and EU law were all dismissed by a Belfast judge.
Though the judge did acknowledge that the Protocol contradicts the Act of Union, he ruled that the agreement by Parliament effectively overrode the 200-year-old law.
Donaldson has described this finding as “politically significant”, saying that if it wasn’t resolved it will have “potential consequences for the future stability of political institutions”.
Again returning to constitutional issues today, Donaldson insisted that the Protocol goes against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.
“At the heart of the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement are three sets of relationships and there’s a very delicate balance within that Agreement as to how those relationships are managed,” Donaldson said.
He added: “It is imperative for all of us that we resolve these issues. I’m not accepting that this can’t be done, I’m not accepting that there is no solution, I believe there is and that’s what I’m going to strive for.”
Donaldson also said that the UK Prime Minister needed to “put right what was done wrong”.

“We’ve heard him recognise that there are difficulties in terms of the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland but not just in trading terms, the Prime minister also needs to recognise that this impacts on our constitutional position.”
Donaldson was confirmed as theDUP’s new leader last month after Edwin Pootswas forced out just weeks after being elected to the position.
Upon his election, Donaldson said he would place opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol at the centre of his leadership.
Asked today whether the DUP needed to acklowdge that Brexit made a trade border inevitable and that the party should instead focus on Northern Ireland’s position in both the UK and EU markets, Donaldson said “there are opportunities going forward”.
“We can’t get to those opportunities because of these unnecessary barriers,” he said, however.
“Much of our supply chain comes from Great Britain, whether you are a consumer buying goods in the supermarket or a business, relying on component parts for your manufacturing process, we need to fix that supply chain problem.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/keir-starmer-says-northern-ireland-doesnt-trust-boris-johnson-5490069-Jul2021/,"BRITISH OPPOSTION LEADER Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of having “betrayed” the people of Northern Ireland.
The UK Labour party leader was speaking during two days of official engagements in the North accompanied by shadow secretary of state Louise Haigh.
Reflecting on having worked in Northern Ireland for six years with police in the early 2000s, Starmer said he learned the importance of trust and the role of the UK Government as an honest broker, bringing communities together.
There are tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol, with unionists claiming the additional checks on goods are placing a border down the Irish Sea.
There have been demonstrations against the Protocol as well as legal challenges to it.
Starmer told the PA news agency in Belfast that Boris Johnson had “not been straight about the consequences” of the Protocol.
“He is now pretending it is someone else’s problem, and in Northern Ireland that won’t wash,” he said.
“There has to be a practical way forward on this, I think there is a practical way forward if the parties are flexible and negotiate, but the most important thing is trust.
“There is a positive future here but it does require the British Government to properly understand its role, and I think that this Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has betrayed the people of Northern Ireland by not properly honouring that (the UK Government being an honest broker), and the words that have been used in pretty well every meeting I have had here in Northern Ireland is a lack of trust in the Prime Minister as an honest broker.
“That is a massive missing piece.”
Starmer visited Forge Integrated Primary School in Belfast this morning before meeting Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne at police headquarters in the city.
The Labour leader later met with the five main political parties at Stormont.

He said the Good Friday Agreement and its promise of peace must “never be taken for granted”.
“Returning to Northern Ireland today, I can see how much is still at stake,” he said.
“The peace here was built on the trust, courage and commitment of the communities of Northern Ireland and political leaders. I felt that while working here in the years after Good Friday. And it is with those values in mind that I will go into today’s important meetings.
“This morning, I saw the transformation that peace helped bring about at an integrated school in Belfast. I saw the smiles of hope from young people as they look to the future. Whether we are in Westminster or Stormont, as political leaders we owe it to that generation to deliver on the promise of the Good Friday Agreement.
“We must recognise that trust is fragile, and progress is stalling. I understand the concerns of communities and businesses here about the problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. I’m here to listen and to call for serious, practical solutions.”
Starmer heard the concerns of the five parties, including opposition to the Protocol from unionists.
Speaking to media after the meetings, Starmer said trust in the Prime Minister was at an “all time low” in Northern Ireland.
He said the UK negotiating a deal on veterinary standards that could reduce the needs for checks in the Irish Sea would be “a big step in the right direction”.
Haigh said they discussed such a deal with all the parties, adding there was “relative consensus that is part of the solution”.
“It’s not the only thing but ultimately we need to see the British Government getting back round the negotiating table with the European Union and using the mechanisms of the Protocol to find that agreement,” she said.
“It is not a sustainable solution to keep proposing unilateral mechanisms and unfortunately that’s what we anticipate will happen in the next couple of weeks from (Brexit minister) David Frost.
“We need to see the consensus and that trust to find sustainable solutions for Northern Ireland.”
The Irish government has said an agreement on SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary), similar to that between Switzerland and the EU, could eliminate 80% of checks.
Starmer and Haigh went on to meet with victims of the Troubles this evening.

https://www.thejournal.ie/g7-summit-explainer-5463028-Jun2021/,"US President Joe Biden talks with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during their meeting ahead of the G7 summit in CornwallToby MelvilleToby Melville
LEADERS FROM AROUND the world are to gather in Cornwall, England today for the G7 summit.
This will be the first time the leaders have met in almost two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the fight against the virus will be one of the main items on the agenda.
The Group of Seven countries brings together some of the world’s richest democracies – the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy, along with representatives of the European Union.
The UK currently holds the rotating presidency, so it has responsibility for hosting the summit, which will take place from today until Sunday at Carbis Bay in Cornwall.
Who are the leaders attending this year’s event?
Along with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, Canada’s Justin Trudeau, Japan’s Yoshihide Suga, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Angela Merkel and Italy’s Mario Draghi will represent their countries.
The European Union will be represented by commission president Ursula von der Leyen and council president Charles Michel.
Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison, South Korean president Moon Jae-in and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa will all attend as guests, while India’s Narendra Modi will participate via video link due to the coronavirus crisis.

Other than Covid-19, what will be on the agenda?
This is Biden’s first overseas visit as US President and he will use the visit to try to build an alliance of democracies as a counterweight to China, with the White House saying they expect G7 leaders to announce a new initiative to provide financing for physical, digital and health infrastructure in the developing world as an alternative to the “belt and road” measures offered by Beijing.
The leaders are also expected to discuss issues including climate change and getting more children into education around the world.
And, of course, there’s Brexit. The ongoing row between the European Union and the UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol is likely to loom large.
Unusually for a summit of leaders, the UK’s Brexit Minister David Frost will be in attendance and Johnson will hold talks with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen as well as the leaders of France, Germany and Italy.

Biden has also taken an interest in the issue in recent days.
The scale of the US president’s unease about the UK’s approach to the Protocol was revealed in a leaked memo which showed the president took the extraordinary step of ordering the United States’ most senior diplomat in London, Yael Lempert, to deliver a demarche – a formal protest – in a meeting with Brexit minister David Frost on 3 June.
The Times newspaper reported that Government minutes of the meeting said: “Lempert implied that the UK had been inflaming the rhetoric, by asking if he would keep it ‘cool’.”
The US charge d’affaires indicated that if Johnson accepted demands to follow EU rules on agricultural standards, Biden would ensure it would not “negatively affect the chances of reaching a US/UK free trade deal”.
Downing Street did not deny the encounter took place. A No 10 spokesman said: “I don’t think you would expect me to get into discussions with other countries.”

Speaking after a meeting with Biden yesterday evening, Johnson sought to play down differences with Biden, claiming the new US President was a “breath of fresh air” and insisting there was “absolutely common ground” over Northern Ireland.
Asked if Biden made his alarm about the situation in Northern Ireland clear, Boris Johnson said: “No, he didn’t.
“What I can say is that America – the United States, Washington – the UK plus the European Union have one thing we absolutely all want to do and that is to uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and make sure we keep the balance of the peace process going.
“That’s absolutely common ground and I’m optimistic that we can do that.”
Are protests expected over the weekend?
Extinction Rebellion activists have promised a series of demonstrations to call on the G7 to do more to tackle climate change.
The Kill the Bill movement will also protest against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.
Security is expected to be very tight. Some 5,000 extra officers from around England have been drafted in to support Devon and Cornwall Police.
In total, 6,500 officers and staff will be deployed in the operation, with 1,000 of them effectively living on a ship moored in Falmouth.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-shortage-of-butchers-endangers-christmas-meats-brexit-5562708-Oct2021/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT said it is “continuing to work closely” with the pig industry amid a reported shortage of butchers which could impact food supplies over Christmas.
UK ministers are considering plans to ease visa restrictions for up to 1,000 foreign butchers, according to The Times.
A spokesman for the Department For Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told the PA news agency it was aware of labour shortages.
“We understand the importance of seasonal labour and we are aware of the challenges that the pig industry has faced in recent months because of the Covid-19 pandemic and labour shortages, and Defra has been working closely with the pig and processing sectors during this time,” he said.
“We are keeping the market under close review and continuing to work closely with the sector to explore options to address the pressures industry is currently facing.”

The Times reported the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the industry is short about 15,000 workers, with has forced its members to just focus on keeping supermarkets stocked with basic cuts of meat.
A BMPA spokesperson was quoted as saying: “We really should have been producing Christmas food from about June or July onwards this year and so far we haven’t, so there’ll be shortages of party foods and things like pigs in blankets. Anything that is labour-intensive work could see shortages.”
The newspaper said Home Secretary Priti Patel has resisted the move to recruit foreign butchers.
A Home Office spokesperson told PA: “We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world.
“We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work.
“The Government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options wage increases and investment.”
The UK economy has been disrupted by several factors that have been bubbling away for months, including labour shortages, new immigration rules affecting HGV drivers and the lingering effects of the pandemic.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-protocol-poll-5585747-Oct2021/,"LAST UPDATE|28 Oct 2021
A MAJORITY OF people in Northern Ireland now view the Brexit protocol governing Irish Sea trade as a positive for the region, according to a poll.
The latest survey of public opinion conducted for Queen’s University, Belfast found that 52% of respondents consider the Northern Ireland Protocol to be a ‘good thing’ on balance.
That figure has increased from 43% who responded to the same question in June.
The poll is the latest commissioned by Queen’s to monitor attitudes in Northern Ireland towards Brexit and, particularly, the trade arrangements that have created economic barriers between the region and Great Britain.
The online survey conducted by LucidTalk at the start of October was the third such poll undertaken since the protocol came into effect at the start of the year.
While the results show that the contentious mechanism continues to sharply divide opinion in the region, it also indicates a growing acceptance of the arrangements.
It found that 53% of the 2,682 voters sampled now agree or strongly agree that the protocol is an appropriate means for managing the effects of Brexit on Northern Ireland. In June’s survey, this figure was 46%.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to ensure the Irish land border remained free flowing post-Brexit. It achieves that by moving regulatory and customs checks to the sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
London and Brussels are currently locked in negotiations to try to redraw aspects of the protocol and cut some of the red tape it has created on Irish Sea trade.
Many loyalists and unionists are vehemently opposed to the protocol, claiming it has weakened Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the UK.
Amid a threat from the DUP to pull down powersharing at Stormont if major changes are not secured, the UK Government had threatened to unilaterally suspend part of the protocol – by triggering the Article 16 mechanism – if talks with the EU end in failure.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar this morning said the results of the survey were “interesting”.
“It’s essential that we listen to the views of people and business in Northern Ireland,” Varadkar tweeted.
“The supply chain problems being faced across the UK have been caused, in large part, by Brexit.”
Asked if the UK would be justified in triggering Article 16 now, 53% of respondents said no and 39% said yes.
The protocol also offers traders in Northern Ireland unrestricted access to sell with the UK internal market and the EU single market.

In response to the question as to whether the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of circumstances that could benefit the region, 62% said yes – an increase on the 57% who agreed in June’s poll and the 50% in March’s survey.
Respondents were also asked to rank their specific concerns about the protocol.
This exercise saw supply of medicines from GB and the additional customs paperwork on Irish Sea trade as the main issues of concern.
While the UK Government has insisted that removing the oversight role of the European Court of Justice in the protocol is a red line demand in the negotiations with the EU, the poll of Northern Ireland voters indicated the ECJ issue was not a priority concern.
A clear majority of voters continue to believe the protocol has had a negative political impact in the region.
Of those sampled, 59% saw the protocol impacting negatively on political stability in Northern Ireland – this percentage decreased from 68% in June’s poll.
Majorities – 62% and 64% – believe the protocol has had a negative impact on UK/Irish relations and EU/UK relations respectively. In the June poll, those numbers were 67% and 70%.
In terms of trust, 87% of respondents do not trust the UK Government to manage the interests of Northern Ireland in respect of the protocol, compared to 86% in June.
On Brexit itself, the poll also indicated a slight increase in the proportion of respondents – 60% compared to 57% in June – who disagree or disagree strongly that Brexit is on balance ‘a good thing for the UK’.
The polls are part of a three-year Queen’s project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
The 2,682 participants were a weighted sample of voters who take an interest in current affairs and politics, and who are likely to exercise their right to vote.
Principal investigator with the Queen’s project, Professor David Phinnemore, said: “Majority opinion in Northern Ireland appears to be becoming more accepting and indeed more supportive of the protocol, although many voters remain concerned about the impact Brexit and the protocol are having on Northern Ireland.
“Immediate priority concerns relate to the future availability of medicines and increased paperwork for and restrictions on bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
“The UK Government sees removal of the Court of Justice from the protocol as an overriding priority; the evidence from this poll is that this is not a priority concern of voters in Northern Ireland.
“What matters more are practical issues and addressing the political instability resulting from Brexit and responses to the protocol.”
Co-investigator Professor Katy Hayward added: “Given that the UK and EU are currently in talks to make adjustments to the protocol, this survey is an important indication of the views and concerns of the people in Northern Ireland.
“The UK and the EU have a crucial opportunity now to restore trust and confidence across communities in NI, as well as to address the issues that have arisen since the end of the transition period that matter most to people here.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-michelle-oneill-sinn-fein-5764280-May2022/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has called the recent elections in Northern Ireland, which saw the party become the largest in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, “historical” and “transformational”.
And as the party’s leader at Stormont, Michelle O’Neill is on the verge of becoming Northern Ireland’s first republican first minister.
At a press conference today, McDonald called it “a matter of disgrace that the DUP … with the support and connivance of the British government, have moved to frustrate the democratic will of the people”.
She added that “we are in the midst of a cost of living crisis. People are literally struggling to pay their grocery bills and their heat,” and said her party is insistent that there is a functioning government in the North, and not “caretaker ministers”.
Yesterday morning the DUP moved to block the election of a speaker for the Northern Ireland Assembly, which will prevent the forming of a new executive.
The move is seen as a protest against theNorthern Ireland Protocol.Unionists oppose the post-Brexit treaty because of the economic barriers it creates between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
McDonald accused UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of using unionism in Northern Ireland as “a pawn in a wider game that is being played out with the European Union”.
In a statement yesterday, DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said: “Some parties who just a few months ago were mocking the promise of decisive action from the DUP in relation to the Protocol are the very same parties now feigning surprise and outrage at a political party keeping its promise to the electorate.”
McDonald and O’Neill will meet with Johnson in Northern Ireland on Monday.

‘The protocol is going nowhere’
McDonald said that what her party wants is the establishment of an executive, the nomination of a first minister, a deputy first minister, and the nomination and appointment of a speaker.
“The DUP have not simply called a halt to the formation of an executive, they have equally attempted to place a veto on the operation of the assembly,” she said, calling it “outrageous”.
The British government, she added, has to “desist” in assisting the DUP in the “blocking tactics”, which is something she and O’Neill will be saying to Johnson on Monday she said.
Asked whether there was a possibility of an announcement from Johnson on Monday that the UK government would be unilaterally dissolving the Northern Ireland Protocol, McDonald said that “the protocol is going nowhere,” and called it a “necessary outworking of Brexit”.
Nobody should be “spooked by the actions of the British government”, she said.
“What the British government and Boris Johnson need to understand is that they may wish to try and thwart or delay or stall change and progressivity in Ireland, (but) they will not succeed.”
Also speaking at today’s press conference, O’Neill said that the public had “voted for politics to work (and) for parties to work together.” She added that through its actions, the DUP is punishing the public for its “own Brexit mess”.
Asked about her outlook regarding whether she would become first minister by the summer, O’Neill stated that she wants the opportunity to lead, and “there should be no delay.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/liz-truss-not-shy-away-action-northern-ireland-protocol-5760407-May2022/,"THE UK FOREIGN Secretary has said the UK “will not shy away” from taking action on the Northern Ireland Protocol after the British Prime Minister indicated the situation was “now very serious”.
Liz Truss said some proposals put forward by the European Union during months of discussions on the post-Brexit treaty would “take us backwards” as she argued against introducing “more checks, paperwork and disruption”.
The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said that, under EU proposals suggested in October, trading arrangements could worsen and everyday items could disappear from shop shelves in Northern Ireland.
Truss said: “The current EU proposals fail to properly address the real issues affecting Northern Ireland and in some cases would take us backward.
“Prices have risen, trade is being badly disrupted, and the people of Northern Ireland are subject to different laws and taxes than those over the Irish Sea, which has left them without an executive and poses a threat to peace and stability.
“Our preference has always been for a negotiated solution but (we) will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.”
Her comments came after Boris Johnson spoke to Taoiseach Micheál Martin about the post-Brexit arrangements on Tuesday.
In a Downing Street account of the call, the two leaders agreed on the vital importance of restoring the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which came second in last week’s Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, has warned the Prime Minister it would not nominate a deputy first minister to form an Executive until “decisive action is taken on the Protocol”.
Donaldson
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told the House of Commons last night thathe will not be taking up his seat in Stormontand that he will stay as an MP “until this Protocol issue is resolved”.

He had said prior to last week’s election that he would not join in the power-sharing government due to his party’s objection to the Protocol but also said that he would sit in the Assembly.
However, since the election he has raised the possibility of not taking his seat either and appeared to confirm this plan in the House of Commons this evening.
Speaking yesterday, Donaldson said his party has taken the “reluctant decision not to nominate ministers” and he went on to say he will not be leaving the House of Commons either.
“I’m prepared to commit the remainder of my political career to going back to those institutions and working with my colleagues to make it work…. but I will not leave this House until this Protocol issue is resolved, I will not leave this House until the political institutions in Northern Ireland have a stable foundation,” he said.
Johnson was said to have made clear that the situation in respect of the Protocol was now very serious.
He also said that the balance of the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement was being undermined and the recent elections had further demonstrated that the protocol was not sustainable in its current form.
“Despite repeated efforts by the UK Government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground,” a Downing Street spokesman said.
“The Prime Minister reiterated that the UK Government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found.”
However, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has warned the UK Government against taking unilateral action on the protocol.
‘This is a democracy’
Varadkar told RTÉ: “We can’t have any unilateral action from the UK. This is an international agreement, they have to honour their obligations. I was in the Wirral with Boris Johnson. I know what he agreed to.
“The British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State need to be wise to that, if they’re not already.”
A Government spokesman said the Taoiseach had urged Johnson “to engage in intensified EU-UK discussions to address issues relating to the implementation of the Protocol”.

Spoke to Prime Minister@BorisJohnsonthis morning.We both agreed on the need to see the NI Executive formed as soon as possible.On the Protocol, I stressed need to intensify EU and UK discussions, and to avoid any unilateral action.
“The Taoiseach pointed out that the EU has engaged constructively in the Protocol discussions, addressing the issue of medicines, and last October putting forward a substantial package of flexibilities and mitigations, including on customs and SPS arrangements.
“The Taoiseach stressed to the Prime Minister that the way forward should be through continued engagement with a view to arriving at agreed EU-UK solutions that address the practical issues arising around implementation of the Protocol.”
In a statement yesterday afternoon, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said renegotiation of the Protocol was “not an option”, and that unilateral action by the UK would make work on possible solutions “more difficult”.
“The EU has been open to joint work with the UK on implementing the Protocol to bring long-term legal certainty and predictability to the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,” he said.
“The EU remains open to such discussions. Only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action by the UK would only make our work on possible solutions more difficult.
“The Protocol, as a cornerstone of the Withdrawal Agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.”
UK Justice Minister Victoria Atkins refused to be drawn on whether taking action on the protocol would spark a trade war with the bloc, but told Newsnight last night that looking after the people of Northern Ireland remains the Government’s “absolute priority”.
“We really want to find a negotiated settlement with the EU on this, and we hope that with flexibility we’ll be able to achieve that,” she said.
“But our absolute priority are our friends, our neighbours, our relatives in Northern Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-stormont-meetings-5987103-Feb2023/,"THE PEOPLE OF Northern Ireland deserve a government, according to Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin.
He described meetings with the five main Stormont parties in Belfast today as “constructive” stating that he was anxious to see the power sharing institutions restored as soon as possible.
“In a democracy, when people elect their public representatives they expect them to take their seats both in the Assembly and in government,” he said.
Speaking about the negotiations that are underway between the EU and UK, he said he believed the issues can be resolved.
He said told parties today that there is “a significant degree of confidentiality surrounding those negotiations and discussions”.
“I am in agreement with the need to provide space to both the negotiating teams to see if they can bring about a resolution of the issues around trade.
“I reiterated our very strong view that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland is not impacted, and has to be underpinned in terms of the principle of consent, and that is something we strongly assert, that there can be no undermining of the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as per the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent,” he said.
Martin acknowledged there are a lot of challenges, stating that he did not wish to understate the difficulties that both sides will face in trying to resolve the issues.
“I think the sensible thing to do is allow the EU and the UK to continue with the negotiations,” he said.
While the talks are ongoing, parties should focus on the imperative of getting the Executive and the Assembly restored, he added.
“I think Europe is very aware and sensitive of the points of view and concerns that the unionist community have put forward in respect of the protocol issue, and having that seamless trade within the UK single market,” he said.
“These are issues that have been advanced strongly by the unionist parties, both the DUP and the UUP, and other parties are clear that if issues of that nature can be resolved, they’re happy enough to see them resolved.

“I do genuinely believe that the European Union is very anxious to deal with those concerns that unionism has.”
Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie described the meeting with Martin as “very frank and very open”.
“We talked about the protocol, it is becoming incredibly frustrating, we are not being kept in the loop as to what is happening in regards to the negotiations between the EU and the UK, and if we’re not involved, if they try to bounce unionism, it’s simply not going to work,” he said.
“We need to know what is going on and therefore we can add value by raising red flags where we see there are problems and giving solutions, and the Ulster Unionist Party have always been about giving solutions.
“But we cannot be bounced on a deal which is simply not going to work in the long term,” he said.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the secrecy around the EU-UK talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol was “probably a good thing”.
He called on DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson not to be “spooked by anybody within loyalism” and to return to Stormont if there is “significant” enough change to the protocol.
“The discussions are being kept very tight, at a very senior level in the British government on the European Commission, and that’s probably a good thing,” he told reporters in Belfast.
“They’re in the tunnel,” Eastwood said, referring to the intense, tail-end stage that negotiations can enter.
“It’s very tight and they’re keeping it very tight. There’s obviously a lot of issues to talk about.
Separately, on the issue of the UK sharing documentation in relation to past atrocities, Martin said very recently the Irish Government has put that case to the British Government in respect of the Dublin Monaghan bombing.
“We want access to all documentation in respect of the Dublin Monaghan bombing. We’re not satisfied with the level of cooperation that was offered in the past in respect of that, and indeed others like Belturbet as well,” he said.
He said this all points to why the legacy bill that is making its way through the House of Lords in Westminster “should be withdrawn, in our view”, stating that “a pause button” should be pressed so that all parties and victims groups can get back into discussions. He said this is the most effective way to deal with the legacy issues of the past.

https://www.thejournal.ie/truss-sefcovic-constructive-talks-northern-ireland-brexit-5663407-Jan2022/,"LAST UPDATE|24 Jan 2022
THE DUP LEADER has warned the UK Government he is not prepared to be “strung out for weeks” waiting for an assurance that it will act over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK Government needs to make clear it will move to suspend parts of the protocol – by triggering its Article 16 mechanism – if a negotiated deal with the EU is not reached.
His comments in Crumlin, Co Antrim, came after the latest round of talks between Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic on issues with the contentious post-Brexit Irish Sea trading arrangement.
Truss and Sefcovic described the discussions in Brussels as “constructive” and said engagement on resolving outstanding issues would continue.
Commenting on the state of the talks, Donaldson said: “I made clear at the beginning of this new year that January was going to be a very important month and I need to hear from Liz Truss and from the Prime Minister if these talks are not going to come to a conclusion in the very near future, and if they’re not going to reach agreement then what action, what decisive action, is the Government prepared to take in line with their command paper published over six months ago to protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market?
“That is a UK Government commitment. It was part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement (2020). It hasn’t been delivered, it needs to be delivered.”
Donaldson suggested his party would follow through with its threat to withdraw ministers from Stormont if progress is not made.
“I think this has to come to a head,” he said.
“We need to know where the Government are going on this. The EU are now indicating that the talks will conclude mid-February, so I need to know from the Government (that) if we’re not going to get agreement with the EU, and it seems unlikely based on what we’re hearing, then what decisive action are the Government prepared to take?
“And I need to know that now – I’m not prepared to be strung out for weeks on end with nothing and no assurance that the Government is going to act.
“I need to know from the Government are they going to act or are they not going to act?
“If they’re not going to act, then be honest and tell us, and we will have to take the action that we need to take to bring this matter towards a solution.”

Sinn Féin deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said the issues related to the protocol were a direct consequence of the “hard Brexit” advocated by the DUP.
“The implications of Brexit are being felt right across our community,” she told Assembly question time at Stormont.
“The implications in terms of the protocol – we wouldn’t have a protocol if we didn’t have Brexit and the protocol provides a solution.
“So I still maintain the position of rigorous implementation within the framework of the protocol because, despite the utterances of the DUP, the protocol isn’t up for negotiation.
“And as we speak here today there are talks ongoing between the EU side and the British government and I hope, I really hope that there’s momentum built upon.
“What we want to find is a way forward that allows, within the framework of the protocol, all these issues to be ironed out.
“I believe in east west trade. I want that to continue. I have said I want to see access to both markets (EU and UK) – there’s huge potential here, but the DUP are so blindsided (they) cannot see it.”
Later in the chamber there were robust exchanges involving DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons and pro-Remain MLAs amid diverging claims about the economic impact of the protocol.
Lyons told MLAs: “When grace periods and mitigations come to an end things are likely to get much worse.
“It’s clear that during 2021 many local businesses and indeed consumers experienced a range of issues as a result of new requirements for sourcing goods in Great Britain and I have spoken personally to many of those businesses.”
Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald accused Lyons of “cherry picking” facts and figures on the protocol.
“A recent Manufacturing NI survey showed the biggest issue facing businesses is the shortage of labour, the protocol is down their list of priorities,” she said.
“Two thirds of businesses do want the protocol to be made to work and 40% want the Executive to maximise the opportunities.
“So does the Minister accept that, just like with Brexit, he and his party are out of step with the majority of businesses here on the protocol?”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-british-government-act-unilaterally-eu-uk-meeting-5364484-Feb2021/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has been urged by the DUP to “act unilaterally” over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Speaking after a meeting of the UK-EU committee for implementing the mechanism, Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster said the British government must “step up and protect the internal market”.
In a joint statement after the virtual meeting today, co-chairmen Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and European Commission vice president Maroš Šefčovič  said both sides committed to the “proper implementation” of the Protocol.
Both the UK and the EU have admitted that the checks associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol have not gone as smoothly as expected.
The UK Government recently made a request to the European Commission for an extension of grace periods concerning trade between Great Britain to Northern Ireland until January 2023.

This would include a grace period for health certificates for major supermarkets, and an extension on waiving the ban on chilled and processed meats.

“The parties acknowledged the importance of joint action to make the Protocol work for the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland.
“In that spirit, the EU and UK reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and to the proper implementation of the protocol,” they said.
“The UK and the EU underlined their shared commitment to giving effect to those solutions agreed through the Joint Committee on 17 December 2020, without delay.
A further meeting of the joint committee is set to take place to “provide further steers and where appropriate approvals”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-negotiator-brexit-protocol-5803585-Jun2022/,"MAROS SEFCOVIC HAS said it is “high time we got Brexit done” during a speech in London in which he warned that plans to rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol would prove unworkable.
The European Commission vice-president, in London for the first time in several months, urged the UK Government to return to the negotiating table as he cautioned that the proposed legislation had set back UK-EU progress on the Northern Ireland Protocol by two years.
MPs voted this week to give the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill a second reading, clearing the way for it to undergo detailed scrutiny in the coming weeks.
The move has been branded as illegal and a clear breach of international law.
Sefcovic dedicated a significant proportion of a speech at a Bloomberg event to criticising the plan.
He predicted that, if it becomes law, the Bill would “lead to constant uncertainty”.
“Put simply: it would not work,” he told the event.
“Ministers in London would have the freedom to change the rules on a whim. A dual regulatory regime, where businesses opt for EU or UK regulations, would bury them under a mountain of bureaucracy.
“This would clearly be a lose-lose situation – for EU-UK relations and, first and foremost, for Northern Ireland.”
Legal action has already been taken by the EU over the planned legislation and Sefcovic was adamant that it would not form a basis for negotiation.
“We have to understand each other well that we are not going to negotiate on the basis of this Bill,” he said, branding it “illegal” and “unilateral”.
Sefcovic opened his speech by referencing a speech by then-prime minister David Cameron at Bloomberg in 2013, which some see as having kickstarted the path to the 2016 Brexit referendum.
“I hope we are close to reaching the end of this particular cycle.

“You may not hear this often from a European Commissioner, but it is high time we got Brexit done,” he said.
But Sefcovic was tight-lipped about what form further EU retaliation might take if and when the Bill becomes law.
While UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signalled that he hopes to see the Bill in law before the end of the year, it is expected to face considerable opposition in the House of Lords.
The EU negotiator, who last met Foreign Secretary Liz Truss face-to-face in February, declined to be drawn at length about the possibility of a hard border on the island of Ireland, if no solution can be found to the row.
Part of the motivation behind the Northern Ireland Protocol was to avoid such a scenario, but the alternative of checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has angered unionists, who claim their position in the UK is threatened.
Asked directly if he could rule out a border on the island of Ireland, Sefcovic said: “We will do everything possible, of course, to avoid it because it was first and foremost the driving interests and driving objectives in all these negotiations.
“That’s why we for the first time, and I’m pretty sure the last time in our history, have been ready to outsource the control of our external economic border to the UK Government.”
Ultimately, he said that it was about creating a relationship of “trust” between the UK and the EU, as he stressed the willingness of the bloc to compromise.
“Zero checks is not an option. Checking everything is not practical. But making some minimal checks, yes, that’ll work,” he said.
“Because post-Brexit, the pre-Brexit reality is no longer an option.
“And it is worth underlining that it is not for London to unilaterally change the game and decide what enters the EU’s Single Market.
“Such an approach amounts to a clear violation of international law.”
Sefcovic used the spectre of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to stress that the EU and the UK are “natural allies”.
“Together with other partners, we have shown in our response to Moscow’s aggression that we will continue to stand side by side in the name of peaceful democracy,” he said.

The 1998 deal, which largely brought an end to the Troubles, also enshrined cooperation with the Republic.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said said the UK cannot be trusted over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which ensures trade across the border remains open and free-flowing.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: “President Biden has been unequivocal about his support for the Good Friday Agreement.
“It has been the bedrock of peace, stability and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland.”
The UK has unilaterally extended some grace periods of light-touch regulation on goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland following lobbying by businesses.
Psaki added: “We also welcome cooperation between our British and Irish partners on the Northern Irish protocol and the recent strong statements on these governments’ full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.”

Before his election, the US president said the Agreement cannot become a casualty of Brexit. The UK is seeking a bilateral trade deal with the US.
The US has agreed to suspend millions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on UK exports as part of an effort to resolve a transatlantic trade dispute over aerospace subsidies.
Washington will temporarily suspend tariffs on a range of goods, cutting the 25% tariff rate on Scotch whisky to zero per cent for four months, according to the UK’s Department for International Trade.
Following a conversation last month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to reassure Biden – who is fiercely proud of his Irish roots – that he remained firmly committed to the peace process.
Johnson said then: “This is fundamental for us, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the peace agreement, the Good Friday process, the Belfast Agreement, these agreements are absolutely crucial.”
Pressed on his support for the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal agreement following the recent row with the EU over vaccines, he replied: “We want to make sure that there’s free movement, north-south, free movement east-west, and we guarantee the rights of the people of Northern Ireland, of course.”
President Biden’s ancestral homes on the west and east coast of Ireland have celebrated his inauguration with champagne and cake while waving Irish and American flags.
The US president’s proud links to Ireland are well known and often spoken about by the Democrat.
He is seen by many as the most Irish American president to date, with his heritage tracing back to Ballina in Co Mayo and the Cooley Peninsula in Co Louth.

https://www.thejournal.ie/farming-agriculture-northern-ireland-protocol-5871455-Sep2022/,"BREXIT AND THE tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol must not be let become a “huge headache” for the farming sector, Minister Simon Coveney has said.
The uncertainty of the future of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which means goods moving between the UK and Northern Ireland are checked at ports and can then move freely between the North and Republic, is among issues that farmers have discussed today at the National Ploughing Championships.
More than 90,000 people attended the first day of the event today, which has returned to Co Laois in full for the first time since before the pandemic.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the Championships this afternoon, Coveney described the “huge disruption around Brexit and the decision by our closest neighbours to leave the European Union”.
“We had the pandemic, which was tragic and really difficult to deal with, and now we have war on the continent of Europe… through each of these crises agriculture has got stronger,” the minister said.
He said that “agriculture has more than survived the pressures of Brexit so far, maintaining a strong market share in the UK”, but that “we have work to do to make sure that the aftermath of Brexit doesn’t become a huge headache and problem for the agri-food sector in the years ahead”.

“What I mean by that is we cannot allow Northern Ireland, in the context of the protections of the Northern Ireland Protocol, to become vulnerable again by the collapse of that Protocol.”
Under the terms of the Protocol, which were devised between the UK and EU as part of their Brexit deal, goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are inspected at Northern Ireland ports and can then be moved around the island, rather than being checked between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
Before the summer, the UK parliament was pushing through a piece of legislation, led by now-Prime Minister Liz Truss, that would override parts of the Protocol to scrap customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.
Coveney said today that it “may seem like a sort of an abstract political issue that’s out there and doesn’t impact on farm businesses – trust me, it does”.
“These are the kinds of political things that the government needs to deliver far agriculture and the agri food sector,” the minister said.
Speaking toThe Journal, Labour leader TD Ivana Bacik said the “main thing is to bring the UK and EU together around the negotiation table in good faith”.
“Unilateral actions like the British action in bringing forward legislation to amend the protocol, that was really unhelpful,” Bacik said.
“But we need to see good faith negotiation from the British,” Bacik said.

Similarly, EU Commissioner Mairead McGuiness said there is “an opportunity now that the UK are coming out of their period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth the Second” and following the election of the new British prime minister.
Speaking to Newstalk FM at the Championships, McGuiness said: “I think the British prime minister and ourselves as the European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, we’re on the same side.”
“We’re focusing on energy, on inflation, on interest rates. We’re working together against Russia, we’ve put sanctions in place. We need to resolve the Protocol issue,” she said.
“I think now maybe an opportune moment where given all of this change and all of the challenges we might find that space politically to solve the problems.
“When I’m here today, I’m hearing voices from north, south, east and west And I suppose for agriculture in particular, agriculture is an all-Ireland activity,” McGuiness said.
“The farmers in Northern Ireland are very happy to have access to the European single market, even though the United Kingdom has voted to leave. We have to find a way to deal with those issues that are causing problems in some communities.
“I do think where there’s a will, there is a way.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-deal-dup-analysis-5997854-Feb2023/,"AFTER MONTHS OF backdoor negotiations, a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol appears to be in sight.
Last minute trips by the UK Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to Belfast and Brussels respectively seem to indicate that a deal between the UK and EU appears to be inching closer to completion.
Yesterday, Rishi Sunak landed in Belfast and held late night meetings with political leaders in Northern Ireland, with the DUP acknowledging that progress was being made.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told reporters this afternoon that “progress has been made across a range of issues” but that there are ”still some areas where further work is required” to get a deal across the line.
“The decisions that will be taken by the Prime Minister and by the European Commission will either consign Northern Ireland to more division or they will clear a path towards healing and towards the restoration of the political institutions,” Donaldson said.
He said that the DUP had not yet seen the text of any potential agreement and that more negotiations were due to take place.
Just before Donaldson spoke, EU Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly held talks which have been described as “constructive”.

In a tweet, Sefcovic said that the joint aim of the EU and UK Government was “responding to the everyday concerns of people in NI”.
Speculation is continuing that a deal may be complete between the EU and UK as early as next week.
However, the main question is whether or not the DUP will back the deal or continue to block and prevent the restoration of the Stormont Executive and Assembly.
Currently, the party is vetoing the establishment of the Assembly over its concerns about the Protocol, particularly over the border in the Irish Sea.
The party contests that this is separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and breaks down the existing union.
To get the DUP to back a deal, the party says that it needs to meet its “seven tests”, which include removing trade barriers between the UK and Northern Ireland alongside preventing a border in the Irish Sea.
Whether or not the deal will meet these key tests is yet to be seen, and even if it does, the issue of reforming the Executive remains an issue.
With Sinn Féin being the largest party, Michelle O’Neill is entitled to take up the role of First Minister, while the DUP will receive the Deputy First Minister role.
While the positions are equal and one cannot be in place without the other, the symbolism of a nationalist First Minister may still be too much for the DUP.
Commentator and former Ulster Unionist Party communications director, Alex Kane, told RTÉ Radio One that the immediate challenge will be for Sunak to sell a prospective deal to the House of Commons.
Related ReadsTaoiseach 'quietly confident' of Protocol deal 'within a week or two' as Sunak meets NI leadersUK Supreme Court challenge on lawfulness of Northern Ireland protocol is dismissed
However, Sunak does have the backing of the Labour Party, with Keir Starmer previously confirming that he would provide the votes to get any deal through the House of Commons.
The Labour leader said that he was willing to provide “political cover” to Sunak and encouraged him to stand up to the European Research Group (ERG),which he referred to as a “Brexit purity cult”.
Kane believes that hardline Tory MPs within the ERG are likely to be even more hardline, due to guilt over their support of the Northern Ireland Protocol three years ago.
“There are still members of the ERG – the hardest of the hard Brexiteers – some of whom voted for the Protocol three years ago and who are feeling a terrible pang of guilt about this, feel that somehow they have to be even more hardline that they were before,” Kane said.
But, Kane added that he believed Sunak was at a point where getting the deal through the House of Commons would not be an issue and this is where problems for the DUP lie.
“If that is the case, that becomes the big problem for the DUP because then it’s the DUP vs the United Kingdom Government of a sovereign parliament and that is their nightmare.”
While there does appear to be some light at the end of the Northern Ireland Protocol tunnel, we are not quite out the gap yet.

Rival KFC also warned recently that supply chain issues meant it was unable to stock some menu items.
Firms across a raft of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers following post-Brexit EU immigration rules, Covid-19 restrictions and self-isolation rules.
The supply pressures have also been affecting supermarkets in recent weeks, while manufacturers have reported sharp increases in the prices of raw materials.
Business groups representing the retail and transport sectors have been calling for the British government to review plans not to grant temporary work visas to drivers from the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-eu-5597366-Nov2021/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Nov 2021
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has called on the UK government to “double down on dialogue” over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Martin said it should not be assumed that the British will trigger Article 16 amid heavy speculation that the UK government is preparing to suspend the agreement.
The Taoiseach called for extensive engagement on both sides to avoid the situation coming to pass.
“Discussions are still ongoing. I would just sound a note of caution that we don’t automatically assume that anything is going to be triggered,” he told the Dáil
“I think that’s important. We don’t want a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy either.
Martin said the European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic had put forward a robust set of proposals to tackle operational issues around the protocol.
But he said a demand by UK Brexit Minister David Frost that the oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the operation of the protocol be dropped, in advance of those proposals being made, was an attempt to “torpedo” the package.
“I think it’s very regrettable that in advance of the publication of the Sefcovic package, that Lord Frost announced the issue around the ECJ,” he said.
Martin was speaking after Frost had earlier said that the EU should “stay calm” and that the triggering of Article 16 is “not inevitable”.
The Brexit Minister Frost was speaking in the House of Lords with some suggestions that he was preparing to signal a suspension of the post-Brexit arrangements drawn up with the EU.
Such a move would likely to spark retaliation from the EU, with talk of a suspension of the EU-UK trade deal that could result in a trade war.

Instead, Frost said that the “talks process” between the UK and EU “had not reached its end”.
“Although we have been talking nearly four weeks now, there remain possibilities that the talks have not yet seriously examined, including many approaches suggested by the UK,” he said.
He added: “I can reassure the House that if Article 16 were to be used, we would of course set out our case with confidence and explain that case to any interested party.”
Yesterday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkarsaid there would be “no option” for the EUto respond to the UK triggering of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Today, he warned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the  UK will not get a better deal if it triggers Article 16.
“We have an agreement in relation to Northern Ireland, we have an agreement in relation to trade with the European Union. Don’t jeopardise that agreement,” he said.
12 months of uncertainty
A suspension of the EU-UK trade deal would require a year’s notice and would spark further uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland, the Republic and the UK throughout 2022.
Rejecting the argument from Brussels that triggering Article 16 would be an aggressive act, Frost said said it would be “entirely reasonable”.
“They seem to be claiming that it would be entirely unreasonable for the British Government, uniquely, to use these wholly legitimate safeguard provisions within the Treaty, designed precisely to deal with situations like the current one,” he said.
“They also suggest that we can only take this action at the price of massive and disproportionate retaliation .”
He added:
“We are hardly likely to proceed in a way that puts all that at risk.

“If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is, of course, a matter for them.
“At that point we would be entitled to come to our own judgment about how much value we could attach to their commitment to supporting the peace process and the people of Northern Ireland as against protecting their own interests.”
The UK government minister told fellow peers in the House of Lords: “I do repeat that in our view Article 16 is not inevitable.”
Oireachtas committee
Frost was speaking after other members of the House of Lords earlier told an Oireachtas committee that a no-deal Brexit will be back on the table if the UK proceeds with triggering Article 16.
Michael Jay, chairman of the House of Lords sub-Committee on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, said a triggering of Article 16 risks resetting negotiations and could result in a no-deal Brexit.
He said: “I agree with you very much on what to say about the risks of Article 16 being imposed or being triggered and the response to Article 16 by the European Union, potentially leading to all the complicated negotiations with the prospect of a no-deal as the last stage. That is one end of the spectrum.
“The other end of the spectrum, which I think we can’t rule it out, and I certainly wouldn’t want to rule out, although I must say that the prospects are not looking brilliant at the moment, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached between now and Christmas or over Christmas.
Peter Hain, a former secretary of state for Northern Ireland, told the committee that a move to trigger Article 16 by the UK Government would be “aggressive and bombastic”.
He said: “If Lord Frost does announce the triggering of Article 16, that is a very aggressive and bombastic move by the British Government, that I … fear has been coming for a while.
“We’re going to need to work together with you parliamentarians across the Irish Sea to try and cope with the fallout because I think it’ll be significant.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/constructive-euroscepticism-ireland-5798675-Jun2022/,"SIX YEARS AGO, EU policymakers worried that Brexit could spark a domino effect across the continent. Britain’s vote was expected to embolden anti-Brussels parties and strengthen demands for referendums on the EU in other member states. The far-right French leader Marine Le Pen went as far as to declare it the beginning of the end for the bloc – an occasion as momentous as the fall of the Berlin Wall,in her view.
Now the picture looks quite different. The predicted widespread revolt against the European project hasn’t come to pass, and even some of the once most ardent Eurosceptics have toned down their rhetoric. More common today is a softer sort of Euroscepticism – or “constructive” Euroscepticism, as it’s been called – which involves opposition to aspects of European integration, but not wholesale rejection of EU membership.
EU advocates themselves will admit that the system is far from perfect. Noelle O’Connell, CEO of European Movement Ireland, argues that the EU is best served by having people debate and engage in its work. However, she says this needs to come from a place of “genuine constructive criticism” if issues are to be solved.
The ‘democratic deficit’ argument
She is encouraged at least by EU plans to establish an online‘Have Your Say’ portalas a one-stop-shop for voters to provide input on EU policy, and for the EU to directly consult citizens.
“It’s an important step for the EU when arguments around ‘democratic deficit’ still ring loud,” she says.
Barry Colfer, director of research at the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), likewise thinks critical views play an important role. “We should be very wary of nasty or exclusionary politics, but having a Eurocritical or Eurosceptic discussion is a healthy part of democracy.
But Colfer tellsThe Journalthat the power of Eurosceptic parties shouldn’t be overstated. “If you look at the places in Europe where Eurosceptics have served in power, you can count them on one hand. It’s the centre – Chancellor Schultz in Germany, President Macron in France, Prime Minister Draghi in Italy – that holds the reins of political power. Yes, their bases have been eroded, and some of their programmes have been affected by Eurosceptic rhetoric, but every government in the EU is still led by a party that comes from the centre right or centre left.”

The UK experience
Many anti-EU figures have also shifted their strategy in the wake of Brexit. “The experience of the UK’s withdrawal has certainly softened the cough of Eurosceptic voices,” says Colfer. “The fact that it was so difficult for the UK, with its excellent civil service and robust institutions… I think that called their bluff.”

The new strategy of focusing on reform, he says, is “at least partly to do with how traumatic and unedifying” Britain’s departure has proven.
Paul Schmidt, co-editor of the recent bookEuroscepticism and the Future of Europe, agrees that the fallout from Brexit has made EU departure seem much less attractive. He argues that the EU’s response to the pandemic – from the joint purchasing of vaccines to its €800 billion recovery fund – has also strengthened its legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
“The lesson for extreme right-wing populist parties is that if they want to be successful, they need to moderate their stance and not talk so much about leaving the EU, because that is something the broad majority of the public would reject.”
A soft veil on anti-EU sentiment?
But Schmidt, who is general secretary of the Austrian Society for European Politics, warns that talk of reform can sometimes disguise deeper anti-EU sentiment.
“If you use softer rhetoric with the goal of building up a new strategy to destroy the EU from within, then I wouldn’t call that soft Euroscepticism. Many extreme right-wing populist parties have been smart enough to move into the centre of the political arena by softening their EU stance, when really this is just another way of being anti-EU.”
In this country at least, Eurosceptic forces are still very much on the margins of political life. ARed C / European Movement Ireland pollpublished last month showed that 88% of people support our continued membership of the EU. Ireland’s size means that the EU is seen as providing an anchor in turbulent times, according to O’Connell.
Colfer says the EU has also been seen as a place where Irish sovereignty is protected. The common narrative in the UK during the Brexit campaign, by contrast, was that the EU undermined British independence. “We have a different attitude to politics here as a former colony,” he says.
“I think there’s a sense that the EU has been a place for Irish sovereignty and the Irish language, and a place where figures like John Hume have been put on stage.”

Where misinformation creeps in
However, O’Connell cautions that strong Irish support for the EU shouldn’t be taken for granted.

“One of the benefits of the Brexit negotiations is that it facilitated a prolonged engagement with people of the benefits of being in the EU. But the EU is not just Brexit, and as Brexit no longer dominates our newsfeeds like it once did, there is a challenge here in how to successfully engage people in Ireland on what else the EU does.
“This is where misinformation or disinformation could slip into the debate around what the EU does and how it will impact Ireland.”
Schmidt is conscious that Europe’s current challenges could also increase animosity towards the EU. “We have many of the ingredients of a perfect storm if you take the price of energy, inflation and so on,” he tellsThe Journal.
“We know that these are the conditions that can lead to a return of extremist populist parties, so the question now is how quickly and effectively we can tackle these problems. There have been enormous steps of integration in military terms, and in terms of the economy, health and climate issue, but that’s only one side of the story.”
The risk of it all collapsing might be small, but EU advocates still worry about the future. “I think these are decisive times,” says Schmidt. “The longer the war [in Ukraine] lasts, the more challenging European cohesion and solidarity will be – and if we lose those things, we give much more room to nationalistic voices.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/solution-northern-ireland-protocol-needed-assembly-mairead-mcguinness-5651021-Jan2022/,"EU COMMISSIONER MAIREAD McGuinness has said the UK and Brussels must find a solution to the row over the Northern Ireland Protocol before the Assembly elections later this year.
McGuinness, Ireland’s representative in the European Commission, said today that she hopes the appointment of Liz Truss to the role of Brexit negotiator will bring some “pragmatism to the situation”.
The Foreign Secretary has taken charge of the UK negotiations on the protocol after David Frost’s resignation from the Government last month.
She is set to hold face-to-face talks with her EU counterpart – European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic – later this week.
Truss has already said she will not sign up to any arrangement that involved checks on goods moving within the UK.
Checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland are central to the operation of the protocol in its current form.
The Cabinet minister also reiterated the Government threat to suspend elements of the protocol – by triggering its Article 16 mechanism – if a negotiated settlement with the EU proves elusive.

McGuinness, speaking on RTÉ radio this morning, said she has seen the Foreign Secretary’s comments.
She said: “They probably reflect the current view, if you like, as was held by her predecessor, but, on the other hand, I’m hoping that Liz Truss will also bring some pragmatism to the situation.”
The senior EU official said Northern Ireland needs a solution to the protocol impasse “before we get into campaign mode for the assembly elections”.
Those elections are scheduled to take place in May.
McGuinness said it is important to give the UK and EU negotiators “time” and added that she hopes 2022 can bring a “fresh start” to talks.
Yesterday, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said, following a meeting with Truss, that the UK Government needs to provide a timetable for when changes will be made to the protocol.
Sinn Féin also held separate talks with the Foreign Secretary, after which Stormont deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said ongoing talk about triggering Article 16 is “reckless”.
Donaldson has indicated that a “pause” on the DUP’s threat to collapse the powersharing institutions at Stormont over the protocol will remain pending the outcome of renewed negotiations between the UK and EU over the Irish Sea trading barriers.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-bill-debate-5800673-Jun2022/,"LAST UPDATE|27 Jun 2022
BORIS JOHNSON’S BID to effectively tear up parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol has cleared its first Commons hurdle amid warnings from some Tories that the plans are illegal.
MPs voted 295 to 221, majority 74, to give the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill a second reading, which clears the way for it to undergo detailed scrutiny in the coming weeks.
Johnson claimed the proposed legislation, which gives ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, could be carried out “fairly rapidly”, with the proposals in law by the end of the year.
But his predecessor in No 10, Theresa May, led the criticism from the Tory benches as she delivered a withering assessment of the legality and impact of the Bill.
May made clear she would not support the legislation and warned it will “diminish” the UK’s global standing.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, presenting the bill, called it “legal and necessary”.
The second reading of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which would see customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain effectively scrapped, took place in the House of Commons this afternoon into the evening.
The Bill would also give UK government ministers the power to change almost every aspect of the text.
Truss pointed to the absence of a functioning government in Northern Ireland and said it was the duty of the UK government’s to “act now”.
The DUP has blocked attempts to move forward on forming a new Executive since Northern Ireland’s recent elections, citing its discontent with the Protocol.
Truss said the UK would “continue to seek a negotiated solution with the EU” as the Bill progresses.
“There is a solution to be achieved. We have laid it out very clearly with our proposal, but we do need the EU to agree to change the text of the protocol,” she said.
“That is the fundamental issue that needs to be addressed.”
Truss said the UK government was acting in the interests of people in Northern Ireland.
“Once this legislation is enacted, we can draw a line under this issue and unleash the full potential of our relationship with the EU.”
Significant time was set aside for the debate this afternoon and into this evening,

Speaking to reporters earlier this afternoon, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that the breaking of an international agreement should not be trivialised and that the UK Government were continuing to move towards unilateralism.
“One cannot trivialise the breaching of an international agreement between the United Kingdom government and the European Union,” said Martin.
“My concern is a trend towards unilateralism that’s emanating from the UK Government.
“We have it now on the Protocol. We’ve had it on legacy issues.
“This is not a good move by the British Government and it has to accept that unilateralism does not work in the context of the Good Friday Agreement or indeed in the context of good relationships with your neighbors and with the European Union.”
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney added said he is “hugely disappointed” that the British government is continuing to pursue its “unlawful unilateral approach on the Protocol on Northern Ireland”.
“This is not the way to find sustainable solutions to the genuine concerns of people and business in NI and only adds to uncertainty,” he said in a statement.
“I continue to urge the British government to return to constructive dialogue with the EU in pursuit of jointly agreed, long-lasting solutions.”

Commons debate
MPs in the House of Commons held a long and firy debate on their positions on the Protocol Bill.
Speaking in the Commons, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the Protocol Bill was seeking to “finally and fundamentally reset and restore Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom, given the devastating impact of the protocol on the economic, constitutional, social and political life of Northern Ireland over the last 18 months”.
The MP for Lagan Valley said MLAs in Northern Ireland were presiding over regulations “over which they have no say”.
SDLP MP Claire Hanna called for a “negotiated solution” with the EU as she told MPs “we have solved bigger problems than these before”.
The MP for Belfast South insisted “there’s no doubt that the protocol can be smooth” and “the operation can be improved”, adding: “Everybody says that.
“Nobody, as I’ve said before, in Northern Ireland loves the protocol, but we know that the better options were voted down, but like everything that’s worth doing in Northern Ireland that will be achieved through partnership, through compromises, and not through unmeetable red lines that would remove the people of Northern Ireland from the single market, which is something that has no support,” Hanna said.
“But instead of doing the hard work and levelling with the people of Northern Ireland, this Government, to whom the DUP have shackled themselves, are choosing to distort and deflect.”
Conservative MP William Cash said the Bill is “necessary” to protect the union and Good Friday Agreement, and he criticised the European Union of “intransigence”.

Fellow Conservative and former minister Bob Neill told the Commons he would abstain from the vote “”to see how the Bill develops because I think it could be amended into a workable form, but it comes with very many caveats and a lot of questions I think the ministers need to answer”.
Alliance MP Stephen Farry called it an “an extremely bad Bill, it’s unwanted, unnecessary and, indeed, it’s dangerous”
Conservative former Northern Ireland minister Andrew Murrison has said he will support the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, but said he is “somewhat bewildered” by the refusal to consider triggering Article 16.
“That is already available to them and nobody has marshalled credible argument, that satisfies me certainly, that it could not be done, should not be done. The grounds for triggering Article 16 are clearly there, in that we don’t have anything approaching proper covenants in Northern Ireland, not at all,” Murrison said.
EU response
The European Union has strongly condemned the plan to unilaterally scrap parts of the Brexit deal and has warned that it could take further action against Britain if it enacts the legislation.
The EUlaunched fresh legal actionagainst the UK just days after the Bill was published.
European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said the UK’s move had “no legal or political justification”.
As well as new legal action for alleged failures to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol as it stands, Sefcovic confirmed that existing infringement proceedings which had been paused while UK-EU talks took place would now be resumed.
Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Sefcovic said the UK Government had set out to “unilaterally break international law”.
The plan would mean “breaking an agreement that protects peace and stability in Northern Ireland, an agreement reached together only three years ago”.
“Let there be no doubt: there is no legal nor political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement.
“Opening the door to unilaterally changing an international agreement is a breach of international law as well. So let’s call a spade a spade: this is illegal.”
Asked about potential further action against the UK, he said: “If this draft Bill becomes the law then I cannot exclude anything.
“But we are not there yet and we want to solve this issue as the two partners should, through negotiations, looking for the common ground and delivering for the people of Northern Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-simon-coveney-5786401-Jun2022/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney has warned that the European Union’s position on the Northern Ireland Protocol has “hardened” in the face of the UK threat to unilaterally scrap part of the arrangements.
Speaking on his way into Cabinet, Coveney urged the UK Government to step back from its plan to publish domestic legislation that would override elements of the protocol, which governs trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland post-Brexit.
“Publishing this legislation will cause a lot more problems than it solves, not just between Britain and Ireland but between the UK and the EU more generally,” Coveney told reporters.
“In many ways from my experience, and I’ve been to Finland to Sweden to Estonia to Latvia, and I’ve been speaking to many other EU foreign ministers, in many ways in the last number of weeks the EU position has hardened because I don’t think there’s a single capital across the EU and anybody in the European Commission that believes, at the moment anyway, that the British government is serious about a negotiated solution, because there is no signal coming from London that they are.
“Instead all of the signals are about unilateral action, making demands with no willingness to compromise, and that has hardened the EU response to what they’re seeing coming out of London now.
‘Rot in relationships’
“So, we need to find a way to arrest this rot in relationships and instead to look to compromise, to negotiation, to dialogue, to solve what are genuine issues and concerns,” he said.
Coveney said it appeared that the UK Government was unsure over what to include in its controversial Bill on the Northern Ireland Protocol.

“It seems to us that the British government has been somewhat unsure as to what to put in the legislation because there are different reports coming out of London in terms of what the legislation will look like, what the approach will be,” he said.
“There were attempts, certainly, we think to harden up some of the language in the proposed legislation this week, which now seems to have been reversed again – we simply don’t know.
“We’ll have to wait and see. But, of course, our real message is ‘please don’t go there’.”Mr Coveney said the last thing Ireland and the EU wanted was “tension and unnecessary rancor” in their relationship with the UK at a time when the focus should be on working together on issues such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
‘Historic low point’
Coveney echoed comments made by Taoiseach Micheál Martin earlier this week when he warned that publication of the legislation would mark a “historic low point” in Anglo-Irish relations.
“I just want to reinforce what the Taoiseach said this week when he said that should that legislation be published it really will represent a new low in British-Irish relations since the Good Friday Agreement was signed,” he said.
“My message to the British government is a very clear one, which is that if you are genuinely interested in negotiated solutions to these problems, and there are problems in terms of the protocol and its implementation, well then let’s see some evidence as to a willingness to negotiate seriously those solutions through compromise, through flexibility.
“The European Commission has shown that willingness, and wants to do more in my view, but it needs and wants a partner to do that. The answer here is not unilateral action, passing domestic legislation to set aside international law and to break commitments that were freely entered into in an international treaty.
“The answer here is to act as a partner and a neighbour to work these issues out together to respond to genuine unionist concerns in Northern Ireland, and we do want to respond to those.
“I believe that both the European Commission and certainly the Irish government is up for it – we cannot do it unless the British government can give us a signal that they’re serious about that discussion, that negotiation, to try and find common ground,” said Coveney.

The Government is “confident” that plans to unilaterally override elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol are legal, a minister has said.
The UK’s Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told the Commons that the Government is confident that its actions are lawful under international law and in line with longstanding convention “that we do not set out internal legal deliberations”.
Cleverly was responding to an urgent question about whether the Government had consulted a senior legal adviser, the First Treasury Counsel, on the proposals.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected the claim that the independent barrister on major legal issues had not been asked to give a view on the plans at Prime Minister’s Questions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-labour-party-conservative-government-stormont-6195390-Oct2023/,"THE DUP IS talking to the UK’s Labour Party, but leader Jeffrey Donaldson insists he is focussed on securing a deal with the current Conservative Government to allow his party to return to the Stormont Assembly.
The lead unionist party in Northern Ireland is refusing to participate in the Assembly until its concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements are addressed by the UK Government.
Donaldson said the Northern Ireland Protocol must be replaced with arrangements that “respect and protect” the region’s ability to trade within the UK and its internal market.
Talks have been ongoing between the DUP and the UK Government for months but speculation has heightened in recent weeks that they may be close to concluding.
Ahead of the general election, expected to take place next year, Donaldson confirmed his party has had “a number of conversations” with both Labour leader Keir Starmer and UK shadow secretary of state Hilary Benn.

He described them as “interesting discussions”, adding: “Labour does have a plan in terms of how it will deal with some of the issues that confront us, including on EU regulations and veterinary agreements”.
“If Labour were to proceed on the basis they have spoken of, for the United Kingdom as a whole, that would help to ease many of the difficulties that we have in moving goods, particularly from Great Britain to Northern Ireland,” he told the BBC today.
But he insisted he is working to get an agreement now with the current Government.

“I don’t want to wait another year. If we can get this right now, if we can have measures that respect our economic rights as part of the United Kingdom, that restore our place in the UK internal market, why wouldn’t I take that now?” he said.
He added: “Realistically, if we reach the end of the year, we’re into the trajectory for a general election and I think it is likely in those circumstances Government are going to focus elsewhere. That’s why I’m keen to make every effort that we can to get agreement.
“I don’t know if that’s going to be possible but I will continue working at this to try and get that solution.”

Speaking before his party’s conference this weekend, Donaldson said he will update members on the talks with the British Government.
Asked if they are close to a deal, Donaldson declined to speculate on a timeline, saying: “Nothing is certain when it comes to negotiations of this nature but we have made progress.”
The DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the Stormont executive in February 2022 in protest against the internal UK trade barriers created by Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
Powersharing is unable to function in Northern Ireland without the participation of the largest unionist party.
The UK and EU agreed the framework earlier this year in a bid to address unionist concerns about the protocol, but the DUP has indicated it will not return to the Stormont Assembly until the Government provides further assurances over Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market.
One of the main parts of the framework – the green/red lane system for the movement of goods – became operational at Northern Ireland ports earlier this month.
In an interview with the PA news agency this week, Donaldson said a lot depends on the progress made to close the gaps that remain but he would like to see an outcome within the next few weeks.","10.54am, 13 Oct 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-changes-lewis-5474867-Jun2021/,"LAST UPDATE|23 Jun 2021
THE UK’S NORTHERN Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has said it is reasonable to take the view that changes will be made to the Northern Ireland Protocol as it is “not sustainable” in its current form.
The comments came after outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots said he had received a personal assurance from the UK Government that significant changes will be made to the Protocol.
The UK Government and the European Union are locked in a dispute over the implementation of the Protocol, the part of the Brexit divorce deal aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland.
Appearing before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee today, Lewis was asked what he had told Poots.
He said: “We are very clear that the current position of the Protocol is not sustainable, it is causing issues for businesses and consumers and citizens in Northern Ireland and we need to rectify that.
“We want to get that rectified and we are determined to do so, so I think it is reasonable for anybody to take the view that we have said that there will be changes because there has to be, the current status quo is not sustainable.”
Lewis continued: “At the moment it’s very questionable whether it’s going to be sustainable in its current format and I think that’s why it’s in everybody’s interests to see it rectified.”
However, Lewis has been told by DUP MP Ian Paisley that any changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol must be significant to address “commercial discrimination” against businesses and customers.

Paisley said that any changes needed to be substantive, and could not be “tinkerings”.
He referred to correspondence sent from Stormont Economy Minister Paul Frew to the committee.
He said: “It is saying they have significant concerns about the distinct possibility that firms in GB will become dissuaded from engaging with Northern Ireland markets when faced by regulatory barriers.
“He goes on to say that the UK Internal Markets Act does nothing to protect against commercial discrimination. These are very strong words from the Department of Economy in Northern Ireland that businesses are now facing commercial discrimination.”
Lewis responded: “I think it highlights the points I made around the sustainability of the Protocol in its current format and how it is being implemented.
“We’ve got to get back to that situation where the products that are available in Northern Ireland are the products you’ve always been able to access and they are not unavailable because of anything other than consumer choice.”
Paisley said: “I don’t think it should be lost on anyone as to why there is a requirement for significant changes, and I hope that those changes, which you are tempting us with, and putting in front of us, that they are actually significant and they will not be tinkerings, but they will be changes which address this discrimination aspect.”
Meanwhile, in an interview with BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show, outgoing DUP leader Poots warned that tensions over the Protocol meant the paramilitaries may get involved if violence was to flare again in the summer.
“I fear that if things don’t change over the course of the summertime, that perhaps some older people who are involved in paramilitaries will get involved.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-deny-fishing-fleet-deal-with-french-5588563-Oct2021/,"DOWNING STREET HAS denied Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have reached an agreement to de-escalate their increasingly bitter dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights.
Following a “brush-by” meeting between the two leaders in the margins of the G20 summit in Rome, French officials were reported as saying they had agreed to try to resolve their differences.
However, in a briefing for British journalists, the British Prime Minister’s official spokesman made clear the UK did not recognise the claims that there had been an agreement.
“I have seen the same reporting. It will be for the French to decide if they want to step away from the threats they have made in recent days about breaching the Brexit (trade) agreement,” the spokesman said.
French officials have warned they will bar UK fishing boats from some ports and tighten customs checks on lorries entering the country with British goods from Tuesday unless more licences are granted for their small boats to fish in British waters.
Britain has said the threats represent a breach of the post-Brexit Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) struck between the UK and the EU and warned it could trigger the disputes mechanism under the terms of the deal.
Johnson’s spokesman said: “The Prime Minister reiterated his deep concern over the rhetoric emanating from the French government in recent days, including the suggestion by the French prime minister that the UK should be punished for leaving the EU.
“He expressed his hope that the French government would de-escalate this rhetoric and withdraw their threats.”
There is frustration on the British side that the dispute between the two sides has at times overshadowed the build-up to crucial international climate change talks at the Cop26 summit which begins in Glasgow on Monday.
The row follows claims by the French that dozens of French boats have had their applications to fish in UK and Channel Islands’ waters, claims which the British have strongly contested.

In the run-up to the meeting between the two leaders there was little sign of compromise on either side.
France’s Europe Minister Clement Beaune tweeted that Paris “stands ready to implement proportionate and reversible measures from November 2, as we have announced repeatedly since last April”.
He insisted the measures were “fully in line” with the TCA.
His warning came after the UK’s Brexit minister David Frost said the entire EU would be in breach of the agreement if France carried out its threats.
The Conservative peer, in a series of tweets on Saturday, said the UK was “actively considering” triggering legal proceedings included in the TCA if there was no resolution to the issue.
“These threats, if implemented on 2 November, would put the EU in breach of its obligations under our trade agreement,” he tweeted.
The Government was particularly angered by a letter from French prime minister Jean Castex to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, in which he said the UK should be shown “it causes more damage to leave the EU than to stay in”.
Johnson raised the letter in a meeting with von der Leyen in the margins of the G20 on Saturday.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “The Prime Minister raised his concerns about the rhetoric from the French government in recent days over the issue of fishing licences.
“The Prime Minister stressed that the French threats are completely unjustified and do not appear to be compatible with the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement or wider international law.”
The wrangle over fishing access escalated this week after French authorities detained a Scottish-registered scallop dredger, accusing it of fishing without a licence.
The captain of the Cornelis Gert Jan vessel, understood to be an Irish national, has been told to face a court hearing in August next year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/article-16-explainer-northern-ireland-protocol-5593205-Nov2021/,"ARTICLE 16 HAS screamed back into the headlines this week as the UK threatens to trigger the clause of the Northern Ireland Protocol because it is not happy with how it is being implemented.
The UK’s Brexit Minister David Frost warned today that time is “running out” on talks to restructure the arrangement.
“We’re not going to trigger Article 16 today, but Article 16 is very much on the table,” Frost said.
The move could undermine the withdrawal agreement and potentially pave the way for a trade war.
The Taoiseach used strong language incautioningagainst triggering the clause, saying it would have “far reaching implications” for the UK government’s relationships with Ireland and the EU.
Micheál Martin said it would be “irresponsible, unwise and reckless” and would shake the foundations of the Good Friday Agreement.
The article is a clause in theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is one of the key elements in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement that legally enabled the UK to exit the European Union.
The protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively remains part of the EU’s single market for goods. It allows goods to flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland and removes the threat of a hard border.
Article 16 allows either side to take “safeguard” measures if it concludes that the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade”.
Article 16 itself runs to less than 200 words in length, which is impressively concise considering the terabytes of news articles its existence has generated.
The UK has threatened to trigger the clause several times since it signed the withdrawal agreement. However, the European Commission went further andsignalled its intentionto trigger the article when it was embroiled in a row with AstraZeneca over vaccines.
That proved to be a pretty spectacular misstep and the Commission quickly performed an embarrassing climbdown.
In order to trigger the clause the UK is obliged to prove that the protocol has given rise to “serious economic, societal or environmental” difficulties.

Frost has repeatedly claimed that the conditions to trigger it are met because of the obstruction to trade flow between Britain and Northern Ireland.
Triggering the article kickstarts a formal process that requires both sides to engage in talks to resolve the dispute.
Professor Federico Fabbrini, director of DCU’s Brexit Institute, says using the provision is not the silver bullet many in UK politics seem to believe it is.
Rather, if the UK did pull the cord on the provision it set off would off a lengthy process –detailed in annexe 7 of the protocol – where the two sides carry out consultations with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.
The article also states that any measures taken under the provision must be strictly necessary and proportionate and should achieve their objectives with the least possible damage to the protocol.
“Article 16 in itself doesn’t solve anything,” Professor Fabbrini explained.
“We don’t know exactly what the EU would do if Britain were to trigger Article 16 because it has never been explicit about this.
“I’m totally mindful that politics will trump the law on this matter, but legally speaking, this is not a silver bullet provision. This is not something that allows the UK to achieve much by itself.”
Professor Fabbrini said the UK’s continuing targeting of the Northern Ireland protocol is part of a strategy to attempt to dismantle anything it negotiated in the withdrawal agreement that binds the UK to the EU.
“The protocol is the most obvious and the strongest way in which the European Union continues to influence the United Kingdom after Brexit. So, the strategy here, I think it’s quite explicit,” Fabbrini said.
The European law expert said the UK triggering the provision now would “mostly be a political declaration” that could backfire very quickly.
He said the fact that it is keeping its powder dry while the COP26 climate summit is taking place in Glasgow shows that it is aware of the likely political ramifications of the move.
“The UK is probably aware that there would be outrage across the world and particularly in Washington, DC, if this happened. They don’t want to do this during an international conference they are hosting,” he said.
“The UK doesn’t have a magic wand, whereby it can get rid of the protocol and solve all the problems.
“If the protocol isn’t the way to solve them there has to be another way. And nobody knows what this other way is.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-protocol-businesses-feast-or-famine-economy-5826808-Jul2022/,"THE NORTHERN IRELAND Protocol has created a “feast or famine” economy in the region with some businesses struggling while others thrive,a parliamentary report from the UK has found.
A House of Lords committee examining the post-Brexit Irish Sea trading arrangements found that companies involved in trade with the rest of the UK were being hampered by added red tape whereas those more reliant on doing business with Ireland and the wider EU were benefiting.
The committee stressed an urgent need to resolve the issues created by the protocol and called on the EU and UK to reengage in negotiations.
The committee’s report comes amid a breakdown in relations between London and Brussels over the UK Government’s controversial plan to pass legislation at Westminster that would empower ministers to unilaterally rip up the bulk of the protocol.
Peers said the two sides needed to rebuild trust and repair damaged relationships and recommit to finding an agreed resolution. They said a “mutually agreed solution” was the best outcome as they urged compromise.
The protocol was agreed by the EU and UK in 2019 as a way to avoid a hard land border on the island of Ireland.
It did do so by moving regulatory and customs processes to the Irish Sea, creating new checks on goods being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
While businesses involved in moving GB goods into the region have been hit by added bureaucracy, those Northern Ireland businesses involved in selling into the EU can do so without restriction, giving them a potential advantage over competitors in the rest of the UK.
Lord Jay of Ewelme, who chairs the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland Committee, said: “The committee’s engagement with businesses trading in and with Northern Ireland has demonstrated that, while much uncertainty remains, the economic impact of the protocol is gradually becoming clearer.
“The situation was described to us as ‘feast or famine’, whereby businesses able to take advantage of the protocol benefit, while those dependent on trade with Great Britain lose out.”
‘Disproportionately negative impact’
In preparing its report, the committee took evidence from the five largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the UK and Irish governments, business representatives, academics and civic society representatives.

Peers said the sea border had created increased bureaucracy, resulting in added pressures on companies’ staff resources, increased costs and longer delivery times.
They said the arrangements had a “disproportionately negative impact” on small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
The committee said there remained a concern that businesses in GB will ultimately decided to withdraw from the Northern Ireland market.
Examining those businesses that are benefiting from the protocol, the committee highlighted the dairy and meat processing industries, which are dependent on complex cross-border supply chains on the island of Ireland.
They said those sectors would be damaged if access to the EU single market was lost.
The committee identified several solutions that have been advocated by the business community in Northern Ireland.
Those include a call for “proportionality” in the application of the rules and controls on Irish Sea trade and differential treatment for GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland, in comparison to those destined for onward transportation into the EU.
One of the UK’s preferred resolutions is the creation of a dual regulatory system whereby businesses could choose to either comply with EU product standards or UK rules.
The committee said there was “widespread concern” among business about the practical feasibility and implications for cross-border supply chains of this proposal.
The report is a follow-up to an introductory report published by the committee 12 months ago.
Lord Jay added: “Business representatives have put forward a number of mitigations and solutions to ease the practical impact of the protocol, and many of these proposals remain unchanged since the Committee’s July 2021 introductory report.
“At that time, we stressed the need for dialogue to resolve the issues arising under the protocol in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. It is a matter of deep regret that, in the intervening twelve months, the state of political dialogue in relation to the protocol has deteriorated further.
“There is an urgent need for a reset of dialogue. We therefore call on the UK and the EU, together with the political parties, and stakeholders in Northern Ireland, and the Irish Government, to make a renewed commitment to work together to put Northern Ireland’s interests first, participate together in constructive engagement, rebuild trust and engage in effective relationship-building.
“As one of our witnesses told us, those who negotiated the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement were able to do so because of their ability to appreciate the perspectives of others and willingness to work together and take risks to achieve a common goal despite historic differences. Such a courageous approach is needed now.”","7.35am, 27 Jul 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/not-perfect-brexit-protocol-5580935-Oct2021/,"BUSINESSES IN NORTHERN Ireland have indicated that the Protocol does work for some sectors, but not all – and that recent changes proposed by the EU to improve the Protocol won’t fix all problems with post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
Since the EU published proposals to alter the current Protocol last week, UK junior minister David Frost and European Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič have been discussing the proposals in the hope of coming to an agreement.
If they don’t there is a threat that the UK will trigger Article 16, a nuclear option that will cut all post-Brexit trade ties agreed between the UK and EU, and restart a whole new process of trade negotiations from the start, as well as inflaming political tensions.
The EU and the Irish government have accepted that there are elements of the Protocol that aren’t working, but insist that there are businesses and citizens who benefit from it, and that changes, such as the ones published last week, can be made to improve it.
The UK government has taken the position that the Protocol needs to be scrapped in favour of other arrangements, and have reportedly submitted unpublished proposals to the European Commission.
Businesses in Northern Ireland have indicated that the EU’s proposed changes won’t solve all the trade problems experienced in the past 10 months, with most of the suggestions focused on the retail and food sectors, with manufacturing offered “little crumbs” to fix their issues.
Polls have indicated that there are split opinions among the public and among businesses on the Northern Ireland Protocol, which contains the North’s post-Brexit trading rules.
A Lucid Talk-Queen’s University Belfastpoll in Juneindicated that 43% of think that the Protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think it isn’t.
A study compiled by a Brexit working group in July found that additional staff time, consultancy fees and and other costs were “not inconsiderable”.
According to the study: “One medium-sized NI-owned company put increased staff time resulting from Brexit at around £3,000 per month, plus one-off advisors’ fees at £130,000.”
Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working GroupNorthern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group
One representative of manufacturers in Northern Ireland toldThe Journalthat the post-Brexit trading arrangements are not working the way either side wanted them to.

“One in five manufacturers say their GB supplier is no longer willing to send goods to Northern Ireland at all,” Stephen Kelly, CEO of Manufacturing Northern Ireland said.
Kelly said that the pain is being “most acutely felt” by the businesses that import components from GB and sell the finished product on to the UK market.
“Those who export their product are in a good place, because they have all of the benefits, which is a price worth paying for the complexity of trade from GB to NI.”
Another business representative said that their sector wasn’t that badly affected or at an added advantage, and that they were “getting on” with the Protocol.
‘Very close’ to what NI businesses asked for
The Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group, made up of 12 organisations representing Northern Ireland businesses, has been engaging with the European Union and the UK on what changes to the Protocol are needed.
Aodhán Connolly, Director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which represents 90% of Northern Ireland businesses and is one of those 12 organisations, said that the EU’s proposals seemed to reflect “very close” to what the Working Group had asked for.
A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group said that “some of the solutions being mooted go some way towards meeting those tests”, that the proposals must provide “stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability”.
The umbrella group has meetings with both the UK government and the European Commission to discuss these proposals in full, and won’t be making statements to the press until those discussions have taken place.
Brian Reid, the CEO of Deli Lites, a fresh food supplier in Warrenpoint, said that his business sells 70% of its products over the border to Ireland.
“We told [David Frost] business is really thriving, but he wasn’t listening to us. We told him the real problem was political uncertainty,”he saidof a visit Frost made to nearby Newry.
Some issues still not dealt with
But Kelly, whose group Manufacturing NI is also one of the 12 Working Group organisations, said that the vast majority of what is proposed is “largely irrelevant” to many in manufacturing, with most of the focus on retail and food issues.
Many transportation manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland buy axles from a German manufacturer, he says.

“It’s an EU product in an EU factory, modified by EU factories, and the only time customs apply is when it’s going to Northern Ireland.”
He says that there are no proposals in the current Protocol changes to fix this anomaly.
“Some people ask: ‘Why don’t people shift supply chains to the EU?’ But history and culture and decades of trading history is linked to Britain, and for good reason: we’ve the same currency, language, legal structure. It’s not possible to just turn that tap off.
“It’s a small-business economy, we don’t have the scale to be competitive.”
‘Devil is in the detail’
Michael Bell, Executive Director of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association says that though the Protocol “was necessary” as it avoided a catastrophic no-deal Brexit, he adds that “it is not perfect”.
“We have consistently called for practical solutions on the Protocol that meet four key tests – we want affordability, certainty, simplicity and stability. Signs of movement from both parties this month are very welcome, and indeed some of the solutions being proposed may go some way to meeting these tests.
“The devil is in the detail however, and the business community continues to work with London and Brussels to encourage lasting, practical solutions.
“The most important thing food and drink businesses in Northern Ireland need right now is certainty.”
One of the common complaints about the current EU proposals is that they are light on detail. Kelly says that this may have been a negotiation tactic, due to the fraught political atmosphere that led up to the proposals being announced:
Kelly summed up the differences between the two sides on the Protocol as the EU assuming that products arriving in Northern Ireland should be treated as ‘guilty until proven innocent’, while the UK is arguing that it should be on authorities to prove that certain traders are non-compliant with post-Brexit trading rules.
“I’m slightly alarmed, despite all this time, that there appears to be gaps in understanding on the EU side about some of the challenges as a result of the Protocol.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-eu-condemns-uk-bill-5809354-Jul2022/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT must “step back from the brink” and cease its efforts to counter the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Parliament heard this afternoon.
Politicians in Brussels condemned the UK’s Protocol Bill, apiece of legislationthat would override parts of the Protocol to scrap customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.
Irish MEPs were among many to speak out against the UK’s actions in the Parliament today, with Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald warning the British government that it was time for it to “step back from the brink” and reengage with the EU.
As Prime Minister Boris Johnson takes heat from within his own party amid a series of high-profile resignations, the EU Parliament discussed support for Ireland and the possible consequences for the UK if it does not stand down on the bill.
Maroš Šefčovič, an EU Commissioner and Brexit negotiator, said that the “door remains open” for talks but that the UK must show “political will” to engage with the EU.
But if the bill is adopted, “of course, in that case, we will be forced to use the measures at our disposal”.
Last week, MPs in Westminster voted 295 to 221 togive the Bill a second reading, clearing the way for it to undergo further scrutiny and progress through the legislative process.
Speaking in Brussels this afternoon, Sinn Féin MEP Chris MacManus said that the “British government are not only attacking the protocol, they are attacking the Good Friday Agreement. They must not succeed.”
“Britain is fast becoming a rogue state, acting unilaterally in the interests of its own elite with no regard for the wellbeing of its people or the international rules-based order.”
He said that “unless Britain return to legality, it deserves to fail”.

Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews said that “in the UK, the stigma against breaking international law, domestic law and constitutional norms has been significantly eroded since Boris Johnson became prime minister”.
“Events in the last 24 hours demonstrate that for many, enough is enough,” he said.
His party colleague Billy Kelleher added that the EU must “ensure that Northern Ireland is not punished, is not suffering, by leaving the EU against the majority of the people of Northern Ireland”.
“In my lifetime, and I’m 54 years of age, I saw some harrowing events on my island and most importantly the Protocol understands that and tries to address it to ensure there is no hard border on the island,” Kelleher said.
“What we need now to do is to ask the British government to come back into the tent and sit down and negotiate in good faith under the basic principles of the withdrawal agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol, but more important, for peace and stability on the island of Ireland.”
Speaking in Irish, Green MEP Ciarán Cuffe said that the current events in UK politics “indicate that the people in Britain have lost confidence in their government”.
“Northern Ireland deserves better than that,” he said.
He said the Bill “endangers peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland”.
“In this difficult period we need to listen to the people of Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland need to be able to decide their own future and the parliament needs to support that.”
And Fine Gael’s Seán Kelly said the Bill “marks a new low for relations between the EU and UK.
He appealed to Johnson and the British government to end what he called a “‘Fawlty Towers’-like approach to politics, because if they don’t, there is a danger that Basil will be confused with Boris”.
“Regardless of the volatile situation in Number 10, there’s only one solution – put this bill aside, come and negotiate, and we can reach an agreement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rishi-sunak-stormont-executive-michelle-oneill-dup-6268950-Jan2024/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has said he believes there is a “very good basis” for the Stormont Executive to be restored.
Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill said it was “decision time” for the DUP on whether to return to powersharing, adding the party had “dragged this out for far too long”.
Devolved government in Northern Ireland has been effectively collapsed for almost two years amid DUP protest action over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The DUP has insisted it will not go back into power-sharing government until it secures legislative assurances from the Government on Northern Ireland’s trading position within the UK.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson indicated earlier this week that his party’s talks with the Government over the Windsor Framework are set to resume.
But speaking today, O’Neill said that it is clear the “substantive” talks between the UK Government and the DUP had concluded.
“It was very clear both privately and publicly that the British government confirmed at Hillsborough that they were done in terms of the substantive talks with the DUP.
“What I’m more interested in is: what is the decision of the DUP? Are they going to decide now to join with the rest of us to actually fight for good public services for the people who we collectively represent? Time is running out on that.
“This is decision time for the DUP. They need to make a decision once and for all, they have dragged this out for far too long.”

Last December, during talks with the Stormont parties, British Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said a £3.3 billion (€3.8 billion) financial package would accompany the return of devolution.

The package would include money to make an outstanding pay award to public sector workers who are set to stage one of the biggest strikes in Northern Ireland’s recent history next week.
The Northern Ireland Office previously said the package will remain on the table until a new executive is formed to allocate it.
Speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons today, Sunak said there is a “real chance” to restore the executive.
He was responding to a question from North Down Alliance MP Stephen Farry, who emphasised that Northern Ireland is seeing its public services “in huge crisis”, adding there are urgent public sector pay pressures that must be addressed.
He asked Sunak did he “recognise the real dangers of continued drift in Northern Ireland and the urgent need for Northern Ireland to have a government”.
Sunak responded by saying his Government’s focus “has always been on delivering for the people of Northern Ireland who rightly expect and deserve their locally elected decision makers to address the issues that matter to them”.
“We have held talks with the DUP and believe that significant progress has been made and that there is now a very good basis for the executive to be restored,” he said.
“I thank him for his comments about the £3 billion financial package and with that there is a real chance to restore the executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again.”
Speaking at Belfast City Hall today before meeting Heaton-Harris, O’Neill said that she is “ready to lead with other parties” in a restored Executive.
She said: “We are elected to do a job, I am ready to do that job. My colleagues are ready to do that job, other parties bar the DUP are ready to do that job.”
She said the DUP should not “wait” until workers are on the picket line next week to make a decision.
Asked about comments from Sunak who said he believes there is a “very good basis” for the Stormont Executive to be restored, O’Neill added: “He did again repeat the fact that the discussions are finished with the DUP.
“He did again repeat that there is a basis now for a restored executive. That has been the case since the May election last year. But, again, ultimately where we are today boils down to: is the DUP going to make the right decision?”","9.59pm, 10 Jan 2024",

THE EU HAS warned the UK against further unilateral actions in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol, as the two sides row over what’s being termed as a potential “sausage trade war” in the UK press.
The bloc has already launched legal proceedings against the UK for allegedly breaking the Northern Ireland Protocol by delaying custom controls on some goods arriving there from mainland Britain — England, Scotland and Wales.
In March, Londondecided to unilaterally extend a grace periodthat was given to supermarkets in Great Britain exporting agri-foods to Northern Ireland.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, EU vice-president Maros Sefcovic vowed Brussels would retaliate if the UK government took similar steps again, such as extending a grace period on checks on chilled meats due to end later this month.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s former newspaper characterised the threat as a “sausage trade war”.
“If the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations,” Sefcovic wrote.

Britain officially left the EU after nearly five decades of membership in January 2020, but under the terms of the divorce, relations remained unchanged until the start of this year.
Since then, London and Brussels have been trading on new terms, with the protocol effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and single market for goods.
The arrangement has been strongly criticised by unionist politicians in the north who have been pushing for the UK to over-rid the agreement.
Sefcovic’s comments come ahead of crunch meetings in London tomorrow with Brexit minister David Frost, and follow weeks of sniping about the protocol.
Sefcovic said there had been “numerous and fundamental gaps” in Britain’s implementation of the special arrangements.
He countered claims by Johnson’s government that the bloc had failed to be sufficiently flexible, arguing in areas such as medicines it had allowed “tailor-made” solutions.
“Far from being inflexible, the EU has shown from the very beginning that we are willing to find creative solutions when required,” he said.
“But we cannot do this alone. It has to be a joint endeavour between the EU and the UK.”
Britain’s Environment Secretary George Eustice stressed today the protocol requires both sides to make “best endeavours” to ease any issues that the new rules are throwing up.

Eustice told LBC that the EU had been “slow to engage” with efforts to iron out difficulties ahead of the ending of a grace period which allows Northern Irish shops to continue selling chilled meats – including sausages and mince.
Eustice said on Tuesday he had “no idea” why the EU imposed “idiosyncratic” rules on the movement of chilled meats.
“I suspect it links to some kind of perception that they can’t really trust any country other than an EU country to make sausages,” he told LBC.
“I think that’s a nonsense. I think we’ve got a very good sausage industry in this country, we’ve got the highest standards of food hygiene in the world.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/protocol-row-isnt-rocket-science-says-ahern-in-call-for-solution-5976989-Jan2023/,"DEALING WITH CONCERNS around the Northern Ireland Protocol “isn’t rocket science”, and a solution must be found, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has said.
Ahern said the current stalemate which has plunged the Stormont Assembly into flux is “beyond comprehension”.
He emphasised that with a bit of flexibility it can be resolved.
“I really, really believe that this isn’t rocket science,” he said.
“When you think of the things that we resolved, we got the IRA to decommit their arms, we released prisoners … we reformed the old RUC to now a very competent international PSNI.”
He said yet now “we can’t find a way of working out how sausages and rashers” can move between Britain and Northern Ireland.
“It’s beyond comprehension, there has to be a solution that is unique to Northern Ireland,” he said.
Ahern was speaking to MPs as he gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Committee at Westminster around the workings of the Good Friday Agreement.
He emphasised that compromise is the only way that Northern Ireland will work.
Ahern served as Taoiseach during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations in 1998.

Chairman Simon Hoare said Ahern was the first either former or serving Taoiseach to give evidence to the committee.
Talks remain ongoing between the UK and EU over concerns around the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The DUP has insisted it will not re-enter government at Stormont until unionist concerns are dealt with.

Ahern said compromise is needed to find agreement.
“I do not believe that’s impossible, it does require some compromise,” he said, rejecting reports that a deal is close.
“There are still difficulties.”
Ahern said unionist concerns “cannot be railroaded” but also said the demands of unionists “can’t be fully adhered to”.
“If we don’t get compromise … then we run into a position where for the longer term … we haven’t got a solution and we don’t have (Stormont) institutions.
“In the absence of compromise, we’re building a future that will be on quicksand, and that’s my concern.
“I am 100% for compromise, 100% for trying to accommodate the concerns of people but I don’t think we can long finger this into the dim and distant future.”
Ahern also emphasised that he “has heard nobody on the island of Ireland say the solution to this is to ignore the concerns of unionism”.
“People might take issue with whether these things are constitutional or whether they’re not, but the issue is that we must find an accommodation moving forward that puts everyone in a win-win position,” he said.
Ahern extolled the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, particularly on the economies of both Northern Ireland and the Republic, but expressed disappointment at how often the political institutions have been down.
The Assembly could not function for three years from 2017-2020 following the resignation of then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness, and is again in flux since last spring following the resignation of first minister Paul Givan.
Ahern said it is “disappointing and unsatisfactory” that the institutions have been down so often.
“Let’s blame nobody and blame everybody, but we haven’t been able to run it,” he said, agreeing that a review of the working of the institution is due.
“I can’t think of another country in the world that has had institutions have been up and down as much, and that’s not good, it’s not good for investment, it’s not good for the people.”
Closing the session, Hoare said the horrors of the war in Ukraine has “contextualised” the size of the problem.
“If the sophisticated, mature statecraft of Brussels, Westminster and Dublin can’t solve this, then I think we all have to begin to wonder what the hell are we all doing,” he said.","6.27pm, 23 Jan 2023",

AT THE BRITISH-Irish Council held in Wales this week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin was asked about why EU-UK relations were so bad.
“How long have you got?” he replied initially, before saying there was a need now to turn the corner on relations between the EU bloc and its former member.
But after five years of debating what Brexit should look like in practice, and with regular public disagreements between the EU and the UK, it’s beginning to look increasingly likely that this is how things will always be.
Diplomatic flare-ups over grace periods and trade details between the EU and UK will be a customary part of the news cycle, much like the superpower posturing between the US and China.
This will leave Ireland increasingly in the lurch, as it tries to grow its global influence independently of the UK, while also maintaining a good relationship with its closest neighbour.
Building those Anglo-Irish relations anew outside the structures of the EU is made all the more volatile by the divisive and unpredictable politics in Westminster.
The latest flare up: commentators and analysts thought it was increasingly likely that the UK would trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which reared its head recently for the first time since February when Boris Johnson’s Brexit bulldog David Frost said the UK would trigger Article 16 if the Protocol wasn’t replaced.
This was said on the eve before his counterpart in Brexit Protocol negotiations, European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič, unveiled the EU’s proposals on how to smoothen post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
This turned out to be an opening salvo. The real threat of triggering Article 16 flared up about a month later – the same week the Tory government became embroiledin a ‘sleaze’ row.
As murmurings from the corridors of Westminster grew that Article 16 would be triggered, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party took a hit in the polls following the controversy, falling to 36% and behind Labour (at 37%) for the first time in 12 months.
In the end, the UK Government didn’t trigger Article 16 when it was suggested it would, and a deal between the EU and UK looks increasingly likely.
“There’s enough going on [right now],” an adviser to the British Prime Minister toldthe Financial Times, referring to inflation, cost of living, energy prices, and Covid-19 pressures.
Article 16, by the way, is a standard trade clause that is usually unused, and is the ‘emergency red button’ that would suspend the Protocol temporarily for specific post-Brexit trade rules that have been identified as problematic.
This would be done if the trading arrangements lead to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade”, as the Article 16 clause states.
Of course, that’s Brexit in a nutshell.
If Article 16 were triggered, it would not solve the UK Government’s problems with the Protocol – those problems being as big as the oversight of the European Court of Justice, or as small as whether a chilled sausage can be sent from England to Northern Ireland.
It would most likely triggeranother round of negotiations, even though the EU and UK are already talking about how to solve what Boris Johnson once called “teething problems” with Northern Ireland trading arrangements in its Joint-Committee.

If these negotiations failed and the UK took unilateral action to cut out the rules it deems unnecessary, the EU may take “proportionate rebalancing measures”. These are then subject to review every three months, and both sides can request a review at any point.
With the UK regularly threatening to abandon the Northern Ireland Protocol, which it rubberstamped twice in the last 12 months, where does that leave Ireland? Can it maintain its relationships with the UK Government during the regular rows with the EU?
Should it?
The alternative is to de-prioritise Ireland’s relationship with the UK, and seek allies elsewhere. But who are they in Europe, and further afield, and does that make sense to do ahead of our nearest neighbour, with whom we have centuries of ties?
And while all these diplomatic flare-ups are happening, where does that leave Northern Ireland? Not mentioned at all in the Brexit vote campaign, didn’t vote for Brexit as a region, not at the negotiating table when a trade deal was struck between the EU and UK, and disrupted politically, economically and societally in the aftermath of Brexit.
Social scientist and Brexit expert Professor Katy Hayward said at a DCU Brexit Institute event this week that the British government and the Irish government have been “talking for Northern Ireland internationally, but saying very different things”.
There has been an acceptance from both sides that there are issues with the Protocol – the disagreement comes over how insurmountable those problems are: the EU thinks they can be tweaked to work, the UK is asking for the whole Protocol to be removed.
Almost six months after the UK Government published its Command Paper, it’s still unclear what the UK is proposing would go in the Protocol’s place.
Queen’s University polling suggeststhat there is a split in sentiment over the benefits and downsides of the Protocol – but polling from October has noted a growth in positive sentiment towards its impact on the Northern Ireland economy, protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and north-south cooperation.
Realistically, it’s still too early for us to know how good or bad it is for the North.
Fine Gael MEP Deirdre Clune made the point toThe Journallast month that the Good Friday Agreement needs to be protected for various reasons, but also because it has a feature that other peace treaties between nations don’t – it has been democratically supported north and south of the border. This is an obvious argument for future cooperation.
“I don’t think the EU is understood on the UK side, and I don’t think the UK is properly understood on the EU side. Of course Ireland has a pretty important role to act as a translator, I think we can play a role there,” Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews argued.
For now, the UK Government has pulled its finger away from the big red button due to political pressures at home and shortage concerns in the run-up to Christmas. But the immediate question then is how long this can last – and what the impact will be on Ireland and the EU if it eventually does decide to go nuclear on post-Brexit trade.
That’s why the next cycle ofThe Good Information ProjectfromThe Journalwill look at the post-Brexit relationships between Ireland, the UK and the EU.
Over the coming weeks, our reporters – including Gráinne Ní Aodha, Rónán Duffy and Ian Curran – will be examining and explaining what’s going on right now as these complicated relationships are navigated. Stay tuned.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-thinks-eu-countries-6375668-May2024/,"IRISH PEOPLE CONSIDER Denmark to be the EU country most like Ireland, according to a new poll.
The Scandinavian nation was closely followed by Spain and then Portugal in the rankings, which did not feature near neighbour the UK due to its departure from the bloc.
The results from the latestThe Journal/Ireland Thinks European Elections series, published today, also show that a clear majority of people believe the UK was wrong to leave the EU.
A total of 15% of people chose Denmark, followed by 13% for Spain and 9% for Portugal. These were followed by the Netherlands at 9% and Poland on 8%.
The majority of age groups also chose Denmark when asked in the poll. It was the main option among people aged 35-54 and by over-65s. Meanwhile, those aged 55-64 chose Spain (15%) but this was closed followed by Denmark (14%).
Denmark and Ireland joined the European Economic Community (now the EU) at the same time in 1973. However, it is not part of the eurozone. At 5.9 million, the population of the Scandinavian country is also higher than Ireland’s 5.1 million but the countries do have other statistical similarities, such as a high life expectancy and low unemployment rate.

When broken down by political party, supporters of the Social Democrats (20%), Aontú (17%) and Fine Gael (16%) and Fianna Fáil (15%) were those most likely to view Denmark as the closest to a kindred spirit.
For Green Party supporters, almost one in four of their voters viewed Ireland as most similar to the Netherlands.
Labour supporters were torn between Netherlands and Austria at 12% apiece, while Sinn Féin (16%) and Solidarity-People Before Profit (29%) voters selected Spain.
Among people voting for Independents and Others, Denmark was most selected at 20%.
However, Poland — which has a strong recent history of migration with Ireland — ranked much higher with Independents and Others than compared with other groups. Similarly, Solidarity-People Before Profit and Aontú voters were also more likely to select Poland.

The reverse was the case in Munster where almost one-in-five voters chose Denmark, while 17% of people in the rest of Leinster chose the Scandinavians.
The final region polled was Connaught and Ulster, where 16% of those polled selected Spain.
Denmark also ranked highest among voters earning between €20,000-€30,000 per year and those in the €50,000-€80,000 bracket.
Highest earning voters, who make more than €80,000 per year, viewed Ireland as most like Portugal. Those earning less than €20,000 opted for France when asked.
Responses mirrored the overall picture among voters depending on their housing tenure, except for those renting from their council. Up to 24% of this cohort selected Spain, followed by Poland (13%) and France (12%).
People were also asked what they think about Brexit, eight years on from the pivotal vote — a total of 68% said they think it was a bad idea for Britain to leave the EU. Just 22% said they thought it was the right idea, while 10% said they weren’t sure.
This view was widely shared among Irish party supporters but with some exceptions: 48% of Aontú supporters said they felt the UK was right to leave the EU, with just 33% disagreeing (a further 19% were unsure).
A majority of voters for Independents and Others (57%) also believe the UK was right to vote to leave the EU.

The type of housing tenure someone had was also a key factor in deciding their position, with renters in particular showing more agreement with the UK’s decision.

The Journal/Ireland Thinks series of polls is running each month ahead of the European Parliament elections in June. It will continue to explore voter intentions, measure Irish public sentiment towards the EU on a number of issues and highlight any potential opinion gaps between different demographics of Irish society on matters important to them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eu-truce-sausage-wars-brexit-5481268-Jun2021/,"A DEAL TO hold off a post-Brexit ban on sausages and other chilled meats moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is expected to be announced at the eleventh-hour.
The UK and the European Union are set to announce an extension to a grace period allowing their movement across the Irish Sea today – hours before a ban would come into force.
Brussels’ post-Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to address the media this afternoon, while the UK is expected to issue a statement.
Downing Street anticipated that a deal to avoid a ban on sausage shipments, which would come into place tomorrow without action, would be reached “on terms which are acceptable to the UK”.

The UK Government had threatened to unilaterally extend the grace period, something which would have triggered retaliatory action from the EU in the trade conflict dubbed the “sausage war”.
A prohibition on chilled meats is one element of Brexit’s contentious Northern Ireland Protocol, which has created a series of economic barriers on Irish Sea trade.
The protocol is aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
Shipments of chilled meats from third countries into the single market are banned – a prohibition which will cover the rest of the UK unless a lasting solution is found.
Sefcovic, a European Commission vice-president, told a Northern Ireland Assembly committee on Monday that he was confident an extension would be granted “that will address both sides’ needs and concerns”.
He said an “obvious” way to remove new Irish Sea trade checks and restrictions on a longer term basis would be for the UK to strike a deal on animal and plant standards that would see London align with Brussels’ agri-food regulations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/unionists-brexit-the-good-information-project-5626384-Dec2021/,"AHEAD OF THE British general election in 2017, the Democratic Unionist Party put out a Brexit wishlist. The party’s manifesto listed 30 objectives for exit negotiations, including “no internal borders” within the United Kingdom.
Despite the DUP emerging from that inconclusive election with the balance of power, things haven’t exactly worked out as they hoped.
The ultimate result of the Brexit talks was the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Irish Sea trade border designed to prevent an equivalent border on the island of Ireland.
The resulting difficulties in sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are a practical headache, but for unionists there’s an added psychological blow.
“People say, hold on a minute, there’s something fundamentally wrong or uncomfortable with the fact that trading within the UK is not practical or seamless or frictionless as it was before”, says Ian Marshall of the Ulster Unionist Party.
“If we applied those rules and regulations on the land border, would they be acceptable to everyone? There’s no question: they wouldn’t.”
Recent polling of politically engaged voters in Northern Ireland suggests that a majority overall now have a favourable view of the Protocol.
But opposition seems to be concentrated in the unionist community. The leaders of all four main unionist parties have signed up to a joint declaration that it “must be rejected and replaced”.
A legal challenge involving “a broad range of unionist opinion”, in the words of the Belfast High Court, is ongoing.
Even given the recent growth in people who consider themselves neither nationalist nor unionist, grievance in one community is a problem.
“The Good Friday Agreement was about consent, mutual respect and parity of esteem”, Marshall points out.
“At the moment, there’s a big chunk of people in Northern Ireland – whether you agree or disagree with them – who don’t feel they’re being listened to and that there’s no certainly no consent from their perspective.”
But assuming that unionists are united in scorched-earth opposition to the Protocol would be a mistake.
Unionist pragmatism
It’s true that the tiny Progressive Unionist Party recently withdrew its support for the Good Friday Agreement, while the DUP has been threatening to pull out of the power-sharing Executive at Stormont over the Protocol in recent months.
“Through their actions, the European Union threaten the very political institutions in Northern Ireland they claim to espouse”, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said on 7 December.

“The Irish Sea border must be removed and Northern Ireland’s place within the Internal Market of the United Kingdom fully restored, so that the political institutions can continue to operate.”
By contrast, the Ulster Unionist Party seems much more open to making the Protocol work.
“Fundamentally, as a consequence of Brexit, there will have to be a trading arrangement”, says Marshall, the party’s Assembly candidate for West Tyrone.
“There has to be a set of rules in place, so we can’t get away from that fact. But what [UUP leader] Doug Beattie has been saying is ‘OK, this needs to be amended and changed, this needs to be different, it’s not fit for purpose as it is and let’s sit down and have that conversation – because the Protocol must work for everyone’.”
That suggests that the UUP, and many individual unionists, are open to persuasion that their interests are being catered for through the continuing UK-EU talks on Protocol reform.
“There has been movement from the European Union”, says Mick Fealty, editor of the popular Northern Ireland politics blog Slugger O’Toole.
A deal that helps small businesses cope with trade barriers – even if imperfect – would, he thinks, kill off the “extreme talk” of loyalist violence or bringing down power-sharing.
“The lower the barriers on east west trade, the more you basically legislate out of existence the ability of the DUP to bring anything down,” Fealty says.
Asked about the talks, Marshall tellsThe Journal: “We’re going to need something that is practical and pragmatic, and I think there is an appetite there to get something we can work with”.
That pragmatism may be more in tune with public opinion than Donaldson’s remarks.
In a recent survey by the University of Liverpool, the Protocol came behind health, Covid and the economy as the most pressing issue for people in Northern Ireland.
While those who want to remain in the UK were more concerned about the Protocol than United Irelanders, only a small minority rated it as the most important issue going.
Similarly, the Liverpool researchers found “no majority support within the pro-union community to reject mitigations and easements [from the EU], or to reject the process of solution seeking”.
Even the Progressive Unionist Party appears divided on the subject: one of its three councillors, John Kyle, recently spoke about the “opportunities that are presented in a reformed Northern Ireland protocol”.
Stormont elections
The DUP does, however, seem to be recovering some support.
In the latest opinion poll of Assembly voting intentions, the only movement larger than the margin of error was the DUP, which was up five points to 18%, while the TUV was down three.
That still left Sinn Féin ahead on 24% – and the next Stormont election is due in May 2022.
Related ReadsWielding a gun with no ammunition: The UK, the EU and the battle over the Northern Ireland ProtocolBrexit is fuelling a boom in cross-border trade. But why? And what does it mean for the island?
As Fealty points out, that kind of vote share would represent a decline in support for Michelle O’Neill’s party compared to the last Assembly election.
It’s not just the DUP that’s losing support to smaller outfits, like the cross-community Alliance Party.
“Sinn Féin lost 7% of its overall vote in the 2019 general election”, Fealty says.
“That can only be accounted for if Sinn Féin voters are defecting towards Alliance and away from nationalism altogether. It’s likely they’ll win, but they’ll lose seats as they win.”
Even so, a win would mean a Sinn Féin First Minister – even if there are more unionist than nationalist members elected overall.
Unlike the original Good Friday Agreement rules, the single largest party after an election gets to nominate the next First Minister.
That’s thanks to the St Andrews Agreement, negotiated in 2006 at the urging of the DUP.
“It used to be the largest party in the largest designation. If they’d left the law alone under the Good Friday Agreement, that would still be the DUP,” Fealty says.
The DUP will try to persuade unionist voters to rally round to make sure a pro-Union outfit is still the single biggest party.
But Fealty thinks they’ll have trouble doing so: unionism, he thinks, is increasingly hard to motivate with a sense of tribal threat.
“Unionists no longer fear a Sinn Féin first minister,” he says. “They don’t fear a united Ireland. They don’t fear the south in the way they did before.”
Marshall’s career is the perfect illustration. A former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, he was elected to the Seanad in 2018 as an independent unionist before moving his political career back across the border.
He’s betting on voters in Northern Ireland being increasingly motivated by bread and butter issues, rather than constitutional wrangling.
“People get up every morning and they worry about food on the table, they worry about their job, their kids’ education, the health service”, he tellsThe Journal.
“That crosses the divide, irrespective of your politics”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michelle-oneill-northern-ireland-protocol-5587886-Oct2021/,"SINN FÉIN’S MICHELLE O’Neill has said there is “no credible alternative” to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
She said we will shortly see whether or not the British government has any interest in getting a solution in the political talks with the EU.
“There is no credible alternative to the Protocol. Businesses in the North continue to access the single market. They want the protocol to work.
“They want certainty and solutions.
“However, the new red lines set out by the British Government begs the question do they want a solution at all?”
She said Sinn Féin is ready to fight the Assembly election next May, or sooner should the DUP crash out of politics at Stormont.
“We will fight for every vote to return strong, progressive, republican representatives. Our priorities will be health, housing, education, jobs and Irish unity.
“This election is about those of us who want to work together to make politics work and deliver on health and education, to deliver progressive change taking on those who want to resist change.”

She hit out at the DUP for “rolling back” on political agreements, accusing the party of denying rights and equality.
The Sinn Fein deputy leader used her opening speech at the party’s Ard Fheis to criticise the Democratic Unionists, accusing the party of “provoking outrage” by boycotting the North-South Ministerial Council.
Sinn Fein is holding its annual conference in north Dublin, and Stormont ministers and TDs are speaking at the scaled-back event.
O’Neill said the balance of power at Stormont has “shifted irreversibly” and the political unionist majority is gone.
“The DUP roll back on political agreements, their continued denial of equality and rights is dead-end politics,” she said.
“It is for the people to decide the next first minister, not the DUP. Sinn Fein is aiming to return as the biggest party, not for the sake of it, but to deliver change.
“This is now about those of us who want to work together to make the Assembly and Executive work, to deliver on health and education, to deliver progressive change, taking on those who want to maintain the status quo and resist that change.
“Their boycott of the North-South Ministerial Council has been declared unlawful by the High Court.
“Their futile stunt to provoke outrage is in vain. Harking back to a bygone era of unionist rule is a lost cause too.
“The DUP has declared that a Sinn Fein first minister after the next election would give unionism a real problem.

“It is for the people to decide the next first minister, not the DUP. Sinn Fein is aiming to return as the biggest party, not for the sake of it, but to deliver change.”
O’Neill said the party will nominate a first minister and vowed to return as the largest party in Northern Ireland.
The deputy leader also criticised the British Government proposals to end all prosecutions for Troubles offences.
She accused the British Government of attempting to “hide” its role during the Troubles.
“Sinn Fein will stand with the families of all victims and lobby the EU and US in support of the Stormont House Agreement and against this universally rejected policy from Downing Street,” O’Neill added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-not-understand-brexit-deal-cummings-5573458-Oct2021/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson never understood what his Withdrawal Agreement with the EU really meant, his former chief adviser has claimed.
Dominic Cummings said in a provocative series of tweets that he had always intended to get “the trolley” – his derogatory nickname for the Prime Minister – to “ditch the bits we didn’t like” after beating Labour in the 2019 general election.
His latest intervention came after Brexit minister David Frost set out the UK’s demands for fundamental changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol contained in the agreement which Johnson signed in January 2020.

He said that when Johnson finally realised the true implications of the deal, he claimed he would never have agreed to it – although Cummings said that was a lie.
During the election campaign, Johnson repeatedly boasted that the “divorce” settlement he had negotiated with Brussels – including the Northern Ireland Protocol – was a “great” deal that was “oven ready” to be signed.
Cummings said: “What I’ve said does NOT mean ‘the PM was lying in General Election 2019’, he never had a scoobydoo what the deal he signed meant.
When the Prime Minister did finally comprehend, “he was babbling ‘I’d never have signed it if I’d understood it’ (but that WAS a lie)”.
Cummings, who was credited with masterminding the successful Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, said that, when Johnson entered No 10 in 2019, the country was facing the “worst constitutional crisis in a century” with much of what he called the “deep state” angling for “Bino” (Brexit in name only) or a second referendum.

“So we wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley to ditch bits we didn’t like after whacking (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn. We prioritised,” he said.
He dismissed suggestions that abandoning those elements of the Withdrawal Agreement would mean breaking international law.
“Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,” he said.
“EU membership infantilised SW1 (Westminster) as yapping re ‘international law’ clearly shows.”

The final episode of the Channel 4 drama included a poignant look back at 1998 and the atmosphere in Northern Ireland at that time.
Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris told the Northern Ireland Affairs committee on yesterday that he feels there is education to be done around the importance of the agreement and its impact.
The final episode of the series was a poignant telling of the vote for the Good Friday Agreement through the eyes of the protagonists.
In the episode it was also revealed that Michelle’s brother was serving a prison sentence for his IRA activities and sees Erin and Michelle both fall out over the morality of involvement in terrorism.

Heaton-Harris recalled motorways in England being closed on occasion during Northern Ireland’s troubled past due to bomb threats, and referred to “plenty of unbelievable tragedies”.
“I have become very aware in the short time that I have held this role that there is actually a bit of education to be done in England, Scotland and Wales as to why the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is so important and what it has done,” Mr Heaton-Harris said.
He described a “lack of understanding, particularly in England and Wales”.
“I don’t think people quite understand the importance of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement … and the peace that has flowed from it equally, so, it’s been hard won over a long period of time,” he said.
Committee chairman Simon Hoare suggested in response: “Maybe enforced viewing of the final episode of Derry Girls in every school actually would be not a bad thing.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-brexit-trade-checks-eu-plans-6038116-Apr2023/,"PLANS FOR HOW post-Brexit border checks on goods coming into the UK from the EU will work have been set out by UK ministers.
The UK government has published a draft border operating model, designed to bring in the checks the UK is required to make under its Brexit trade agreement with the EU.
Ministers have delayed implementing the checks on several occasions since the UK officially withdrew from the trade bloc on 31 January 2020.
Under plans published by the Cabinet Office yesterday, the UK government says its new model will prevent delays at the border by reducing the need for physical checks for many types of goods.
The UK government says that under the new model, investigations of animal and plant products would still be thorough enough to protect against diseases like African swine fever and Xylella, while also making it as easy as possible for businesses to import.
It also plans to carry out the checks away from ports, to prevent traffic from building up similar to the passport-processing chaos which engulfed Dover at the weekend.
The customs and regulatory process is designed to be streamlined through the use of the “single trade window”, allowing traders to submit information about goods through one digital system.
A pilot trusted-trader scheme is also planned, in order to test further simplified processes for frequent importers.
Cabinet Office minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe said the draft strategy was a “huge step forward for the safety, security and efficiency of our borders”.
She added: “Our proposals strike a balance between giving consumers and businesses confidence while reducing the costs and friction for businesses, which in turn will help to grow the economy.”
UK’s Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: “It is vital that we have strong border controls in place. Invasive diseases could cost our farms and businesses billions of pounds, threaten our food safety and break confidence in UK exports around the world.
“That is why we are working hand in glove with businesses to devise a strong system that works for the nation.”
Under the draft plans, health certificates for animal and plant products crossing from Europe could be introduced by 31 October, with further measures planned at two further milestones throughout 2024.
Ministers are encouraging businesses to prepare for the new regime ahead of the Halloween start date.

William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The BCC is a big believer in the shift to a digital trade system.
“If it is done properly then smaller firms will see benefits when it comes to importing goods into Great Britain.
“Providing certainty for business is crucial and the focus must now be on delivering to the timescales set out. This will need a concerted effort to get the physical and digital infrastructure in place.
“It is then vital that companies, here and across the world, involved in sourcing and supply chains, are properly prepared for these changes and the introduction of new trusted-trader arrangements.
“We look forward to working closely with the UK government and businesses over the coming months to make sure this switchover runs as smoothly as possible.”
The British Retail Consortium urged ministers to step up its communication with retail businesses to ensure they are prepared for the changes.
Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: “With only six months until new checks on food imports are introduced, it is imperative the government steps up its engagement with retailers and their European suppliers to ensure the supply chains are prepared, preventing any disruption for customers and businesses.
“Ports and farmers will also need to be ready for physical checks from January, when the UK is particularly reliant on imported produce.”
Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the changes, claiming that “small firms that import from the EU and worldwide to the UK have been overwhelmed by complex customs paperwork and lack clear guidance on navigating border controls”.
But she said some small enterprises had been deterred from foreign trade in recent years, and encouraged the UK government to “adopt a ‘think small first’ approach to customs policy development and place small businesses at the heart of new trade and customs structures to avoid disproportionate cost or administrative burdens”.
The Liberal Democrats said the new model would “make trade between us and Europe harder”.
Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: “It’s staggering that the Conservatives looked at the chaos at Dover and said ‘more of that please’.
“The government’s claims that these plans are going to ease trading chaos are downright dishonest.
“Let’s be clear, these proposals mean more checks and more red tape, not less – the last thing anyone wanted.”
The UK government will now spend six weeks consulting with business, with a final model for trade checks due to be published later this year.","7.25am, 6 Apr 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/trade-northern-ireland-major-growth-5604848-Nov2021/,"EXPORTS FROM NORTHERN Ireland jumped by 60% in the first nine months of the year, new figures show.
Data published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) today reveals that imports from Northern Ireland reached €2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2021.
Exports to Northern Ireland from the Republic rose by 48% to reach €2.6 billion over the same period.
The figures come amid ongoing negotiations between the UK Government and the European Union over the future of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Unionists argue that the post-Brexit trade arrangements damage the union between Northern Ireland and Britain by placing a border in the Irish Sea.
Those trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland.

It has achieved that by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, an arrangement which has led to the checks on products crossing the Irish Sea from Britain.
Earlier, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost expressed concern about the impact the protocol has had on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.
“I think there is no doubt that the trade diversion that has occurred and the way the protocol is working has worried people about the strength of the connections and that’s playing into the sense of economic and social concern that we pick up, and it’s our wish to resolve that as consensually and reasonably as we possibly can,” he told BBC Radio Ulster yesterday.
The CSO also published revised figures that show trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland between 2016 and 2020 was higher than previously believed.
The figures indicated that exports from Northern Ireland to Ireland were worth around €2.4 billion in 2019 and 2020.
According to the CSO: “Where a large increase in trade with Northern Ireland was recorded since the start of 2021 the data have been queried with traders.
“In many cases, the increases are explained by changes to supply chains.
“In some cases, traders reported that they had previously incorrectly reported their trading partner as Great Britain, when in fact it should have been Northern Ireland.”","11.02pm, 17 Nov 2021",

However, a united Ireland isn’t necessarily the gold standard in good north-south relations as Brexit seems to have already strengthened the relationship between businesses north and south. In the year to September, the value of imports to the Republic from the North grew by 60% to almost €2.6 billion while the value of goods going the opposite direction rose by almost 50% to €2.8 billion.
Complexities and the additional red tape since 1 January mean businesses in the north and south have struggled with supply lines from Britain, so this boom also has to be credited withnecessity rather than politics. New Brexit rules in Northern Ireland have also driven a wedge between north and south – as professional qualifications in the north aren’t automatically recognised in the south anymore.
Omnipresent is the Northern Ireland Protocol which the EU and UK both agree there are issues with, changes to which could fracture the currently booming all-island economy.

Dubbed the “Edinburgh reforms”, the changes will be announced by Hunt in the Scottish city tomorrow as he heralded the “golden opportunity” Brexit provided to reshape the rules governing the financial sector.
Hunt will set out a package of more than 30 regulatory reforms, with plans to “review, repeal and replace” hundreds of pages of EU regulations ranging from disclosure for financial products to prudential rules governing banks.
Any rules deemed to hold back growth or that put companies off listing in the UK will be review or overhauled, as part of the bid to create a “tailor-made” UK regulatory system.
The plans come as the Government pushes ahead with efforts to end the UK’s sluggish record on growth, after Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng promised a similar set of reforms dubbed “Big Bang 2.0” – itself a reference to Margaret Thatcher’s 1986 policies which kicked off a massive change in the City of London.

“This country’s financial services sector is the powerhouse of the British economy, driving innovation, growth and prosperity across the country,” Hunt said.
“Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to reshape our regulatory regime and unleash the full potential of our formidable financial services sector.”
Hunt, who will meet with finance CEOs in Edinburgh tomorrow, said the Government was delivering an “agile, proportionate and home-grown regulatory regime which will unlock investment across our economy to deliver jobs and opportunity for the British people”.
While promising to protect consumers, the Government is also set to announce changes to ring-fencing rules, which currently require large banks to separate retail and investment arms.
In his autumn statement, Hunt pledged to reform Solvency II, referring to the multi-trillion pound insurance sector, which will ease capital rules for the industry.
The Treasury said that reforms will build on that pledge, with the Chancellor also expected to issue new mandates to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority to ensure both help “promote the international competitiveness of the UK”.","10.52pm, 8 Dec 2022",

63% of people say their view of Britain has changed since Brexit, and of those, 95% say it has changed for the worse.
Overall, that means 59.8% think less of Britain now since the Brexit vote.
Polling by The Good Information Project/Ireland Thinks this month asked respondents whether their view of Britain changed since Brexit and if it changed for better or worse.
For 34% of people, their views have not changed, and 2% don’t know.
Two-thirds of women have a different opinion of Britain now than before, along with 60% of men; 97% and 93% of those men and women respectively said it changed for the worse.
A changed perspective is present at a nearly equal level among all age groups, ranging from 60% to 64%, except among 25 to 34-year-olds, of whom 70% said their view of Britain is different since Brexit.

Among political party affiliations, Green Party and Social Democrat voters were especially likely to say their views on Britain have changed since Brexit at 86% and 75% respectively.
That was followed by 65% of Fine Gael, 64% of Fianna Fáil, 62% of Sinn Féin, 61% of People Before Profit, and 57% of Independent voters.
Only 38% of Aontú voters said their view has changed, with 72% of them indicating it changed for the worse and 25% for the better. Of those who said it hadn’t changed, 53% felt it stayed the same, and, if pressed, 20% leaned towards saying it would have changed for the worse and 26% for the better.

Kevin Cunningham, the founder of Ireland Thinks and a lecturer at TU Dublin, said that “for some people, Brexit has had a bigger impact on how they perceive Britain”.
“These people are quite similar to who would have been the core ‘Remain’ demographic in the UK, the sometimes unfairly maligned ‘metropolitan liberal elite’,” Cunningham explained.
“That is, people with higher levels of educational attainment, people living in Dublin, people aged 25-34, people on higher incomes, and supporters of the Green Party or Social Democrats,” he said.
“These people are more likely to say that their view of Britain changed due to Brexit.
“At the other end we have the more rural, older members of the public, more likely to support Aontú, who are much less moved by the development.”
Ireland Thinks polled a representative sample of 1,453 people between 3 and 5 December.
People with higher incomes over €50,000 were much more likely to say their views had changed (71%) than those on lower incomes less than €5,000 (38%)
Of those who said their views changed, all of those respondents earning an income less than €5,000 said it changed for the worst, along with 95% of people with more than €50,000.
Regionally, changed views on Britain were more prevalent in Dublin (73%) than other parts of the country, 62% in both Leinster and Munster and 59% in Connacht and Ulster.
But among those whose views have changed, between 94% and 96% of every area said it had changed for the worse.

Speaking toThe Journal, Dr Etain Tannam, a lecturer in International Peace Studies and expert in British-Irish relations at Trinity, said that Ireland has been “particularly hit” in the aftermath of Brexit, though the implications are being seen “across the board” in the EU.
“What I’ve noticed is a negative discourse about Britain as a whole. There sometimes isn’t a distinction in the media between Brexiteers and the British government and then the people as a whole, because so many were Remainers and young people would be different as well,” Dr Tannam said.

“I also think there was a latent negativity even before Brexit because of our history,” she said, noting that a general lack of research on attitudes to Britain or England make it difficult to have a baseline to draw comparisons from.
“I think the Shared Island approach [a government campaign for cooperation on the island of Ireland] is trying to deal with that,” she said, drawing on comments made by President Michael D Higgins last year about a need to curb anglophobia in Ireland.
“It’s very tame, it’s not extreme, but it’s a negative view or negative stereotype sometimes.”
She said that improved relations between the governments and between the EU and UK, as well as a resolution to the Northern Ireland Protocol, could positively impact opinions.
“I still think there’s work to be done in our knowledge base of Englishness and Britishness and unionism as well, it’s something there probably needs to be education about anyway, even after Brexit there probably is some ignorance among some people as there is very much in Britain about us.”
After voting to leave the EU in 2016, Britain withdrew from the bloc officially on 31 January 2020, followed by a transition period that finished at the end of the year.
Since then, a major sticking point in post-Brexit talks has been theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which allows goods to pass between the Republic and Northern Ireland and instead places checks at the Irish Sea.
Britain has signalled its discontent with the arrangement, saying it obstructs trade flow with Northern Ireland, leading to months-long talks between negotiators with it and the EU, though no consensus has yet been found.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said reaching an agreement on the Protocol before Christmas is“unrealistic at this stage”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/foster-replace-nothern-ireland-protocol-5340217-Jan2021/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S FIRST Minister has pressed Boris Johnson to replace the NI Protocol after the EU sparked a dispute over vaccine controls.
The EU caused outrage yesterday evening when it moved to invoke Article 16 of the post-Brexit mechanism, to stop the unimpeded flow of vaccines from the European bloc into the region.
Brussels subsequently reversed the move following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast.
Under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the single market for goods and continues to apply EU customs rules at its ports and airports.
The EU had signalled its intention to trigger Article 16 of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.
The Irish government, the British government, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the DUP and other unionists all raised concerns about invoking the article.
Arlene Foster said it was an “absolutely incredible act of hostility towards those of us in Northern Ireland”.
“It’s absolutely disgraceful, and I have to say the Prime Minister now needs to act very quickly to deal with the real trade flows that are being disrupted between Great Britain and Northern Ireland,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning.
“We’ve been asking the PM to deal with the flow problems and indeed, since 1 January, we’ve been trying to manage along with the Government the many, many difficulties that have arisen between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and there are actions he could take immediately,” she said.

“There is great unrest and great tension within the community here in Northern Ireland so this protocol that was meant to bring about peace and harmony in Northern Ireland is doing quite the reverse.
“The protocol is unworkable, let’s be very clear about that, and we need to see it replaced because otherwise there is going to be real difficulties here in Northern Ireland.”
Pressed on whether that would be in breach of an international treaty, she said: “Well it didn’t seem to bother the European Union yesterday when they breached the treaty in terms of their embarrassment around their vaccine procurement.”
A former Fianna Fáil politician said the Taoiseach was furious at the EU’s abandoned move to override part of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland.
“The action doesn’t make any sense at all and it has clearly embarrassed the Irish Government which was blindsided,” former European minister Dick Roche said.
“I understand that Micheál Martin was very annoyed at it, that he made very strong representations to the commission.”
In a statement late last night, the European Commission said it was “not triggering the safeguard clause” to ensure the protocol was “unaffected” after widespread condemnation of its move as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines.
The protocol has already proved unpopular with unionists in Northern Ireland who complain of a border down the Irish Sea.
Yesterday, there were calls for Government intervention amid claims that Brexit red tape could hinder the movement of military equipment within the UK.
New Irish Sea shipping arrangements mean the armed forces need to give 15 days’ notice, complete customs declarations and even inform Nato in order to take materials from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, according to the Ulster Unionist Party.
UUP MLA Doug Beattie, a decorated Army veteran, said the restrictions were a consequence of the protocol, which governs the movement of goods across the Irish Sea since the Brexit transition period ended.
Foster said a restriction on the movement of military equipment was among “hundreds of problems” created by the protocol.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-protocol-5607678-Nov2021/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Nov 2021
THE UK AND the EU negotiating teams need space to continue working to solve the impasse on post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said.
The two sides have been in negotiations over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is designed to prevent checks along the Irish border.
Coveney said he believed that the UK and the EU were now “serious” about trying to find solutions to some of the problems caused by the protocol.
“I think both are serious in terms of their engagement now with each other, to try and find a way forward on practical things that can reduce the impact of the protocol on the ground,” he said.
“I think now is a time to try to give space to the negotiators.
“I think instead of focusing on who’s at fault there I think, for now, we should certainly be giving both Lord Frost and his team and vice president (Maros) Sefcovic and his team, the time and space to really get into the detail of negotiations.
“It’s encouraging that the negotiations this week, while they were difficult, I understand in Brussels, are continuing now next week in London.
“And of course, we all want to close this chapter if we can, particularly for the sake of Northern Ireland.”
Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the UK’s Chief negotiator David Frost said there was “momentum” for his government to “secure a solution based on consensus” following a meeting in Brussels.
The current problems with the protocol go to the heart of our territorial integrity, of what it means to be one country and one market,” he said. “They will not just disappear.
“I still hope the EU can show the ambition needed to fix the problem by agreement. If they can’t, of course we will have to safeguard our position in other ways.”

‘We just don’t know’
Asked onRTE’s The Week in Politicsprogramme whether there was a danger that Brussels was being strung along by Frost, Coveney said that was a “danger”.
“It’s hard to know what’s happening right now, whether or not this is the British government giving some space for negotiation, with a view to then changing an approach in a negative direction in a few weeks time.
“We just don’t know. Because this is a very robust and difficult negotiation.
“But what we do know is that the two negotiating teams are in serious negotiations right now this week and again into next week. And we need to give that a fair wind if we can to give the best possible chance of agreement.”
Coveney said that it was important to listen to the concerns of unionists. However, he reiterated that the EU would not be budging on the contentious issue of the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing disputes around the protocol.
“I don’t see how the EU can outsource the arbitration on EU rules and regulations to a court outside of the EU,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s a realistic proposition.”
Speculation has continued for months that the UK Government is preparing to trigger Article 16, which would suspend elements of the post-Brexit arrangements in place in Northern Ireland.
However, there have been hopes on the EU side that the tone is shifting from the UK government.
European Commission vice-president Sefcovic said the EU was doing “everything possible” to avoid the triggering of Article 16.
He told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “We had a change of tone in the discussions over the last week, which I really appreciate.
Coveney said that the EU would respond “robustly” to any triggering of Article 16.
“That’s not what we want.”

New data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed a 65% drop – €906 million – to €497 million in January compared with the same month last year.
The beginning of 2021 marked the end of the Brexit transition period, bringing an end to the free movement of goods between Britain and European Union member states.
CSO senior statistician Orla McCarthy said: “Traders reported that a combination of factors contributed to the large reduction in imports from Great Britain in January 2021. These included the challenges of complying with customs requirements.
“Other factors identified by traders were stockpiling of goods in Q4 2020 in preparation for Brexit, substitution with goods from other countries, and a reduction in trade volumes due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions throughout January.”
The largest decrease was in the imports of live animals, falling by 75% – or €187 million – to €62 million.
It was followed by mineral fuel imports such as coal and gas, which fell 71% – or €139 million – to 57 million.
Chemicals, machinery and transport equipment also saw significant drops.
Exports to Britain also fell, by 14% – or €149 million – to €946 million.

Britain accounted for just 7% of exports from Ireland.
The largest declines were in exports of food and live animals, which fell by 33% – or €92 million – to €188 million.

Machinery and transport equipment decreased by €106 million to €101 million, a decline of 51%.
But chemicals and related products increased by 56%, up €157 million to €437 million.
Since 1 January, all trade in goods with Britain is treated as non-EU trade.
This brings considerable red tape that has caused significant delays for hauliers at ports.
During the Brexit transition period, trade rules remained the same as when the UK was an EU member state.
However, since that period ended at the beginning of 2021, incoming trade from Britain has remained persistently low.
Customs officials say Brexit alone is not to blame for this, with high levels of stockpiling and the coronavirus pandemic also contributing.

He said: “Goods are being pointlessly interrupted, and it is crazy to have cancer drugs which you can’t move from one part of the UK to another.”

Asked if he planned to trigger Article 16 during the Conservative Party’s conference next week, Mr Johnson replied: “That depends on the response from the EU”.
He told the broadcaster that the he signed up to the protocol because he has an “optimistic view of human nature and thought they (EU) would want to respect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement”.
He added the protocol was framed to operate “free trade east to west just as much as north to south and that was very, very clear but unfortunately that is not the way it is being operated”.

He also said that he suspects the UK political term will end next week, slightly earlier than planned, and that many of the core issues faced by the British government will not be tackled until a new Prime Minister has been appointed.
This process could take up to six week, he said.
The minister’s comments follow a tumultuous 72 hours in British politics that saw the resignation of over 50 government members and culminated in theresignation of outgoing Conservative leader Boris Johnson.

Minister Coveney, who met with Johnson on numerous occasions including throughout the former PM’s time as UK Foreign Secretary, described the political situation in Britain as an “extraordinary implosion” in leadership.
When asked if the Northern Ireland Protocol will fall down the agenda of the British Parliament, Minister Coveney said: “we will have to wait and see”.
“The truth is not much will happen in the context of big policy decisions between now and when there’s a new British Prime Minister,” he toldRTÉ’s Today With Claire Byrne.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also spoke about how theongoing Tory leadership competitionmay impact relations between the UK and Ireland, as well as the rest of Europe, moving forward.
He said that there is a “rump” of politicians within the Conservative party who want tension between the UK government and the EU and that these relations will play a large role in the leadership contest.
“I think leadership change in a party often changes a lot of things,” he said.
“Let’s wait and see what this leadership contest is about; Whether Brexit remains central to everything, as it has done under Boris Johnson’s leadership, or whether the debate broadens out in British politics to a whole series of other pressures that Britain faces now.”

Coveney also welcomed the change in British leadership as an opportunity for Ireland and the UK to achieve compromise.
“There is a landing zone if people want to find it… My job is to try to build a personal relationship [with the UK that hopefully can] result in us talking about pragmatic compromise, the two governments working together to try to try to end this deadlock in Northern Ireland… of course, I can’t do that on my own.”
“This ultimately needs to be a negotiated solution between the EU and the UK government. But certainly, we can do some of the groundwork,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/business-re-opening-covid-lockdown-not-prepared-brexit-5433690-May2021/,"BUSINESSES WHICH ARE reopening for the first time this year due to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions must get up to speed with post-Brexit trade arrangements, an Oireachtas committee has heard.
Revenue Commissioner and Director-General of Customs Gerry Harrahill said it has been “extremely challenging” for businesses trying to adjust to the new reality of customs checks since the trade rules changed on 1 January and that many businesses were “not as a prepared as they needed to be”.
He added that there were some businesses who would be dealing with these challenges in the coming weeks for the first time because until now they have been closed due to public health restrictions.
Harrahill told the Seanad Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU that it was now almost 20 weeks since the practical impacts of the UK being outside of the EU’s customs union and single market have taken effect.
“Unfortunately, some businesses were not as prepared for Brexit as they needed to be because the necessary preparations were not completed and, in some instances, weren’t even started in advance of 1 January,” he said.
“For some, this was because of the late stage at which the Trade and Cooperation Agreement was finalised and a misunderstanding that an agreement would mean no customs formalities, or because of a lack of clarity on what the UK formalities would entail after 1 January or because of an understandable focus on meeting the immediate challenge of Covid-19.”
He added that once 1 January had passed, it was “extremely challenging” for businesses trying to adapt their business model in real time for something that had already happened.
He warned other businesses may still need to adapt to the new trading environment.
“While businesses have made enormous progress in adapting to the new requirements in the four month period, we need to be aware that other businesses, who because of significant stockpiling or perhaps because they have been closed due to Covid-19 may encounter similar challenges when the economy reopens over the coming months,” he said.

“There is also a need for businesses to prepare to comply with the UK formalities that, although delayed, will be introduced from October onwards.”
The committee heard that since 1 January, Revenue had dealt with some 115,000 freight movements into Dublin Port, 82% of which have been green routed on arrival meaning they passed freely through the port without the need for any additional interaction with Revenue or any other State Agency.
About 10,000 freight movements had also arrived in Rosslare from Great Britain and on average 85% of those movements were green routed.
Complexity ‘not anticipated’
Harrahill was among a number of representatives from state agencies discussing the on Withdrawal of UK from EU will discuss customs checks and trade flows at Irish ports.
Hazel Sheridan, Head of Import Controls Operations at the Department of Agriculture, said in the first 15 weeks of this year the department had carried out 13,000 checks at Dublin Port and a further 670 had been conducted at Rosslare Port.
In comparison last year it conducted about 3,500 checks a Dublin Port in a 12-month period.
The HSE’s national director for National Services Joe Ryan said in advance of Brexit the HSE had recruited and trained over 110 additional Environmental Health Officers and admin staff specifically for import controls at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort border control posts.
He said Brexit had presented significant challenges and new ways of working for many import businesses, and it was clear that despite early engagement, “many importers did not anticipate the level of complexity on 1 January”.
In the first quarter of this year, the HSE undertook checks on almost 14,000 consignments between Dublin and Rosslare with over 11,000 of these consignments arriving from Great Britain.
In the same period last year checks were completed on 891 consignments. The vast majority of these consignments were cleared for release.

McCord’s brother Raymond was beaten to death by a Ulster Volunteer Force gang in north Belfast in 1997.
Holding a picture of his brother, he confronted LCC chairman David Campbell only moments after he and former Ulster Unionist MLA and Ukip NI leader David McNarry unfurled an anti-Protocol banner outside the Irish Secretariat offices.
McCord mocked the size of the protest and claimed it demonstrated that the LCC had no support within loyalist communities.
“Nobody wants you, clear off,” he said.
A police officer intervened during the exchanges and urged people to respect Covid-19 regulations and guidance.
The demonstration took place as loyalists vowed to resume protest action against post-Brexit trading arrangements that have created new barriers and bureaucracy on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Loyalists claim the Northern Ireland Protocol has undermined the region’s place within the Union.
They had temporarily paused protests following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.

Yesterday evening, banners similar to one displayed by Campbell and McNarry were erected in several loyalist areas in Northern Ireland.
The banners accuse the UK and Irish government, the European Commission and the US administration of not listening to loyalist concerns, and warn that politicians face a choice between the Good Friday peace accord of 1998 and the Protocol.
Earlier this month, rioting broke out in a number of working class loyalist areas across Northern Ireland.
Campbell said all protests should be peaceful.
“There are other individuals making similar peaceful symbolic protests today throughout Northern Ireland, in London and in Dublin itself and we hope that conveys a message to anyone who is seeking violent protest to stay at home – you’re not assisting our cause,” he said.
McNarry insisted the size of the protest at the Irish Secretariat reflected the public health situation.
“Had this been normal times David and I would have been two of a hundred thousand people on the street today and on the streets on many nights, peacefully protesting and asking for our rights to be acknowledged,” he said.
Loyalist anger at the Protocol has been cited as one of the main factors behind the violence that erupted earlier this month.
Another was the decision not to prosecute 24 Sinn Féin members for Covid-19 breaches after they attended a mass republican funeral during the pandemic.
There are also more long-standing concerns held by some loyalists that they have missed out on the gains of the peace process in areas such as jobs, investment and housing.
Nationalists reject the contentions and insist their communities experience just as many problems with poverty.

A WAR OF words is continuing over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland, with unionist leaders calling for the Northern Ireland Protocol to be scrapped and the Irish government insisting it needs to stay.
The EU and UK are in talks to discuss possible solutions to how the Protocol has been implemented, after British Prime Minister told Brussels he will consider triggering Article 16 which would unilaterally stop barriers being put up in the Irish Sea.
NI First Minister Arlene Foster said the Northern Ireland Protocol risked the country’s “political and economic links” to the UK and called for it to be replaced.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told BBC Good Morning Ulster: “We need to be truthful with everybody – the Protocol is not going to be scrapped.”
He said ministers wanted to be helpful and flexibilities were possible but the problems were a consequence of the UK’s Brexit negotiating stance.
Coveney said: “There is not going to be very dramatic change.”
Foster also appeared on BBC Good Morning Ulster today, and accused Coveney of being “tone deaf to the concerns of unionism”.
“These are not teething problems,” she said.

“People need to get their heads out of the sand and get their fingers out of their ears and actually listen to what people in Northern Ireland are having to deal with.”
The Protocol
The agreement on Northern Ireland was seen as a way of resolving the main sticking point in Brexit negotiations – the Irish border – and sees checks focused on goods traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and allowing them to move freely on the island of Ireland.
Concerns over the protocol and its impact on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK were exacerbated last week when Article 16 was briefly triggered to close the border to exports of the coronavirus vaccine from the Republic.
European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič is due in the UK next week to discuss the issue, and Boris Johnson has not ruled out a reciprocal triggering of the emergency brake, telling MPs: “We will do everything we need to do, whether legislatively or indeed by triggering Article 16 of the protocol, to ensure that there is no barrier down the Irish Sea.”
Šefčovič and Michael Gove held a meeting with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland yesterday and, in a statement following the meeting, the Cabinet Office minister and his EU counterpart said they would “work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues”.
However,writing in the Daily Telegraph, Foster said Johnson had committed to protect the UK internal market, and “must now back up those words with tangible actions that protect the integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom”.
The DUP leader wrote: “The Northern Ireland Protocol has not worked, cannot work and in light of our proposals to the government, needs to be replaced.
“Indeed, across Northern Ireland there is growing anger at the current arrangements. The delicate political balance and relationships in Northern Ireland have been damaged and disturbed by the Protocol.”
Ian Paisley Jr, also of the DUP, echoed his party leader’s words, telling BBC’s Newsnight: “The first 34 days of this year have been absolute and total chaos for the citizens of Northern Ireland.

“This has been an unmitigated disaster. I can’t imagine that’s what they planned but this is how it has worked out and therefore we’ve got to fix it and fix it fast.”
Separately, physical inspections on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which are required under the protocol, have been suspended amid threats and intimidation of staff.
Police have insisted there is no evidence that loyalist paramilitaries are involved in the sinister campaign, instead blaming disgruntled individuals and small groups.
Unionists and loyalists are deeply unhappy with the new arrangements, which came into force at the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, believing the protocol has created a barrier between the region and the rest of the UK.
Sinn Féin’s Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Šefčovič was keen on finding a solution and did not intend to cause problems when Article 16 was triggered.
She said: “He was very gracious in his apology around that and recognised that it caused some tensions
“I accept that apology in the way in which it was intended.
“There are flexibilities inbuilt (in the protocol) which he thinks haven’t even had a chance to work out yet.”
O’Neill welcomed his commitment to travel to the UK to find ways to resolve the issues that have emerged, adding that she believed it was a “very pragmatic and very constructive way” to move forward.","8.25pm, 3 Feb 2021",4 Feb 2021

Ahern said he was hopeful the anniversary of the agreement will be able to be celebrated in April with a deal on the outstanding Protocol issues met.
Talks between the UK and EU to resolve the impasse over the contentious Brexit trading arrangements are continuing, with both sides insisting a deal is possible.
“The technical issues on the protocol, I believe, can be sorted out,” Ahern told BBC One’s Sunday Politics Northern Ireland programme.
“I do understand that unionists and loyalists have concerns about the constitutional position. They do have concerns that have to be worked out and we have to take account of their views and try and find solutions to alleviate the concerns and fears. I think that’s very important.”

The former Fianna Fáil leader said “a lot of progress” has been made on the Protocol issues.
“Hopefully over the early weeks of next year that can be dealt with,” Ahern added.
“The concern about the constitutional issues … we have to work through with loyalists and unionists, and that hopefully that can happen too.
“So, I’m hopeful that when we get to April, we will be able to genuinely celebrate it and not in the way it is at present.”
Despite the potential for a deal, the UK had previously signalled that it would act on the Protocol unilaterally, with legislation currently before the House of Lords.
The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which would override large swathes of the Protocol, has been criticised by both the EU and Ireland.
However, the bill has been praised by the DUP, who are currently refusing to return to power sharing at Stormont due to the Protocol.

Devolved government at Stormont has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the ministerial executive in protest at the Protocol.
The DUP has insisted it will not allow a return to powersharing until radical changes to the Protocol are delivered.
The region’s largest unionist party has blocked the formation of a new administration following May’s Assembly election and prevented the Assembly meeting to conduct legislative business as part of its protest over the protocol.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-deal-explainer-6005421-Feb2023/,"LAST UPDATE|27 Feb 2023
UK PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have signed off on a “breakthrough” post-Brexit deal called the new “Windsor Framework”.
Sunak described it as a “decisive breakthrough” on post-Brexit trading arrangements, while von der Leyen said they had both changed the original protocol.
Von der Leyen arrived in the UK this morning for talks on the revised deal.
While any deal will spell changes to the Protocol, the DUP could refuse to accept it and continue to boycott Stormont, continuing the political stalemate in Northern Ireland.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson noted in the House of Commons this evening that “significant progress has been made”.
“Ultimately, my party will now assess all these proposed outcomes and arrangements against our seven tests,” he said, adding “and whether it respects and restores Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom”.
Brexiteers within the Conservative party could also try to sink the deal if they are unhappy with it and have called on Sunak to put it to a vote in the House of Commons.
Sunak said the new agreement protects “Northern Ireland’s place within the union” and allows VAT and excise changes to be applied across the whole of the UK.
Speaking at a press conference, he said:
“We’ve amended the legal text of the protocol to ensure we can make critical VAT and excise changes for the whole of the UK, for example alcohol duty, meaning our reforms to cut the cost of a pint in a pub will now apply in Northern Ireland.”
He said today’s agreement delivers the “smooth flow of trade within the United Kingdom. Goods destined for Northern Ireland will travel through a new green lane with a separate red lane for goods at risk of moving on to the EU”.
“Food retailers like supermarkets, restaurants and wholesalers will no longer need hundreds of certificates for every lorry and we will end the situation where food made to UK rules could not be sent to and sold in Northern Ireland,” said Sunak.

“This means that if food is available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, then it will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland,” he added.
The movement of plants from Britain to Northern Ireland has also been streamlined.
Rather than paying £150 per movement into Northern Ireland, growers and businesses can pay £120 a year to be part of the UK scheme, as they did before the Protocol came into force.
Pet owners visiting Northern Ireland from Great Britain but not travelling on to Ireland, will have to confirm that the pet is microchipped and will not move into the EU, as opposed to more rigorous checks imposed previously.
Referencing the process of sending parcels and VAT, he said:
“This means we have removed any sense of a border in the Irish Sea. Second, we have protected Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.
“We can make sure that the EU’s plan to reduce the VAT threshold by £10,000 will not apply in Northern Ireland and nor will the SME VAT directive that would have brought huge amounts of EU red tape for small businesses.”
Under the Framework, 2,000 Northern Ireland businesses will not need to register for VAT under a 2025 EU Directive.
He said the agreement would make drugs approved for use by the UK medicines regulator automatically available in Northern Ireland pharmacies.
In addition, the Northern Ireland Assembly will be able to “pull an emergency brake for changes to EU goods rules”, Sunak said.
“If the brake is pulled, the UK Government will have a veto.”
The ‘Stormont Brake’ means the UK can veto new EU goods laws if they are not supported by both communities in Northern Ireland.
The Windsor Framework was described by the UK prime minister as a “turning point for the people of Northern Ireland”.
The agreement “fixes the practical problems” and “preserves the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement”, he added.

All parties in Northern Ireland will want to consider the agreement in detail, a process that will need time and care, said Sunak.
The UK Parliament will have a vote on the deal “at the appropriate time”, said Sunak.
Meanwhile, von der Leyen said she believes “we can now open a new chapter in our partnership, a stronger EU-UK relationship, standing as close partners, shoulder to shoulder now and in the future”.
“For this to work, we have agreed on strong safeguards like IT access, labels and enforcement procedures that will protect the integrity of the European Union’s single market.”
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the “sole and ultimate arbiter of EU law” and will have the “final say” on single market decisions, she said.
“Indeed, the European Court of Justice is the sole and ultimate arbiter of EU law – that’s natural because it’s prescribed by the EU order. So the ECJ will have the final say in EU law and single market decisions,” said von der Leyen
The Protocol agreement, signed by Boris Johnson in 2020, saw checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain begin taking place at ports in the North to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The DUP has maintained that this is causing Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK and wants the checks removed.
It also called for a change in what it calls the “democratic deficit” of Northern Ireland being subject to EU rules while not having a say on them.
The role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which can settle trade disputes and take action against the UK if it believes that EU law is currently not being respected in Northern Ireland, and is also something the DUP and ERG wanted removed.
In order to ease checks on goods, the UK government wanted to impose a two-lane system for goods entering Northern Ireland, which is now contained in the Windsor Framework.

https://www.thejournal.ie/wetherspoons-beer-supply-chain-issues-5537199-Sep2021/,"PUB CHAIN JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK’s supply chain crunch.
The hospitality giant confirmed that it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries.
Lorry driver and factory staff shortages attributed to Brexit employment rules and the pandemic have impacted supplies at rival firms including McDonald’s, Nando’s and KFC in recent weeks.
Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: “We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available.

“We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue.”
The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers.
Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers.
It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning, and called on the Government to add drivers to the Shortage Occupation List to make it easier for overseas workers to address the shortfall.
Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-trade-cross-border-5606625-Nov2021/,"BRIAN REID FEELS he was well prepared for the disruption.
The chief executive of Deli Lites, a food-to-go manufacturing business based less than two kilometres from the border in Warrenpoint, Co Down, had been preparing for Brexit in some form or another ever since the referendum vote in 2016.
“We did a lot of work early on to weigh up the damage that Brexit could do to us,” he toldThe Journallast week.
For Reid, like many people in the initial wake of the referendum, that meant attending trade fairs, commissioning studies on the potential impact of Brexit-related tariffs, setting up meet-the-buyer events and, ultimately, lining up new suppliers.
“We started a transition at that stage to move some of our supply chains away from sourcing in Great Britain to sourcing on the island of Ireland”,
“We set up a southern subsidiary… that was one of the first things we did.”
But while Deli Lites has always been an all-island business, he said, that’s even more true now than it was this time last year.
“We were probably sourcing maybe 30% of our ingredients and raw materials from GB. That’s nearly down to 10% now. We’ve moved quite a lot of our supply base across,” Reid explained.
Reid’s business is one of the many captured in an arresting set of trade statistics published by the Central Statistics Office last week. They show that in the nine months since the EU28 became the EU27, cross-border trade has boomed and business relationships between companies north and south have flourished.
In the year to September, the value of imports to the Republic from Northern Ireland has grown by a hefty 60% to almost €2.6 billion. Meanwhile, the value of goods moving in the opposite direction has ballooned by almost 50% over the same period last year to €2.8 billion.
What will the long-term impact of this shift be? Is it making a practical case for greater north-south economic integration or even Irish unity?
It’s easy to speculate. But the reality is a lot more complex.
Trade ties
The six million euro question is whether these are permanent shifts or a temporary reaction to the initial wave of uncertainty. And crucially, what’s driving the boom?
These are the kinds of questions that the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), employer’s group Ibec and the ​​UK’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research are hoping to answer through a new project, launched this week.
Dubbed the All-Island Economy research project, the three-year initiative is aimed at improving the quality of research, statistics and economic data available around the Northern Ireland economy, in particular.
“There’s nothing political about this,” ESRI chief executive Alan Barrett was keen to stress to reporters at the launch.
“The focus began with this idea of the all-island economy, but it quickly turned to the question about knowledge of Northern Ireland and the potential value that could emerge if we had a databased statistical model of the macroeconomy,” he said.
“All we’re trying to do in a sense is create or generate for Northern Ireland the type of macroeconomic model that we have in place in the Republic and obviously places like the United Kingdom.”
But it’s difficult to separate the project from the context that Brexit has created. Economic and trade ties between the two jurisdictions as a direct result of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and the Northern Ireland Protocol, which largely safeguards the north’s position within the Single Market.

Because of that, the Protocol has created certain opportunities for Northern Ireland businesses in particular, ESRI Research Professor Martina Lawless toldThe Journal.
“From a very narrow economic standpoint, the Northern Ireland Protocol and this sort of joint membership of two different customs areas could be really good news for the Northern Ireland economy,” she said.
Driving a wedge
For Reid, at least, his company’s shift towards an all-island focus is definitely a permanent one — not least, because it’s a direction his company wanted to travel in anyway.
By sourcing more of its ingredients on the island, Deli Lites “can reduce our food miles and support local and indigenous producers”, Reid said.
But key to understanding the boom in cross border trade in 2021 is that on both sides of the border, the changes have been born of necessity rather than politics or questions of identity, explained Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI.
“It’s like a tap was turned on 1 January as Irish buyers struggled with the new post-Brexit world,” said Kelly.
Because of those fresh complexities and the additional red tape, businesses in the north have also struggled with supply lines from Britain.
One in five NI manufacturers, according to a survey, say their GB suppliers are no longer prepared to send goods to Northern Ireland.
“There’s a whole cohort of Great British businesses going, ‘Do you know what? We can’t be arsed,’” Kelly said.
“Northern Ireland may be a smaller part of their overall business so they’re saying, ‘Why do I need to do this when I don’t need to do this for customers in Leeds or Leicester.’”
That’s certainly been good for the all-island economy but it would be wrong to think of Brexit just in terms of the positives, Kelly believes. Nor does he think it puts the island on a glide path to Irish unity.
In many ways, Brexit has driven a wedge between the two economies, he said.
The Northern Ireland Protocol, for example, is really only designed to prevent the hardening of the border through increased checks on the movement of goods between the two jurisdictions. “The reality of the Protocol is that we’re not in the Single Market,” Kelly said. All the other things that make the single market work isn’t covered by the Protocol.”
That includes the issue of professional qualification recognition. ​​Within the Single Market, British professional qualifications — such as dentistry, midwifery or accountancy — were automatically recognised in other member states.
That effectively ended with Brexit and it isn’t covered by the terms of the Protocol, a significant barrier to those in the services sector who want to work across the border in Ireland.
“So instead of actually a closer alignment of the two economies,” Kelly said, “we’re actually drifting further apart. We’re diverging.”
While the two economies are undoubtedly growing closer, Lawless agrees that booming cross-border trade isn’t going to lead to a united on its own
“The political developments towards a united Ireland are just so far away from better economic relationships,” she said. “The European Union has had 50 years now of increasing economic relationships and political development without anybody ever saying that the individual countries aren’t sovereign national states.
“Apart from the UK.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/fewer-fireworks-ireland-5577493-Oct2021/,"GARDAÍ HAVE SEEN a marked decrease in the amount of illegal fireworks on Irish streets this year while Customs have increased the number of seizures,The Journalhas learned.
The Halloween season normally sees large quantities of fireworks going off across Irish towns and cities from September onwards.
However supply chain issues in the UK due to Brexit and the global supply crunch means that stocks there are down by as much as 70%, which has led to fewer being made available for purchase in Ireland illegally.
A garda spokesperson toldThe Journalthat figures have yet to be compiled but this year’s seizures are expected to be down ‘a lot’ on last year.
“There is some evidence that there are less of them – the reason for that is hard to say but there has been a lot less,” he said.
Operational sources have said, anecdotally, that there are less calls and less seizures than in previous years.
Sources in Kerry, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick all said that there has been a decrease in the use of fireworks compared to previous years.
“There is definitely less than in previous years – there are still complaints coming in for them being set off but there are less seizures.
“They are normally sold by people at car boot sales, market stalls, that kind of thing but also just straight from a house.
“The gardaí hear about these places and go and execute warrants – but there isn’t as much of that going on this year and that is a sign that they are not as prevalent,” a senior source said.
The possession of fireworks is illegal in Ireland and they can only be imported into the State with a licence.
Sources have said that organised criminals have been involved in the importation of fireworks via Northern Ireland but added that it is much more likely that individual people travel to the North to buy them.
The shortage of fireworks, according to an investigation byThe Guardian,can be blamed on Brexit and the global supply chain crisis.
It has been reported that importation problems have forced up prices and reduced stocks by up to 70% in the UK.
Changes to paperwork in the UK due to Brexit has caused a shortfall, according to British-based distributor Fireworks Kingdom.
Richard Hogg told The Guardian: “Importing fireworks has become very difficult and unstable in the wake of Brexit. Our industry is being hit particularly hard, receiving just 30% of the usual annual supply.”
The main issue centres around the switch from the Europe-wide CE safety label to a UKCA mark which will come into effect in 2023 – this has halted wholesalers stocking up on products that will not have the required label.
Customs
A Customs spokesperson said that the organisation has seen a marked increase in seizures of fireworks.

“In relation to seizures of fireworks, I can confirm that, since 1 January 2021, a total of 11 consignments of fireworks have been seized by Revenue officers. For comparison purposes, in 2020, a total of 3 consignments of fireworks were seized.
“The consignments seized arrived into Ireland either via the postal system or via one of our trade ports. As you will appreciate, Revenue statistics are compiled in response to our business needs and having regard to the information available to us.
“No further firework related statistics are compiled in the normal course and therefore no additional information other than the statistics above are available,” the spokesperson said.
The Customs spokesperson said that officers had changed their detection methods as smugglers changed their methods during the pandemic.
“Over the course of the past 18 months the Covid-19 global pandemic has impacted the economy and the movement of people.
“For example, we have seen an increase in online shopping worldwide, non-essential travel was not permitted for many months and non-essential retail premises were closed for extended periods.
“It is also too early to provide an accurate analysis of the impact of Brexit on imported goods, especially when considering the particular increases in postal and shipped items caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the spokesperson said.
Operation Tombola

A garda spokesperson said that they have reignited Operation Tombola – their annual nationwide initiative to deal with anti-social behaviour problems and fireworks arising from the Halloween period.
The spokesperson said that data will be collated following the Halloween period and released to the public at that time.
They also warned of the risk of injury from fireworks, as well as the ‘great distress and annoyance’ they can cause to older people.
“Each year, many people, including children, suffer terrible injuries caused by fireworks, including burns, loss of limbs and serious eye injuries,” the spokesperson said.
“The sale, possession or use of fireworks in this country is illegal. It is also illegal to possess any fireworks that may have been legally purchased outside of the jurisdiction and then brought into the State and Gardaí will confiscate any fireworks found in the possession of persons and such persons are also liable to prosecution.
The issue has been mentioned in the Dáil, with An Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Justice Heather Humphreys both vowing to deal with the anti-social behaviour problem.
“I am aware of the distressing impact the improper use of fireworks has on our communities and I share the concerns of the Deputies and of the local communities affected,” Humphreys said.
“I know the fear and distress fireworks being set off causes our elderly family members and neighbours and people with sensory challenges and other vulnerabilities. They also have a terrible impact on pets and other animals and livestock.”
The Taoiseach, in his comments in the Dáil in response to a question from Deputy Sean Haughey, said that he recalled the enjoyment of bonfires in years gone by but said that times have changed.
“I would like to think we have moved on from that era because bonfires are pollutants.
“They are dangerous as well, when one considers what is thrown into them today. Anti-social behaviour should be stamped out. We will work with the Garda and the authorities on the matter of illegal fireworks. That is a fair point. We want that time of year for children to enjoy,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-australia-trade-brexit-5470763-Jun2021/,"IT’S BEEN A top priority for Brexiteers for some time but this week, Downing Street finally announced the broad terms of a new trade agreement between the UK and Australia.
After a year at the negotiating table, the proposed deal is aimed at removing arguably already modest trade barriers between the two countries.
The deal hasn’t actually been signed, sealed and delivered just yet but the reasons for the timing of the announcement this week are obvious.
Six months on from the end of the Brexit withdrawal period, the UK government “needs to keep up the momentum to show that Brexit is a success”, says trade expert David Henig, UK Director at the European Centre For International Political Economy.
Sovereignty over trade policy was, of course, a major selling point for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.
From Boris Johnson’s perspective, Henig says, “You then need a flow of deals coming in.
“So the deal is politically significant. Economically, less so.”
The numbers seem to bear that out. Based on some estimates, the free trade agreement will add a modest 0.02% to UK gross domestic product within 15 years.
So what are the major points of the deal and who will reap the benefits? Let’s take a look.
Perhaps the key element of the deal — and certainly the most controversial on the other side of the Irish Sea — is how generous it appears to be towards Australian farmers.
In principle, the deal commits to the “full liberalisation” of Australian goods entering Britain.
Australian winemakers, sugar cane growers and dairy farmers will all benefit.
But most significant are the ample quotas the deal provides for Australian meat producers for the shipment of tariff-free beef and lamb to the UK.
Those quotas will rise from 35,000 and 25,000 tonnes for beef and lamb respectively at the outset to 110,000 and 75,000 tonnes by year 10 of the deal.
Caps will disappear altogether after 15 years, allowing for the free flow of Australian agricultural produce into the UK market.
British farmers are expressing deep concern about this element of the deal, particularly given the fact that animal welfare and food safety standards are lower in Australia.

Because they are held to completely different welfare and environmental standardsAnd have a whole post colonial landscape to scale up onpic.twitter.com/aJG3xxucKt
This means, in theory, that Australian farmers can produce meat at a much lower cost, making them much more competitive within the UK market.
“It’s hard, always to get a sense of how much is a justified concern and how much is straight protectionism,” Henig says.
“There is an element of both.”
Post-Brexit, he says that UK farmers are nervous “about the fact there’s going to be a lot of trade deals that offer free access without conditions.

“Australia might not, in fact, send us that much meat or they might,” Henig explains. For context, Australia shipped just 7,788 tonnes to the UK in 2019, far below the initial 25,000-tonne quota.
But the concern for UK farmers is whether similar deals will be put in place with New Zealand and other countries.
Henig says, “Part of this is also about a longer-term conversation between UK farmers and the government. They want to make it clear that they’re unhappy so that the government has to think again about other trade deals.”
Key to understanding the agreement, Henig argues, is that for the government, it’s less about the economic benefit to the UK and more about the optics of it in the post-Brexit landscape.
In a nutshell, “the deal is very generous agriculture quotas in return for a photo opportunity for Boris Johnson”, he says.
That’s exactly what he got on Tuesday when he posed for snaps with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison with both leaders exchanging packets of biscuits from their respective countries.
But the UK negotiators did manage to wring a few concessions from their Australian counterparts on behalf of British exporters.
For one, the deal removes tariffs of up to 5% on £4.3 billion worth of UK goods travelling to Australia.
These include biscuits, Scotch whiskey and cars made in Britain.
“So there should be a little bit extra, certainly for whiskey. It’s not clear that we will send any more cars anyway because of the nature of that trade,” Henig says.
But rather than tariffs, the main barrier to trade between the UK and Australia is and always has been how far apart the two countries are in a geographic sense, he explains.
“So there’ll be a few processed food products that get slightly cheaper tariffs. But the tariffs weren’t that high in Australia to start with.”
Although it’s characterised by a number of “small, incremental improvements” rather than anything earth-shattering, there are some “nice-looking commitments” in the agreement for the UK services sector and for workers, Henig says.
According to the text of the agreement in principle, the two countries have agreed that “UK and Australian lawyers can practise in the other country’s territory using their original qualifications and title”.
Somebarriers will still exist, according to the Law Society of England and Wales.
But I. Stephanie Boyce, President of the Law Society, said this week that she would “would welcome a clear framework for regulatory dialogue” in the final trade deal to “further this cooperation” between the two nations.
Under the agreement, British citizens under the age of 35 will be able to stay in Australia for up to three years without having to undertake certain, specified types of work.
The deal also commits the two countries to “outlining visa pathways to facilitate mobility for those involved in agricultural work”.
Most of these details aren’t “going to make a huge economic difference” for British citizens, Henig says.
On the contrary, the agreement is more about the political message it sends than anything.
“I think it says [the government] sees getting the trade deal itself as being a win,” Henig believes.
“It says, ‘We’re not overly worried about the content. We’re not going to sweat the details too much.’
“That might not be the worst thing in the world because in some ways, you get the agreement and you can work from there to address some of the key issues… But there will be more pressure now to change it; to try to get better and better deals and better outcomes.”

REVELATIONS ABOUT THE British Government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, as recalled by aide Dominic Cummings, feature on the front of many of today’s papers.
His marathon seven-hour session of evidence to MPsgave the press plenty to write about, some calling it a “rain of fire”, others a “Domshell”.
They included suggestions Government failings lead to tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily, through to Cummings saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of Prime Minister.
The Times carries a sketch from Quentin Letts on its front page in which he refers to the session as “longer and bloodier than Hamlet”.

Dominic Cummings has branded Boris Johnson unfit to be prime minister and accused him of being responsible for tens of thousands of needless deaths from coronavirus.He called Johnson’s approach “completely mad”.https://t.co/OzvVdlrJtB
He writes: “Mark Sedwill, the former cabinet secretary, took a pyroclastic boulder smack in the face.
“The Department of Health was left smoking like Ground Zero. Carrie Symonds was ‘crackers’ and ‘desperate to get rid of me’.
“Even Dilyn the dog came up in dispatches and may well now have to give evidence to the official Covid inquiry. Only in England could a major health dingdong include a cameo for a Jack Russell. Barking.”
The Guardian, the Independent, i and Daily Mirror all use the same quote headline: “Tens of thousands died who didn’t need to die”, with the latter carrying a leader column headlined “damning testimony”.

The paper points out the problem of only hearing one side of the story, but that the Government “failed in this fundamental duty”.
It says: “Cummings’ evidence may have been onesided and selective but it should not be ignored. His criticisms of the Government’s handling of Covid demand an explanation.
“The coward Johnson is trying to hide from accountability by delaying the public inquiry into Covid until next spring. We need to learn lessons now, not at his convenience.”

The Daily Telegraph takes a different angle, suggesting an element of revenge from Mr Cummings with associate editor Camilla Tominey writing “having expended his nine lives in government, this was also about settling scores”.
The Sun’s headline – “Do you need a hindsight test, Mr Cummings?” – pokes fun at his well-publicised trip to Barnard Castle during the pandemic, while its leader column claims Johnson will “dodge Dom’s bombs”.

It adds people “recognise that our Government was one of many whose Covid response was found wanting.
“The key difference since being the stellar success of our world-leading vaccine rollout.
“Voters are more likely to credit the Government with that and our rosier future than rake over the terrible bleakness of 2020 and the chaos in Downing Street.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/britian-only-major-economy-recession-2023-imf-5983626-Jan2023/,"LAST UPDATE|31 Jan 2023
THE UK IS set to be the only economy in the G7 to experience a recession this year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In a quarterly update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast that the British economy will contract by 0.6% this year, 0.9 percentage points worse than its previous forecast last October.
The fund said the forecast reflected “tighter fiscal and monetary policies and financial conditions and still-high energy retail prices weighing on household budgets” in the UK.
It puts the UK in a worse position than its G7 counterparts and makes it the only country across advanced and major emerging economies expected by the IMF to suffer a year of declining GDP.
Even Russia, which is under pressure from a raft of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, is predicted by the fund to see a growth of 0.3% this year.
Among the other G7 nations, the IMF’s predictions show growth of 1.4% in the United States, 0.1% in Germany, 0.7% in France, 0.6% in Italy, 1.8% in Japan and 1.5% in Canada.
The IMF also said it believes inflation has passed its peak and is expected to fall from 8.8% last year to 6.6% this year. However, it warned that rising prices and the impacts of actions taken to curb inflation would continue to weigh on the economy.
“Consumer confidence and business sentiment have worsened. With inflation at about 10 percent or above in several euro area countries and the United Kingdom, household budgets remain stretched,” it said.
“The accelerated pace of rate increases by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is tightening financial conditions and cooling demand in the housing sector and beyond.”
Chief economist for the IMF, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, explained there were three key factors driving the UK’s economic outlook.
“First, there is exposure to natural gas… we’ve had a very sharp increase in energy prices in the UK,” Gourinchas said. “There is a larger share of energy that is coming from natural gas, with a higher pass-through to final consumers.

“The UK’s employment levels have also not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This is a situation where you have a very, very tight labour market but you have an economy that has not re-absorbed into employment as many people as it had before. That means there is less output, less production.
“The third is that there is a very sharp monetary tightening because inflation has been very elevated, that’s a side effect of this high pass-through of energy prices.”
However, the IMF did upgrade its outlook for UK growth in 2024 to 0.9%, up from the 0.6% expansion previously forecast.
In a statement this afternoon, British Chancellor Jeremy Hunt stressed many forecasts were overly-pessimistic about the UK economy last year.
“Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects – the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years,” he said.
It follows efforts by Hunt last week to talk up the UK economy and its growth prospects in his first major speech in the post, declaring that “declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today”.
The UK is currently experiencing a raft of public sector strikes over pay, with inflation still standing at more than 10% in the country.
It comes after a period of instability in the country, which saw three prime ministers last year.
Last September, a £43 million mini-budget unveiled by Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last September which sent markets into turmoil and caused the Bank of England to step in.
Kwarteng wassubsequently sacked, and Truss resigned after 44 days in office.
In November, newly-appointed chancellor Huntannounced a wave of tax hikes and spending cutsin his autumn statement and declared that the UK’s economy was in recession, adding that the measures were needed to bring financial stability.
Exactly three years since the UK left the European Union, the impact of Brexit has also had a negative impact on the country’s economy and created political instability in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/liz-truss-scrap-parts-northern-ireland-protocol-next-week-5759265-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|10 May 2022
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has urged UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to take any “unilateral actions” in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol amid reports that the British government is planning on doing just that.
Martin and Johnson held an “extensive discussion” by phone this morning, with Downing Street saying following their conversation the Protocol situation is  “now very serious”.
The context for their conversation is Northern Ireland’s Assembly elections last week which saw the DUP lose their position as the largest party and replaced by Sinn Féin.
A majority of the MLAs elected to the Assembly do not favour a scrapping of the Protocol but the DUP is refusing to consider joining an Executive unless there is “decisive action” on the Protocol.
The Protocol is a post-Brexit mechanism agreed between the UK and EU that allows Northern Ireland to effectively remain part of the EU’s single market for goods while also being part of the UK’s customs territory.
To maintain EU standards within the single market, some checks are required on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, something which is strongly objected to by unionists politicians in Northern Ireland.
Earlier today it emerged that British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will reportedly move to discard large portions of the Protocol after giving up on Brexit negotiations with the EU.
TheLondon Times reported officials workingfor Truss have drawn up draft legislation to unilaterally remove the need for checks on all goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland. The paper said the legislation could be enacted as soon as next week.
The law would also ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are able to disregard EU rules and regulations and remove the power of the European Court of Justice to rule on issues relating to the region, the paper said.
Importantly, the bill would override the Protocol agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2019 and mean the UK had breached its obligations under the Brexit agreement.
The Times said Truss is understood to have concluded talks with the EU and has been told the proposed bill could lead to a trade war with the bloc.
In a statement from the Department of An Taoiseach this afternoon, the department said that Martin urged Johnson to engage in “intensified EU-UK discussions” to address issues relating to the Protocol.
“He set out clearly his serious concerns at any unilateral action at this time, which would be destabilising in Northern Ireland and erode trust,” the statement said.
Martin and Johnson were said to be in agreement that “a strong functioning Executive” should be put in place in Northern Ireland, with the Taoiseach emphasising the importance of both governments “working together in support of the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement”.
A Downing Street account of the call also outlined that the two leaders agreed on the vital importance of restoring the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.
Johnson was said to have made clear that the situation in respect of the protocol was now very serious. He reiterated that the UK Government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found

He also said that the balance of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement was being undermined and the recent elections had further demonstrated that the Protocol was not sustainable in its current form.
“Despite repeated efforts by the UK Government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.
“The Prime Minister reiterated that the UK Government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found.”
Johnson has said he does not plan to be personally involved in the Northern Ireland talks, while Downing Street played down the reported Cabinet rift over the protocol.
Asked about the Government’s position on the protocol and whether there are divisions within Cabinet over proposals to unilaterally scrap it, Johnson’s official spokesman said:
“I wouldn’t say that at all.
“No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. The Deputy Prime Minister made clear the situation, it’s very serious.”
He insisted the proposals put forward by the European Commission “don’t go anywhere near far enough to make the protocol sustainable”, adding: “We believe (they) would take us backwards from where we are today. So no decisions have been taken. But we do reserve the right to take action.”
Speaking this afternoon on RTÉ’s News at One, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said that the Irish government will take part in efforts to return devolved institutions in Northern Ireland
“We’re co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, so we’ll do that,” he said.
“As you know, matters internal to Northern Ireland are considered Strand One issues and they’re issues between the parties and only between the parties, but issues such as the Protocol, such as relations with the EU, such as reforming the system of government in Northern Ireland, they are beyond the Executive and the Assembly.
“So yes, of course, we’re going to be available to be involved in any talks on the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland.”
The Vice-President of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic released a statement this evening in which he called the Protocol an integral part of the EU’s stable relationship with the UK.
“The EU has been open to joint work with the UK on implementing the Protocol to bring long-term legal certainty to the people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  The EU remains open to such discussions.
Only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action by the UK would only make our work on possible solutions more difficult.”
“The Protocol, as a cornerstone of the Withdrawal Agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position,” his statement concluded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/slim-majority-voting-rights-president-election-citizens-northern-ireland-abroad-5368731-Mar2021/,"THE MINISTER OF State for electoral reform has said that its his preference to hold a “stand-alone” referendum on extending the right to vote in presidential elections to Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland and abroad.
It comes as a poll has indicated that there is a slim majority in favour of extending that right to Irish-passport holders in Northern Ireland and the UK, and an even slimmer majority in favour of extending it for all Irish-passport holders living abroad.
The government has committed to holding a referendum on extending voting rights in presidential elections to all Irish citizens before 2025. The next presidential election will be held in the autumn of 2025.
At a major event about the voting rights Irish citizens should have, Minister of State for Heritage and Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan said that the plan would be to hold the referendum on the diaspora’s right to vote in late 2022 or early 2023.
Noonan said he was aiming to set up an independent Electoral Commission before the end of the year that would examine these issues, as well as other electoral reform issues such as regulating political ads and modernising the Electoral Register.

""We believe you are Irish wherever you are"", says@SenBillyLawless- as he speaks of Ireland's need to catch up on giving voting rights to citizens abroad.
The minister said that he would “certainly” explore lowering the voting age from 18 to 16, “at least for local elections”, while admitting that there appeared to be a “strong majority” against that move.
“We look at the Fridays for Future – young people want to have a say in their electoral processes,” he told the online event. “I would love for the Commission to explore that possibility for the 2024 local elections.”
A poll released today by Ireland Thinks, and carried out on behalf of the campaigning group VotingRights.ie and the UCD Clinton Institute, found that a slim majority of 56% of people support extending the vote to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK with 39% against, while 52% of people support extending the vote to all Irish citizens abroad.
A significant majority believed that the voting age shouldn’t be lowered to 16 (66%).

The poll was conducted by Ireland Thinks between 20-24 February with a sample of 1,131 people drawn from a nationally representative panel and weighted according to age, gender, past vote, educational attainment, housing tenure and political interest.
Respondents were also asked about whether there should be designated seats in the Seanad to represent people in Northern Ireland or those living abroad, and about the timeframe after which their voting rights should be retained (it’s currently 18 months).
Analysis of the poll results indicate that younger voters are more likely to support extending voting rights to the diaspora, while older voters are more likely to be against it.
The results indicated an overall majority in favour of extending the length Irish emigrants keep their right to vote.
Ireland ThinksIreland Thinks
Minister of State Noonan said that although the Commission being set up was the main objective, it also needed an “ambitious agenda” of reforms to carry out.
Holding a referendum on the right to housing and a referendum on water, as well as a referendum on extending the right to vote in presidential elections, are in the Programme for Government.
When asked about whether another referendum question would be asked along with the voting rights for the diaspora, Noonan said that he wasn’t “terribly keen” on that idea.
“My preference would be to hold a stand alone referendum on this, you could muddy the waters, and could end up having a significant emphasis on one referendum over another, which, given where the figures are at present I don’t think that’s going to be good for the outcome of this referendum. I want it to be a standalone referendum.”
Despite the majority of countries offering their passport-holders abroad a right to vote, Ireland has limited its rights to its passport holders both in Northern Ireland and abroad.
Among the concerns that there may be with extending the right to vote to the Irish diaspora is how it would influence the outcome of elections – despite diasporas of other countries having small turnouts during their elections.
Senator Michael McDowell said at the event that the polling released today confirmed that an “awful lot of campaigning needed to be done” to confirm a Yes vote. “It’s not a shoo-in as a proposal, and would need a lot of political salesmanship,” he said.

IRISH OFFICIALS ARE not expecting the European Commission to be “bounced” into a response to UK plans to dispose with some aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The response from Brussels to yesterday’s speech by British Foreign Secretary has been best described as a “wait and see approach” despite exasperation at the UK’s decision.
Speakingyesterday in the House of Commons, Secretary Liz Truss said that the Conservative government plans to “introduce legislation to make changes to the Protocol.”
The move by the UK to unilaterally change an international treaty, the Withdrawal Agreement, has caused dismay across the EU.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar saidtoday it caused particular “puzzlement”across European capitals at a time when the UK was seeking to defend international norms in the case of Ukraine.
Speaking yesterday, European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic criticised Truss’ plan and left open the option that Brussels could retaliate.
Should the UK proceed with the Bill, the EU will respond with“all measures at its disposal”, he said.
Despite this, Irish officials working on this country’s response to Brexit have reiterated that what they are expecting is a “calm and measured approach” from the European Commission in the coming weeks.
Instead, it is hoped that both sides could return to more talks but some officials have cited concerns in Brussels that UK priorities “have changed”.
At tonight’s parliamentary party meeting, An Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told colleagues Brexit is not a passing storm.

The Fine Gael leader said Brexit is more like political climate change and a permanent change in relations between Ireland and the UK and also between the EU and the UK. It will go on forever and will never just be “done”.
He said Ireland had been threatened before by the UK but Ireland and Europe faced down these threats.
Varadkar said we are dealing with a London Government that we are struggling to trust as evidenced by what has happened since the Withdrawal Agreement was made.
The Tánaiste advised colleagues that efforts would be redoubled to get to a landing zone on the protocol but that it needed to be a stable one.
Truss has said she wants the EU to “come to the negotiating table” so a “pragmatic solution” can be agreed together.
“But if that doesn’t happen we do need to move ahead delivering this solution for the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.
The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK following Brexit and was designed as a way preventing the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The Protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU Single Market for goods but also keeps Northern Ireland in the UK’s Customs territory.
While the unique arrangement offers potential advantages for NI businesses to operate in both territories, unionists have criticised it because it has required some checks to be carried out on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Some of the particular criticism has been made in terms of food items, with suggestions from unionist politicians that food going to supermarkets in Northern Ireland should be free of all checks.
The UK has not yet published the detail of the legislation to alter the Protocol but it is understood that the government is planning unilateral action to introduce separate “green” and “red” lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The different lanes would draw a distinction between goods destined to stay within the UK and those heading to the Republic of Ireland and beyond.
There will be no crossover between the channels, it is understood, with goods filtering through one or the other, depending on their intended destination.

Asked about such a system this morning, Varadkar said that it made be “a possibility” but he added that there are also “risks” to that proposal.
“On the up side, it would allow more products going to Northern Ireland from Britain without any checks and I think that would help resolve some of the objections from the unionist community, but there is a risk, of course, of products going south. That’s something we’d have to bear in mind,” he said.
Referencing chlorinated chicken from Thailand or beef from Brazil being imported to the UK, Varadkar continued: “Is this something that the Ulster Farmers’ Union actually wants, is this something that the DUP actually wants, could this be a repeat of the Brexit moment where people in Northern Ireland who wanted Brexit maybe didn’t understand what the consequences were.”
Good Friday Agreement
Truss has sought to defend the UK’s planned unilateral action in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, somethingwhich has angered the Irish side in particular.
Truss has claimed that “the situation is very severe” and that she would table the legislation within weeks.
“The Executive hasn’t been formed since February. And we’re only going to be able to get it back up and running, to get the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement working again, by delivering this solution,” she told Times Radio today.
It wasrevealed last week that a delegationof influential US congress representatives is set to fly to Europe amid growing concern in the White House about spiralling tensions over the Protocol.
It is expected that the delegation will travel to Northern Ireland to get a sense of the issues on the ground as well as travelling to Brussels to reaffirm US support for the Protocol.

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has spoken about the growing tension between the EU and the UK over Brexit to an influential group of US Congress members.
Coveney and EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic spoke to the Friends of Ireland caucus yesterday, including its chairman, Congressman Richard Neal.
The group discussed Northern Ireland and concerns around the UK’s extension of post-Brexit grace periods.
The engagement came as it emerged the UK Government is to deploy a senior official to Washington amid concerns that the Biden administration is only hearing one side of the story on Brexit.
The Northern Ireland Office official, who will be based in the British Embassy in the US capital, will engage with the administration and other influential politicians.
The initiative, which was reported by the Daily Telegraph, is being seen as an effort to counter US briefings from the EU/Irish side that are critical of the UK’s stance on the Brexit deal and its recent actions to delay implementation of new Irish Sea trade arrangements.
Before he was elected, US President Joe Biden, who has strong ancestral links to Ireland, made clear that a US/UK trade deal would be dependent on Brexit not undermining the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
Ireland and the EU insist that the Agreement will be undermined if the Northern Ireland Protocol is not implemented.
The UK Government announced last week that it was unilaterally extending a series of grace periods, which limit protocol red tape, to allow businesses in Northern Ireland more time to adapt to the new rules.
The European Union is set to launch legal action against the UK this week.

Coveney said he and Sefcovic told the group of tensions around the Northern Ireland Protocol as well as the “divisions and polarisation” of politics in Northern Ireland.
He added it has caused a strain on the relationship between the EU and the British Government.
Coveney told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland today: “We talked for about an hour-and-a-half about the protocol, its implementation, the tensions around that, the mistakes that have been made by both sides.
“The need to try to re-engage in discussion, because without finding a way forward through dialogue, which of course has to be the preference for everybody, then Maros Sefcovic outlined that the EU side really has no option but to take legal action, which will begin this week.”
Coveney said politics is “very strained” in Northern Ireland because of perceptions around the protocol and its implementation.
“My job is to ensure that what has been agreed, as a mechanism to deal with the disruption that Brexit causes on the island of Ireland, which is the protocol, is part of an international treaty, as part of international law,” Coveney added.
“Last December, Maros Sefcovic and Michael Gove, who is a very senior person in the British Government, agreed an implementation plan and an approach to implement the protocol, and we are simply saying that we need to ensure that that happens now.
“Of course, the EU has been considering and will consider further if flexibilities need to be accommodated, if there are genuine problems in terms of implementation, how we solve them.
“But that has got to be done collectively between the EU and the UK.
“We cannot move forward on the basis of one side just deciding unilaterally ‘Well, this is what must be done and we can’t wait for the other sides to agree with us’, and that’s essentially what the British Government has done.”
Coveney said the European Commission feels it has no option but to take legal action to the European Court of Justice.
However, he said he believes other avenues should be explored to resolve the issues.
“The way to manage relationships between unionist leadership and the Government here in Dublin is not through legal challenges, it’s through working together and collaboration,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-prevents-medical-students-northern-ireland-5659563-Jan2022/,"MEDICAL STUDENTS IN universities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain cannot apply for internships in Irish hospitals due to Brexit – an anomaly that the Department of Health is hoping to fix by the end of the year.
The situation means that that there are students from Ireland who are studying in universities in Northern Ireland who will not be able to apply for internships in the Irish healthcare service, as the rules stand now.
Medical students who wish to work within the Irish health service after graduating need to apply for internships within the healthcare system in their final year or after they graduate in order to gain the required Certificate of Experience.
However, those applying for these internships must be a graduate or a final year student of a medical school from a specific list of countries.
These include Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Iceland or the RCSI and UCD Malaysia Campus.
Although last year Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom were listed as jurisdictions from which you could apply, this year both have been removed from the list.
HSEHSE
A first-year student from Dublin who is studying at Ulster University toldThe Journal: “It will affect any students who may have graduated last year from Queen’s [University], but also may affect the applications of students applying from the Republic of Ireland.
“I applied to study in Northern Ireland on the basis that I would have no issues in Ireland. They need to get that changed fast,” she said.

Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris visited Ulster University’s Magee Campus and its newly opened medical school in December;he said on Twitterthat there was a “need to work together in the North West to enhance access to education and development of research and campuses”.
In response to a query fromThe Journal, the Department of Health said in a statement: “Eligibility for access to medical intern training posts is set out in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.
“Significant progress has been made and the Minister [for Health Stephen Donnelly] will soon be seeking Government approval to draft the legislation necessary to amend the Medical Practitioners Act. It is expected that this will be enacted later this year.”
In a statement toThe Journal, the Medical Council said that in order to apply for an intern post, a doctor must be eligible to apply for internship registration and that internships can be granted to doctors who have completed their medical studies either here in Ireland or an EU member state.
The Medical Council said that “since the UK has left the European Union, it is considered a third country and graduates of medical schools there no longer fulfill the requirement set out in section 49 to have completed their medical degree in an EU member state, for the purpose of applying for internship registration”.
An EU directiveon professional qualifications allowed EU and UK to recognise professional qualifications in each other’s jurisdictions, including health qualifications. This directive no longer applies to the UK, with exceptions made for professionals already recognised by authorities before 31 December 2020.
In April last year, Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris said that a working group was set up in late 2019, chaired by an official from his Department to ask ask several departments to be sure that its regulators put processes in place to ensure that Irish and UK professionals could continue to have their qualifications recognised.
Irish and UK regulators adopted varying approaches based on what worked best, he said.
“Some, like engineers for example, put a memorandum of understanding in place while others such as the Teaching Council and Medical Council adjusted their third country qualification recognition policies… It was not possible to do everything by administrative arrangements. It required legislative change in some areas.”
When the Department of Higher Education was contacted, it advised that this was a matter for the Department of Health.
A statement from the Medical Council was added to this article at 8.30am on 24 January.

THE EU HAS taken a “very belligerent approach” to the difficulties caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol post-Brexit, the DUP leader said.
Arlene Foster also said “something had to give”, and the UK had to take action and extend a grace period limiting red tape associated with the movement of goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.
The First Minister added she was “not entirely surprised” by the EU’s threat to take legal action over the matter.
Earlier today, the EU warned that it will launch legal action “very soon” following the move by the UK to unilaterally delay implementation of part of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Foster said: “They have taken a very belligerent approach to the difficulties the protocol have caused for Northern Ireland.
“It was quite clear to me that there wasn’t going to be a meeting of minds. So the UK Government was going to have to take action, given that the grace period for goods in terms of supermarkets ended at the end of this month.”
Foster said: “The number of checks that are occurring between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are so disproportionate to the risk to the EU single market that it has become completely out of step with what the protocol was meant to do.”
“The protocol was meant to do two things. It was meant to protect the single market of the European Union, and it was meant to protect the Belfast agreement, and frankly, it is disproportionately doing one and damaging the other.”

Legal action
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said the announcement by the British Government on Wednesday had come as a “very negative surprise”.
The Cabinet Office Minister David Frost said the UK was extending a series of “grace periods” designed to ease trade between Northern Ireland – which remains in the EU single market for goods – and Great Britain while permanent arrangements are worked out.
It provoked a furious response in Brussels, with the EU accusing Britain of going back on its treaty obligations in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Sefcovic – who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the agreement – said the European Commission was now working on “infringement proceedings” against the UK.
“We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon. The most precise term I can give you is really very soon,” he said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has downplayed the disputeHouse of CommonsHouse of Commons
His warning came after Boris Johnson had sought to play down the dispute, saying the British Government was simply taking some “temporary and technical measures” to ensure that trade kept flowing.
“I’m sure with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable,” he said yesterday.
However MEPs in the European Parliament have already taken steps to delay formal ratification of the wider trade and co-operation agreement between Britain and the EU pending the outcome of the latest row.
The Northern Ireland protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement was designed by the EU and UK to avoid a hardening of the border on the island of Ireland.
It means keeping Northern Ireland aligned to various EU rules, requiring checks on goods arriving into the region from Great Britain.

Ireland yesterday criticised the UK’s decision to unilaterally extend the grace period, with Taoiseach Micheál Martin saying he was “disappointed” by the decision”.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that it “clearly undermines” previous commitments given last week.
In a statement yesterday evening, Martin said: “I am disappointed that the British Government has today announced unilateral action relating to the Protocol. Issues relating to the Protocol should be resolved by the UK and EU working together, through the Joint Committee.
“We have worked continuously in support of efforts to find sensible means of implementing the Protocol that respond to challenges identified. We will continue to do so, but unilateral action undermines the trust necessary to reach agreement.
“I call on the British Government to engage urgently with the European Commission, and to work towards agreed outcomes.”
Meanwhile the White House has again stressed the support of new US President Joe Biden for the Good Friday Agreement which the protocol is intended to protect.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said: “President Biden has been unequivocal about his support for the Good Friday Agreement.
“It has been the bedrock of peace, stability and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland.”
Prior to last year’s election, Biden – who is intensely proud of his Irish roots – warned the agreement must not become a casualty of Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/two-youths-arrested-belfast-disorder-protocol-5591639-Nov2021/,"TWO YOUTHS HAVE been arrested following “disgraceful” disorder in Belfast after a rally against the Brexit protocol.
The disorder came on Lanark Way in the loyalist Shankill Road area, there was also disorder on the nationalist Springfield Road side of the peace wall.
Two males, aged 12 and 15 years, were arrested on suspicion of riotous behaviour and have since been released on bail as police enquiries continue.
Police said officers were deployed in both areas from around 5pm.
A PSNI spokesman said a small protest on Lanark Way obstructed the road for a period of time, disorder then broke out involving both sides of the community and continued for several hours with items being burnt on the roads as missiles were thrown at police officers and their vehicles.
He said it was “extremely fortunate” that there were no reports of injuries to members of the public and police officers,
“A number of police vehicles were damaged by masonry attacks. Calm was restored to the area by around 10.30pm,” he said.
Chief Inspector Darren Fox described the scenes as “totally unacceptable behaviour”.
“The disgraceful scenes of disorder seen this evening put members of the public and the responding police officers in real danger and must be condemned by all,” he said.
“The totally unacceptable behaviour by those intent on trouble caused significant inconvenience to the local community and only served to heighten community tensions across the area.
“I would like to thank local community representatives and youth workers for their influence and assistance in preventing further disorder.
“I would appeal for those involved in disorder to consider the choices they make in coming out onto the streets to attack police, property and their own communities.”
Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan condemned those who organised the anti-protocol protest.

Police officers in riot gear by their vehicles near to the Loyalist Shankill Road during a protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“I condemn the trouble on the Springfield Road and on Lanark Way this evening,” he said.
“There is absolutely no place in our society for this needless violence and local residents deserve to live in peace.
“Tonight’s trouble is a direct consequence of the dangerous and irresponsible stunt organised by loyalists at the Lanark Way interface this evening.
“This so-called anti-Protocol protest was deliberately organised at this interface with the sole intention of heightening tensions and causing trouble.
“I am calling on political unionism to show some leadership and call for an immediate end to all protests at interface areas before someone is seriously injured and they should tone down the provocative and dishonest rhetoric.”
SDLP West Belfast representative Paul Doherty called for a permanent end to disorder at interface areas in the community.
“The scenes in west Belfast this evening have been highly regrettable. I went to the area to appeal to our young people not to engage in anti-social and dangerous behaviour that does nothing but cause misery to the long-suffering people of this community and put their own future at risk,” he said.
“There can be no excuse for attacking police officers who are doing their best to keep the community safe. The young people taking part in these incidents are likely to end up with a criminal record or worse and I would urge them to think twice before they act.
“The violence on the streets of west Belfast this evening has little to do with Brexit. It’s about communities that have been abandoned and led astray by their politicians. Our young people are frustrated because of the high levels of poverty, unemployment and educational underachievement in these areas and this is what we need to be focusing on tackling.”
Serious disorder erupted in the Lanark Way in April, which was partly attributed to Loyalist anger at a trade border in the Irish Sea under the Protocol’s post-Brexit arrangements.
Earlier this week, a bus was burnt out in Newtownards in an attack politicians linked to loyalist opposition to the protocol.
The attack in the predominantly unionist area happened on the day set by the DUP earlier in the autumn to pull down the institutions at Stormont if major changes to the protocol had not been secured.
It was condemned by unionist leaders.
The DUP has not yet withdrawn ministers from the Executive, insisting progress is being made in efforts to dismantle the contentious Irish Sea border.
Opposition to the arrangements that have created trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was a factor behind rioting that flared in several loyalist areas across the region in April.","7.33am, 4 Nov 2021",

The UK prime minister stressed her trade priority is striking agreements with India and the Gulf states, and joining a trade pact with nations including Australia and Japan.
But she heavily downplayed the chances of talks even resuming to get the comprehensive deal with the States that was billed by Brexit backers as a major benefit of leaving the EU during the referendum.
Truss, a former Brexit opponent who has switched to becoming a supporter, said the deals with Delhi and other allies are “our trade priorities” ahead of talks with the US president at a United Nations summit tomorrow.
“There aren’t currently any negotiations taking place with the US and I don’t have an expectation that those are going to start in the short to medium term,” she told reporters flying with her to New York.
Officials did not deny that Truss was effectively conceding it will be years before talks with the White House resume.

Biden has stalled on trade negotiations and, vocally proud of his Irish heritage, has raised concerns about the impact of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol on the peace process.
The next presidential election is in 2024 and the more UK-friendly Donald Trump may run again for the Republicans.
When Boris Johnson last visited the US as prime minister, Biden downplayed the chances of a deal with the UK as he warned against tampering with the Northern Ireland peace deal amid a row over the post-Brexit protocol.
Biden has raised concerns about the impact of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol on the peace process.
Truss named among her priorities the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), one of the world’s largest trading blocs which includes Australia, Canada and Japan.
The other she cited is the Gulf Co-operation Council, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and is the EU’s sixth largest export market.
Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a deadline for striking a deal by Diwali, the Hindu celebration being held on 23 October.
So far the UK and the US have been striking smaller state-by-state agreements, with Britain signing deals with Indiana and North Carolina.

But these are far less ambitious than the comprehensive free trade deal touted by Brexit supporters during the 2016 referendum.
One of the issues facing future talks is Truss’s threat to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which the EU says would break international law.
Senior figures in Biden’s Democratic party have warned a trade deal could be jeopardised by the UK single-handedly tearing up the agreement, which was part of the Brexit divorce deal.
While in New York, Truss is also set to have talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, which are bound to prominently feature Brexit.
Truss will meet Macron today, before seeing Biden and von der Leyen tomorrow. She had been set to talk to the US President in Britain over the weekend as he visited for the queen’s funeral, but the meeting was postponed.
The UK Labour party’s Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who was also attending Unga, said: “After being snubbed by the Biden administration within her first weeks in office, Liz Truss urgently needs to wake up to the damage her reckless approach to foreign policy is doing to the UK’s national interest.

THE NORTHERN IRELAND Protocol has become a “real problem” and must be “fixed” to ensure the country can agree a new powersharing administration, Boris Johnson has said.
The UK and the European Union have come to fresh blows over the Brexit treaty after reports emerged that the UK Foreign Secretary is drawing up emergency legislation to suspend elements of the protocol.
Boris Johnson, who negotiated the protocol when taking Britain out of the EU, would not be drawn on whether the wording of the divorce pact needed to be changed when questioned this evening.
He argued that without changes to the treaty, which is designed to prevent a hard border here, a new executive in Northern Ireland could not be formed as per the rules set out in the Good Friday Agreement.
Sinn Féin made history during last week’s Stormont elections when it became the largest party in the Assembly for the first time.
But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has ruled out entering into a new powersharing administration without significant changes to the protocol which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The impasse has led to concerns in Westminster that the protocol could spark sectarian violence.
Johnson told broadcasters that the “institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement aren’t functioning” and that political governance in Northern Ireland has “collapsed”.
Speaking in Stoke-on-Trent, he said: “The people of Northern Ireland need leadership, they need a regional, a provincial government… they haven’t got that.
“That’s a real, real problem.

The latest row came as months of tensions over the working of the protocol – which forms part of the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU – threatened to boil over.
Under its terms, the UK is required to impose checks on some goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in order to maintain an open border here while protecting the EU single market.
However, the Government has complained that the way it is being implemented is imposing a huge burden on businesses in Northern Ireland and creating trade barriers within the union.
UK Ministers have repeatedly warned that they could unilaterally suspend the arrangements unless the EU agrees to major changes to reduce the impact.
But Brussels has raised the possibility of suspending the entire Brexit deal if the threat is carried out, in a move that would spark an all-out trade war and potentially exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss used a phone call with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to warn that if the bloc does not show “flexibility” over the trading arrangements, then the UK would have “no choice but to act” alone, the Foreign Office said.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis later drove that message home during a visit to Brussels, giving a speech in which he pressed for “significant changes”.
He said the EU’s approach in refusing to change the negotiation mandate had been “hugely disappointing”.
“We will continue to talk with the EU but we won’t let that stand in the way of protecting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland,” Ellis told a press conference at the European Parliament.
“As both the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have made clear, we will take action to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement if solutions cannot be found.”
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson, speaking to reporters in Antrim, said Government figures had told him to expect “movement” on the protocol “fairly soon”.
According to The Times, Attorney General Suella Braverman has issued legal advice that the UK could act because the EU’s implementation of the agreement was “disproportionate and unreasonable”.

UK ministers have said they could trigger Article 16 of the protocol – the power allowing either side to suspend some of the arrangements – while reports have suggested Ms Truss is readying a domestic law designed to suspend parts of the terms.
Mr Sefcovic warned his counterparts in London that the EU could not “renegotiate” a form of Brexit that Britain freely signed up to.
Speaking in Brussels, the senior bloc figure said: “The EU cannot solve all the problems created by Brexit and the type of Brexit that the UK chose.
“That is the reason why the EU’s position has been consistent: we will not renegotiate the protocol, and the EU is united in this position.
“Unilateral action, effectively disapplying the protocol, is not a solution for the way forward.”
He said the commission “stands ready” to carry on working for a joint solution to the frictions being caused by the accord, and urged the UK “to do the same”.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK pushing to use domestic legislation to overwrite the protocol was “deeply unhelpful” and had “ratcheted up tension”.
Unilateral action by the UK also risks provoking a row with the US, where President Joe Biden has made clear his concern over any measure that could undermine the Good Friday peace agreement.

THE UK GOVERNMENT has announced it will extend the grace periods for allowing a range of products, including sausages, to continue being shipped across the Irish Sea.
In a written statement to Parliament today, Brexit minister David Frost said the move would “provide space for potential further discussions” with the European Union over possibly reforms to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“The Government proposed to the EU on 23 July a ‘standstill’ arrangement to maintain the operation of the protocol on the current basis, and to pause current legal actions, to provide space for discussions on those proposals,” said Frost, who negotiated Britain’s divorce from Brussels.
He added: “Following on from this, to provide space for potential further discussions, and to give certainty and stability to businesses while any such discussions proceed, the Government will continue to operate the protocol on the current basis.
“This includes the grace periods and easements currently in force. Operational and other guidance will be updated to reflect this approach.
“We will ensure that reasonable notice is provided in the event that these arrangements were to change, to enable businesses and citizens to prepare.”
Earlier today, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told RTÉ News he believes the business community, in Northern Ireland and the Republic, will welcome any extension.
However, he added: “However, it’s important that we use the period of any extension that may occur really to get down to business to try to put in place more permanent arrangements to make sure the protocol is made more workable.”

Varadkar was speaking after he met with British Cabinet member Michael Gove today during his first in-person Irish trade mission to the UK since before the Covid-19 pandemic began.
Varadkar said he got a sense of “reassurance” from Gove that “the UK government doesn’t want to walk away from the protocol, but does want to make it more workable, particularly for businesses in Northern Ireland”.
EU rules prevent chilled meat products being imported into the single market and the terms of Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements mean following Brussels’ regulations.
Sausage shipments could have been halted when the current extension to the grace period expires at the end of September.
The Northern Ireland Protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with Ireland at the extent of additional bureaucratic barriers for goods crossing from Great Britain.

Talks remain ongoing between the UK government and the European Union aimed at resolving issues surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The UK Brexit Minister David Frost described last week a “significant” gap remaining between the UK and the EU.
While some progress on medicines was welcomed, the UK team was understood to be disappointed that there has been little in the way of progress on the flow of goods between Britain and NI while governance and subsidy control remain points of contention.
Yesterday, unionists in Northern Ireland visited around 250 Orange Halls across the region to sign a declaration against the protocol.

Harold Henning, deputy grand master of the Orange Order, emphasised the depth of feeling among unionists against the protocol in terms of trade and the impact on the union.
He said at this stage they were leaving it for politicians to “sort out”, but suggested rallies could be called in future if deemed necessary.
The DUP has urged the UK government to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, which would suspend parts of the agreement and risk a major escalation in tensions with the EU.
Donaldson has also threatened to withdraw his party’s ministers from the Stormont Executive, effectively collapsing the institutions if progress is not made over the protocol.
Addressing DUP party members on the same day, Donaldson said they “remain committed to removing the Irish Sea border”.
“Left unchallenged it will damage our country and our union in the longer term. Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market must be respected and protected,” he said.
“We have made progress in focusing minds on this. It is only through our determination that the EU and UK Government are back at the talks table. Unionists should keep focused and together we can see a resolution to this.”

McGuinness, Ireland’s representative in the European Commission, was commenting on the potential for the country to be disproportionately affected if there is a breakdown of the Brexit trading arrangement designed to prevent a hardening of the island’s land border.
McGuinness also said UK and EU relations would be in a “very, very difficult place” if there was any truth in claims made by former Downing Street chief advisor Dominic Cummings that the UK Government always intended to ditch the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The EU and UK are set for an intense round negotiations in the coming weeks after Brussels last week published a range of proposals aimed at cutting the red tape the protocol has imposed on moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
However, the plan did not address a key UK demand – the removal of the oversight function of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the operation of the protocol.
UK Brexit Minister David Frost has warned that his Government will be prepared to suspend aspects of the protocol – by triggering its Article 16 mechanism – if it cannot reach agreement with the bloc on changing how it operates.
That has raised the prospect of the EU taking retaliatory action, potentially in the form of further restrictions on trade with the UK.
McGuinness told RTÉ One’s The Week In Politics it was more important to focus on getting a successful outcome to the negotiations than the “what ifs” that may materialise if talks break down.
However, she added: “At the end of the day if things break down and if there is a sense in which the United Kingdom is not prepared to agree to existing commitments or to reach an agreement on a new deal then of course Europe will have to act in Europe’s best interest. So I think that that’s clear.
“As to the specific issues or where we might take action, I mean there are many ways to do it, we do not have the lists now.”

McGuinness was asked whether Ireland would be the Member State hardest hit if the protocol talks end in failure.
“There certainly is a reality and my colleagues in Europe and around the commission understand Ireland is in a very vulnerable position, because if things go wrong we could find ourselves in a difficult situation,” she said.
“I don’t find any sense amongst the member states that they want Ireland to be singled out or to be made feel vulnerable.
“But I would put a question to the UK side – I hope that’s not their intention, I hope they’re not using Ireland, as opposed to Northern Ireland, as a way to, if you like, reconfigure things, because that won’t wash well either.”
Last week, Cummings suggested the UK Government had always intended to ditch the protocol, which it signed up to as part of the 2020 Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
McGuinness said that claim had left her “speechless”.
“How do you answer, if that is the fact?” she said.
“How do you deal politically and in a democracy and in diplomacy, if that is a fact?
“If Dominic Cummings’ tweets are true, then I think we are in a very, very difficult place. So from my side, representing the European Commission, we have to believe in good faith, because if we act in good faith, we solve problems where they are there.
“What troubles me is that sometimes on the UK side, the minute there is a solution they find a problem in that solution, and that’s not progress. That’s going back and forth to the detriment of people in Northern Ireland.”

Today’s Front pages, known as splashes in the newspaper trade, are characteristically jingoistic and slightly despairing in equal measure.
Much of the coverage reflects the exhaustive efforts to try and get this deal finished but others moan about their country’s continued connections to Europe.
The Timesset a hopeful tone and hailed the development as a “Brexit breakthrough”, which grants Britain the power to veto EU laws.
But they also raised questions over the presence of King Charles in the endgame phase of negotiations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-liz-truss-brexit-5869622-Sep2022/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN said he sees an opportunity to “reset” Ireland’s relationship with the UK after meeting UK Prime Minister Liz Truss today.
Martin said he had a “warm” meeting with Truss and refrained from answering questions on the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit agreement.
“I don’t think this is the time, if you don’t mind me saying so, to get into the detail about issues like the protocol,” he said during an interview on BBC Radio 4, adding that he respects the period of national mourning the UK is currently engaged in.
The talks during the UK’s mourning period, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, are being portrayed as chats rather than formal bilateral sessions, but the meeting comes against a backdrop of political tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The Taoiseach and President Michael D Higginsboth paid their respectsto the queen at her lying-in-state in Westminster Hall today.
Martin continued: “I had a good telephone conversation last week with the British Prime Minister, had an initial warm meeting this morning where we discussed many issues in the context of the British-Irish relationship.
“But I do think the opportunity is there for us to reset relationships and to be conscious of what we achieved in previous years, the obstacles that were overcome then.
And that gives us the strength to know that we have the capacity to overcome current obstacles, current issues that potentially could impede the relationship, and I believe we can overcome them.

The meeting comes as Britain is expected to push ahead with legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was jointly agreed by the UK and EU in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Both the EU and Ireland claim Britain’s move to unilaterally revise the post-Brexit treaty would breach international law.
The issue is expected to ramp up ahead of a deadline at the end of October to form a new Northern Ireland Executive, which the DUP has so far blocked in protest over the protocol.
Truss had been due to meet US president Joe Biden, a milestone of her early premiership, but the talks were cancelled, with a “full bilateral meeting” scheduled instead for Wednesday, when they are set to be in New York for the UN General Assembly.
Along with meeting the Taoiseach, Truss will also meet Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Polish president Andrzej Duda in Downing Street.
Martin previously met Truss in person briefly shortly after she became Prime Minister earlier this month.
They were seated next to one another during a memorial service for the queen at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast on Tuesday.

THE TAOISEACH HAS welcomed the intervention of US President Joe Biden in the row over Northern Ireland’s Brexit arrangements.
Joe Biden is expected to tell UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to let the row put the Good Friday Agreement at risk when the pair meet today.
In the US president’s first overseas visit, aides said he will stress the need to “stand behind” the Northern Ireland Protocol, the element of the Brexit deal which has triggered a UK-EU dispute.
Speaking today on Newstalk Breakfast, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that “the intervention from Joe Biden is significant – but it makes sense from the American perspective”. He also said, from his perspective, the US intervention involves a lot of common sense.
The Taoiseach this morning said it’s important for countries with similar values to be aligned and so the EU-US relationship is very important regarding restoring that transatlantic relationship. However, the UK need to also be aligned in that restoration.
Biden is in the UK to attend the G7 summit, set to begin tomorrow in Cornwall. However, the Northern Ireland protocol issue is threatening to overshadow the Biden’s first meeting with the British Prime Minister and possibly Johnson’s hosting of the summit as well.
“I think it is significant in the context of the message from President Biden and his administration that the sensible thing to do is to have alignment between the UK and the EU and the US – we all share common values as democracies,” the Taoiseach said to reporters this morning at an event in Dublin.
“I think he’s saying ‘let’s do the sensible thing here’.”
Also speaking today, at Dublin’s RDS, Minster for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, said the US sees itself as “an international guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and the peace process in Northern Ireland”.
“President Biden himself is personally interested in follows closely the twists and turns of of politics in Northern Ireland,” he said. He says he expects US guidance to continue from Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

Aside from Brexit, Johnson and Biden will work on efforts to resume transatlantic travel and agree a new Atlantic Charter paving the way for co-operation on challenges including climate change and security.
But Biden’s close interest in issues affecting Ireland will mean that the dispute over the protocol will feature heavily in discussions with the UK and European Union over the coming days of intense diplomatic activity in Cornwall.
The London Times reported today that Biden took the extraordinary step of ordering the United States’ most senior diplomat in London, Yael Lempert, to deliver a demarche – a formal protest – in a meeting with Brexit minister David Frost on June 3.
The newspaper reported that Government minutes of the meeting said: “Lempert implied that the UK had been inflaming the rhetoric, by asking if he would keep it ‘cool’.”

Today, top European Union officials have vowed to use all available measures to ensure the UK respects the terms of its Brexit agreement.
“It is paramount to implement what we have decided. This is a question of rule of law,” European Council President Charles Michel said.
“We will use all the tools we have in order to make sure that we defend our interests and to protect the integrity of the single market.”
Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are set to hold talks with Johnson at the sidelines of the G7 summit, in an effort to diffuse the row.
Talks between Brexit minister Frost and the European Commission’s Maros Sefcovic yesterday failed to make a breakthrough on the protocol.
The EU has threatened to launch a trade war against Britain if it fails to implement checks on goods entering Northern Ireland under the terms of the Brexit divorce settlement which Johnson signed.
The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the European single market for goods in order to avoid a hard border with Ireland, meaning a trade barrier in the Irish Sea for goods crossing from Great Britain.

Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One:
“President Biden has been crystal clear about his rock-solid belief in the Good Friday Agreement as the foundation for peaceful coexistence in Northern Ireland.
“That agreement must be protected, and any steps that imperil or undermine it will not be welcomed by the United States.”
Asked whether Johnson’s stance was imperiling the peace deal, Sullivan said:
“I’m not going to characterise that at this point.  I’m only going to say that President Biden is going to make statements in principle on this front.
“He’s not issuing threats or ultimatums; he’s going to simply convey his deep-seated belief that we need to stand behind and protect this protocol.”
Boris Johnson told reporters yesterday that resolving the dispute with Brussels was “easily doable” and “what we want to do is make sure that we can have a solution that guarantees the peace process, protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom”.
The meeting of the two leaders comes on the eve of the G7 summit which will bring together the world’s wealthiest democracies at a time when the West faces difficult judgments in responding to the rise of China as an economic and political force and the destabilising actions of Russia.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cost-of-used-cars-in-ireland-5972342-Jan2023/,"THE PRICE OF used cars in Ireland has jumped by almost 70% since before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report.
Used cars in the lower end of the market in particular are becoming less affordable, despite being lower in safety standards and higher in emissions.
In the last quarter of 2022, the prices of cars being sold on DoneDeal were 69.7% higher compared to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020.
When comparing prices now to this time last year, they are 16.2% higher, according to the latest DoneDeal Car Price Index.
In the lower end of the market (cars costing less than €6,000), prices rose by 4.7% in the last three months of 2022.
However, in the upper end of the market (cars costing over €20,000), Q4 saw a 1.1% rate of deflation. This is the first time that deflation has been observed in the price index for this end of the market since Q1 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic.
The report, which was compiled by economist Dr Tom Gillespie, notes that the “lingering effect” of the pandemic microchip shortage, coupled with Brexit and the outbreak of war in Ukraine “caused significant disruption to both the supply of, and the demand for, used cars”.
DoneDeal Car Price IndexDoneDeal Car Price Index
In the first nine months of 2022, used car prices rose by an average quarterly rate of 4.7%. Despite expectations of a slowdown in price inflation in Q3, it remained strong at 3.5%.
However, in the last three months of 2022, it seems that price inflation has finally slowed to a more ‘normal’ level as the quarterly rate of price inflation in the last quarter of 2022 was 1.4%, the lowest rate of inflation seen since Q3 2019.
On DoneDeal, the number of active listings is up 19% when comparing the stock of active ads on 1 January to 1 December 2022, suggesting a slight recovery in supply.

DoneDeal Car Price IndexDoneDeal Car Price Index
In the last three months of 2022, consumer demand fell by 17% quarter on quarter, which is largely in tune with the observed slowdown in price inflation.
“On the demand side, the cost-of-living crisis inevitably means that big-ticket items such as cars are given more careful consideration from a household budget perspective, dampening demand,” the report notes.
As car production catches up with demand, newer used cars are less in demand from consumers who have a preference for straight-from-the-factory-floor cars, the report notes.
The report states that, for the lower end of the market, so-called Celtic Tiger cars (made from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s) are “rapidly becoming obsolete”.
Replacing the supply of older and cheaper cars “can only come from overseas”.
DoneDeal Car Price IndexDoneDeal Car Price Index
The report notes: “For many people who live in rural Ireland and are in the lower end of the income distribution, there is a strong reliance on a car for transport, therefore demand does not fluctuate much for this cohort.
“Coupling this necessary demand with choked supply due to Brexit restrictions, means that inflation in used cars continues to be driven by the lower end of the market.
“As prices continue to rise in the lower end of the market, cars are becoming less affordable, lower in safety standards, and higher in emissions.”
Under plans discussed by Cabinet yesterday, high-powered electric vehicle chargers will be installed every 60 kilometres along all main road networks.
The EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy 2022–2025 and Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy sets out a roadmap for the delivery of Ireland’s publicly-funded charging infrastructureover the next three years.
The strategy provides €100 million in funding for the new public-charging infrastructure. It will be rolled out to complement home charging, which currently accounts for the vast majority of charging.
The aim of the new public infrastructure is to assure car users of the feasibility of switching to an electric vehicle over the coming years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/truss-turnip-ireland-brexit-5767894-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|19 May 2022
TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said it will be up to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to confirm or deny whether or not she made remarks saying that the impact of a no-deal Brexit in Ireland would only “affect a few farmers with turnips in the back of their trucks”.
The claim comes from a Tweet by Alexandra Hall Hall, a former British ambassador to Georgia who was the lead Brexit envoy for the UK Government in Washington for several years.
Hall Hall alleged that Truss made the comments as part of a speech to a US audience in 2019.
So pleased to see Liz Truss become a genuine expert on Irish matters: she was, after all, the Minister who told a US audience three years ago that Brexit would not have any serious impact in Ireland…it would merely “affect a few farmers with turnips in the back of their trucks”.https://t.co/qOwfPxC9jH— alexandra hall hall 🇺🇦🌻 (@alexhallhall)May 17, 2022

Hall Hall had previously claimed to have heard a “senior British minister” make the comments about a no-deal Brexit, but on Wednesday she attributed the remarks to Truss, who was then trade secretary.
It is understood that those close to Truss have claimed not to recognise the comments.
Speaking during Leaders Questions earlier today, Varadkar said that he did not know whether or not Truss made those remarks in 2019.
“I don’t know whether Secretary Truss made those remarks or not, it’s obviously up to her to confirm or deny them,” said Varadkar.

He made the comment in response to a question from Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín, who said that the alleged remarks “were an insight into the ignorance at the heart of the British bad faith when it comes to Brexit”.
“We all know that Brexit -  even the Brexit with the deal that we’ve had – has affected people and has affected businesses and has done so adversely in a lot of consequences,” said Varadkar.
“Although I think it would have been much worse if we didn’t have the deal that we have.”
Allegations
Hall Hall later quit as a diplomat after more than three decades in 2019, citing concerns over the UK Government’s handling of Brexit and being forced to “peddle half-truths”.
She tweeted the claim about Truss as a reaction to a Tweet from the Foreign  Secretary which said the UK government’s “first priority is to uphold the Belfast Agreement”.
Hall Hall wrote in the Texas National Security Review journal last year that during her time as a diplomat in Washington, DC that Boris Johnson’s government damagingly played down the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland’s peace process in statements intended for US audiences.
In an article Hall Hall wrote in the autumn of 2021, she referenced the “turnip” remarks without attributing them to anyone in particular.
She described it as a “low point” of her time in Washington when a UK official “openly and offensively” in front of a US audience dismissed the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Irish businesses.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-set-to-move-ensure-medicines-flow-gb-and-ni-5633044-Dec2021/,"THE EUROPEAN UNION is set to announce proposals to ensure medicines can continue to flow unimpeded from Britain into Northern Ireland.
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic is expected to announce proposed new legislation tomorrow.
The UK’s Brexit Minister David Frost is understood to be aware of the development and is also expected to make a statement.
The issues surrounding medicines stem from the outworkings of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the Brexit deal which means Northern Ireland remains covered by the EU’s pharmaceutical regulations.
As Northern Ireland receives most of its medicines from suppliers in Britain, there had been concerns that their movement could be impeded when a grace period ends in January.
However, the anticipated EU announcement would include a proposal to pass legislation that will enable the trade of medicines between Britain and Northern Ireland to continue.
Advertisement
A Brussels source said: “We believe the proposals solve all the issues that were raised about medicines.”
Any new legislation would be subject to ratification by both the European Council and the European Parliament.
Sefcovic and Frost are expected to speak by phone ahead of the announcement.
It is understood Frost has asked to meet with Northern Ireland’s political parties tomorrow, with party leaders anticipating a briefing on the development.
It is not expected that there will be a resolution to any other subjects, but there may be an indication from both sides on an approach to dealing with outstanding issues such as customs and food and plant and animal checks in the new year.
The proposed EU law change would allow British-based pharma suppliers to maintain their current regulatory arrangements.
It would mean companies in Britain could continue to act as a hub for the supply of generic medicines to Northern Ireland, without the need to establish bases in the region.
The proposals would also apply to other small markets which use British medicines, including the Irish Republic, Malta and Cyprus.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-leader-says-debris-of-protocol-must-be-cleared-for-stormont-to-return-5894928-Oct2022/,"THE DEBRIS OF the Northern Ireland Protocol must be “cleared away” if Stormont powersharing institutions are to return, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has insisted.
Donaldson was speaking ahead of a meeting with Taoiseach Micheál Martin later today, and he reiterated the political institutions need the support of unionists as well as nationalists and others.
The Taoiseach is meeting local parties in Belfast as a deadline to restore Stormont and avoid fresh Assembly elections rapidly approaches.
The DUP is blocking the functioning of the powersharing institutions in Belfast as part of its protest against the post-Brexit protocol that has created barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by way of a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation that would empower ministers to scrap the arrangements without the approval of Brussels.
Relations between the UK and EU appear to have improved since Liz Truss became prime minister and London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for a deal through fresh negotiations.
Current legislation says that unless Stormont is restored by 28 October, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has to call Assembly elections – something he has said he is prepared to do.
Donaldson said: “We must lay solid foundations if we are to move forward.
“We need to clear away the debris of the protocol years.
“We need to restore cross-community consensus.
“No unionist MLAs support the protocol. Therefore, it must be replaced by arrangements that unionists can support.

“This is essential if the political institutions are to function and succeed.”
The DUP leader also called on Brussels to “loosen the guide ropes” for its negotiating team so problems with the protocol can be discussed and resolved.
He added: “The protocol continues to bedevil us, with businesses and consumers reporting further problems each week.
“A 25% tariff on steel, driving up transport costs by almost 30%, and uncertainty over medicine and veterinary supplies.
“The checks, however, on the Irish Sea border are but a symptom of the problem.
“They are the product of Northern Ireland being subject to a different set of laws imposed upon us by a foreign entity without any say or vote by any locally-elected representative.
“If we can secure a better way forward, then there is a great prize of stable devolved government, but without decisive action in Dublin and Brussels then the protocol will continue to erode the foundations of Stormont.
“Devolution requires the support of unionists as well as nationalists if it is to function and succeed.”
Sinn Féin, which emerged as the largest party in Northern Ireland during Assembly elections earlier this year, has repeatedly called for Stormont to return immediately to address the cost-of-living crisis.
Speaking last week, Sinn Féin Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill said: “We need to get around the executive table today, no more delays. Particularly whenever you see the scale of challenges that we have to tackle as an executive, not least fixing our health service.”
The Taoiseach will hold separate meetings with O’Neill, Donaldson, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long, leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood and Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie.
His programme will conclude with a visit to meet participants in programmes working with schools as catalysts for peace and reconciliation.","6.47am, 17 Oct 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/article-16-oireachtas-5355662-Feb2021/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Feb 2021
THE VICE PRESIDENT of the European Commission has told TDs and Senators that “mistakes were made” in Brussels regarding the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol but that lessons have been learned and that Europe’s commitment to Ireland was not in doubt.
Maroš Šefčovič today addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, and said the commission would do its utmost to protect peace in Northern Ireland going forward.
However, despite being asked on numerous occasions, he did not outline who made the decision that caused such an outcry.
His appearance came after the controversial move from the European Commission to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol late last month, in a row over the supply of vaccines to Europe.
The move blindsided governments in Dublin and London, which could have meant checks between the six and 26 counties. EU officials quickly rescinded the plan the same evening and acknowledged it as a mistake.
In an interview withEuroNews’ Shona Murrayyesterday, Šefčovič said that “we apologised for it, and we are sorry” in relation to the proposal to trigger Article 16, and said that there was a need to dial down “heated rhetoric” around the problems with carrying out post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland.
Speaking before the Oireachtas Committee today, the European Commission vice president reiterated this apology while being pressed on how the decision was made and who exactly made that decision.
“The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process and we deeply regret that,” he said.
“But in a matter of three hours, we got it right. Article 16 was never activated. I can assure you the commission has learned a lesson and the commission will do its utmost to protect the peace in Northern Ireland.”
Šefčovič said the proof that the European Commission will take the best measures going forward comes from its track record.
“I think that the best answer is our track record, unwavering support, political, economic and financial to the peace process since the Belfast agreement was signed and agreed upon,” he said. “Also the way in how we conducted the entire Brexit negotiation process.”
He said that during the entire Brexit negotiation process, Ireland was “in our minds all the time, and in our hearts”.
The top commission official said that work is ongoing with UK counterparts and Irish ministers to regarding the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.
“We want to listen, we want to learn, and we want to work on solutions,” Šefčovič said.
“It must be always a two-way street. We also have to recognise the fact that we knew from the beginning that the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Customs Union and the Single Market is a massive operation, that it’s not possible to prevent all the disruption.
Speaking to RTÉ News this afternoon, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that “Šefčovič has been a real friend of Ireland here”.
Coveney outlined that himself and Šefčovič will be meeting stakeholders on Brexit on Thursday and that the European Commission Vice President will be doing the same with Michael Gove in the context of stakeholders in Northern Ireland.
“He will then follow that up with a specialised Committee to focus on the protocol and its implementation and what flexibilities may be possible in ensuring that implementation is as smooth as possible and follow that up again by a Joint Committee probably early next week,” Coveney said.

“There’s a lot of commitment coming from Vice President Šefčovič and the European Commission to focus on the Irish issues, north and south, linked to the implementation of the protocol, to first of all ensure that it’s fully implemented by both sides and secondly to look at using the flexibilities within the confines of the protocol to the greatest extent possible to respond to genuine implementation issues that have emerged over the last six weeks,” he said.
A “colossal” mistake
Lisa ChambersOireachtas TVOireachtas TV
Fianna Fáil Senator Lisa Chambers said that the move from the European Commission was a “colossal” mistake with huge political implications.
“What we’re trying to figure out is the events that led to the making of that decision,” she said. “When did you inform the other commissioners of your intention to invoke Article 16?”
Šefčovič said the decision came through a “primary objective” of the European Commission to make sure it got its fair share of vaccines.

“We are a major producer of vaccines in the EU,” he said. “We felt we weren’t getting our fair share. We didn’t have enough transparency over where these vaccines were going.
The European Commission vice president said that Europe has shown itself very loyal to Ireland and Northern Ireland, and that the Northern Ireland Protocol was the “only solution” to protect peace and stability while avoiding a hard border.
Labour’s Brendan Howlin said Europe’s previous commitments to Ireland “underscored the degree of shock” with the decision, and that the harm done “continues”.
Brendan HowlinOireachtas TVOireachtas TV
“How can such a fundamental thing happen without political awareness of it?” Howlin asked. “Who signed off on it, politically? We need to understand that.”
Šefčovič reiterated that it was a “draft proposal that was quickly corrected”. He also said that there shouldn’t be a “blame game”.
Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary put it to Šefčovič that he was “splitting hairs” by saying Article 16 was never triggered, when every indication had been given that it would be.
He said it was vital for accountability to be provided over who made the order to trigger Article 16 and reassurances that it wouldn’t happen again. He said the protocol needed to be able to withstand changes in personnel at the highest levels, and that safeguards needed to put in place in this regard.
“Our job is parliamentary scrutiny,” Calleary said. “We’ve a responsibility to get to the detail of what happened on and the days leading up to 29 January. It’s not a blame game, we’re doing our job.”
Dara CallearyOireachtas TVOireachtas TV
Šefčovič replied that the move was made in the context of the situation concerning vaccines in Europe.
“I want to make it 100% clear that this article was never activated,” he said. “There was immediate communication between President [Ursula von der Leyen] and the Taoiseach and Minister Coveney.”
‘Early warning system’
Speaking to the same committee last week, Minister with responsibility for EU Affairs Thomas Byrne said that the government is seeking an “early warning system” on the use of Article 15 of the Northern Ireland protocol on Brexit.
He said the government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the European Commission and the UK Government to find a resolution.
Byrne added: “What the Government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place.
“There is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the Commission made a mistake, yes the Commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now.
“Clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.”
Asking questions today, Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond asked about the “crucially important” early warning system.
Neale RichmondOireachtas TVOireachtas TV
“Everyone can make mistakes but it’s how you learn from them that’s important,” he said.
Šefčovič said that a new mechanism was being set up within the Commission that would respect fully the elements of the Northern Ireland protocol while keeping all parties informed of developments.
“Ireland will always be consulted on these issues,” he added.
The European Commission vice president added that the responsibility for shortages of any supplies to supermarkets in Northern Ireland rests with the UK, as such problems were foreseen well in advance.
He said the protocol was the solution that would solve these problems in future, and that any problems with it should be ironed out.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-driver-in-rise-of-english-welsh-people-holding-irish-passports-6157029-Aug2023/,"THE NUMBER OF UK-born residents in England and Wales holding an Irish passport has increased five-fold since 2011, with the rise thought to be partly down to Brexit.
While the change has been partly driven by migration over the decade, with more people moving to the UK from the EU, it is also thought more people have taken up additional passports after Brexit, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The majority – 84.4% or 50.3 million – of usual UK residents across England Wales held only one passport in 2021, according to an analysis of UK Census 2021 figures.
While the number of UK/EU passports held increased by five times over the 10-year period for UK-born residents of England and Wales, there had been a three-fold rise for non-UK-born residents since 2011.

The rise in dual citizens may also suggest greater uptake of additional passports following the end of free movement when the UK left the European Union
Jay Lindop, from the ONS, said: “The number of people with dual citizenship has doubled since 2011, with more than 1.2 million usual residents in England and Wales now holding multiple passports.
“This change has been partly driven by migration over the decade, with an increase in people moving here from the EU. As people who have settled in England and Wales go on to have children, we can see an increase in dual citizenship among the younger ages.

“The rise in dual citizens may also suggest greater uptake of additional passports following the end of free movement when the UK left the European Union.”
There were age differences among dual citizens, with the rise in UK-born British and European dual citizens driven by younger age groups, but British/Irish passport holders being older, the ONS said.
More than half (58.7%) of dual citizens born in the UK and holding both UK and EU passports were aged under 16, while just over a third (36.7%) of UK and non-EU dual citizens were under 16.
Non-EU dual citizens had a median age of 22, and UK/Irish dual citizens were older, with a median age of 47.
For Irish-only passport holders, the median age was 33.
A rise in UK/Irish dual citizens across the decade was most apparent in those aged 50 to 70-years-old, the ONS said, adding that this suggested many only took up their dual nationality more recently despite moving to England and Wales years ago.
The top five UK/EU passports for UK-born dual citizens were primarily held by children or young adults, with Ireland having the only older population, the ONS said.
The statistics body said the reasons for holding multiple passports were likely to differ between those who held a UK passport first and those who held a non-UK passport first, noting that the census did not collect data on when passports were acquired.
Looking more closely at the areas where dual citizens are based in the two nations, the ONS found that more than a third (39.1%) of all UK-born holders of UK and EU passports in England and Wales were living in London at the time of the 2021 census.","1.34pm, 31 Aug 2023",

The UK’s Brexit opportunities minister was adamant in the past that any backups when crossing the Channel would be witnessed in Calais in France.
But after people travelling abroad from the UK faced chaos on gridlocked roads on the British side of the border, Rees-Mogg conceded he was wrong but insisted it was “for the right reason”.
Rees-Mogg blamed Paris for the “French-created delays” as he was played a clip from 2018 where he claimed that “the delays will not be at Dover, they will be at Calais”.
Asked if he would apologise during the appearance on LBC radio, Rees-Mogg said: “Yes, of course, I got it wrong but I got it wrong for the right reason, if I may put it that way.

“The point I was making was that the only delays would be caused by the French if they decided not to allow British people to pass through freely, they have decided to do that.”
He blamed “juxtaposed border controls” for the delays, meaning the French check travellers in Dover, while the British do the same in Calais.
“That means if the French don’t operate their system properly, we get the delays,” he said.
Rees-Mogg suggested Britons might believe “going to Portugal is more fun because the Portuguese want us to go and the French are being difficult”.
“Why should we go and spend our hard-earned money in France if the French don’t want us?” he asked before insisting he was not calling for a boycott.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-uk-northern-ireland-protocol-5617460-Dec2021/,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE-PRESIDENT Maros Sefcovic has urged the UK to “reciprocate” in talks over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Intensive talks are continuing between the UK and the EU over the post-Brexit arrangements which have sparked outrage among unionists in Northern Ireland.
They say additional checks on goods arriving into the region from Great Britain are impacting trade as well as undermining Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK.
Sefcovic said the benefits of the protocol are “immense”, offering Northern Ireland access to EU and UK markets.
He was speaking as he appeared remotely before the Northern Ireland Assembly’s Executive Committee today.
Sefcovic said he wanted to “reaffirm the EU’s overarching objective to establish a positive and stable relationship with the United Kingdom”.
“We have been showing flexibility and creativity in finding solutions within the framework of the protocol,” he added.
Sefcovic said the protocol is “not perfect but it is the best response to the UK’s decision to withdraw from EU and the form of Brexit the Government has chosen”.
He said the EU has put forward a package of solutions addressing the main issues: supply of medicines, checks on goods, and simplification of east-west trade in terms of customs.

“Our proposal will deliver significant changes, they amount to a new model for the implementation of the protocol and can deliver a real difference for all people and businesses in Northern Ireland,” he said.
“We made an important move towards the UK with far-reaching proposals for solutions. We need the UK Government to reciprocate this now, we have no time to lose, and what is most pressing is the need to ensure continued supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
“We have put the solutions on the table, we have been listening carefully to the pharmaceutical industry.
“I made a promise during my visit to Belfast in September where I said I would do whatever it takes to solve this very important issue, including amending our own rules, and I will keep my word and our UK partners know that.”
Sefcovic said political and technical discussions between the EU and UK are continuing and he will speak to the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost on Friday.
“I can assure you that I am sparing no efforts to reach solutions,” he told MLAs.
“We will remain calm and constructive but also firm. The EU stands united, our commitment to the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement is absolute, the key prerequisite for this is the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“We hope that the United Kingdom Government will follow down the path of engaging to find solutions because this is in everybody’s interests.
“Now is not the time any more to insist on things that civil society organisations or businesses have not identified as a problem in my numerous engagements with them.
“Now it’s time to act and to act on the things that matter to the people, like the uninterrupted supply of medicines.
“The EU for one is putting all its energy into getting a solution. Our ultimate goal is to provide predictability, stability and certainty for the people of Northern Ireland and we are absolutely convinced that our package does exactly this.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-checks-could-be-decreased-brexit-5863691-Sep2022/,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE President Maros Sefcovic has toldthe Financial Timesthat the EU could reduce physical customs checks across the Irish Sea to just a few lorries a day if Liz Truss’s government cooperates with post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Sefcovic said that the trade border would be “invisible” under new plans if the UK would give EU officials real-time data on trade movements.
“If the data are downloaded into the system, when the goods are put on the ferry from Britain . . . I believe that we can remotely process them while sailing to Northern Ireland,” he told the Financial Times in an interview.
He added that physical checks would only be made “when there is reasonable suspicion” of illegal trade smuggling, illegal drugs or dangerous toys or poisoned food.
Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market under the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to prevent customs checks across the border, however this requires checks from Britain to Northern Ireland, while the UK government is demanding for no checks.
Sefcovic said that the UK government’s desire for zero customs checks across the Irish Sea is compatible with the EU’s offer of “minimum checks, done in an invisible manner”.
He has stated in the past that attempts from Tories to unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol are “damaging trust and respect with the EU”.

Last week, Sefcovic said the EU had already put forward“far-reaching” proposalsto address issues of concern raised by stakeholders in Northern Ireland about the operation of the protocol.
He said the EU proposals would create an express lane for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and reduce sanitary and phytosanitary checks and controls by more than 80%.
“These proposals have, however, never been seriously picked up by my counterparts. In short, they were dismissed without consideration.
“The UK has not even engaged in any meaningful discussions with us since February.
“Instead, we are now faced with the UK Government’s continuing determination to push forward the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, set to disapply core elements of the Protocol.”
However Sefcovic stated he was “encouraged” by indications from Truss that she wanted a negotiated settlement with the EU, believing that the new prime minister could move discussions forward.
The DUP has refused to return to Stormont until the protocol is changed.
Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP leader, told the FT “there is the prospect of renewed negotiations”.
“I think that would require a change of stance from the EU. They need to recognise that if we are to arrive at a solution it requires them to accept, and respect, the integrity of the UK, its internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-cummings-newsletter-substack-5463475-Jun2021/,"DOMINIC CUMMINGS IS planning to charge newsletter subscribers to hear about his time inside Downing Street.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s former top aide has launched a profile on Substack, a newsletter platform that allows people to sign up for newsletter mailing lists on topics they find interesting.
In a post on the site Mr Cummings said he would be giving out information on the coronavirus pandemic for free, as well as some details of his time at Downing Street.
But revelations about “more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, ‘inside No10’, how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc” will be available only to those who pay £10-a-month for a subscription.
Subscribers will also be able to access “extra features” such as question and answer sessions.
“Subscribers will find out first about new projects that I make public,” the post said. “Only subscribers can comment.”
He said he also intended to use the platform to campaign for answers over the Covid pandemic and the Government’s handling of it.

And he confirmed the launch of the platform on his Twitter account urging campaigners pushing for an immediate Covid inquiry to get in touch as he would “help campaign for free”.
Mr Cummings said one of the situations he may be able to help in is “if you want to win an election” or “you want to predict something but don’t know how”.
Users can get some access without charge, but then can pay £100-a-year, £10-a-month, or £200-a-year to become a “founding member”.
It comes after Mr Cummings has taken aim at Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock, and the Government in general since he left Downing Street after a behind-the-scenes power struggle in November last year.
Mr Cummings had accused the Health Secretary of lying, failing on care homes and “criminal, disgraceful behaviour” on testing.
But the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee said Mr Cummings’ claims would remain unproven because he has failed to provide supporting evidence.
Mr Hancock said he has “no idea” why he was targeted by the former aide but was aware he wanted him sacked, suggesting the aide briefed his desires to newspapers.
“I think the best thing to say about this, and this will be corroborated by lots of people in Government, the best thing to say, is that Government has operated better in the past six months,” the minister said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-stormont-5545023-Sep2021/,"THE DUP HAS threatened to pull down powersharing at Stormont if major changes to Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol are not secured.
Here are the answers to some of the questions raised by the party’s dramatic move.
How can the DUP collapse powersharing?
The institutions created through peace process agreements can only operate with the participation of both the largest unionist party and the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland.
As such, only Sinn Fein and the DUP have the ability to unilaterally collapse devolution.
If either withdraws from the structures, they can no longer function.
That is how devolution imploded in 2017 when the late Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUP’s handling of a botched green energy scheme.
That political impasse lasted three years, with devolution only restored in 2020 after the main parties signed up to a new accord, New Decade, New Approach, to resolve a series of long-standing sticking points.
How is the party justifying the move?
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed the new economic barriers on trade between GB and NI are disrupting the lives and livelihoods of everyone in Northern Ireland while also risking the constitutional integrity of the UK.
Since becoming leader in June, he has toured Northern Ireland meeting unionists and loyalists.
He has said grassroots discontent at the protocol has informed the party’s ramped-up strategy.
Donaldson has cautioned against tinkering around the edges of the arrangements and has insisted wholesale changes are required.
He has characterised his approach as an attempt to inject urgency into stalled efforts secure changes to the protocol, warning that his party will not accept years of slow negotiations or repeated moves to extend protocol grace periods in lieu of permanent solutions.
With the fate of the protocol in the hands of the EU and UK Government, collapsing devolution is one of the few levers the DUP can pull. Donaldson hopes the threat to pull it will bring matters to a head and secure the changes he desires.
Are there other factors in play?
DUP HQ has been rocked by a series of shocking polling results this year.
The latest saw the region’s largest party trail in in joint fourth place, with public support rated at just 13%.
In the last Assembly election in 2017 the party was backed by 28% of the electorate.
Significantly, in last month’s poll, the party lagged behind both of its main unionist rivals, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV.
The party is also facing the uncomfortable prospect of Sinn Fein emerging from the next Assembly poll as the largest party.
The republican party taking the First Minister’s role in Northern Ireland would represent a sizeable symbolic blow for the DUP and unionism in general.
The disastrous polling was undoubtedly a factor in the chaos that engulfed the DUP earlier this year when two leaders, Arlene Foster and her successor Edwin Poots, were ousted in successive internal revolts that occurred within weeks of each other.
Advertisement
What could this move do to the wider political dynamic within unionism?
The protocol has thrown political unionism into flux as the main parties attempt to position themselves ahead of the scheduled Assembly election in May.
Doug Beattie took over the leadership of the Ulster Unionists in May with a pledge to move the party back to its moderate, centre ground roots.
In the wake of Donaldson’s speech, Beattie was quick off the mark to distance his party from threats to pull down Stormont.
In so doing he has created further clear blue water between the parties.
It is in keeping with his attempt to woo back moderate unionists who in recent years have switched allegiances to the centrist, non-affiliated Alliance party.
Donaldson’s rhetoric yesterday was more in line with the approach advocated by the harder line Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party.
Critics have previously derided the party as a one-man band that relies solely on its formidable leader Jim Allister for an identity.
However, as the latest opinion polls suggest, the party could be poised for a breakthrough in the next election, with the potential to mop up many disaffected DUP voters.
Why will the DUP face difficulty defending its position?
It is yet to be seen whether the DUP follows through with it threat and pulls down the administration.
If it does push the nuclear button the party would undoubtedly find itself in an awkward political position.
In so doing, the DUP would be left open to the very same accusations it has aimed at Sinn Fein for the last four years, namely, jeopardising public service delivery for narrow political interest.
Northern Ireland has the worst waiting list times in the UK and the DUP has consistently blamed this situation on Sinn Fein and the three year powersharing impasse.
Short-lived DUP leader Poots was again highly critical of Sinn Fein during the summer when the republican party threatened not to re-enter the coalition alongside his choice of first minister without a firm assurance on a timeline for legislation for Irish language protections.
Poots insisted he was a devolutionist and claimed any Sinn Fein move to collapse the institutions would threaten vital health service reforms.
How much of a political risk is the DUP strategy?
It would be a high stakes move to pull down Stormont at any time but particularly when Northern Ireland is still dealing with the Covid-19 crisis.
However, as it stands, DUP strategists believe they are facing a potential electoral battering in the next Assembly poll.
They fear many within the unionist electorate will blame the party for the Irish Sea border, accusing it of squandering its unprecedented influence in the Brexit process during the two-year confidence-and-supply deal with the Conservatives at Westminster.
The DUP knows it needs to change this narrative and quickly.
Its move represents a bid to position itself firmly at the forefront of the campaign to scrap the protocol.
If he ultimately follows through with the threat to collapse the executive, Donaldson will be banking that unionist fury over the Brexit border will trump the inevitable anger that will be directed at a party that brings down devolution in the middle of a pandemic and at a time when 335,000 are stuck on waiting lists.
Moreover, it is a bet that many in the unionist and loyalist community have reached the conclusion that a Stormont overseeing the implementation of an Irish Sea border is a Stormont not worth saving.

https://www.thejournal.ie/agri-food-checks-northern-ireland-ports-protocol-5672022-Feb2022/,"LAST UPDATE|3 Feb 2022
CHECKS ON CERTAIN goods entering Northern Ireland are continuing to take place, despite an order from the DUP’s Agriculture Minister to stop checks last night.
Minister Edwin Poots, whose officials are responsible for carrying out checks under the Northern Ireland Protocol, ordered his permanent secretary to stop checks on agricultural goods into the North at midnight last night.
The direction itself relates to sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks required by the protocol. The customs procedures on Irish Sea trade are unaffected by his instruction.
Both Downing Street and the EU Commission have said that the checks are continuing to take place despite the order from Poots last night.
“As we speak checks are continuing to take place at ports in Northern Ireland, as they have done before,” a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
“We are monitoring the situation closely and keeping the legal position under review.”
Speaking in the Dáil this afternoon, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the Irish government’s position on the issue is “very clear”.
“The British government has signed an international agreement which includes the Protocol of Northern Ireland as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. That is now international law and the British government has an obligation to act in a way that’s consistent with international law,” Coveney said.
He said the government doesn’t regard Poots’ decision as “consistent with the obligations the United Kingdom has under the protocol.
“My understanding is the checks are continuing today whilst while senior officials try to get legal clarity on this issue,” he said.
European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said the EU’s observers in Northern Ireland were satisfied the required checks were still being carried out.
“We have seen this announcement, obviously we are monitoring the situation on the ground – we have experts who are on the ground in Northern Ireland precisely in relation to the issue of checks,” he said.
The “preliminary information” from those experts “is indeed that those checks are continuing”.
Malmer would not be drawn on whether or not the Brexit trade deal would be suspended if the requirements of the Northern Ireland Protocol were not met.
“I’m not going to get into speculation about what we would undertake in case the checks were to stop … for the moment our indications are that the checks are ongoing.”
Downing Street has said that whether or not the checks take place is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and not the UK Government.
Calls for clarity
There have been calls from port workers in Northern Ireland for the local Government to provide clarity on the situation.
Seamus Leheny of Logistics NI said the sector has been plunged into confusion following the order from Poots.

Leheny said businesses received advice to continue to complete paperwork.
“There is a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety with businesses, they weren’t too sure what they had to do, did they still have to fulfil the administration with regards to moving products of animal origin in here,” he told the PA news agency.
“Generally the advice this morning from government departments is that you must still complete the paperwork to move goods in here. I’m not really too sure what is happening at the border control posts, we’ve not been told what is happening yet… but at the moment we have been told to keep doing the customs and keep doing the phytosanitary paperwork.”
He added: “We just need some stability and clarity, and that’s what is lacking.
Leheny said around 85% of movements do not require any checks, 12% need just paperwork checked and 3% require a physical inspection.
He said moving checks to the Irish border would be a “massive problem” with 12,000 goods vehicles crossing the border every day.
‘Extremely unhelpful’
Speaking earlier today, European Commissioner Mairéad McGuinness described the order by Poots to stop checks on certain goods at Northern Ireland’s ports from this morning as “extremely unhelpful”.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme, McGuinness criticised the order.
“I think, to put it at its mildest, this is extremely unhelpful to have this news at this time of a new year, when all efforts are being made on our side… to find solutions with the United Kingdom to specific problems,” she said.
“This announcement has created uncertainty and unpredictability and certainly no stability. I’m not sure what the purpose of this movie is.”
McGuinness said checks on goods into Northern Ireland is required to protect the European Single Market and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and that ending checks was not a constructive way of resolving issues with the NI Protocol.
She added that there will be a call between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic later today.
The comments were echoed by a European Commission spokesman who said “the protocol is the one and only solution we have found with the UK to protect the Good Friday Agreement.”
The spokesperson said Sefcovic will continue discussions with Truss on finding durable solutions for the people of Northern Ireland.
“He will recall that controls on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain are a key element of the protocol.
“They are necessary for Northern Irish business and citizens to continue to benefit from access to the single market for goods.
“They are also necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“The European Commission remains steadfast in our efforts to facilitate the implementation of the protocol, while safeguarding the integrity of the EU’s single market,” the European Commission spokesperson said in a statement.
‘Frustrations’
The UK’s Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said last night that his officials will not get involved in the dispute over the implementation of agri-food checks.
Related ReadsExplainer: What has led Edwin Poots to halt Brexit agri-checks at Northern Ireland ports?
Speaking on ITV last night, Lewis said the issue was a matter for officials in the North.
“Obviously this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive, it is something that is within their legal remit, obviously we will be looking at the outworkings has taken, exactly what the legal advice is that Edwin has taken, but one of the frustrations is, this I have to say is something we’ve been saying to the European Union for some time, was the kind of thing that we could see happening,” he said.
“It’s exactly the sort of thing that we have been warning about in terms of the stability of the executive and the decisions the Executive ministers will take in order to make sure that products can move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in a way that they always have done.”
But this morning, Simon Hoare, the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee in the House of Commons, suggested the reputation of the UK was at stake if the protocol was breached.
“In relation to NI Protocol checks: I’m a Conservative. I believe in the rule of law and adhering to obligations we voluntarily entered,” he tweeted.
“There’s no ifs and buts on this. The reputation of the UK on these matters is important. Anyone who cares about the UK should feel the same.”

Other parties at Stormont insist the civil service has a duty to comply with Stormont’s legal obligations to carry out the checks under the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
But Poots said legal advice he had sought on the issue supported his view that he was entitled to stop the checks.
A spokesman for Poots’ department said: “The minister has received senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis.”
Asked whether officials would comply with Poots’ direction and whether hauliers should expect checks to be carried out today, the Daera spokesman said: “Nothing further to add.”
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said the decision to halt Northern Ireland Protocol checks would be a “breach of international law”.
“If a political decision is taken by a minister in Northern Ireland to stop all checks in ports on goods coming across the Irish Sea, coming into Northern Ireland, that is effectively a breach of international law.
“And I would remind everybody that the protocol is part of an international agreement.
“It was agreed and ratified by the UK and the EU. And its implementation is not only part of an international treaty, but it is part of international law.
“And so to deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty I think would be a very serious matter indeed.
“It’s essentially playing politics with legal obligations. And I certainly hope that it doesn’t happen, as has been threatened.”
While he did not name Poots or the DUP, Coveney said he suspected the move was “far more about politics than it is an effort to try and find compromise”.
He told the Seanad: “We should also put on the record that the protocol was designed and conceived and agreed to protect the Good Friday Agreement at the time, in the context of the fallout on this island of Brexit, and all its dimensions fully recognise the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.”

The meeting comes a day after a French court released a British trawler impounded for a week as part of the deepening dispute.
David Frost will sit down with French Europe Minister Clement Beaune to continue negotiations after several days of tense exchanges between the leaders of the two countries.
Frost is a staunch defender of Brexit while Beaune is a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, not shy of making clear his belief that France should not pay for what he sees as Britain’s mistake of leaving the EU.
The two have also sparred on social media. Their meeting is set to be held behind closed doors and no press conference is planned.
French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said there would also be a European Commission meeting on the issue during a visit by Frost tomorrow, but this is yet to be confirmed by Brussels.

Yesterday evening, the impounded trawler, the Cornelis Gert Jan, left the French northern port of Le Havre after receiving permission to leave, an AFP correspondent said.
Its captain, Jondy Ward, still faces charges of gathering two tons of scallops in French waters without a proper licence.
But the lawyer for the ship’s captain, Mathieu Croix, told AFP a court in the nearby city of Rouen had allowed it to leave without posting any financial guarantee.
The court rejected the state’s demand that the trawler remain impounded until a €150,000 bond had been deposited, he said.
“It is a good decision, of a kind that will allow the tensions to drop,” said the lawyer. “French justice is independent from political pressure,” he added.
Ward, who was present in court for the hearing, afterwards joined his seven crew members to begin the journey back, smiling for journalists on the shore.
The captain still faces a trial in Le Havre on 11 August 2022 on charges of non-authorised fishing in French waters by a boat from outside the European Union, which carry a maximum fine of €75,000.
‘All options on table’
The dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights has strained already troubled relations between Paris and London following Britain’s exit from the European Union and has threatened to escalate into a full-blown trade war.

While British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday made it clear that London’s position had not changed there are signs both sides favour diplomacy in a bid to avoid the situation worsening.
Attal emphasised that “all options were on the table” regarding future sanctions after Macron put off implementing trade sanctions to give the talks a chance.
France has threatened to ban British boats from unloading their catches at French ports and to subject all British imports to inspections.
Under a deal agreed by Britain and the EU late last year, European fishing vessels can continue to ply UK waters if they can prove they operated there in the past.
But dozens of French boats have had their applications to operate in the UK’s fish-rich waters rejected.
The total volumes affected are tiny in terms of overall France-UK bilateral trade.
But analysts say Macron is keen to take a hard line against Johnson as he eyes re-election in 2022 polls while the British premier is also keen to talk tough in the wake of Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-northern-ireland-protocol-5785394-Jun2022/,"THE UK’s NORTHERN Ireland minister has said his government will soon publish legislation that will override the Protocol to reverse “ridiculously excessive” checks on goods moving within the United Kingdom’s internal market.
It comes amid a stand-off between the UK and the EU over the Protocol, an agreement designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland but which instead created fresh checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said Britain’s plans to act unilaterally over the Northern Ireland Protocol would be “deeply damaging” and mark a “historic low point”.
The legislation is expected to be produced in the coming days by Boris Johnson’s government.
Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns said the legislation will be published soon.
“We have been very clear with the EU that, if they can broaden the mandate . . . that we are absolutely determined and willing to engage with the EU to reach a negotiated settlement, that is absolutely in the best interest of both sides,”Burns told RTE Morning Ireland.
The reality is that we have now got ridiculously excessive checks on goods that are moving within the United Kingdom’s internal market that will never go near the Irish Republic

“But the vice president has been very clear that he cannot move beyond the mandate of the proposals that he put in place last October and we have been clear with him that those do not go anywhere near far enough in achieving the goals the United Kingdom would like to achieve.
Burns said the UK government “recognises the attractiveness” of the agreement for business in Northern Ireland, but said the restrictions on goods moving within the UK’s internal market needs to be reversed.
Meanwhile,addressing the European Parliament this morning, Martin said the UK Government’s proposed legislation to override key parts of the Brexit deal would be “to the benefit of absolutely no-one”.
The taoiseach also said during his visit to Strasbourg that he disagrees with the UK Government’s handling of the protocol and accused it of failing to engage with the EU.
Responding to Martin’s assertions that the EU will be flexible in its negotiations, Burns said: “That is not our lived experience from the conversations that we’ve been having with the EU over very many months.
“They talk of flexibility within the terms, within the constraints of the proposals they tabled last October. We have been clear with them that those proposals do not go as far as they would need to go to respect the integrity of the United Kingdom’s internal market.”
The Conservative minister added that the legislation will be “lawful and appropriate”.
“It’s a very, very simple proposition here. We’re simply saying the goods moving within our own country – with the exception of live animals, which we can see the need for checks on, obviously – the goods moving within our own country should move freely,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poots-ni-protocol-significant-vistory-5473897-Jun2021/,"OUTGOING DUP LEADER Edwin Poots has said that he has received a personal assurance from the UK government that significant changes will be made to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Poots, who was forced to announce his resignation as leader last week following an internal party revolt over his decision to proceed with nominating a Stormont First Minister, predicted there would be a “significant victory” on the protocol in July.
Jeffrey Donaldson was confirmed this afternoon as thenext leaderof the DUP.
Brexit minister David Frost said today it is “hard to see” how the NI Protocol can survive in its current form.
The UK Government and the EU are locked in a dispute over the implementation of the protocol, the part of the Brexit divorce deal aimed at avoiding a hard border.
Under the terms of the deal, deliveries of chilled meats – including sausages and burgers – could be effectively banned from crossing the Irish Sea from Britain to Northern Ireland at the end of the month.
The UK is considering unilaterally extending the grace period covering sausage shipments, something that Brussels has warned could trigger a retaliation.

But unionists are opposed to the protocol and have repeatedly called for it to be scrapped.
In an interview with theBBC,Poots said he proceeded with the appointment of Paul Givan as First Minister last week, because he believed he could oppose the protocol more effectively with a functioning Assembly.
He said: “My focus is on the Northern Ireland Protocol because that is what makes a constitutional difference to Northern Ireland.
When asked if he had received the assurances personally, Poots said: “Yes.”
He added: “We are looking to these changes happening in July, most likely early July.
“We believe that there is a significant victory to be won on the protocol. I will hand over at the end of June [to the new DUP leader] and hopefully most of the work will actually be achieved by that stage and we can make those gains.”
When asked what was the nature of the changes he had been promised, Poots said: “We haven’t got detail but fundamentally for me the issues that really need to be resolved are the issues around the constitution because UK lawyers argued that the Act of Union was seceded by the Withdrawal Act.
“How ridiculous is that, that people are signing up to an agreement which doesn’t have democracy contained in it? And then we have all of the trading issues of course, which have been highlighted over and over again. My ultimate desire is that the protocol goes in its entirety.
“We have been promised there will be a significant win on the protocol, that is what the Secretary of State [Brandon Lewis] is indicating at this stage.”

Asked about Poots’ comments, David Frost told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee: “I can’t comment on private conversations and accounts of them. But we haven’t made a secret of the fact that we find it hard to see how, as currently operated, important elements of the protocol are sustainable.
“I don’t think that’s a new judgment. We have also said that we are considering all our options, and we are doing so.
“There is a real-world timetable to things that needs to be taken into account when we do that.
“That’s where we are at the moment, we are actively considering the options to deal with a situation that is hard to see as sustainable.”
Sinn Féin north Belfast MP John Finucane said Poots had not provided any detail of the proposed changes he had been promised.
“I would be very reluctant to take what Edwin Poots has said today, I think I would want to see the detail because ultimately these are conversations between the British Government and the European Union,” Finucane said.
“It is not within the Secretary of State’s gift as to what he does with the protocol – it is an agreement his Government entered into with the European Union.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-attorney-general-northern-ireland-protocol-5762578-May2022/,"THE NEW NORTHERN Ireland Assembly will meet later with the DUP set to block the election of a Speaker.
Ninety MLAs will gather in the chamber after last week’s Northern Ireland Assembly election saw Sinn Féin emerge as the largest party for the first time.
The DUP had previously indicated that it will not nominate for the position of deputy First Minister, which will prevent the forming of a new Executive, as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Unionists oppose the post-Brexit treaty because of the economic barriers it creates between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson has now said his party will not back a Speaker, which will leave the Assembly unable to function.
Donaldson said in a statement: “Today the DUP will not support the election of a speaker in the Assembly.
“Some parties who just a few months ago were mocking the promise of decisive action from the DUP in relation to the Protocol are the very same parties now feigning surprise and outrage at a political party keeping its promise to the electorate.
“Devolution was restored on the basis of the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ agreement. We have seen delivery of, or significant progress towards, nearly every aspect of that document except one.
“That is the UK Government’s promise to legislate to respect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.
“Twenty-eight months since that promise was made and 16 months since it should have been delivered, unionists cannot stand accused of lacking patience.”
The DUP leader added: “I have both patience and resolve in equal measure to see the Irish Sea border removed and stable as well as sustainable devolution restored.
“Unionist concerns on the Northern Ireland Protocol are not merely some political squabble which is impacting upon Stormont.
MLAs will meet an noon where they will sign the register and designate as nationalist, unionist or other.
Donaldson will not be in the chamber as he has chosen to retain his position as an MP, despite being elected as an MLA for Lagan Valley a week ago.

Welcome aboard@little_pengellyThank you for stepping up to cover this interim period. Lagan Valley is a great constituency to represent.https://t.co/UQGp1H7EPN
Instead, former party MP Emma Little-Pengelly has been co-opted to replace her leader on the Stormont benches.
As the largest party, the new 27 Sinn Féin MLAs will take their position on the benches on the right-hand side of the Speaker’s chair for the first time.
It is entitled to nominate its Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill as First Minister, but she will not be able to take up the role without the DUP nominating a deputy First Minister.
Under the rules of the devolved power-sharing administration, both roles are equal and one cannot be in office without the other.

Since last week’s election, O’Neill has repeatedly called for the DUP to re-enter the Executive so it can begin to tackle challenges such as the cost-of-living crisis and spiralling hospital waiting lists.
In a tweet this morning, she said: “Today is the day we should be forming an Executive to put money in people’s pockets and to start to fix our health service.”
“The DUP have confirmed they will punish the public and not turn up. They are disgracefully holding the public to ransom for their Brexit mess. Shameful,” she said.

The Stormont sitting comes amid increased tensions between the Westminster Government and the EU over the working of the protocol – which forms part of the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK will have “no choice but to act” if the EU does not show enough “flexibility” over post-Brexit checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.
‘Anti-democratic’
Jacob Rees-Mogg this morning said the EU is trying to make the UK “feel bad” about Brexit through its approach to dealing with the Protocol.
However, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has instead insisted that the UK Government would be acting in an “anti-democratic” way if it goes through with its threat to override elements of the post-Brexit treaty.
Government ministers have been increasingly hinting they could take unilateral action on the protocol, with Boris Johnson arguing the Good Friday Agreement is more important than the Protocol he signed up to.
European leaders have warned the UK not to make the incendiary move, amid fears it could provoke a trade war with Britain’s largest trading partner.
Rees-Mogg, Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency told GB News: “I think it (the EU) wants to make the UK feel bad about having left the European Union and that underpins its whole policy and it doesn’t really mind about the consequences of that. And we just have to get on with life and recognise that we have left.
“We have to make our own way. We are an independent country, and what the EU wants and thinks is secondary,” he said.
“The Paymaster General, Michael Ellis, has made a speech in Brussels today, making it very clear that we are, if not at the end of the road, very close to it.
“To cancel the TCA (EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement), the European Union would need unanimity, and it seems to me that’s a pretty high bar to get.
“And you have to say to the European Union, does it really want to punish its consumers at a time of rising inflation? And inflation in a lot of the EU countries is higher than it is in the UK.”
Rees-Mogg said the Protocol needs to be revised and that the treaty provides for its revision.
But Coveney said the EU wanted to implement the protocol with “flexibility and pragmatism” to take account of unionist concerns.
He told BBC Radio Four: “What is being looked for in Northern Ireland, from business people and many in the unionist community, what they want is to ensure that trade within the United Kingdom is facilitated and checks are removed when possible on goods that are staying in Northern Ireland.

“That is what the EU Commission wants to resolve but unfortunately they can’t do that if they don’t have a partner and there is a lot going on this week in the context of ratcheting up language, increasing tension unnecessarily between the UK and the EU.”
Related ReadsJohnson says protocol causing ‘real problems’ in Northern Ireland and must be ‘fixed’Coveney unsure if UK government interested in working to overcome Northern Ireland problemsLiz Truss ‘will not shy away’ from taking action on Northern Ireland Protocol
Asked what were the implications of the UK Government taking unilateral action on the protocol, Coveney added: “People across the United Kingdom need to understand what that means, it means that your Government is deliberately deciding to breach international law, which is something that every former prime minister still alive in Britain has warned against.
He added: “Don’t forget this treaty was designed and ratified and agreed by the British Government under this Prime Minister.
“He stood for election and got a huge mandate from the British people on the back of that deal and now is blaming the deal for the problems in Northern Ireland.”
In an interview with Bloomberg, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the the protocol is causing economic and political harm and called on the EU to be flexible.
He said: “It’s a serious situation. It’s important to me that we also protect the Good Friday Agreement and we resume power-sharing in Northern Ireland.”
‘Painfully necessary’
The UK Attorney General has said that action over the Protocol is “painfully, apparently necessary”, in a major hint the Government will override parts of the post-Brexit agreement.
Suella Braverman, the Government’s chief legal adviser, did not deny the Times’ report that she believes overriding the Protocol would be legal because the EU’s implementation of it is “disproportionate and unreasonable”.

She told BBC’s Question Time she could not comment because of conventions binding the Government’s law officers, but suggested unilateral action could be required.
“The economy of Northern Ireland is worth less than 1% of the whole EU economy, but yet the number of checks that they are applying on the Irish Sea is totally out of proportion to that, and is disproportionately bigger than the number of checks they apply on the rest of their borders,” she said.
“If this does actually go forward – because there’s a decision yet to be made, I have to be clear, and that is a decision for Government, Cabinet.
“But looking at the way things are at the moment, taking action to protect Northern Ireland and the integrity of the United Kingdom, taking action to remove the burdensome checks and bureaucracy on the border, which is causing traders to stop trading with Great Britain and in fact, move their trade to Northern Ireland.
“Taking action to try and re-establish the place of the Good Friday Agreement so that both communities feel part of Northern Ireland and the east-west connections are preserved just as strongly as north-south… that action is becoming painfully, apparently necessary.”
Jonathan Jones QC, who resigned as the head of the Government Legal Department in 2020 over a previous attempt to override the Protocol, warned the move could break international law.
He told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “If that’s been proposed now then that’s seriously problematic, and it feels like a rerun of what happened two years ago when the Government was proposing to break international law.
“We know that the EU will be very cross if that happens and I think it’s understandable that they would be cross, because this would be a unilateral act and it would very severely damage the relationship we will continue to need with the EU post-Brexit.”
Meanwhile, David Frost, the architect of the 2019 withdrawal agreement that included the Protocol, was pressing for Johnson to tear up the deal on Northern Ireland despite the risks of a trade war with the EU.
He used his Daily Telegraph column to say ministers have “no option now other than to act unilaterally to disapply part or all of the Protocol”.
“We may, of course, face EU retaliation, though it would be disproportionate to the trade involved, only arguably legal and entirely self-defeating,” he wrote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/factfind-castex-letter-uk-france-fishing-row-brexit-5589055-Nov2021/,"
AS THE FISHING row between France and the UK rumbles on, a letter about the stand-off from French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has taken centre stage in the disagreement.
Thesimmering fish fight has threatened to boil overin recent days as President Emmanuel Macron’s government is incensed that the UK has not issued some French boats with licences since Brexit took full effect at the start of 2021.
Paris has vowed that unless licences are approved, it will ban UK boats from unloading their catches at French ports from tomorrow and impose checks on all products brought to France from Britain.
The long-running squabble was dramatically dialled up last Friday evening when Alex Wickham of the Politico news website tweeted a scanned copy of the letter from Castex to Von der Leyen along with the message:
“NEW: Huge escalation of French fishing row tonight. Extraordinary letter from French PM Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen obtained by POLITICO. France tells Brussels it must demonstrate that Britain has been damaged by leaving the EU.”
Wickham added a follow-up tweet which claimed that France was asking for EU support on fishing and had told Von Der Leyen that “Britain must be damaged by Brexit”.

His tweets included a paraphrased translation of one section of the letter: “It is indispensable to demonstrate to European public opinion that more damage is suffered by leaving the EU than by remaining.”
In another tweet Wickham added: “The key line in the letter is where Castex explicitly admits the fishing row is about Brexit. He calls on the EU to cause ‘damage’ to Britain as a warning to other nations who might consider leaving in future. UK will seize on this as evidence of bad faith from France.”
Wickham’s Twitter thread quickly unleashed a flurry of similar reporting in UK news outlets, as well as an out-pouring of accusations fromjournalists,politiciansandothersthat he had mistranslated the letter.

Very disillusioned today by the number of senior British journalists lazily repeating the@alexwickham@BorisJohnsonlie that the@JeanCASTEX’ letter spoke of ‘punishing’ the UK.It didn’t. Surely their French is up to understanding that?
“Lost in translation I’m afraid,” France’s Ambassador to the UK Catherine Colonnatweeted.
Members of the British government quickly seized on the early reporting about the letter.
Brexit negotiator David Frostwrote: “That is why we are concerned and surprised by the comments seemingly made by @JeanCASTEX to @vonderLeyen that: ‘it is indispensable to show European public opinion that … it causes more damage to leave the EU than to stay in.’”
Boris Johnson was also quizzed about the matter at a press conference in Rome.Reporters at the scene saidthe UK prime minister was “visibly angry” when discussing the letter, which he said left him “puzzled”.
“I don’t believe that is compatible either with the spirit or the letter of the Withdrawal Agreement of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement [TCA],” Johnson said.

The Financial Timesreportedthat Number 10 described the letter as stating “the UK should be punished for leaving the EU”. Wickham alsoreportedthat officials in the UK government were referring to the document as the “punishment letter”.
The mistranslation of the letter (more on that soon) also provoked a slew of scathing articles in pro-Brexit media outlets such as TheExpress, TheTelegraphand TheSpectator.
Wickham has said he is happy with his reporting and the translation his outlet, Politico, used. He said on Twitter yesterday: “Despite what some want to believe our translation and reading were correct and this is a story that rightly leads the news.”
The nub of the row boils down to whether Castex was recommending “causing” harm to the UK because of Brexit – hence punishing them – or “showing” the harm that leaving the European Union causes.
Two translations requested byThe Journalof the paragraph show that Castex was actually seeking to demonstrate the damage that can result from leaving the EU. He was not calling for the UK to be damaged because of Brexit. This was a standard EU line throughout the Brexit deal negotiations as the union repeatedly stressed that countries outside the bloc could not have the same advantages as member states.
Dr Edward Arnold, Professor in French and European Studies at Trinity College Dublin, translated the controversial paragraphs of the letter forThe Journal:
This shows that Wickham’s translation (and Frost’s comments) left out a reference to “respecting commitments”.
Dr Eamon Maher, Director of the National Centre for Franco Irish Studies and a member of the lecturing staff in the Department of Humanities on the Tallaght Campus of TU Dublin, also translated the paragraph, although he said it was not “a perfect translation”:
The independent translations differ slightly – underlining how the argument erupted in the first place. However, they are both clear that commitments undertaken or entered into were mentioned, a piece of missing context from much of the reporting.
There is also no mention of punishment, something that Downing Street had interpreted from the paragraphs.

With France’s deadline fast approaching, Britain warned Paris that it will take action if it does not withdraw its “unreasonable” threats to impose trade measures.
There was no sign of the tensions as Johnson welcomed Macron to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow today, with the two leaders smiling and chatting for several minutes.
However, Macron reiterated that the French ban on UK boats “will take effect at midnight tonight” if the two sides failed to achieve a breakthrough.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss demanded that France rescind its threat to disrupt cross-Channel trade or face legal action.
Truss told Sky News that “we will use the mechanisms of our trade agreement with the EU to take action” if France pressed ahead with its plans.
“The French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry, and they need to withdraw those threats,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-explainer-migrants-brexit-shortages-delivery-5568840-Oct2021/,"A BIG PART of the discussion around the UK’s Brexit referendum involved the topics  of immigration and free movement.
It might not have been the sole reason people voted for Brexit, but it played a part in the Brexiteer argument for leaving the European Union. Now, years on, the topic of immigration is still a big one in the UK.
Over the past few weeks, The Good Information Project has been focusing on the European Union’s current migration issues. With free movement between the EU and the UK (with the exception of Ireland because of the common travel area) having ended on 31 December 2020, the series looks at what impacts have been felt.
On this week’s podcast, we look at how migration has been affected post-Brexit. From the figures available, it appears that pre-pandemic, a significant percentage of low-skilled factory and construction jobs in the UK were held by EU-born workers, as were factory and machine operator jobs, and jobs in food preparation.
Given the changes post-Brexit, and the need for EU citizens (except Irish citizens) to get visas in order to work, what impact has this had on these industries, and in turn on the availability of goods and services?

New figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that overall exports from the UK fell by £5.6 billion, or 19.3%.
It was driven by a £5.6 billion, or 40.7%, plunge in exports of goods to the EU, the ONS said.
Imports also fell, by £8.9 billion overall (21.6%), while imports from the EU dropped £6.6 billion (28%), the figures show.
The falls in imports and exports are the largest since records began in 1997, the ONS said, as a £200 million (1.7%) increase in non-EU exports failed to make up for the decline within the bloc.

British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) head of economics Suren Thiru said: “While changes in data collection limit historic comparisons, the significant slump in UK exports of goods to the EU, particularly compared to non-EU trade, provides an ominous indication of the damage being done to post-Brexit trade with the EU by the current border disruption.

The end of the transition period coincided with the spread of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, causing lorry drivers to need tests to cross the border at the English Channel.
Another national lockdown was also imposed at the beginning of the month.
Since then, other measures have shown that trade levels have in part recovered.
A UK government spokesman said: “A unique combination of factors, including stockpiling last year, Covid lockdowns across Europe, and businesses adjusting to our new trading relationship, made it inevitable that exports to the EU would be lower this January than last.
UK pharma exports to Ireland increase by 224%
Companies had been stockpiling ahead of the end of the transition period, and may also have been using their stock instead of buying new goods in January.

The export of food and live animals to the EU plummeted by around 64% in January, the figures show, potentially because of strict checks by the EU.
The Scottish Seafood Association has reported that sign-offs on consignments are now taking six times longer than previously.
The EU imposed full customs requirements on exports coming from Great Britain in January; however, the UK decided it did not immediately want to start full controls.
Yesterday, the UK government again delayed its plans to introduce full border checks with the EU until early next year, after they were originally planned for July.

“Offering tax credits to support firms to adapt to the new arrangements would help many address new burdens and requirements better.”
Imports of services dropped 2% in January, while exports fell 1%.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-windsor-agreement-6010371-Mar2023/,"DUP DELIBERATIONS ON the Windsor Framework will not be knocked off course by rhetoric and will instead be grounded in reality, the party leader has insisted.
Sir Jeffrey Donaldson acknowledged improvements had been made to post-Brexit Irish Sea trading arrangements for Northern Ireland but said questions remain about “core sectors of our economy”.
He reiterated that his party will take time to secure “clear answers” on aspects of the proposed arrangements they still have questions about.
His comments, contained in a message to party supporters, came as Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald again called on the DUP to lift its blockade on devolution in Northern Ireland and end the powersharing “limbo”.
McDonald and Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill met party activists in Belfast this morning to update them on the week’s developments.
The UK and EU are hoping their proposed framework to deliver changes to the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol will be enough to convince the DUP to return to devolved government.
While the DUP has made clear it will make a collective decision, factoring in views across the party, some prominent DUP figures including Sammy Wilson, Lord Dodds and Ian Paisley have already expressed concerns whether the changes to the Irish Sea trading arrangements go far enough to address their concerns over trade and sovereignty.
Sir Jeffrey updated party members and supporters in a message this morning.
The message, seen by the PA news agency, stated:
“This party will always stand up for Northern Ireland. Our rationale is to look at the long term and build a better Northern Ireland for the next generation.
“There are some who would say ‘yes’ to anything and others who would say ‘no’ to everything because they are more focused on where they have come from than where they are going.
“As the custodians of Northern Ireland’s future, however, we must carefully weigh up the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of each situation.
“Where improvements have been made, we will recognise progress and where questions remain, we will take the time to get clear answers.
Checks
The protocol created checks and processes on the movement of goods from GB into Northern Ireland.
The latest deal between London and Brussels seeks to remove many of those post-Brexit trade barriers, creating a new system for the flow of goods into Northern Ireland.

In the message, Sir Jeffrey criticised rival parties at Stormont that had supported the implementation of the protocol.
“People said it couldn’t be done, but this party has proved that it could. Brussels came back to the table and changes have been made,” he said.
“Whilst we will study the fine print and take expert advice, improvements have been made especially regarding trade however questions remain over core sectors of our economy.
He added:
“Those pro-protocol parties were more focused on the EU’s interests than they were on Northern Ireland’s interests.”
Sinn Féin view
Speaking to the PA news agency at the party meeting in Belfast, Sinn Fein leader Ms McDonald said there was nothing to prevent the DUP returning to Stormont while it sought clarity on aspects of the framework.
“I think we need to be very careful here not to keep playing the politics of this long,” she said.
“Of course people need to work their way through the detail of this deal. We’re doing that, everybody needs to do that. We have consistently said that that can be done whilst the Assembly and the Executive is up and active and delivering for people.
“So we would encourage everyone, but particularly the DUP, to make their decision now, and to give people what they want and what they need, which is government.
She added:
“A return of government or return of the assembly, respecting the democratic verdict of all of the electorate, nationalists, republicans, unionists and loyalists also is a win for everyone.
McDonald said the DUP returning to devolution was the “right and sensible thing” to do.
“For us, it is now all about getting government back up and running.
“We now have the negotiations concluded, there is a deal on the table, we are absolutely satisfied that it ensures no hardening of the border on the island, protection of the Good Friday Agreement, protection of the all-Ireland economy and of course, access to the European market, which is so essential for the economic opportunities here.
“And now it’s decision time. That is really it.”
Earlier today, Alliance leader Naomi Long warned that her partyis willing to test the legalityof Stormont’s “discriminatory” voting structures.
Addressing her party conference in Belfast this afternoon, Long expressed frustration that the UK and Irish governments had not moved to deliver reform of the powersharing institutions to release them from the unionist/nationalist “straitjacket” created by the Good Friday Agreement.","4.50pm, 4 Mar 2023",

AN IRISH SENATOR has criticised a social media post by the British Governmentabout the Northern Ireland Protocol as “deceitful”, while a TD said that it was a “Trumpian” move.
In a 30-second-long video viewed over half a million times, it is stated that the Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to protect the peace process and respect all communities in Northern Ireland, but “is doing the opposite”.
The clip,posted by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, claims that the Protocol “prevents” the free flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and that 78% of people in Northern Ireland have said that the Protocol could be improved.
Most goods can be sent between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but there is additional paperwork and costs associated with some goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland is still in the Single Market.
This has caused problems for pre-Brexit trade habits, and has lead to some shifts in how companies in Northern Ireland operate since Brexit came into effect in January 2021.
Fianna Fáil Senator Erin McGreehan, who is from Co Louth, toldThe Journalthat the video from the British Government was “deceitful”.

“The issue is that the British Government entered into the Protocol, they knew what it was, they signed up to an agreement.
“If a unionist party put that video out, I would say ‘That’s their view’ – I mightn’t understand it, but I accept it’. But this is the British government, which is working to try to amend as many parts of the Protocol as it possibly can.”
She said that the EU have been “honest brokers” and have taken every opportunity to understand Ireland, which she says cannot be said for the British Government.
The EU and the UK Government are currently engaged in negotiations to find solutions to the practical problems with how the Protocol works – despite the UK calling for the Protocol to be removed entirely.
“[EU Commissioner] Maroš Šefčovič came to the border here in Co Louth, he met people who would be affected by the Protocol. He listened to them.”
She added that it was “quite bizarre” that an international agreement that was signed up to just over a year ago is now being re-negotiated.
Though acknowledging that there are issues with how the Protocol operates, McGreehan says that it’s mostly around the practical details of the trading arrangement, rather than the whole Protocol.
“Imagine the Irish government putting out ads saying the peace process is at risk. We wouldn’t be putting out ads – we’d be going to the North and meeting with people. That’s leadership. If Boris Johnson was serious about the peace process, serious about their unionist friends, they should show leadership and go sit down and make this work.”

Fine Gael TD for Dublin Neale Richmond said: “This is a very disappointing tweet and a pivot from what has been an attempted change in tone towards agreed resolution.
When asked whether the timing of the tweet is a concern, particularly during huge lorry tailbacks in England, and ahead of Northern Ireland’s elections in May, Richmond said that he is concerned these are “distractions produced for a domestic audience”.
“I do fear that campaigns like this, especially from an organ of the state, are a very worrying development.”
The British Government’s new lead on negotiations with the EU over the Protocol is Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. She visited Northern Ireland on Thursday, and expressed determination to secure a deal on the Protocol that would win universal support in Northern Ireland.
The visit came amid continued warnings from the DUP that it will walk away from the devolved administration at Stormont if major changes to how trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain works are not secured rapidly.
Ireland and the EU have maintained that the Protocol will not be removed, and repeatedly stress that it was signed up to and implemented by the British Government, which has invested significant funds to implement Brexit trading arrangements.
Truss said this week: “I want to make significant progress by February. That’s important but it’s important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community.”
Meanwhile, in the English coastal town of Dover, dramatically long queues of lorries have been seen parked along a motorway, stretching back for miles. More Brexit rules came into force from the beginning of the year, causing problems for smaller businesses in particular and resulting in long delays as trucks try to bring goods into the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-trawler-france-fishing-row-5591380-Nov2021/,"THE BRITISH TRAWLER that was impounded by France amid the post-Brexit fishing row has been released by the French authorities and is setting sail from Le Havre.
The Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan left the northern French port today after being held there since last week, when France accused it of fishing in its waters without a proper licence.
Video showed the blue, white and red trawler departing the quayside after dusk.
The public affairs director of the vessel’s owner Macduff Shellfish confirmed it has been released by French authorities.
“The court (of appeal) determined that no bond was required for the release of the vessel,” Andrew Brown said in a statement to the PA news agency.
He added: “We are pleased to have this matter resolved and delighted that our crew and vessel are now able to return home. The crew have acted with calmness and professionalism throughout the entire incident.”
“They are in good spirits, looking forward to return to their loved ones and are grateful for all the messages of support received from the British public.”
The ruling came after the boat’s captain, Jondy Ward, appeared at the Court of Appeal in Rouen earlier today.
“If it goes right we’ll get out of here today,” the Irish skipper told reporters after the hearing.
Ward explained that French maritime police detained the trawler last week for not being on a European register when it was fishing off the Normandy coast.
The skipper said he did not know if it was an error on the part of UK or French officials.
“We had everything in order on the bridge, as far as I was concerned we had everything in place to be legal,” he said.
He said the boat was “definitely” caught in the middle of the Franco-British spat over post-Brexit fishing arrangements.
The comments were echoed by his lawyer, Mathieu Croix, who told reporters outside the courtroom: “We’re clearly caught in a political game as there is a whole story spun around this entire case, whereas in fact it is a rather mundane affair over fishing in an area that is supposedly out of bounds, and about licences that may or may not have been given and catch amounts that are relatively modest.

“From then on, given the current political climate, the case blew up to levels that in our view are totally disproportionate.”
The produce that France says the Cornelis Gert Jan caught illegally in its waters was seized by French maritime police, according to Croix.
Ward faces trial next August regardless of today’s ruling, but the charges could be dropped before then.
At the centre of the post-Brexit fishing dispute are the licences for small French boats, which are issued only if the vessels can demonstrate a history of fishing in British waters.
French President Emmanuel Macron had warned that Paris could block British boats from landing their catches in French ports and tighten customs checks in protest against what it claimed is a refusal by the UK authorities to grant licences to French boats.
However, France suspended the threats at the 11th hour as negotiations continued, a move welcomed by Britain.
Today, Downing Street acknowledged France could reimpose its threats in the fishing row as Brexit minister David Frost prepares to hold talks with France’s Europe minister Clement Beaune.
The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “He will be discussing both the (Northern Ireland) protocol and the fisheries issues, we want to emphasise that our position as regards to how we grant licences has not changed in any way.
“But we are keen to discuss the broader issue of the protocol and come up with substantive changes.
“It’s entirely up to the French government if they want to reimpose the threats that we saw they both announced and stood back from in recent days.”
Asked what success in tomorrow’s meeting in Paris looks like, the spokesman said: “We’re seeking substantive changes to the protocol with the EU and these changes are necessary because the protocol as it is being enforced is extremely challenging.
“So, we want to seek agreement from the EU that they will make the changes necessary so that it can be sustainable in the long term.”
Meanwhile, talks organised by the European Commission to find a solution to the dispute have led to a “better understanding of the outstanding issues”, a commission spokesman has said.
Speaking at a press briefing today, the spokesman said officials from the UK, France, Jersey and the European Commission have been meeting for the past two days.
He said: “These talks have allowed us to chart the way forward on several aspects and have created a positive dynamic aiming at a solution. The technical meetings will continue today, including also with some officials from Guernsey.
“The talks in these past few days have allowed for a better understanding of the outstanding issues which have been impeding quicker progress, and we hope that the positive engagement on all sides will soon translate into concrete results.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-secretary-says-deadlines-are-deadly-amid-calls-to-restore-stormont-6064743-May2023/,"SETTING A DEADLINE for restoring powersharing in Stormont would be “deadly”, according to Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.
He added it is “pointless” to set timelines and the focus is on “getting the job done properly” to ensure the executive can remain for a “very long time” when it returns.
There has been no functioning government in Stormont since last year when the DUP withdrew in protest over the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.
The Windsor Framework recently struck by the UK and EU sought to reduce red tape on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, but the DUP wants further assurances.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Labour former minister Kevin Brennan said: “Given the hugely advantageous position Northern Ireland now finds itself in, as outlined by the Prime Minister [Rishi Sunak] when the Windsor accord was being announced, isn’t it time that powersharing really was restored?
“And isn’t it time the Secretary of State in fact considered a deadline for the restoration of powersharing?”
Heaton-Harris replied: “The one thing I have learned in my role as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is that deadlines are deadly. It is pointless setting timelines on things.
“Getting the job done properly, so when the executive comes back it can be there for a very long time, is the right thing to do. And that is what everyone is working towards.”
Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle later asked Heaton-Harris to reveal what talks were taking place about restoration of powersharing.

Heaton-Harris said there was an “ongoing pattern of formal talks with the parties”, but added: “I would also say to him, one thing I have learned from the negotiations to get the Windsor Framework over the line is that some of these things are best done on a confidential basis, because otherwise, other people get to pull the threads of negotiations and the whole thing falls apart.”
Earlier at Northern Ireland questions, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson highlighted ongoing unionist concerns about the EU’s influence in Northern Ireland, particularly how “divergence from UK law”, could inhibit “our ability to trade with the rest of the United Kingdom”.
He added: “If we are to get Stormont restored on a stable foundation, which is what we want, then we have got to resolve these issues.
“People in Northern Ireland, unionists in particular, need to know that their place in the United Kingdom, which was enshrined and protected in article 1 of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, will be equally enshrined and protected in UK law as a result of any arrangements that are put in place.”
Heaton-Harris replied: “I can give him that assurance from this despatch box, but I know because of the engagement that we have had that he would like to see that in other terms as well.
“That is why I look forward to our continuing conversations so we can work out exactly what the ask is, so I can try and deliver on that.”
In the absence of local ministers, it has fallen on Heaton-Harris to set Northern Ireland’s 2023/24 budget and senior civil servants to run departments.
MPs are considering all stages of the Northern Ireland (Interim Arrangements) Bill today.
Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, opening the second reading debate, said: “The measures in this Bill will ensure a continuation of the current governance arrangements in Northern Ireland… should there be no executive when they expire on 5 June.
“They are not and cannot be a substitute for devolved government… they are by no means ideal, particularly in the context of this financial position.”
He said the UK Government is “acutely concerned about the long-term sustainability of public finances in Northern Ireland”, and said departments are facing “very difficult and unavoidable decisions in the current difficult and frustrating circumstances”.","4.38pm, 10 May 2023",

ACCORDING TO MARK Twain, history does not repeat itself but often rhymes. Of course, Twain did not live through Brexit, where the DJ might change, but the tune stays the same, whether it is requested or not.
Enter the next hopeful to turn the decks, Britain’s latest prime minister, Rishi Sunak.
For just over a week, there was growing speculation that a deal to improve the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol had been agreed upon between the UK and the EU.
Official level negotiations have given way to political exchanges, and yesterday, Sunak had one final meeting with EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, before the two of them announced that the Windsor Framework had been reached, and she drove off for tea with Britain’s new King, Charles III. The deal was done; the King, simply icing on the cake.
For the first time in a long time, there is a sense that genuine progress has been made on the Protocol. Sunak woke up this morning to positive headlines from all the UK’s major newspapers, and he has earned the right to be cautiously optimistic. However, progress is in the eye of the beholder, and as always, the real negotiations for the UK’s Prime Minister are not with the EU, but with his own party and the DUP.
As reports of a deal emerged last week, hardline Brexiters wasted no time in penning opinion pieces forThe Daily Telegraphand securing television interviews to restate their impossible demands – that the Protocol be rewritten, that no EU law apply in Northern Ireland, that the European Court of Justice have no role in adjudicating on the application of single market rules.
Meanwhile, the DUP have their own tests, allseven of whichthey claim must be met if they are to lend their support to Sunak’s deal. The bar they have set is also impossibly high, and they are currently keeping their counsel.

Sunak rightly wants to move beyond endless arguments regarding the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but the political challenges he faces are all too familiar. Many in his party have no real interest in pragmatism anymore, preferring ideological Brexit purity instead. This is an appetite that cannot be satisfied but can be stoked, and Boris Johnson sits in the wings waiting to do just that.
Meanwhile, the DUP have backed themselves into a corner, where anything short of Sunak scrapping the Protocol leaves them open to accusations that they have failed to deliver for the community that they represent.
If Sunak is to succeed, he needs to persuade his unpersuadable MPs of the merits of his deal, or, perhaps more importantly, secure DUP support, which would remove the political cover that their opposition provides the ERG for their intransigence.
Neither outcome seems easy, which leaves Sunak with just one other option – face down opponents within his own party and deliver his deal with the support of the opposition. If it feels like we have been here before, it is because we have, when Theresa May tried and failed, to get her deal through Parliament by courting the support of the Labour Party in 2019.
However, victory without the support of the DUP, or in the face of serious opposition from his own party, will leave Sunak considerably weaker, with the likely consequence being that he suffers the same fate as May.
Sunak’s task is unenviable. If he succeeds, it would be an extraordinary achievement for a PM who remains inexperienced and has appeared, until now, to lack the political nouse or authority to lead effectively. Fail and it will be further confirmation that when it comes to Brexit there is no rhyme, just a life lived on repeat.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-positive-5915400-Nov2022/,"Tadgh McNally reports from the European Parliament.
IRISH MEPS HAVE said that the UK Government’s attitude on the Northern Ireland Protocol has shifted in recent weeks, with more positive sounds now coming from Westminster.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels this afternoon, Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly said that at a meeting between MEPs and UK MPs earlier this week, the Northern Ireland Protocol was the main topic of discussion.
Kelly said that the new British Government appeared willing to resolve the ongoing stalemate around the Protocol.
“I think the fact that elections in Northern Ireland are postponed would tie into the vibes that I got, that this brinkmanship, hopefully, is coming to an end and that the British Government are now seeing sense and they want to come to an arrangement that will solve, hopefully, the protocol and the impasse in Northern Ireland and get the assembly back up and running,” Kelly said.
It comes as technical discussions between the UK and EU are continuing, with Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney saying that a deal is doable before the end of the year.
“Now there’s a sense that something positive is hopefully happening,” Kelly added.
Colm Markey, a Fine Gael MEP for Midlands-North-West, said that there was now “willingness” to move the process on.
Advertisement
“The mood certainly in the room this week was much, much stronger in terms of a willingness to try and move things on,” Markey said.
Despite the potential for a deal, the UK had previously signalled that it would act on the Protocol unilaterally, with legislation currently before the House of Lords.
The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which would override large swathes of the Protocol, has been criticized by the EU and Ireland.
However, the bill has been praised by the DUP, who are currently refusing to return to power sharing at Stormont due to the Protocol.
Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews said that if the bill were to become law, it would force the EU to escalate.
“If the Northern Ireland protocol bill becomes law you’re into a completely different space and it’d be almost impossible for the EU not to escalate to either dispute resolution or specific tariffs against targeted UK goods, so you’re into trade war territory.”
However, Andrews says that the UK currently faces other significant issues and they “can’t afford” further strain on the country’s economy.
It follows on from a mini-budget, which lead to a record fall in the pound and the eventual resignation of Liz Truss as UK Prime Minister.
“That is the reality of it. The new Government is aware of that reality and can ill afford any new headwinds in additions to the ones they already face,” Andrews added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-crown-pint-glass-banned-eu-rules-5777946-May2022/,"
THE UK MAIL on Sunday has claimed that the European Union banned crown symbols from featuring on pint glasses in Britain under rules introduced in 2004.
The newspaper carried a front-page story yesterday that heralded the return of the symbol in time for the beginning of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations for the UK’s Queen Elizabeth later this week.
The crown featured on pint glasses for more than 300 years and was used as a mark to show that they were big enough to hold a full pint.
However, the Mail on Sunday alleged that the EU ordered the removal of crowns in 2004 as part of a directive on measurements to demonstrate conformity with European rules.
Did this really happen? Let’s take a closer look.
The UK’s Mail on Sunday newspaper claimed that the European Union “ordered [the UK] to remove the crown symbol” from pint glasses.
In its front-page story on 29 May, it said that “the 2004 EU Measuring Instruments Directive required the use of the EU-wide ‘CE mark’ to demonstrate conformity with EU rules”.
The story quotes an unnamed British government source, who said the directive led to “the effective removal of the crown symbol because the UK ‘could not have two competing indications of conformity’.”
Mail on SundayMail on Sunday
The claim was originally made by senior members of the Conservative Party late last year, as the UK pledged to roll back what they perceived to be the stifling red-tape imposed upon them by membership of the European Union.
In September last year, former Brexit negotiator David Frostsaid in a letter to Ian Duncan Smiththat the UK Government had agreed to permit the printing of the crown stamp on pint glasses “and to review the EU ban on markings and sales in imperial units [...] neither of which were possible within the EU”.
Then in December,Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledgedto return the crown to pint glasses as part of a list of “key successes” of Brexit for 2022.
“From simplifying the EU’s mind-bogglingly complex beer and wine duties to proudly restoring the crown stamp on to the side of pint glasses, we’re cutting back on EU red tape and bureaucracy and restoring common sense to our rulebook,” he said at the turn of the new year.
Firstly, let’s look atthe 2004 Measuring Instruments Directivecited in the piece, which is blamed for causing the crown to be banned from featuring on pint glasses in the UK.
The directive harmonised standards on so-called ‘measuring instruments’ by introducing certain requirements on them if they are sold or manufactured in the European Union.
The term ‘measuring instruments’ refers to a number of different things within the directive, but one of the specific definitions is “a drinking glass” which is designed to “determine a specified volume of liquid [...] which is sold for immediate consumption” – which would include a pint of beer.
The directive also specifies a number of rules around shapes and markings, but one of the rules also states that instruments should contain the “CE” mark.
The CE stands for “Conformité Européenne” which means “European Conformity” in English. If you’ve bought something in the EU or that was made in the EU – a children’s toy or a medical device – you’ll likely have spotted this symbol before.
It’s basically a mark to say that the EU deems that the product conforms to agreed standards on health, safety and environmental protection.

So the Mail On Sunday’s story is so far correct in saying that the 2004 Measuring Instruments Directive led to the introduction of the CE mark.

But what about the removal of the crown symbol because of a clash with the CE mark?
The directive also contains a series of rules around the placement and use of the CE mark on measuring instruments.
For example, it says that the mark must be at least 5mm high and that manufacturers have to place the CE mark on products themselves, or show it in packaging or accompanying documents if a product is too small or sensitive to carry it.
Crucially, the directive says that instruments can contain other markings as long as they don’t impact on the visibility or legibility of the CE mark or deceive people as to its meaning.
A spokesperson for the Commission directedThe Journalto Article 7.3 of the directive, which states:
In other words, crowns were not specifically banned from featuring on pint glasses under EU rules.
They would be prohibited if they affected the visibility of a CE mark on a pint glass or made people think that the CE mark meant something else, but this is not nearly the same as being banned outright.
The claim that crown symbols were banned from British pint glasses by the EU is therefore untrue.
The claim is connected to an allegation – as made by David Frost last September – that the EU banned the sale of drinks in imperial units. However, as anyone who has been to a pub or bought milk in Ireland can testify, this is also untrue.
Although the EU sought to have the UK and Ireland adopt the metric system by 1 January 1995, both governments successfully sought a derogation for the use of the unit “pint” when serving beer and cider in pubs (and when selling milk in shops).
The European Commission officially ended its attemptsto have both states use the metric system in 2007, when the UK was also allowed to use imperial measures like miles when measuring road distances.
This claim is therefore also untrue.
The UK’s Mail On Sunday, David Frost and Boris Johnson all claimed that EU rules banned a crown symbol from appearing on pint glasses in the UK.
The Mail on Sunday specifically claimed this was to do with the 2004 EU Measuring Instruments Directive, which required the use of the CE mark on pint glasses.
The newspaper quoted an unnamed government source as saying the directive meant the UK “could not have two competing indications of conformity”, ie the crown and the CE mark.
However, the directive does not say this. It actually states that multiple symbols are allowed on pint glasses, provided that the second symbol does not affect the visibility or legibility of a CE mark or make people think that the mark means something else.
As a result, we rate the claim:FALSE.
As per our verdict guide, this means the claim is inaccurate.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-export-rules-ireland-31-january-6275941-Jan2024/,"FROM THE END of this month, businesses in Ireland that export goods to Great Britain will need to satisfynew Brexit trading arrangements.
You thought you had heard the last of Brexit, didn’t you? Well not quite yet.
Here’s what you need to know if you are a small business owner.
At the end of the Brexit transition in 2021, the EU introduced full checks and controls on goods coming in from Great Britain. The UK is now introducing checks in a more graduated way after a number of postponements.
So what this means for Irish businesses that export to Great Britain is that from 31 January 2024 they will need new documentation for goods entering Great Britain.
Trading with Northern Ireland is not impacted by these changes.
From 31 January the UK is requiring thepre-lodgement of customs declarationsand thepre-notification of agri-food exportsfrom Ireland entering Great Britain.

In some cases, businesses will also need anExport Health Certificatefor agri-food products.
The need for such a certificate will depend on what category of risk the goods being exported fall into. Goods in the low-risk category will not require a certificate.
Businesses that export to the UK are being urged to examine their supply chains to make sure they are ready for the changes.
Most businesses should already be aware of these changes, but it isn’t too late to get the relevant documentation together for those who may not have done so yet.
It is unclear how many businesses will be impacted by these changes or what the typical cost will be for businesses as a result.
At this point, physical checks of goods will not take place but it is expected that such checks at UK Border Posts will begin by 31 October 2024 at the earliest.
Over one third of Irish exports go to the UK, with the UK remaining the largest single destination for Irish food, drink and horticulture exports.
The UK accounts for 47% of Irish beef exports, for example, with an estimated value of €1.3 billion, while dairy exports to the UK were valued at €1.1 billion in 2023.
Full details on the changes are availablehere.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-protocol-negotiations-trust-uk-varadkar-5767217-May2022/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT is “all take” in its approach to resolving disagreements over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Tánaiste has said.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar described that the UK’s threats to disapply parts of the Protocol agreed with the European Union are creating an “atmosphere of distrust”.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’sToday with Claire Byrne, the Tánaiste said he thinks that the British Government “expressing a willingness to breach international law and to breach a treaty” at the same time as helping Ukraine fight Russia has caused “puzzlement in European capitals”.
“I think anyone would acknowledge that the decision to impose Brexit on Northern Ireland and Scotland against their will has caused more people in Scotland and Northern Ireland to question whether they’re better off in the union,” he said.
“I think if we now had a situation whereby the British government in London tried to disapply the Protocol against the wishes of the Northern Ireland Assembly, against the wishes of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, that would cause more and more people to ask themselves in Northern Ireland whether this government actually looks out for our interests.”
The Northern Ireland Protocol has been a sticking point in post-Brexit debates and hung over the recent Stormont election, which saw the DUP reassert its stance that the Protocol is untenable.
The Protocol, agreed as part of the agreement between the EU and UK as the latter withdrew from the bloc, means that goods can continue to flow between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in line with the Good Friday Agreement.
Instead, checks are carried out between Northern Ireland and Great Britain on trade across the Irish Sea.
Unionists argue that the arrangement is isolating Northern Ireland from Britain and the British government hasthreatened to override parts of the deal.

Speaking this morning, Varadkar said the UK risks losing trust in any future negotiations.
“We negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the British government including a Protocol and they’re now proposing to disapply part of that unilaterally, and that does create an atmosphere of distrust,” the Tánaiste said.
“If we agree anything with them, how will we know that they will honour that agreement? And if we make any concessions, how will we know that we will get some concessions back in return?
“And that’s not a good basis, unfortunately for negotiations to succeed or for a good relationship into the future.”
He said that a ‘trusted trader’ system in which goods are allowed to enter Northern Ireland from Britain without any checks if they are staying within the six counties is a possibility.
However, that would risk products entering the Republic, and therefore the EU, without going through the proper scrutiny.
Varadkar said he doubted whether Ulster farmers wanted international agricultural products coming into Northern Ireland that would compete with their own.
“Is this something that the Ulster Farmers’ Union actually wants? Is this is something that the DUP, for example, actually wants?” Varadkar asked.
“Could this be another repeat of the Brexit moment where people in Northern Ireland who supported Brexit maybe didn’t fully understand what the consequences were? I would have thought that if it is the case that those kinds of products are brought into Northern Ireland by a trusted trader system, never mind not going south, would Ulster farmers and consumers not have a difficulty with that?”
The Tánaiste said Ireland is open to discussing changes to the Protocol but that barriers on the island would be a “red line”.
“The whole point of the Protocol is to make sure that there aren’t checks north and south. Any modification, any reform of the Protocol we can discuss, but not one that would involve the single market for Ireland being different because what it does is it makes sure there’s no border between north and south,” he said.
Related ReadsO'Neill accuses Johnson of 'assisting DUP nonsense' amid UK plans to 'rip up' parts of Protocol
“If you had modifications to the protocol that undermined the fundamental point of the protocol, that would be that wouldn’t be acceptable.”
The Tánaiste said he believes UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was being “expedient” in agreeing to the Protocol.
“I think he was being expedient. He had an election coming up. He wanted to win it and that meant getting a Brexit deal,” Varadkar said.
As the deal was negotiated with the EU, Johnson “went to an election and told the British people that he had an oven-ready Brexit deal and the people of Britain voted for that”.
“Now, it seems they want to depart from it.”
He said that the EU is unlikely to impose sanctions unless the British government moves first.
“The European Union, we are the grown-ups in the room when it comes to all of this,” Varadkar said.
“We’re not going to impose sanctions or impose adverse consequences on Britain just because they’ve made a threat about something they might do.
“This wouldn’t be my call, of course, this would be a call for the European Commission, but I can’t see the European Commission responding to a mere threat with sanctions or actions,” he said.
“I think the British government would actually have to do something to merit that and hopefully we won’t come to that point. There’s plenty of space for negotiations over the next couple of weeks or months.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/liam-conlon-election-candidate-labour-uk-6425310-Jul2024/,"ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS are at their lowest point since the Good Friday Agreement thanks to Brexit and 14 years of Conservative power, a Labour candidate in London has said.
Liam Conlon, who is running to become a first-time MP, said a Labour government would attempt to undo the damage done in recent years.
Conlon, the son of Sue Gray and grandson of Irish immigrants, said careless comments by senior Tory figures about Northern Ireland have done immense damage.
“Remember when Boris Johnson trivialised the border by comparing it to the border between Camden and Islington (two areas in London)? You had Priti Patel, who used language of the Famine as a threat to Ireland.”
In late 2018, then-Home Secretary Patel implied that a no-deal Brexit might mean food shortages in Ireland, saying this should beused as leverage in negotiations. Patel denied referencing the Great Famine, in which over one million people died in the 1840s and 1850s, and said her comments were taken out of context.
Either way, the perceived lack of understanding of issues in Northern Ireland by certain British politicians soured relations in a post-Brexit environment.
In an interview withThe Journal, Conlon said: “The relationship between Britain and Ireland has been allowed to, I think, probably fall to its lowest level post the Good Friday Agreement because of actions and language used by the Conservative Party.”
If the Labour Party is elected as expected this week, things will be different under Keir Starmer, Conlon told us. He said Starmer has “a genuine affection for Ireland” and “plays his five-a-side football games in a Donegal jersey”.
Sportswear aside, Starmer has made certain commitments aimed at improving Anglo-Irish elections. The biggest, perhaps, is promising to revisit the controversial Troubles Legacy Act.
The legislation, which shut down historical investigations into crimes committed in Northern Ireland between 1966 and 1998, has been sharply criticised across the policial spectrum and by groups advocating on behalf of victims and their families.
“I’m against it for a number of reasons,”Starmer said last month. “The first is it doesn’t have the support of any of the political parties in Northern Ireland. This is the wrong way of doing business.”
Conlon agrees that the legislation needs to be revisited. His family is related to a Catholic priest who wasshot dead in the Ballymurphy massacre in 1971.
“So I know, from growing up, the importance of truth and justice. And people want closure.”
Conlon said the fact the Conservative Party brought in this legislation – despite it being almost unanimously opposed across the island of Ireland, runs counter to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement which calls for “cooperation, trust and respect”.
“This was unilaterally imposed against everyone’s wishes in Northern Ireland, every victims’ group on a cross-community basis.”
Conlon, who is a dual British-Irish citizen, is the chairperson of theLabour Party Irish Society. The group boasts over 1,000 members and supporters across the UK, but he expects a jump in membership numbers later this week.

Conlon is Labour’s candidate in Beckenham and Penge, a new constituency in the southeast of London. He is “confident” about taking the seat, given Labour’s polling numbers, but “not complacent”.
Since its creation as a constituency in 1950, Beckenham has always voted for a Conservative MP. However, the constituency was recently withdrawn to include parts of Penge and Lewisham West – more Labour-friendly areas.
The outgoing MP, Colonel Bob Stewart, defected from the Conservaties after he was last year found guilty of racially abusing an activist. He sat as an independent for his final few months in parliament. His conviction was quashed on appeal, but he agreed tostep down before the election.
Polls have fluctuated in recent weeks but Labour still has a lead of around 20 points over the Conservatives with Reform UK in third and the Liberal Democrats in fourth, according to this analysis byBBC News.
Unless there is a massive upset, Labour will storm home with a large majority. Conlon is hoping to be one of the candidates who turns a blue seat red.
Conlon said people in the UK are ready for change after 14 years of Tory rule, “constant lies” from the government, and poor conduct such as senior figures like Johnson breaking lockdown rules during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Conlon’s mother, Sue Gray, investigated the so-called partygate scandal. Her report into parties at Downing Street during lockdown played a key role in Johnson’s downfall as prime minister.
Last year, she quit her position as a senior civil servant to take on the job of Labour leader Keir Starmer’s chief of staff – much to the annoyance of the Conservatives.
Conlon said he and his mother haven’t seen much of each other during the campaign as they’ve both been so busy.
Stefan Rousseau / PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Images / PA Images
He is quick to point out that he has been involved with Labour for much longer than her.
“I was in in the Labour Party for about 10 years. One of the jokes I said when she took the job was, ‘This was my thing. How are you coming into this now?’”
Conlon said he would be “very proud of her” if she became chief of staff to the prime minister.
If she did, she’d be the first woman to solely hold the role, he notes. (Theresa May had two joint chiefs of staff, one male and one female.)
“She’ll also be the first school leaver [to hold the role]. You know, she didn’t go to university. She’ll be the first child of immigrants to be Chief of Staff to the British Prime Minister.
Gray and her husband, country and western singer husband Bill Conlon, ran a pub in Newry at the height of the Troubles in the 1980s.
Somewhat unepectedly, Conlon brings up Philomema Begley during our coversation, saying the famous singer would often visit their family home.
“On a Saturday morning I’d come down, and you could tell she was there because you would smell the perfume halfway down the stairs,” he recalls.

Conlon has spent years campaigning for disability rights. He was inspired to get invovled in activism after he shattered his hip in a “freak accident” when he was 13 and was unable to walk for years.
“I couldn’t walk for four years after that, so I was in and out of hospital, NHS hospitals, across London. I had lots of surgery. I missed a lot of my education.”
Conlon said, given “how things have changed in the NHS, I wonder whether a child today would have the same chance of recovery as I did”.
“Probably not,” he added.
“I’m very fortunate now that I can walk, but I can’t play sport, I can’t run. I drive an adapted car.
“There are very, very few disabled MPs in Parliament. And one of the things I really want to change, well, I want to be a national voice for disabled people.
“I’d like to do for disabled people what Harriet Harman (who was a Labour MP for over 40 years) has done for women.”
Conlon said, if elected, he will also focus on the cost-of-living crisis, health and housing issues – saying these come up very often when he meets constituents.
When asked if voters bring up Gaza on the doorsteps, he says no. “It comes up occasionally, not that much.”
Starmer’s position on Gaza has caused anger among some in his own party,and his own constituency, with the leader facing criticism for not calling for a permanent ceasefire sooner.
Conlon said his party’s position is “very clear”.
“The Labour position is for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
“It was a Labour motion that passed in the House of Commons that called for every step being taken to prevent further civilian deaths, the release of all hostages, and unimpeded aid into Gaza.”
He said the topic is “not one of the top issues” voters raise with him.
“The top issues really are the cost of living, the NHS. You have parts of this constituency, where you have genuine child poverty in London. And that’s where people are at.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/stormont-falling-apart-5673621-Feb2022/,"THE RESIGNATION OF Stormont First Minister Paul Givan was in the tea leaves. Well signalled. Easily read.
We didn’t need to look inside the cup.
DUP party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had repeatedly warned of the possibility.
So much so that his lines started to sound like a broken record.
Stretched over a few months. This huffing and puffing that Stormont could be blown down.
History repeats, again
The developments of the past 24 hours do not represent the complete collapse of 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister – a response to the RHI cash for ash episode of that time.

Givan’s resignation means the Executive cannot meet.
In the way of these things, no First Minister means no deputy First Minister.
Others, including Health Minister Robin Swann remain in post. But there can be no new decisions.
Sinn Féin positioning
The Assembly will sit for now. But politics is broken again.
We wait to see what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald means in her comments that her party will not facilitate such a scenario.

What we have now are pre-election headlines. They could become bigger, louder, as this story develops.
There is nothing certain. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants to return to Stormont. Wants to be  First Minister.
DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
But politics here is no longer as predictable as it once was.
There is a pattern.
The 2017 Assembly election in which unionists lost their overall majority at Stormont.
The 2019 European election when Alliance leader Naomi Long took a seat.
Then, the 2019 UK General Election, the results of which show that unionists no longer hold a majority of the Northern Ireland seats at Westminster.
All of this explains the nervousness of now.
The latest fine mess. A politics here that has never really settled since its collapse in 2017.
Thinking today about the vast number of women & men in Northern Ireland who love where they live, celebrate the unique agreement that has won & maintained peace & who are at ease with shades of grey rather than black & white. This majority will prevail. Keep the faith.— Julian Smith MP (@JulianSmithUK)February 3, 2022
Thinking today about the vast number of women & men in Northern Ireland who love where they live, celebrate the unique agreement that has won & maintained peace & who are at ease with shades of grey rather than black & white. This majority will prevail. Keep the faith.
It is a little over two years since Stormont was rescued. Saved from itself in a joint initiative involving the British and Irish Governments.
The New Decade-New Approach agreement was offered as a take-it-or-leave-it deal.
And the Stormont parties were pushed back into Stormont after a three-year absence of government.
Boris Johnson came running to steal a slice of the success.
A threat to the Union itself, and an earthquake moment that turned what was meant to be a 2021 Centenary year of celebration into something representing chaos. A convulsion in politics.
Current impasse
Inside that unionist/loyalist community there was talk of collapsing Stormont.

The Protocol is of course an extension of Brexit. The play out from the agreement.
The part that is left out of the script.
A reminder that politics is not just about what you want, but what comes with it.
In the turmoil, we have watched the DUP as ‘a family at war’. A description I have borrowed from the BBC political correspondent Gareth Gordon.
He was waiting to see results in the UK-EU negotiations – talks that some time ago took on the look of a marathon run, rather than some short-term fix.
His patience tried, Donaldson tired. Thursday’s resignation of the First Minister Givan a result of that.
Unionists, of course, are watching the polls in the South and the polls in the North.
Seeing Sinn Féin at the top of both.
Not saying it out loudly, but in quiet conversations, worrying about where this is leading.
All of this is the latest crossroads in our politics. All adding to the cross words of now.
Times changing.
Old certainties gone.
Stormont getting ready for another last stand.

https://www.thejournal.ie/martin-north-speech-5857012-Sep2022/,"AN TAOISEACH MICHEÁL Martin has said that the DUP’s refusal to participate in forming an executive in the North was “unacceptable”.
Martin said that the DUP’s refusal to take part in the assembly was damaging the functioning of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and this was to the detriment of people in the North.
“It is to the detriment of the people of Northern Ireland that their Executive is not in place to take the decisions and provide the leadership that the North needs, particularly as we face into a difficult and economically challenging winter,” Martin said.
“It is a denial of the mandate they gave in the elections of the fifth of May.
An Taoiseach was speaking  earlier today at the British Irish Association Conference at Pembroke College in Oxford. He said had been “completely consistent on this issue” and had expressed similar views when Sinn Fein withdrew from the Executive in 2017.
Martin said that when the Executive broke down on previous occasions, both governments worked hard to resolve the issues, “make progress and restore the Institutions”.
Assembly elections were held on 5 May of this year following the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP withdrew in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Sinn Féin secured 27 seats and the DUP won 25, but the DUP said it would not nominate a deputy first minister until “decisive action” is taken on the protocol, which has led to a deadlock.
Speaking at the same conference yesterday evening, in comments carried byRTÉ News, the UK government’s Northern Ireland Secretary of State Shailesh Vara said if parties in the North didn’t form an Executive, he would call another assembly election by the end of October.

Northern Ireland Protocol
The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed upon by the EU and the UK during Brexit negotiations. It governs the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and is aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.
There have been some implementation difficulties with the protocol, and it has become a serious bone of contention between the EU and the UK, with the British government bringing forward legislation to unilaterally suspend key aspects of the protocol. Ireland and the EU have said that this would break international law and renege on key aspects of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Speaking yesterday, Vara said that the British government’s plans to set aside part of the protocol was an “insurance policy”.
“Our aim with the legislation on the Northern Ireland Protocol is to put in place an insurance policy so that we can ensure we have a way of resolving the issues with the Protocol,” he said.
However, today Martin said the moves by the UK to suspend aspects of the protocol risked causing further instability in the North, and will fray the relationship with Ireland.
“I am deeply concerned about the British Government’s legislation which would unilaterally undo core elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” said Martin.
The Taoiseach said he was concerned by what such moves could mean for a partnership between the UK and the EU and for the message it would send about rules-based international order. But, most of all, Martin said he was “concerned because it is neither in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland nor what they want”.
He said the EU recognised “that there have been genuine difficulties with aspects of the implementation of the Protocol”.
Martin was speaking ahead of the announcement of a new Prime Minister on Monday, when either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will become the new leader of the Conservative Party.
“I wish them well in the challenging times ahead,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-preparing-for-worst-uk-changes-northern-ireland-protocol-5574221-Oct2021/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Oct 2021
EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE president Maros Sefcovic has said discussions around the Northern Ireland Protocol will not be a renegotiation.
The EC has laid out measures to slash 80% of regulatory checks and dramatically cut customs processes on the movement of goods, especially food and farming produce, between Britain and the island of Ireland.
The UK government welcomed the announcement, signalling it wants “intensive talks” to follow the EU’s proposals.
At the same time, however, a spokesman for the government said there have to be “significant changes” to the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement if there is to be a “durable settlement”.
Brexit minister David Frost is expected in Brussels tomorrow to meet Sefcovic to discuss ways to break the deadlock.
Sefcovic spoke to Northern Ireland’s political leaders earlier today. Afterwards, he said he has no mandate to renegotiate the protocol.
“Now we should really do the last mile, work constructively with all the proposals we put on the table, put it finally to bed,” he told BBC Northern Ireland’s The View programme.
“I believe that we could be in the home stretch with our proposals on the table and as I said, let’s try to solve all these issues before Christmas because I think that would be the best Christmas gift we can give to the people of Northern Ireland.”
However, Sefcovic added: “I have no mandate to renegotiate the protocol … the withdrawal agreement, protocol and trade and cooperation agreement, we signed it, we ratified it, it’s international law and I think we should respect it.”

Earlier, speaking on BBC2’s Newsnight, EU ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida said Brussels has gone the “extra mile” and cannot go any further following yesterday’s proposals.
“We went to the limits of what we can do to address the problems of Northern Ireland because we care for Northern Ireland,” he said.
“These problems were caused by Brexit.”
He stressed that the EU cannot accede to a key British demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in overseeing the protocol.
“There is no single market without the European Court of Justice. It’s the referee of the single market,” he said.
Frost has previously said the role of European judges is something the UK cannot accept.
But in a sign that he may be willing to compromise, he told peers yesterday that he never used the term “red lines” in his negotiations.
Under the terms of the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and EU as part of the 2020 Withdrawal Agreement, the ECJ would be the final arbitrator in any future trade dispute between the two parties on the operation of the protocol.
The UK now wants to remove that provision and replace it with an independent arbitration process.
One option reported to be under consideration by Brussels is a reduced role for European judges.

The Times reported that under the plan, disputes would go to an independent arbitration panel, with the ECJ asked to interpret narrow matters of EU law as a last resort after dispute resolution has failed.
British cabinet minister Sajid Javid said ending the role of the ECJ is one of the key points.
The Health Secretary told Sky News: “Looking forward, there should not be a role for the European Court of Justice in any part of the UK and that includes Northern Ireland.
“I think it is an over-legalistic approach that the court has. Lord Frost has been really clear about this with the speech that he made this week. One of the most important issues is to end the role of the ECJ in Northern Ireland.”
The package of proposals already set out by the EU would remove the prospect of certain produce, including sausages, being banned from being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The EU plan also includes a 50% reduction in customs paperwork required to move products across the Irish Sea.
In return, the trading bloc has asked for safeguards to be implemented to provide extra assurances that products said to be destined for Northern Ireland do not end up crossing the Irish border.
These include labelling certain products to make it clear they are for sale in the UK only, and enhanced monitoring of supply chain movements and access to real-time trade flow information.
The EU plan amounts to a set of counter-proposals in response to a wish list of protocol reforms outlined by the UK Government in July.
The proposals from both sides are now set to form the basis of a new round of negotiations between Brussels and London in the weeks ahead.
The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to sidestep the major obstacle in the Brexit divorce talks – the Irish land border.
It achieved that by shifting regulatory and customs checks and processes to the Irish Sea.
But the arrangements have created new economic barriers on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
This has caused disruption to many businesses in Northern Ireland and has also created a major political headache for the Government, as unionists and loyalists are furious at what they perceive as a weakening of the Union.
First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he is “frankly baffled” by the UK Government’s stance, adding: “It is their deal, yet so often we hear UK Government ministers talk as though the deal was entirely somebody else’s responsibility.”
He told Sky News: “It’s a very important issue for Wales because our ports face the island of Ireland and trade through our ports is significantly down following Brexit.”

DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told European Commission vice president Sefcovic earlier today that proposed changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol “fall short of what is needed”.
Speaking after his virtual meeting with Sefcovic, Donaldson said: “We had a useful and honest discussion. I welcomed the change of heart in Brussels with the decision to renegotiate.
“For so long we were told the protocol could not be reopened but the persistent pressing of our case has paid dividends.
“I also explained why the proposals fall short of what is needed.
“These negotiations must not be a missed opportunity. There is a window to get this right. To get a deal which can allow Northern Ireland to, once again, get moving forward.”

Donaldson added: “Short-term fixes will not solve the problems that have beset the United Kingdom internal market.
“Removing some checks today does not solve the divergence problems of tomorrow. State aid and VAT arrangements if left unaltered will be detrimental to Northern Ireland’s long-term prospects.
“We need a sustainable solution which removes the Irish Sea border and restores our place within the United Kingdom.”
Sinn Féin welcomed the new proposals from the EU and is seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly to demonstrate support for the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Party president Mary Lou McDonald toldRTÉ Radio’s News at Onethat Donaldson and the DUP “do not speak for the vast, vast majority of people in the north of Ireland”.
“The vast majority across all sectors recognise that a protocol was necessary and also now want to work to a situation where that protocol is operable.”
When asked about the number of concessions given to the UK government throughout negotiations, McDonald said every negotiation stance has “an elastic limit and the moment where it runs out of road”.
On the issue of the ECJ’s role, McDonald added: “I didn’t hear one Unionist, including Jeffrey Donaldson, make mention of the European Court of Justice or its jurisdiction on the Protocol before David Frost mentioned this issue.”
Irish reaction
Yesterday evening, the EU’s proposals were welcomed by political leaders here, with Taoiseach Micheál Martin describing them as “the obvious way forward and the obvious way out of the issues”.
“I trust that it will now be the subject of serious engagement with the British Government and form the basis of a jointly agreed solution to those challenges,” he said.
“Such an outcome is very much in the interests of both the EU and the UK, but most especially of the people and businesses in Northern Ireland.”
Martin said no-one should be under “any illusions” about the importance of keeping all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement in place, and had emphasised this to Johnson.
Martin added that the European Commission had “demonstrated imagination, innovation, and also a listening ear to the people who matter, the people in Northern Ireland who are on the ground dealing with these issues”.
He said: “(In) my last meeting with the British Government, they wanted to give this … they said to me they wanted to give it one final shot.”
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said he “strongly welcomed” the proposals.
“This is a major effort by the EU to address concerns raised around the protocol,” he said.
“The European Commission has listened to the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland and has produced far-reaching proposals that comprehensively address the practical, genuine issues that matter most to them.
“These proposals represent a real opportunity for Northern Ireland. People in Northern Ireland – especially those in the business community – want the protocol to work well.”
He added: “We welcome David Frost’s comments that he will engage seriously, fully and positively with the commission.
“The package provides a pathway to resolving all the outstanding issues. Now is the time for the UK Government to engage constructively on the practical solutions being put forward by the commission to the issues that matter most to the people of Northern Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-fears-ireland-5705690-Mar2022/,"UNCERTAINTY OVER POST-Brexit arrangements for the North is “dampening” investment on the island, Irish politicians have been warned.
However, Brexit did not hit Ireland as hard as feared, an Oireachtas committee heard on Wednesday.
The meeting of the Oireachtas committee came as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has overshadowed the ongoing negotiations on the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.
No breakthrough between the UK and the EU is expected in those talks ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Northern Ireland.
That uncertainty was pointed to on today as a significant cause of unease for traders.
Appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Trade, Enterprise and Employment, one Government official said: “In large measure, Brexit was not the calamitous event that we all feared, and this can be attributed, in no small measure, to the level of preparedness of Irish businesses for the changed trading relationship with the UK in the aftermath of Brexit.”
Anne Coleman-Dunne, from the Irish-UK section in the Department of Enterprise and Trade, speaking around 15 months since the first impacts of Brexit were felt in Ireland, said that “businesses have faced the realities of the new trading relationship”.
“While for many businesses, Brexit is done, this is not the case for those in the agri-food sector and businesses in this sector need to continue preparing for the UK import controls.
Those new import controls had been set to come into effect from the start of the year.
Describing it as a “temporary reprieve”, Coleman-Dunn warned that nonetheless “Brexit has changed forever the trade relationship between the UK and Ireland and the full extent of these changes will only become fully evident over time”.
Already, data from the Central Statistics Office has shown significant changes to the trading relationship between the two countries, even as trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland appears to grow.

That change was set out clearly at the Oireachtas committee, where the decline in the use of Great Britain as a so-called landbridge for Irish traders was raised, with no indication from the data as to whether the shift is temporary or permanent.
Coleman-Dunn said: “The trade data for 2021, particularly on exports to Great Britain and on trade flows North-South, is encouraging. However, uncertainty for the future of the UK-IE trading relationship remains.”
Representatives from InterTradeIreland, which promotes cross-border trade, said that with limited exceptions “Irish imports and exports to and from Northern Ireland are up across all categories”.
Margaret Hearty, the CEO of InterTradeIreland, said that the change is caused by a combination of factors, including Brexit and the pandemic, as well as the rising cost of energy and inflation.
Skills shortages are also playing a role, Ms Hearty said.
“It’s important to recognise that the rise in trade value across the border is not all resulted from new sales or supply chain activity.
“Many firms trading across the border on the island, particularly those with complex and integrated offshore supply chains, are finding adjusting to the new market rules challenging.
“Continued uncertainty with regard to the final agreement in relation to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is having a dampening effect on investment. Removal of Northern Ireland from the EU’s single market for services is also having a particular impact on firms with an all-island outlook or aspirations.
“Many firms are still continuing to work through the impacts on services delivery and it is likely that further challenges will arise in a number of areas for services firms in the coming months and years. These challenges will likely be centred on market access, data sharing and skills.”
Quizzed by Sinn Fein TD Louise O’Reilly about the lack of a functioning Executive in Northern Ireland, Hearty stressed that the “raison d’etre” of her organisation was to promote cross-border trade.
“Business continues despite what happens within politics and we continue to support businesses.”
“Uncertainty is not good for business,” she said.

THE IRISH GOVERNMENT needs to recognise the damage that the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing to political stability in Northern Ireland, the DUP leader has told the Tánaiste.
Leo Varadkar was meeting with Jeffrey Donaldson today to assess the post-Brexit arrangements and Covid recovery.
The Fine Gael leader said Donaldson “didn’t mince his words” about the DUP’s assessment of the difficulties created by the controversial post-Brexit agreement.
The protocol, part of the Brexit divorce deal agreed by the UK and Brussels, effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
This means checks on goods being sent from Great Britain into the single market, and in some cases could result in prohibitions on certain products that do not comply with EU rules.
The protocol was put in place to ensure there would be no hard border with Ireland, but it has instead effectively placed a trade barrier in the Irish Sea and is deeply unpopular with unionists, who have insisted it should be removed.
Donaldson said: “I made absolutely clear that the protocol is harming our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom.
“It has undermined that relationship, it has contravened the Belfast Agreement, it has contravened the Act of Union, it is damaging to political progress in Northern Ireland.
“It has the capacity to so undermine the political progress here that it drags us backwards.”
He continued: “I made clear, as I made clear to the Irish Prime Minister last week that this situation is not sustainable. The protocol, the Irish Sea border, has to go.
“So we were very clear to Leo Varadkar that the Irish Government needs to very quickly recognise the damage that this protocol is doing to political stability in Northern Ireland.”
Varadkar said: “I had a very good meeting with Jeffrey and his team and he was very frank, he didn’t mince his words about their assessment of the protocol and the difficulties they feel it’s creating.”

Mr Varadkar also met with business representatives during his two-day visit to Northern Ireland.
“I think in many ways there are two sides to the protocol and two sides to the coin and I think in fairness to Jeffrey, he acknowledged that too,” Varadkar said.
“A lot of business people are saying to me that it has resulted in a major increase in north/south trade, going in both directions, and that has been beneficial to them,” he said.
“It’s also led to an increase in enquiries in investment in Northern Ireland because of the unique position that Northern Ireland now has with access to the European single market and the Great British market,” the Tánaiste added.
“I would argue that is something that no other territory has, but at the same time, the real practical difficulties businesses have in terms of the forms they have to fill in, additional costs which will get worse at the end of the grace period, so there is very much two sides to that coin.”
He said that the Republic and England had also been affected by trade disruption.
“We know in England where Nando’s are having trouble getting staff, McDonald’s are having trouble getting milkshakes, there is trouble getting hauliers, and the protocol doesn’t apply to England, yet they are having those problems too,” he added.
“I think some of the problems put down to the protocol are actually problems related to Brexit, that are experienced in the Republic and in England as well.”
He said that the Irish Government and the EU never wanted trade barriers between the two islands.
Varadkar also said he would not object to extending the grace periods, but said it would not solve the underlying difficulties.
“It puts things off and in my impression, from Jeffrey Donaldson is that wouldn’t be an acceptable outcome from them anyway,” the Fine Gael leader said.
“It would be preferable to come to an agreement but if more time is needed to find time to ratify any agreement, that would be reasonable to do.”
When it was put to Varadkar that he was a “hate figure” in unionism over his role in the Brexit negotiations, he said there were a lot of people who saw him as the “architect” of the protocol.
“For me, the protocol was only ever a means to an end,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sausage-war-truce-chilled-meat-grace-period-extended-5481758-Jun2021/,"LAST UPDATE|30 Jun 2021
THE UK AND the European Union have agreed to extend a grace period allowing chilled meats to be sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland until 30 September – as well as a number of other solutions to clunky elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Among the “practical” solutions to problems with the Protocolthat have been announced are: drivers travelling from the UK will no longer need an insurance green card in the EU, Ireland included; a solution for the movement of guide dogs which the North’s authorities must finalise; and the EU will change its own laws to allow UK medicines to be used in Northern Ireland after the grace period ends this year.
The UK had made a formal request to extend the grace period for chilled meats by three months in mid-June, following a public row between the UK government and EU leaders at the G7 summit.
Despite the UK having unilaterally extended another grace period in place for supermarket goods sent from GB-to-NI earlier in the year, and the EU subsequently launching legal action, this extension to the chilled meat grace period was formally granted.
Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney said today’s announcements “strongly underlines the EU’s commitment” to making the NI Protocol work.
“I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK’s request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats. This cooperative approach recognises that the Protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented,” Coveney said in a statement.
“The time ahead must now be used to work towards longer-term arrangements on broader SPS and veterinary issues.”
European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said the extension was being granted to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland in particular to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation – something he said was “yet to be completed”.
Some pushback to this statement from the UK government has already been reported, however.
The EU has shown tremendous flexibility today, and a willingness to stretch as far as possible within existing legislation. Today’s announcement shows the EU’s commitment to making the Protocol work for the people of Northern Ireland, and it’s respect for both traditions there 🇪🇺— Thomas Byrne (@ThomasByrneTD)June 30, 2021

Chilled meats
Under EU rules, chilled processed meats such as sausages and minced meat cannot be imported to the EU from third countries – which the UK now is after Brexit.
But because Northern Ireland has slightly different post-Brexit rules than Great Britain, in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, there have been some problems with GB-to-NI trade, including on chilled meats trade – including sausages and minced meat.
Grace periods have been in place since the new rules came into effect to give businesses a chance to adapt – but there is some suggestion that the UK may simply continue requesting extensions.
The UK’s Brexit minister David Frost and the European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič announced the extension to the chilled meats issue jointly this afternoon.
Frost said in a statement: “We are pleased we have been able to agree a sensible extension on chilled meats moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – one that does not require rules in the rest of the UK to align with future changes in EU agri-food rules.
“This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution – Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years.
“This is a very clear sign that the Protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way.”
Šefčovič said the measures agreed between the EU and UK were an “unquestionable response to those in the UK suggesting the EU is inflexible” – but highlighted that it came with some “strict” conditions.
“For example, the meat products that are subject to the channelling procedure referred to in the United Kingdom’s unilateral declaration must remain under the control of the Northern Ireland competent authorities at all stages of that procedure.
“These meat products must be accompanied by official health certificates issued by the UK competent authorities, can exclusively be sold to end consumers in supermarkets located in Northern Ireland, and must be packed and labelled accordingly.
“The EU also underlines the importance of ensuring that Border Control Posts in Northern Ireland have the necessary infrastructure and resources to be able to perform all the controls required by the EU’s Official Controls Regulation.”

Other measures: medicines, livestock, guide dogs and insurance
As part of the joint committee set up between the UK and EU to solve any issues with the Protocol, a number of solutions have been found in relation to four problems:
Stop-gap measure
Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, welcomed the chilled meats deal but said there were still bigger issues to resolve.
He said: “While it is good to see the EU and the UK cooperating on this issue and reaching agreement, this is, in trade terms, a peripheral matter.
“The most pressing issue is the fate of the thousands of food products moving daily from GB to NI, which will be subject to extensive controls when that grace period ends in October. We are no closer to a decision by both sides on this.”
This is the grace period on supermarket goods that was unilaterally extended by the UK in March.
“There is a frustration felt across business. We can see the technical solutions that are possible, such as a trusted trader scheme, yet there does not seem to be the political will to deliver them.
“We need both sides to live up to their commitments and find a pragmatic solution to ensure NI consumers continue to get access to both the choice and affordability in the food they need. Yet again the clock is ticking.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/serious-headway-needed-northern-ireland-protocol-eu-5600078-Nov2021/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Nov 2021
“SERIOUS HEADWAY” NEEDS to be made in negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the next week, the EU has said.
However European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said there had been a “change in tone” from the UK during the latest round of negotiations.
It comes after the UK Government appeared to soften its stance on using the protocol’s get-out clause, describing Article 16 as a “legitimate part of the protocol’s provisions” while stressing there was a “preference to find a consensual way forward”.
At a press conference following the latest round of talks held in London today, Sefcovic said: “We can and must arrive at the agreed solution that Northern Ireland truly deserves.
“That is also why I raised forcefully that we need to make serious headway in the course of next week.
“This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines.
“An uninterrupted long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is the protocol-related issue on everyone’s mind in Northern Ireland.”
He also said there had been a “change in tone” from Brexit Minister David Frost in the fourth round of talks held with the UK Government.
Sefcovic said: “I acknowledge and welcome the change in tone of discussion with David Frost today, and I hope this will lead to tangible results for the people in Northern Ireland.”
He told reporters the UK needed to “reciprocate the big move the EU has made” on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He said he was “convinced the the issue of medicines could be a blueprint for how to approach and solve together the remaining outstanding issues” between the UK and the trading bloc.
Following the talks, a UK Government spokesman said: “Lord Frost noted that there remained significant gaps to be bridged between the UK and EU positions.

“He noted that, as set out to the House of Lords on 10 November, it remained the UK’s preference to find a consensual way forward, but that Article 16 safeguards were a legitimate part of the protocol’s provisions.
“Lord Frost also underlined the need to address the full range of issues the UK had identified in the course of discussions, if a comprehensive and durable solution was to be found that supported the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and was in the best interests of Northern Ireland.
“In this context, although talks had so far been conducted in a constructive spirit, Lord Frost underlined that in order to make progress, it was important to bring new energy and impetus to discussions.”
Reaction
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said this afternoon that outstanding issues around the Protocol “could be overcome if the British Government worked in partnership with the EU”.
However, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has today urged the UK government to honour its commitment to protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.
He today welcomed a “more positive tone from the EU”, but urged a “sharper focus now on finding a solution that deals with the problems that have been created by this entirely unacceptable Irish Sea border”.
“The Government has made clear that the conditions have already been met to trigger Article 16, and for the UK to take unilateral action to address the difficulties created by the protocol and to replace it with new arrangements that protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market,” he said.
“That is a key commitment that the UK Government gave in the New Decade, New Approach agreement and we need to see that honoured, either in an agreement with the EU that removes this Irish Sea border, or in unilateral action by the UK Government triggering Article 16 and restoring Northern Ireland’s place fully in the UK internal market.
“Time is of the essence, it’s time for focus now, we need to see solutions, less of the rhetoric and let’s get to where we need to get to, and that is to remove the Irish Sea border and restore Northern Ireland’s place fully within the UK internal market.”
Speaking to media in Co Armagh following a meeting with a logistics firm, McDonald called for “less brinkmanship, less of the bad faith and the belligerence from the British Government”.
“We need them to work in partnership with the European institutions,” McDonald said.
“I have to say that our analysis is that the difficulty has come from the British Government, who regard Ireland, and the north of Ireland in particular, as collateral damage in their Brexit game. That is not good enough.
“The issues that arose with the protocol have answers, have solutions, I think the European Commission has moved considerably to provide those answers.

“Now the ball is firmly in the court of Boris Johnson and his Government and we need to see him and them finally act in partnership, in good faith and with goodwill.
“If those things prevail we can find the answers, not just to medicine, but to all of the other outstanding issues.”
McDonald said there was “no reason” for the British Government to trigger Article 16.
“The negotiations for the Withdrawal Agreement and the new trading arrangements and the protocol ran to the 11th hour and that happened because the British Government made a decision to negotiate in that way, right up until the last moment,” she said.
“There is no reason to trigger Article 16. We have a joint committee, we have the mechanisms to deal with issues as they arise.
“The evidence is clear now, all across Ireland and in the north of Ireland, that the vast, vast majority of people and businesses recognise the need for the protocol and they want it to work.”
The next set of talks will take place in Brussels on Friday, 19 November.
The UK has set a December deadline for resolving the renegotiation of the protocol.
In October, the EU offered a series of alterations to the agreement, which is designed to maintain free-flowing trade on the island of Ireland without a hard border.
The agreement effectively keeps Northern Ireland within the EU single market, meaning that trade goods must be checked on arrival from mainland UK.
The EU has offered to cut out 80% of these checks, with the aim of helping businesses and the economy in Northern Ireland.
But the UK Government is seeking further alterations to the agreement, including removing the role of judges in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the arbitrators of disputes.
On the role of the ECJ, Sefcovic confirmed that “definitely nothing’s changed” in the EU’s position.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/arlene-foster-heave-5422064-Apr2021/,"IN A LONG game of political chess, we are now watching the endgame.
The quiet whispers and questions about Arlene Foster’s leadership of the DUP, that had become louder in the early weeks of 2021, now the headlines of a challenge with talk of “no way back” and decisions within days.
For unionism, the Northern Ireland centenary is becoming more of a crossroads than a celebration.
Foster has lost the confidence of the bulk of her Assembly team at Stormont and too many of the party’s MPs at Westminster.
As it develops, this play inside the DUP will stretch into a wider frame. The Stormont Executive, restored a little over a year ago, again hangs by a thread.
Fragile politics
There is talk it will not last. That there could be an early Assembly election and, then, another negotiation.
After that three-year absence of government from 2017 through to 2020, there will be little tolerance for this.

A disinterested Prime Minister in London has switched off from Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson has more than enough on his own plate to worry about this place.
Nor is he trusted.
It was his deal that created the Irish Sea border and made Northern Ireland different from the rest of the UK. On his list, Brexit was more important than the Union.
And, this is the tremor – the earthquake moment for the DUP and the unionist/loyalist community. The Union on the line. Arlene Foster’s leadership on the line – perhaps Stormont on the line.
All of this, the consequence of walking up the blind alley of Brexit.
No longer holding the balance
There have been few highlights in the DUP story since the collapse of Stormont in January 2017 – the RHI scandal the straw and opportunity that finally broke its back.
It could easily have fallen in any number of rows before then.
It is here, they are accused of overplaying their hand – overstating their influence – not reading the tea leaves. Not reading Johnson.
They could not stop his sea border deal, were left at the altar – and left to explain back home. Inside their own community, they are being blamed for the mess.

The fallout has been a heavy price.
A ‘day of reckoning’ in the 2019 General Election when Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost their seats and the party failed to win North Down.
The post-Brexit conversation has been a louder debate on a ‘New Ireland’. This was not meant to be the unionist story of 2021.
Nor is it just about Arlene Foster. What about those who got lost in the London lights – those who shouted loudest for Brexit?
If it falls, this time, there may not be two governments waiting to lift it up again.
In such a scenario – that ‘New Ireland’ project will gain more momentum and pace. This is the what next that goes beyond the Good Friday Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-michael-martin-5485123-Jul2021/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has called on the UK government to “reciprocate the generosity of spirit” shown by EU leaders on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
It came after UK cabinet ministers ramped up pressure for concessions on the Protocol by warning of disruption to peace if changes are not made.
Martin said the EU had demonstrated “goodwill and generosity” to the UK,with the extension to the grace period allowingchilled meats to be sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland this week.
He said “warning each other is over” and called for engagement to find solutions through the withdrawal agreement.
He told reporters today: “I think the British government should acknowledge the approach of the European Union this week in terms of the extension of the grace period and also in terms of the facilitation around the medicines issue.
“It really is time for British government to reciprocate the generosity of spirit that European leaders have shown.
“And also the sense of flexibility that Europe has indicated to the United Kingdom that it is willing to deploy, in respect of the working-out of issues pertaining to the Protocol.
As well as extending the grace period on chilled meats, the EU changed its own rules to allow medicines to continue to flow from the UK into Northern Ireland and waived the obligation to show the motor insurance Green Card for drivers from the UK.

Unionists – who have demonstrated against the UK-EU treaty in recent months – have complained the terms of the Protocol are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain and hitting the pockets of businesses, with suppliers either giving up exporting across the Irish Sea or facing added checks and costs to do so.
Martin said there is a pathway to a sustainable solution to those concerns.
“It’s within the withdrawal agreement that the British Government signed up to, and there are mechanisms within that agreement to reach a resolution,” he said.
The Taoiseach said the EU is willing to make changes that can ease disruption to trade flows, but that the UK must abide by what it signed up to.
He said: “European leaders have made it clear to me, and the agreement itself makes it clear, that it wants to reduce and minimise disruption to the optimal degree, as much as possible.
“But there was an agreement there. There was a mechanism to resolve the issues within the withdrawal agreement. It really needs political will now. I have no doubt that if both the United Kingdom government and EU Commission really engage, this can be resolved.”

UK Cabinet ministers turned up the rhetoric in a bid to push Brussels into concessions over the Northern Ireland Protocol by warning of possible disruption to peace in the region without changes.
In a joint article in the Irish Times, Brexit Minister David Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said this week’s extension of a grace period in the so-called sausage war was “welcome” but that the extension “addresses only a small part of the underlying problem”.
The men warned the European Union that the Protocol – negotiated as part of the Brexit divorce deal – risks “damage” to the Good Friday Agreement, which in 1998 helped to secure peace after decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, unless a “new balance” is found in terms of customs checks.

Following a request from the UK, the EU on Wednesday agreed to continue to allow chilled meats to be shipped to Northern Ireland from Great Britain for another three months.
The deal avoids a trade dispute by delaying the ban until September 30 while efforts continue to find a lasting solution.
With a reprieve in place, Frost and Lewis urged Brussels to adopt a softer approach to the implementation of the Protocol – a treaty the Conservative peer helped to negotiate – or else risk further economic disruption and possibly even upsetting the peace in Northern Ireland.
The protocol is aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
Writing in the Irish Times, the ministers said: “Opposition is growing, including among many people who are not normally active in political life. That is not a stable basis for the future.
“The current process to resolve all these difficulties is not working and risks creating a series of rolling crises as we lurch from one deadline to another.
The Conservative frontbenchers called for a “new balance in the way the Protocol is operated” to be put into place “rapidly” and questioned how the EU’s insistence on stricter application of the Protocol would help matters.
They said that the UK would have to “consider all our options” if no solution is forthcoming, as ministers have “an overriding responsibility and obligation to support peace” in Northern Ireland, in what will likely be read as a further threat to act unilaterally to suspend irksome elements of the Protocol.

https://www.thejournal.ie/frost-sefcovic-brexit-discussed-issues-5411539-Apr2021/,"TALKS HAVE TAKEN place about Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements amid warnings from MEPs that the breakdown in trust could derail the trade agreement between the UK and European Union.
Brexit minister David Frost and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic discussed the problems around the Northern Ireland Protocol at a dinner in Brussels yesterday.
The meeting came just hours after two influential European Parliament committees backed the UK-EU trade deal but expressed concern about the breakdown in relations over Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland remains part of the single market for goods, meaning products arriving from Britain face EU import regulations.
The UK enraged Brussels by unilaterally extending grace periods covering areas of the economy to help retailers in Northern Ireland struggling with supplies, meaning post-Brexit checks are not yet fully applied.
The protocol has been blamed as a factor behind the recent upsurge in violence in loyalist areas amid concerns in those communities that it has weakened their place in the UK by erecting barriers to trade with Britain.
The arrangements formed part of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Brexit deal under which the UK left the EU at the end of January 2020.

The UK and European Union subsequently signed the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) on Christmas Eve, setting out the trading arrangements which came into effect on January 1 this year.
But the TCA has not yet been formally ratified and group leaders in the European Parliament have refused to set a date for a final vote because of their concerns over Boris Johnson’s stance on the earlier agreement.
The TCA’s provisional application is only due to continue until the end of April and the UK side has repeatedly stressed it expects the EU to complete its processes by then.
That came a step closer yesterday when MEPs on the European Parliament’s trade and foreign affairs committees gave their consent to the deal.
Andreas Schieder, who led the European Parliament foreign affairs committee’s work on the UK-EU deal, said: “Brexit is a historic mistake, but now we need to establish a strong fundament for future relations.”
However “all progress could be lost, if the UK continues to unilaterally breach the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Northern Ireland”, he warned.
Christophe Hansen, from the trade committee, said backing the agreement would mean “expanding our arsenal of legal tools and leverage to continue pressing for a full and pragmatic implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocol”.
A UK government spokesman said: “We have agreed to extend the deadline for the EU to ratify the deal to 30 April and we expect them to complete their processes to this timeline.”

THE UK GOVERNMENT has announced it is abandoning plans to start selling goods in imperial measures after a consultation revealed 99% support for keeping the metric system.
Ministers had looked at changing the law after the UK’s departure from the European Union in 2020 to allow traders to use Britain’s traditional weighing system – which measures in pounds and pints – alongside the metric one.
But they decided against the move after 98.7% of the 100,938 respondents to an official consultation said they were happy using metric units when buying or selling a product.
“The government has analysed all consultation responses received and reviewed the arguments for and against expanding the use of imperial units in domestic consumer transactions,” a statement from the department of business and trade said.
“After careful consideration, the government has decided against any legislative changes at this time.”
The department said the UK had “a long and proud history” of using imperial measures and that their use is “closely associated with our culture and language”.
Distances in Britain are still measured in miles, while beers and milk are also sold in pints.

The department also announced that rules would be altered to allow a 568 ml “pint” size of wine to be stocked on Britain’s supermarkets, pubs, clubs and restaurant for the first time.
The move, it said, that was “ever thanks to new freedoms from leaving the European Union”.
The 568 ml size would sit alongside the 200 ml and 500 ml measures already available, it said.
The department said the reforms were thanks to “new Brexit freedoms” obtained via the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023.
“Our exit from the EU was all about moments just like this, where we can seize new opportunities and provide a real boost to our great British wineries and further growing the economy,” enterprise, markets and small business minister Kevin Hollinrake said.
During the UK’s 2019 general election campaign, former UK prime minister Boris Johnson pledged that he would bring back imperial units in shops.
The former UK leader claimed that measuring in pounds and ounces was an “ancient liberty” and promised a “new era of generosity and tolerance” towards traditional measurements.
The United States, Myanmar and Liberia are the only other countries that use the imperial system on a daily basis.","1.58pm, 27 Dec 2023",

BRITAIN HAS GRANTED another 23 licences to French fishermen, a government spokesperson said on Saturday, a day after a deadline set by Paris to resolve a post-Brexit battle over fishing rights.
The European Union had set London a December 10 deadline to grant licences to dozens of French fishing boats under a Brexit deal signed last year, with Paris threatening European legal action if no breakthrough emerged.
The licences were agreed Friday night after British officials met European Union counterparts and followed what the spokesman called an “evidence-based approach” ensuring vessels qualify to work in UK waters.
The spokesperson added that the approach “provides stability and ensures the sustainability of our fisheries”, with the United Kingdom granting 18 licences and the Channel Island of Jersey five.
The EU hailed the agreement as “an important step in a long process” towards implementing the 2020 Brexit agreement and said work continued to license seven more vessels by Monday.
But France said it would “continue to work” to obtain a further 80 licences it insists its fishing fleet is entitled to.
France had previously said 104 of its boats still lacked licences to operate in British and Channel Island waters that should have been granted under the Brexit agreement.
With the 23 permits granted Saturday, France is still seeking 81 approvals having received 1,027 in total so far.
Under the deal, EU fishermen can continue to work in British waters if they can prove they used to fish there.
France’s Fisheries Minister Annick Girardin and European Minister Clement Beaune said: “This work has accelerated in recent days.
They said in a joint statement: “France and the EU continue to work together to ensure the full application of the trade and cooperation agreement,”

Paris had threatened to lodge a complaint with the European Commission over the dispute.
That could have seen the EU impose financial penalties or even tariffs on British goods if Britain was judged to be reneging on its commitments.
Some 83 vessels have received licences since the EU attempted to intensify negotiations over outstanding applications in late November, according to Brussels.
French fishermen last month disrupted cross-Channel ferry and freight traffic in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements and consequent loss of trade.
Half a dozen fishing boats blocked access to ferries at the northern port of Calais and the port of Ouistreham in Normandy to the west.
In May, protesting French trawlers massed in front of Jersey’s main port and even caused a brief standoff with Royal Navy vessels.
The UK is highly dependent on French ports, particularly for fresh food imports, and any extended blockade would have the potential to have a significant impact.
The EU and Britain are also locked in a separate trade row over checks on products entering the British province of Northern Ireland after the UK government unilaterally postponed the introduction of checks.
The dispute has exacerbated deteriorating bilateral relations between Britain and France, who have clashed this year over migrant crossings in the English Channel, post-Brexit trade arrangements and submarine sales to Australia.
The British announcement comes a day before EU fisheries ministers meet in Brussels on Sunday to decide on annual fishing quotas in European waters.
The EU is holding talks separately with the UK towards fixing annual fishing quotas in their shared waters by the end of December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/protocol-not-sustainable-brandon-lewis-5723699-Mar2022/,"THE NORTHERN IRELAND Protocol is “not sustainable” in its current format, the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said.
The Secretary of State said 200 businesses in Great Britain are not trading with Northern Ireland due to the post-Brexit trade arrangements.
He also referred to supermarkets that do not have a store in Ireland, going through the same checks as if they were moving goods across the border.
“That is not sustainable. It’s not appropriate within the internal market in the UK, it’s certainly not what is going to be able to function for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland,” he told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee today.
Lewis said businesses across Northern Ireland, with the exception of one sector, are “pretty unanimous that the protocol and the EU’s package offered last October doesn’t resolve the issues either”.
He referred to reported issues with importing species of trees for the Queen’s Jubilee and kosher food across the Irish Sea, adding: “There are a whole range of examples of products… as a UK citizen, those citizens should be able to access, let alone businesses who need them for their supply lines.”
Talks between the UK and the EU over the Protocol have not yielded a deal.
Lewis told MPs that over the last six to nine months he has not seen “the pragmatism or flexibility” from the EU that would allow a deal, adding “otherwise we would have agreed one by now”.
There is strong opposition from unionists to the Protocol, regarding additional checks on goods at Northern Ireland’s port as a border in the Irish Sea.

Paul Givan resigned as Stormont First Minister earlier this year as part of the DUP’s opposition to the Protocol, which also removed Michelle O’Neill as deputy First Minister and left the Executive unable to fully function.
DUP MP Ian Paisley challenged Lewis, saying: “The talk is very strong but I think most people wonder when is some action going to actually flow from that.”
Lewis said the UK Government has not yet triggered Article 16, which would suspend some elements of the post-Brexit arrangements, because ministers want to find agreement for better stability and certainty for businesses.
“I appreciate your point about where does patience run out, our view is we will strain every last sinew to do this by agreement with the EU, and that’s the work that is continuing,” he told MPs.
Earlier in the session, Lewis said it is right that protocol checks on goods are continuing.
In February, Stormont Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots ordered the checks to be halted but that order was suspended after a legal challenge.
“Those checks are still ongoing and there’s no shift to that,” Lewis told MPs. “Our view is that they are a legal requirement and it is right that they are continuing.
Colin Perry, director of economy and Protocol at the Northern Ireland Office, said discussions are ongoing about how the checks will take place.
“Some of those checks will fall on the devolved administration, the agriculture department and the chief vet will make decisions about the kind of checks they put in place,” he told MPs.
Asked if he would be prepared to use his power to order the checks are carried out, Lewis responded: “I would look at using every other means that I possibly could on any issue.
“I believe in devolution so I believe in trying to work with the Executive to get things done in a devolved way by the devolved authority as much as we can.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/richard-neal-ireland-brexit-protocol-5772807-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|24 May 2022
DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has accused Congressman Richard Neal of “slavish adherence to Sinn Fein dogma” ahead of their meeting in Belfast on Thursday.
Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is leading a delegation of senior US politicians to Europe on a fact-finding mission about the Protocol.
Speaking today, Neal described the impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol as “a manufactured issue”, adding that “it’s up to London” to find a solution.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Neal referenced polling following this month’s Northern Ireland Assembly elections which suggested “7% of the people” voted based on the Protocol.
He said that while 80% of people expressed a desire to makes changes the Protocol, “you can say that about any piece of legislation I’ve ever had my hands on in my life”.
In atweet this afternoon, Donaldson responded to Neal’s comments saying:
Ina statement this evening, DUP MLA Diane Dodds described Neal’s comments as “outrageous”.
“Richie Neal has always been a friend of Sinn Fein and quick to pay tribute to the IRA so his disrespect for unionists isn’t much of a shock but to suggest the more than 40% of MLAs elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly less than 20 days ago were ‘manufacturing’ their opposition to the NI Protocol is outrageous,” he said.
The nine-strong bipartisan US delegation arrived in Europe last week and held talks in Brussels before travelling to London for talks with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.
The team has been in Ireland since the weekend,met with Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterdayand will travel to Belfast tomorrow for what Neal has described as two days of “serious” talks.

Speaking today after a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Neal said that trade issues connected to the Protocol could be solved “quickly”.
“We began in Brussels with purpose, moved to London, so we quickly heard divergent views. But as always we’re going to meet with everybody who has an interest here,” he said.
He added: “What we’ve heard so far clearly from European Union, is they want to find a solution. What we’ve heard from the Minister, the Taoiseach and the President, is they want to find a solution. We the congressional delegation want to find a solution. So I think now it’s up to London to help us all find a solution.”
Asked if he believed the Protocol issue was manufactured one, what the motivation might be to manufacture it, Neal said: “I hope this is not about domestic politics.”
Of the group’s meeting with Truss at the weekend and what specifically concerned the UK government, Neal said “there was a certain vagueness in the conversation.”
In a response to another US Congressman over the weekend,DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the Protocolhad the potential to “destroy the Good Friday Agreement”.
Neal said today that the “historic” Good Friday Agreement “should be celebrated widely” and that the basis of the deal was “everyone giving something up”.
“That’s what negotiation is,” he said.
The congressmen also spoke about a previous congressional trip he took to Ireland over 30 years ago when Northern Ireland “was a militarised state” with 30,000 British troops “in an area the size of our state of Connecticut”.
He described his bus being boarded by armed soldiers on the Donegal-Derry border:
“This is a template for the world and I don’t understand here, in the almost the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, why there would be any retreat, this should be celebrated widely,” he said.

Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said today that 53 of the 90 MLAs elected earlier this month “would vote for the Protocol in the morning if asked”.
The DUP has argued that there is no unionist majority for the Protocol in the Assembly but Coveney said today that there was “no cross community support for Brexit” either.
Coveney added that he feels there has been deliberate confusion about the requirement for cross-community support on issues in Northern Ireland, saying this only applies within the Executive.
“The other thing I think that is important to say is that the basis of the Good Friday Agreement is the principle of consent. The principle of consent is about what the majority of people in Northern Ireland want for their future. What is also important in the Good Friday Agreement is the principle of cross-community support,” he said.
“Cross-community support in the Good Friday Agreement applies to decisions that are being made through a devolved government structure for Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland. Some have deliberately tried to confuse what the principle of consent is, with what cross community support is.”

Addressing the Seanad this afternoon, Neal said “any incautious moves to undo the Protocol” could put the Good Friday Agreement at risk.
“We need courage, dialogue and leadership from all sides to keep Northern Ireland secure and prosperous,” he said.
Neal added that the delegation will head to Belfast tomorrow for “two very serious days with all the political parties”.
“We want to meet with people so that we can understand the fallout from the UK’s decision to leave the EU has affected all of them and us. This message we will bring is firm clear and unambiguous. The number one priority for the United States on this island is to ensure that the hard won peace in Northern Ireland is preserved and reinforced.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-checks-between-ni-and-gb-not-fit-for-purpose-5667833-Jan2022/,"EU OFFICIALS HAVE said that the system for checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK is “not fit for purpose”.
The draft report, compiled following an audit carried out by the European Commission in June last year, is highly critical of the current system of agri-food checks and recommends a series of changes.
Officials say the UK Government has “failed to ensure that sufficient resources – human and structural – have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland”.
Since the UK left the EU, new trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
It has achieved that by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, which has led to the checks on products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.
The report is highly critical of the implementation of these checks, noting: “The system is not fit for purpose, does not comply with EU rules and cannot provide sufficient assurances that only compliant animals and goods are permitted to enter the EU SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] area through the designated border control posts in Northern Ireland.”
Staffing was cited as a major issue, with EU officials bemoaning an insufficient number of “suitably qualified staff so that official controls and other official activities can be performed efficiently and effectively”.
This week, Stormont’s First Minister Paul Givan said his party colleague Edwin Poots will order a stop to the controversial checks after a failed bid to secure the wider approval of the Stormont Executive to continue them.

The anticipated move by the Agriculture Minister has been branded a stunt by other parties in Northern Ireland.
The other Executive parties insist Poots does not have the authority to prevent checks required under the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, an international treaty.
Unionist parties and loyalist groups have long been opposed to the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, arguing that they damage the union between the region and Great Britain.

Truss also tweeted following the meeting.
She said it was important that all sides “work constructively together to find solutions that address the problems in NI and protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement”.
The Foreign Secretary this week expressed her determination to secure a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol that can command universal support in Northern Ireland.
Truss made the comments after meeting with business and political leaders in Northern Ireland on Thursday.
She said: “What I want is a deal that works for everyone. We are making progress. We’re having constructive talks.
“I want to make significant progress by February. That’s important but it’s important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community.”
Recent days have seen renewed warnings from the main unionist party, the DUP, that it will walk away from the devolved institutions at Stormont if major changes to the Irish Sea border trading arrangements are not secured.

After another week in the laboured talks on solving the issues thrown up by the Brexit border deal, David Frost said he and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic had still not reached agreement.
The Brexit minister said “intensive talks” would continue next week. He and his opposite number will double how often they meet “in the hope of making worthwhile progress towards agreed solutions before Christmas”.
Frost had previously said he did not want protocol negotiations to continue beyond December.
Reports have suggested that the UK Government has watered down its demand that the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) must be removed from the protocol.
The stance had been seen as a block to any potential agreement, with Brussels refusing to countenance such a move.
But, in his statement on Friday, Frost said there needed to be “movement on all the difficult issues created by the protocol”, including on the Court of Justice.

The protocol was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland after the UK left the EU.
Both sides are trying to reach an agreement that would reduce customs paperwork and the number of checks required on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland and ensure a continued free flow of medicines across the Irish Sea.

https://www.thejournal.ie/long-way-to-go-northern-ireland-protocol-frost-5575539-Oct2021/,"THERE IS STILL “a long way to go” to reach resolution on the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol, Brexit minister David Frost has warned ahead of a meeting with his EU counterpart.
The UK Cabinet minister will hold talks with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in Brussels today as the two sides prepare to embark on a fresh round of negotiations on the post-Brexit Irish Sea trading mechanisms.
On Wednesday, the EU tabled a range of proposals aimed at cutting the red tape the arrangements have imposed on moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
However, the plan did not address a key UK demand – the removal of the European Court of Justice’s oversight function in the operation of the protocol.
Ahead of the lunch meeting in Brussels, Frost told Politico that the UK is studying the EU proposals “constructively”.
“Clearly they have proposed some changes; we do need to understand that detail, and we’ve begun that conversation, but there’s quite a long way to go,” he said.
Responding to claims that the UK is trying to tear up an international treaty, including allegations from former chief Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings that it was always the intention to ditch the protocol, Frost said the UK Government knew some elements of the arrangements would “possibly be difficult to make work in practice” and they were always viewed as “a little bit provisional and open to review”.
He insisted movement on the ECJ is needed.
Rejecting a claim that the UK is acting in bad faith, the Brexit minister added: “Obviously the protocol was agreed at a particular moment. We knew that some elements of the protocol would possibly be difficult to make work in practice, and some aspects of it were left open for the discussions in 2020 and afterwards.

“I don’t think it’s surprising that we found that that was the case … the very fact that the protocol has a consent mechanism (in the Stormont Assembly) in it for four years’ time showed we recognised that it might be necessary to renew or otherwise consent for these arrangements.
“In that sense they have always been a little bit provisional and open to review.”
Sefcovic has said the EU has stretched itself to offer far-reaching compromises but insisted he has no mandate to renegotiate the protocol.
“Now we should really do the last mile, work constructively with all the proposals we put on the table, put it finally to bed,” he told BBC Northern Ireland’s The View programme last night.
“I believe that we could be in the home stretch with our proposals on the table, and, as I said, let’s try to solve all these issues before Christmas because I think that would be the best Christmas gift we can give to the people of Northern Ireland.”
He added: “I have no mandate to renegotiate the protocol … the Withdrawal Agreement, protocol and trade and co-operation agreement, we signed it, we ratified it, it’s international law, and I think we should respect it.”
Suspending parts of protocol
Frost has warned the UK could move to suspend parts of the protocol, by triggering the Article 16 mechanism, if an acceptable compromise cannot be reached.
However, such a move could prompt retaliatory action on trade from the EU.
Amid reports that certain EU leaders are considering the form of potential retaliatory action, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said he hopes member states are not considering a trade war.
“I don’t know the extent to which this is posturing on the part of some of the EU member states in advance of the negotiations but bear in mind that the EU has a massive trading surplus with the UK,” he told Times Radio.
Related ReadsNorthern Ireland Protocol discussions will not be renegotiation, says SefcovicHere's what the EU is proposing for the NI protocol
“They sell far more goods into our country than we sell to them. We are a market of 60 million, the second largest market in Europe. Are those countries, especially the smaller member states, seriously saying they don’t want to sell us goods anymore, that they want a trade war? I would hope that isn’t the case.
“I can’t see how it’s in their interest to do that and what we need now is to focus on the negotiations. We’re not contemplating failure, we want to see success. But we are clear that if the EU does not step up and be reasonable in reaching an accommodation, then we do expect that the UK Government will take steps to protect the integrity of its own market.”
Donaldson was also pressed on the claim that Boris Johnson signed up to an agreement he knew he was going to break.
“I have no knowledge of that,” the DUP leader told Times Radio.
“That has certainly never been said to me and I was very much involved at that time. We were in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Government.
“At no stage did any Government minister including the Prime Minister say to me what you have described.”
The DUP leader also indicated the party’s threat to collapse powersharing at Stormont if changes to the protocol are not secured still stands.
“Our position is clear,” he said.
“I hope we can get a solution, but we are not going to continue implementing something that harms Northern Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-northern-ireland-trade-deal-eu-commission-6287838-Feb2024/,"LAST UPDATE|1 Feb 2024
THE DUP HAS given the green light for the recall of the Stormont Assembly, with powersharing due to be restored in the North on Saturday.
The announcement from party leader Jeffrey Donaldson comes after two pieces of legislation contained in the UK Government’s deal to resurrect devolution were fast-tracked through the House of Commons.
The two motions were approved by MPs this afternoon without the need for a formal vote.
The UK government fast-tracked legislation that would realise the measures outlined in its Safeguarding the Union command paper.
This would replace the Windsor Framework’s green lane process at Northern Ireland ports with a “UK internal market system” that will govern the movement of goods inside the United Kingdom.
The regulations will need to be approved by the House of Lords before they can become law. This is expected to take place on 13 February.
The DUP has said the UK government’s package to revive devolution in Belfast has delivered “fundamental change” to UK-EU arrangements on post-Brexit trade.
Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson has previously said negotiations had led to “clear” alterations to the Windsor Framework by ending routine checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Donaldson has written to the outgoing Speaker of the Stormont Assembly, Sinn Féin’s Alex Maskey, to confirm his party was prepared to end its two-year blockade on the institutions.
“I expect the Assembly will meet on Saturday following the Speaker consulting and making all necessary arrangements,” he said.

“It is my intention to meet with the leaders of the other executive parties during the course of Friday to finalise arrangements on the key issues that will be tackled by the incoming executive,” added Donaldson.
When the Northern Ireland Assembly does reconvene at Stormont, it will witness the historically significant moment of the appointment of its first nationalist first minister, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill.
In the UK Commons earlier today, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris sought to reassure MPs that the measures will not reduce the UK’s ability to diverge from EU rules.

“This is an important new safeguard to future-proof Northern Ireland’s constitutional status,” Heaton Harris said.
“No government in the future can agree to another protocol, nor can the UK internal market be salami-sliced by any future agreement with the European Union.”
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told Donaldson during today’s Commons session: “I think he has done a lot of good work over the past couple of weeks and he’s been very brave.”
However, Eastwood added that the SDLP “don’t support” this command paper.
The SDLP leader said it has “moved far beyond the principles set out in the Good Friday Agreement, it is undermining north-south cooperation, and it’s far too much focused on east-west”.
He said all future negotiation should be done with all parties and both governments so that “everybody can feel comfortable with the result”.
Donaldson said Eastwood made his point “with fortitude and determination”, but added that he makes “no apology” as a unionist for having a “focus on protecting, preserving and strengthening and binding together” the UK, of which the North is a “proud part”.
He added:
While a major change to UK-EU trade arrangements would require the approval of the bloc’s 27 member states, Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government has said the changes outlined in the deal with the DUP are “operational” in nature and don’t change the “fundamentals”.
This morning, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the European Commision would “have some questions” and will want to look at “some of the detail”, adding that he had spoken to the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about the deal.
“There are definitely going to be some questions about what was agreed between the UK government in the DUP but nobody is, at this stage, saying that there are any red flags, anything that gives us major concern,” Varadkar told reporters in Brussels while attending an EU leaders summit focussed on renewing financial support for Ukraine.
Varadkar also said that Irish “red lines” related to the status of the border with Northern the Republic’s position in the EU single market had not been crossed.
“From our point of view in Ireland, our priority was always to make sure there was no hard border between North and South. I think that’s been achieved and protected,” he said.
Yesterday, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris spoke to EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to explain the proposed changes detailed in the command paper.
In a statement, the Commission said it would “carefully analyse” the new measures.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-supermarket-apologises-non-eu-salt-and-pepper-label-5589836-Nov2021/,"UK SUPERMARKET CHAIN Morrisons has apologised after labelling a chicken product as containing “non-EU salt and pepper”.
Shoppers complained on social media over the packaging for the salt-and-pepper chicken crown, which also features the Union flag and highlights that it is made from “British chicken”.
The company immediately backtracked over the “error”, describing it as a mistake during the labelling process.

Morrisons tweeted that “the wording on the packaging is an error for which we apologise”, and told customers it was changing the packaging immediately.

A spokeswoman for the supermarket chain said: “Our chicken label is adhering to British packaging regulations, however, we will be redesigning it to make it clear this is not a political commentary.”
It came after a raft of tweets from customers who accused the company of “anti-EU bias” and threatened to stop shopping at Morrisons.
One Twitter user, David Bright, said: “I’m done with shopping @Morrisons … I can live with Union flags on bananas, but the gratuitous slight on the EU is too much.”
Another, Robin Wilton, tweeted to describe the packaging as “small-minded” and “populist-pandering bigotry that’s just cost you a customer”.
According to UK government guidance, meat packaging where full country information is not available must use the term “non-EU” to describe its origin.
From October next year, this will be replaced by “non-UK” after post-Brexit rule changes.
The furore comes a week after Morrisons moved into private hands, following its £7 billion takeover by US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-delays-post-brexit-border-checks-2024-6154896-Aug2023/,"
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has said it will delay introducing post-Brexit border controls on food and fresh produce from the European Union, postponing the start date to January 2024.
The UK had delayed implementing the checks several times since leaving the EU’s customs union and single market in January 2021, but British exports have faced controls for products heading in the opposite direction.
The UK was planning to finally roll out its new import controls in phases over 12 months from 31 October this year.
“Having listened to the views of industry, the government has agreed to a delay of three months for the introduction of remaining sanitary and phytosanitary controls, as well as full customs controls for non-qualifying Northern Ireland goods,” the government said.
It added that further controls for EU imports will also have a revised timetable “to give stakeholders additional time to prepare for the new checks”.

This includes physical checks and safety declarations, which will be introduced in stages throughout 2024.
The Financial Times reported last week that the UK’s finance minister Jeremy Hunt backed another delay to the border checks amid fears it would push up food prices during a cost-of-living crisis.
UK inflation, currently running at 6.8%, is the highest among G7 nations.
The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, after a referendum in favour of Brexit in 2016.
British exporters say EU controls have caused long delays at Channel ports, extra bureaucracy and cost, putting them at a commercial disadvantage with importers from the bloc.
Opponents say Brexit has erected barriers to trade with the UK’s biggest overseas market for goods and services, pushing up the price of food and cutting exports.

NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY Brandon Lewis has beenquestioned by MPsfrom the DUP and Labour over Boris Johnson’s previous statements that his Brexit deal would not result in checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and how they may have fed into unionist and loyalist frustrations and anger in recent days.
Lewis mentioned a number of factors that have led to scenes of unrest in recent days, including “frustrations” after a year of the coronavirus, particularly for young people; a “perception that the law is not enforced equally, especially after the PSNI’s decision not to prosecute those who attended the Bobby Storey funeral last June; as well as the Northern Ireland Protocol leading to questions around identity and political allegiances.
“Northern Ireland has made huge strides over the last two decades,” Lewis told the Commons, “but it is a post-conflict society and there do remain elements of fragility.”
An escalation of violence in some areas of Northern Ireland has been evident for the past 10 days: with the most dramatic seen at a peace wall separating two communities in west Belfast, where people as young as 14 were involved. A bus was also burnt out, and left the driver badly shaken.
So far, 88 police officers have been injured, there have been 18 arrested and 15 people have been charged.
Lewis told the Commons that there have also been other incidents of unrest in Newtownabbey in north Belfast, Ballymena, Cookstown, and Derry. In recent days they have reduced to isolated incidents only.
“It is tragic and deeply concerning that young people have been engaged in and encouraged into this violence, and will now end up with criminal records,” he said, adding that the factors behind it are “complex and multi-faceted”.
He also said that although the European Commission has apologised and recognised their mistake of suggesting to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, it “definitely had an impact” on Northern Ireland.
Representatives of civic society made that clear, Lewis said, adding that it has had “a lasting effect on people’s sense of identity”.

Johnson ‘not a casual observer’
PAPA
Today, over the course of an hour, Lewis answered 31 questions from MPs about recent violence in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Protocol, national identity, and how economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic would affect the “post-conflict society”.
Labour MPs in particular criticised UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for telling unionists and loyalists that there would be no border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain when he knew “full well” that his Brexit deal would result in new checks along the Irish Sea.
“He is not a casual observer to these events,” Labour’s Louise Haigh said, MP for Sheffield.
Labour’s Paul Blomfield, MP for Sheffield, said that Johnson had agreed to the Protocol and promoted it without being honest to the people of the North about what it meant:
Lewis said that Northern Ireland was an “integral and fixed part of the United Kingdom’s customs territory”. He emphasised that there needs to be as great an importance placed on east-west relations under the Good Friday Agreement, as there was on north-south.
SDLP MP Colum Eastwood said he was “disappointed” at the “lack of acceptance of culpability” from the UK government about how “they haven’t been honest with the unionist community” about how Brexit checks would work in practice.
What DUP MPs said
DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson called on the British government to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol, and thanked police officers for “impartially” applying the rule of law.
Jeffrey told the Commons: “[Louise Haigh] put her finger on it when she said that the issue here is trust – and taking the peace process forward has to be built on trust.”
He said “trust was broken” in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral, and said there was a “two-tier policing” in Northern Ireland, as well as the barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Lewis replied: “As [Donaldson] knows, we took unilateral action just a few weeks ago to ease some of the issues and issues that would have made matters even more difficult as I suggested at the time. I think it is now very clear they were the right actions to take.”
This is making reference to the UK government’s decision to unilaterally to extend by six months grace periods for Brexit checks required on parcels, plants, and supermarket goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

“I think, through that, people can see that we are determined to deal with some of the problems and the issues there (with) the Protocol.”
DUP MP Carla Lockhart for Upper Bann asked Lewis whether he accepted how deep anger is in unionist communities, and goes “far beyond those who have taken to the streets in recent days?”
“Will the Secretary of State take any opportunity to point out to his Irish and European colleagues whose belligerent approach has exacerbated the difficulties that the rigorous implementation of the Protocol is not only inconsistent with the Belfast Agreement, but is also, even before it is being implemented in full, causing societal difficulties in Northern Ireland?”
Brandon Lewis replied: “We are determined to work through these issues and make sure that the Protocol is one that can work for everybody in a sense that is pragmatic, flexible and free-flowing trade for GB to NI.”
Jim Shannon said that violence over the past few days was “unjustifiable”, but added that “people are dismayed and angered, their frustration is boiling over, they feel like second class citizens.”
What did other MPs say?
Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael (Orkney and Shetland) called on the Prime Minister to “step up to the plate” and demonstrate leadership.
Carmichael told the Commons: “For years the Government have been warned that peace in Northern Ireland was a delicate and fragile thing, and that it was not to be taken for granted.
“The fact that we have reached this point, I think, illustrates sadly only too well the recklessness of the position of the Prime Minister in particular with regard to the position of Northern Ireland and our departure from the European Union.”
Brandon Lewis replied that Johnson “has been involved in this all the way through”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-commission-vp-stormont-brexit-5442026-May2021/,"THE VICE PRESIDENT of the European Commission and the UK’s Brexit minister have been invited to address a Northern Ireland Assembly committee.
Members of Stormont’s Executive Office oversight committee agreed today to invite Maros Sefcovic and Lord Frost to address them.
Committee chairman Colin McGrath said they are being asked to give evidence on the impact of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Protocol divides opinion in Northern Ireland where the largest party, the DUP, is urging that it be scrapped.
Unionists and loyalists regard the rules of the Protocol, which includes additional checks on goods arriving at ports from Great Britain, as a “border down the Irish Sea”.

Anger at what is regarded as separation from the rest of the United Kingdom has sparked protests by loyalists across Northern Ireland.
Some of the protests descended into violence and attacks on police earlier this year, although more recent demonstrations have been peaceful.
McGrath said the ongoing negotiations between the European Commission and the UK Government will have a “significant impact” on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability.
“It is crucial, therefore, that those involved at the most senior level engage with the Northern Ireland Assembly Committee responsible for these matters,” he said.
“It is particularly important for those who continue to use Northern Ireland as a pawn to advance political grudges to sit down and front up with our committee.
“I have been deeply concerned about the rising rhetoric from the British Government over the course of the last number of weeks. Those who co-authored the Protocol cannot now distance themselves from its outworking.
“There are practical issues that need to be resolved, that means constructive engagement from both London and Brussels, but fundamentally the Protocol offers Northern Ireland a competitive advantage that we are not using to the benefit of local people and businesses.”

POLICE IN NORTHERN Ireland have said there is no evidence of loyalist paramilitaries being involved in threats made to workers conducting post-Brexit trade checks at Northern Ireland’s ports.
The European Commission earlier announced that its officials were being temporarily withdrawn from duties in NI, after the North’s Department of Agriculture temporarily suspended the need for post-Brexit checks at Belfast Port and Larne Port “in the interest of thewellbeing of staff“.
Police in Northern Ireland had raised concerns about messages on social media and graffiti that suggested opposition to post-Brexit checks.
In an update this evening, assistant chief constable Mark McEwan said the PSNI has no information to substantiate or corroborate an “anonymous piece of information claiming paramilitary involvement in threats”.
McEwan said he was concerned about signs of tension within the local community, adding that investigations into graffiti at various sites and other forms of intimidation on social media are ongoing.
The PSNI also increased patrols at the points of entry in order to “reassure” staff and the local community.
Three MLAs condemned any threatening behaviour or messages to Port staff at a Seanad committee today, and called on their unionist colleagues to play a greater role in diffusing any tensions so that staff could return back to work.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said today: “Obviously the security of our staff in Northern Ireland is as high a preoccupation as that of any other person working in Northern Ireland on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.”
“We have asked them not to attend their duties today and we will continue to monitor the situation and adapt accordingly.”
Mamer added: “We condemn very strongly any threats of violence against port officials or anybody else in Northern Ireland who are simply exercising their duties and implementing the Withdrawal Agreement. That must be absolutely clear.
“It is obvious for us that the first and utmost priority is the safety of people.”
Brussels has been in contact with the UK authorities “both from a security perspective and from the perspective of the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement”.
Senior figures from Brussels, Westminster and Stormont will discuss the situation in Northern Ireland’s ports tomorrow, the European Commission said.
UK Cabinet minister Michael Gove, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič will take part in the video conference.
Graffiti and social media
The PSNIlast weekwarned that graffiti and social media posts had indicated some dissatisfaction with post-Brexit checks imposed in Northern Ireland since 1 January.
In addition to fears over graffiti and social media, it is understood staff expressed concerns that individuals had been spotted taking down number-plate details.

This morning, graffiti was sprayed on at least two Alliance Party offices, one of which said“RIP GFA”and the other said “Stay out”.
“We’re serving the community, seeking solutions to the problems others caused. We will not be deflected from that by bomb hoaxes and graffiti,” Alliance leader Naomi Long said.
“Port workers must return to work free from threats or intimidation,” Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said. “This is non-negotiable. That is the strong message from the Northern Executive and from political leaders across Ireland.”
‘It’s not the Protocol causing problems – it’s Brexit’
It comes as a number of Senators and MLAs condemned any possible threats made to staff at the North’s ports.
The Seanad Special Select Committee on Brexit and the Northern Ireland Assembly’s Committee for the Executive Office met today to discuss the island of Ireland’s response to adapting checks introduced because of Brexit changes.
Reacting to the news today of the withdrawal of some staff from ports in Northern Ireland, SDLP MLA and Chair of the Executive Office Committee Colin McGrath said that threats are counter productive, as the new post-Brexit checks weren’t going to change, and staff needed to be on site at ports to get “the practicalities sorted out”.

“It’s not the Protocol causing these problems – it’s Brexit,” McGrath said, adding that “there will be difficulties for a year” in adjusting to post-Brexit changes.
He said there needs to be a collective approach to this, as “the bottom line is the sale of a potato or a pencil”, and it doesn’t matter who it’s being sold to.
‘The Protocol is being targeted’
The Northern Ireland Protocol came into effect on 1 January, when the Brexit transition period ended and Britain’s 2016 vote to split from the EU came into full effect. It is designed to prevent a hard border emerging between the north and EU member Ireland
Three representatives of the committee attended the Seanad committee today – two from Sinn Féin and one from the SDLP. McGrath said he would work to see that unionist members of the committee attend any future committee meetings with the Oireachtas.
Sinn Féin MLA for Foyle Martina Anderson said that the PSNI didn’t confirm that the graffiti threats to port staff was from loyalists.
“The Protocol is being targeted,” Anderson said. “These threats need to be removed, if people are taking car registration numbers, people need to be arrested.”
Emma Sheerin, Sinn Féin MLA for mid-Ulster, said that political unionists needed to show leadership amid these threats.
“There is no threat to their identity or to where they call home,” she said.
McGrath said: “If some politicians constantly [insert] culture into those issues, then we live in a very dangerous territory. Because once you start to threaten a person’s culture or identity, then they will react in a particular way.”
“It’s when we get everything tangled that we get ourselves tied in knots and confused.”
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said EU moves last week to restrict vaccine exports to the UK province, amid controversy over jab deliveries but which were swiftly abandoned, had “undermined” its special post-Brexit arrangements and “provoked concern”.
“What is needed is urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems with Protocol implementation,” he said on Twitter, while reiterating “Northern Ireland’s place in the UK will be protected and strengthened”.

DUP - free us from Protocolhttps://t.co/Vo0YLv8g9avia@duponline
The DUP announced this evening that it is to launch a co-ordinated bid to undermine the Northern Ireland Protocol in Belfast and London.
That includes an online petition calling for the UK Government to remove barriers to unfettered trade and opposing protocol-related legislation in the Stormont Assembly.
The party promised to work with other unionists to send a united message to London, Brussels and Dublin that Northern Ireland must be freed from the post-Brexit arrangement and its problems.
It also said it will:
It said: “The Government needs to be bold and be prepared to act to bring about outcomes that underpin Northern Ireland’s full place in the most important internal market for us – that of the UK.
“The Prime Minister must now directly address the people of Northern Ireland on the growing crisis arising from the protocol.”
Reacting to the announcement, Sinn Féin said the DUP’s position was “reckless” and not driven by the best interests of the people of the north.
Urging the DUP to “pull back”, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said: “Now is the time for calm leadership and solutions to deal with the disruption which has arisen as a result of Brexit.
“The Irish Protocol allows businesses in the north to export to Britain and the EU seamlessly, something that is of huge benefit to the north. It is critical that it is not unpicked and undermined after five weeks in operation.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-asia-pacific-trade-bloc-5341031-Jan2021/,"
BRITAIN INTENDS TO apply to join a massive 11-nation free-trade bloc of Asia-Pacific countries this week, not long after quitting the European Union’s single market.
International Trade Secretary Liz Truss will formally request tomorrow for Britain to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a market representing half a billion people and roughly 13.5 percent of the global economy.
The move comes a year after Britain left the European Union, ending more than forty years of membership, and after five years of complex trade discussions with the bloc.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the potential new partnership would “bring enormous economic benefits for the people of Britain”.
“Applying to be the first new country to join the CPTPP demonstrates our ambition to do business on the best terms with our friends and partners all over the world and be an enthusiastic champion of global free trade,” he said.
Negotiations between the UK and the partnership — which represents 11 Pacific Rim nations including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico and Vietnam — are expected to start this year, the trade department said.
But opposition Labour party shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry questioned the lack of transparency surrounding the pact.
After five years of debate over Brexit trade agreements, she said people would question the British government’s decision “to rush into joining another one on the other side of the world without any meaningful public consultation at all.”
“At present, Liz Truss cannot even guarantee whether we would have the right to veto China’s proposed accession if we join the bloc first,” she said.
Truss said joining the CPTPP would offer “enormous opportunities”.

Britain has already made agreements with CPTPP members such as Japan and Canada in the wake of Brexit and, according to British media reports, CPTPP nations accounted for around eight percent of UK exports in 2019.
Truss said the deal will mean lower tariffs for car manufacturers and whisky producers, and would also deliver “quality jobs and greater prosperity for people here at home”.
Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Truss praised the arrangements of the CPTPP in comparison to the EU, where Britain was subject to bodies like the European Court of Justice.
“There aren’t the strings attached so we wouldn’t have a court making judgments, we wouldn’t have any control over our borders lost, we wouldn’t be paying any money in,” she said.
Karan Bilimoria, president of the UK’s largest business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the move marked a “new chapter for our independent trade policy”.
“Membership of the bloc has the potential to deliver new opportunities for UK business across different sectors,” he said.
The CPTPP was launched in 2019 to remove trade barriers among the 11 nations representing nearly 500 million consumers in the Asia-Pacific region in a bid to counter China’s growing economic influence.
The partnership is an updated version of a giant deal originally backed by former US president Barack Obama.
The United States pulled out of the agreement under Donald Trump’s presidency — turning away from what he viewed as unfavourable multilateral deals — but 11 countries eventually agreed to sign the new version.
Britain’s departure from the European single market at the end of 2020 brought to an end the one-year Brexit transition period it had agreed with the EU. And the UK is seeking to advance the brand of “Global Britain” in 2021.

A UK SUPREME COURT challenge to the Northern Ireland Protocol post-Brexit trading arrangements has been unanimously dismissed.
The UK Supreme Court has ruled on the lawfulness of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
The legality of the contentious trading arrangements was challenged by a collective of unionists and Brexiteers.
Reacting to the Supreme Court judgment dismissing legal challenge against the Northern Ireland Protocol, DUP leader Jeffery Donaldson said the case had highlighted why unionists are opposed to the trading arrangements.
Jeffrey, who attended the judgment hearing in London, said: “A solution to the protocol was never going to be found in the courts, but the cases have served to highlight some of the reasons why unionists have uniformly rejected the protocol.
“The Government must consider this judgment, their own arguments to the court and take the steps necessary to replace the protocol with arrangements that unionists can support.  The protocol represents an existential threat to the future of Northern Ireland’s place within the Union. The longer the protocol remains, the more it will harm the Union itself.
“The checks on the Irish Sea border are the symptom of the underlying problem, namely, that Northern Ireland is subject to a different set of laws imposed upon us by a foreign entity without any say or vote by any elected representative of the people of Northern Ireland,” he added.

Arguments were considered by the UK’s highest court at a two-day hearing last year after the Court of Appeal upheld a ruling in Belfast High Court dismissing the legal challenge.
The protocol, which is a key aspect of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, was jointly designed by London and Brussels to keep Ireland’s land border free flowing following the UK’s departure from the EU.
Becoming effective in 2021, the arrangements instead shifted customs and regulatory checks to the Irish Sea and created new red tape on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with trade in the region remaining subject to certain EU Single Market rules.
The appellants argued that the legislation passed at Westminster to give effect to the Withdrawal Agreement conflicts with the 1800 Acts of Union that formed the United Kingdom, particularly Article 6 of that statute guaranteeing unfettered trade within the UK.
The legal challenge also contended that the protocol undermines the peace process legislation underpinning Northern Ireland’s powersharing settlement at Stormont – the 1998 Northern Ireland Act.
The Northern Ireland Act, which gave effect to the historic Good Friday peace agreement, guarantees that the constitutional status of the region can only be changed with the consent of its citizens via referendum.
It also includes cross community provisions (Section 42) that ensure controversial decisions at Stormont can only be taken if they are supported by a certain proportion of both nationalist and unionist MLAs.
The Withdrawal Agreement does provide for a future Assembly vote on the continuation of the protocol, however the UK Government has amended Stormont rules so the vote can be passed on a straight majority basis, rather than having to meet the cross community consent thresholds.
In 2021, Belfast High Court judge Mr Justice Colton dismissed a judicial review challenge against the lawfulness of the protocol on all grounds.

His judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year.
While the Appeal Court found that the protocol does conflict with the Acts of Union in respect of unfettered trade, judges ruled that the 1800 statute had been lawfully modified by Parliament.
The court also dismissed the argument that the post-Brexit trading arrangements have changed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.
It further ruled that the Government did have the authority to disapply the cross community voting provisions in the Stormont Assembly when it came to the vote on the future of the protocol.
The Court of Appeal later granted leave for the case to be referred to the Supreme Court.
The case involved two conjoined challenges – one taken by unionist politicians and Brexiteers including Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Baroness Kate Hoey and the other mounted by a loyalist pastor from Belfast, Clifford Peeples.","7.21am, 8 Feb 2023",8 Feb 2023

EUROPEAN COMMISSION CHIEF Ursula von der Leyen will meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London tomorrow to discuss changes on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, they said in a joint statement.
In what appears to be the talks entering into an endgame phase the statement said the meeting would address “complex challenges”.
The two “agreed to continue their work in person towards shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland”, said the statement issued late Sunday.
Commission “President von der Leyen will therefore meet with the Prime Minister in the UK tomorrow,” it said.

SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has welcomed progress in talks between the European Commission and the British Government.
Eastwood said that any resolution to the discussions must secure the benefits of dual market access for businesses in Northern Ireland.
Over the line
Earlier Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the EU and UK both want to get a resolution on the Northern Ireland Protocol “over the line”.
It’s believed that both sides are growing ever nearer to an agreement on the post-Brexit trading mechanism that has prevented a hard border on the island of Ireland but drawn unionist ire.
Deputy British Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said he expects a pact to be signed off in “days, not weeks”, while the Tánaiste said he believes reaching a deal will be for the benefit of people in Northern Ireland.
Speaking to RTÉ, the Tánaiste said that “our objective collectively between the British government, the Irish government, the European Union is to have a resolution between the EU and UK and have the convention for the assembly and the executive restored in Northern Ireland, which I think will benefit the people of Northern Ireland”.
“I’m always very wary of speculating in respect of timelines but I do know that the will is there on everybody’s behalf now to get this over the line in a quicker timeline,” he said.
On whether the deal in the works could satisfy the DUP and restore powersharing in Stormont, he said: “I would hope so and I believe we’ve listened very, very carefully to the concerns of all parties in Northern Ireland.”

“It’s clear to me that both negotiating teams worked on the basis of responding to concerns that had been raised by political parties in Northern Ireland.”
Meanwhile, the UK’s Dominic Raab said there had been a “paradigm shift” in the approach from Brussels, hinting that talks had wielded changes on customs checks as well as the role of the European Court of Justice.
Raab, asked on Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme whether a deal could be unveiled as soon as tomorrow, replied: “I think there is real progress.”
“We want to make sure all the pieces are in place. I think, hopefully, there will be good news in a matter of days, not weeks,” he said.
The Cabinet minister later told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “If we can get this over the line — we’re on the cusp, we’ve made great progress, we’re not there yet — this would be a really important deal.”
It comes as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said yesterday his administration was “giving it everything we’ve got” to finalise a deal.
Hard border
The Protocol was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and placing trade checks at the Irish Sea instead, which unionists have lamented.
Several reports have said there will be red and green lanes for customs, allowing trusted traders to send goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland without checks, while goods destined for Ireland and the EU’s single market will go through the red lane.
The European Court of Justice’s role in Northern Ireland under the Protocol has become a point of contention in the negotiations, with unionists and Westminster eurosceptics wanting to be free of its influence.
The Tánaiste said today: “I think the problem is that very often its role is not understood more broadly across society.”
“What is very interesting in all of my consultations with parties in Northern Ireland and with industry and business, all want continued access to the European Union single market because it benefits the Northern Ireland economy,” he said.
“There’s balance and perspective in all negotiations and I think we need to properly understand the role of the ECJ – it’s around interpreting European Union law.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that “certainly the deal isn’t done yet” but that “I do think we are inching towards conclusion and I really want to thank the UK Government and the European Commission and the Northern Ireland parties for the level of engagement that they’ve done in recent months to get us to this point”.
“I would just encourage everyone to go the extra mile to come to an agreement because the benefits are huge,” he said.
“They allow us to have the Northern Ireland Assembly back up and running in the north and the Good Friday Agreement working properly again, and also to put relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland and the European Union on a much more positive footing.”

[NOTE: We are now covering all of today's rolling eventsin a liveblog]
UK PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak appears to be on the verge of agreeing a Brexit deal aimed at easing trade friction in Northern Ireland as he enters into “final talks” with the European Union.
Sunak will meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Windsor today to discuss a “range of complex challenges” around the Northern Ireland Protocol, Downing Street said.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that he had been in touch with both leaders at the weekend, and described the visit as an encouraging development.
Speaking to RTÉ News last night he said the two sides were “inching forward to an agreement”, adding that “there’s definitely still a bit of work to be done”.
Downing Street has raised the prospect that the talks could produce a breakthrough moment after months of negotiations with Brussels about fixing the protocol.
Sunak, following on from his discussions with the EU chief, is planning to brief his Cabinet before potentially announcing to voters and MPs the details of any agreed deal.
He told the Express newspaper that should he shake hands with von der Leyen on a pact that “works for all”, it would “show that Brexit truly works and will finish the job”.
He added: “This deal will work better for business and communities and get goods moving.
“It will resolve the issues so we can all move forward. This will give Northern Ireland control of their own destiny. This is something very positive.”
The protocol D-Day, however, is fraught with risks for the Prime Minister.
If any potential agreement fails to meet the red lines set by the DUP, it could mean the party continues to abstain from restoring Stormint and put him on a collision course with hardline Brexiteers on his own backbenches.
Downing Street has not fully committed to giving Parliament a vote on the agreement, as demanded by the hardline Brexiteer Tory group the European Research Group (ERG).
The Times, however, reported that Cabinet ministers had briefed MPs that they could expect to have their say on at least “part of the deal”.
Speaking this morning, Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said the “devil is in the detail” and he refused to say if he would vote for the deal.
“So, if the DUP doesn’t think that it meets test, that will be very influential among Conservative MPs.
“I’m afraid with all the EU deals the devil is in the detail, so when people say ‘we need to see the legal text’, they are not larking about, they really want to see it to understand what the effect is.”

The former Cabinet minister added that he does not believe Sunak has done enough to convince the DUP to go back into power-sharing:
The Protocol, signed by Boris Johnson in 2020, was designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit, with Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on goods to prevent checks being needed when crossing into the Republic.
But the trade barriers in the Irish Sea created by the treaty have created tension, with the DUP collapsing powersharing last year in protest at its impact.
Today’s schedule
Sunak will speak with the EU leader at lunchtime before holding a virtual Cabinet session from Windsor to brief them on what he has managed to secure.
Those most closely involved, including Foreign Secretary James Cleverly — who has met regularly in recent weeks with commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic — and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, are expected to join him in person.
Should London and Brussels sign-off on a protocol revision, Sunak and von der Leyen will hold a joint press conference.
Sunak plans to travel to Westminster afterwards to give a statement in the House of Commons.
What’s in the deal?
There has been little detail revealed on what is currently on the table in terms of a fresh pact but UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab appeared to hint at what might be in a new deal during interviews yesterday.
Raab indicated that reports of check-free lanes for goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland were correct and that efforts had been made to give Belfast a role in approving new EU laws that would apply in the North.
The Leave campaigner said the reduction in trade red tape would lead to a “substantial scaling back” of the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), but he refused to rule out it having a say on future legal cases.
The continued application of Brussels-made laws and the influence of European judges in Northern Ireland after Brexit has angered Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP, putting Sunak at risk of a backbench revolt if he calls a vote on a deal that permits either.
He is likely to win any division but is keen to avoid needing Labour votes, with the Opposition party supporting a revised deal, to secure victory.
Speaking yesteday, Tánaiste Michéal Martin said “very significant progress” had been made in the talks and said the negotiating teams should be given space “not just to agree a deal, but to land a deal”.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed news of the progress and said any resolution to the discussions “must secure the benefits of dual market access for businesses in Northern Ireland”.
He added in a statement:  “All political parties in the North will study the contents of any deal in detail but we should all be approaching this moment in good faith and with a determination to restore the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.
“The politics of division and deadlock must be abandoned in the days ahead.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/frost-accuses-eu-ignoring-political-sensitivities-northern-ireland-5588725-Nov2021/,"UK BREXIT MINISTER David Frost has condemned the European Union for behaving “without regard to the huge political, economic and identity sensitivities” in Northern Ireland.
Frost also said the EU had “destroyed cross-community consent” with an “overly strict” enforcement of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The attack came after the UK and the EU put forward proposals to address the dispute over the protocol, which was negotiated by Frost.
He made the comments in the foreword to a new paper for the Policy Exchange think tank that sets out how negotiations in the Brexit process have been hampered by decisions made in 2017.

The terms of the protocol effectively kept Northern Ireland in the single market, creating a border down the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the fourth nation of the UK, which has angered unionists and hit the UK’s internal market.
Frost said: “We must return to the protocol and deliver a more robust, and more balanced, outcome than we could in 2019.”
He argues that a 2017 EU-UK joint report, which set the terms for the Brexit process, was a result of the UK failing to make “the necessary mental shift from being a member of the EU to negotiating exit from the EU”.
He also claimed it was a result of the “extreme weakness” of the UK Government after the June 2017 election.
The Policy Exchange paper – The Northern Ireland Protocol: The Origins of the Current Crisis, by Roderick Crawford – provides a chronology of Brexit negotiations and what went wrong in 2017.
It argues that commitments, particularly on the Irish border, in the 2017 joint report were “a diplomatic triumph for Ireland and the (European) Commission” but “failing to secure adequate reciprocal concessions was a staggering failure for the UK”.
Related Reads‘Do they want a solution at all?’: O’Neill questions the UK’s red lines on NI ProtocolIs the Protocol bad or good for firms in Northern Ireland? It's both, they sayUK and EU 'still far apart' on big NI Protocol issues as talks to continue in London
Crawford says the joint report – and what it committed the UK to – led to a flawed February 2018 draft withdrawal agreement and the subsequent November 2018 Withdrawal Agreement.
The paper says that led to the fall of Theresa May’s government in 2019 and “tied the hands” of the new Government led by Boris Johnson that year as it renegotiated the terms of Brexit.
Frost also warns that enforcement of the Northern Ireland Protocol “has begun to damage” the Good Friday Agreement.
He claims he considered resigning in December 2017 after reading the terms of the joint report and realising “a crucial pass had been sold”.

Ever wonder why Ireland never wins the Eurovision anymore? Our entry to this year’s Eurovision, Brooke Scullion, was a big hit on the semi-final night – as the cheers in the stadium proved. But unfortunately, she didn’t make it through to the final. We had a great song, it was going down well with the fans – so why didn’t it work? We’ve asked this question for quite a few years, mainly because we had such a great run of it in the 1980s and 1990s.

European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly chaired meeting to formally adopt the new arrangements for Northern Ireland after the UK Government won MPs’ backing for the Windsor Framework earlier this week.
The vote by MPs in favour of regulations to implement the Stormont brake, a key part of the Windsor agreement, came despite former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss joining the Democratic Unionist Party and hardline Brexit-backing Tory MPs in voting against the deal.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson and his party continue to oppose the deal with no sign of yet being willing to return to powersharing.

The formal sign-off, which is understood to have happened mid-morning, comes as Jeffrey Donaldson’s party continues to oppose the deal brokered by the Government, with no sign of the DUP yet being willing to return to powersharing.
The UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris warned the DUP that there was no prospect of renegotiating the deal ahead of today’s meeting, which comes after Brussels also formally agreed to the key parts of the Windsor Framework at an EU Council meeting.
The formal sign-off happened at a meeting of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee meeting, with Šefčovič and Cleverly also attending a meeting of the partnership council – another of the implementation bodies under the Brexit deal.

“By formally approving the Windsor Framework, we are delivering on our commitment to provide stability and certainty for Northern Ireland,” Cleverly said.
He said the the framework is “the best deal for Northern Ireland” and for “safeguarding its place in the union” and protecting the Good Friday Agreement.
“I look forward to further effective co-operation with the EU on key issues, such as security and energy.”
Tánaiste Micheál Martin has welcomed the signing of the deal.
“Today’s endorsement of the Windsor Framework should provide momentum towards early restoration of all institutions of the Good Friday Agreement for the benefit of the people in Northern Ireland,” he said on Twitter.
The UK hopes that the new deal on the protocol can mark a step towards British participation in the EU’s €100 billion Horizon programme, with science and research likely to feature in official discussions between the pair.
Šefčovič and Cleverly were also expected to discuss a recent agreement between the the EU, Ireland and the UK on Peace Plus, the cross-border peace funding programme.
The continuing stand-off over Stormont suggests the prospects for a return to powersharing at Stormont in time for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement mext month remain bleak.

However, there are plans to exempt people from the Republic of Ireland from having to do so.
The new Minister of State for Immigration, Robert Jenrick, outlined the plans in response to parliamentary questions from Stephen Farry, an MP from the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.
Jenrick said: “Our long-term aim is that all visitors and migrants to the UK will provide both their face and fingerprint biometrics under a single global immigration system.

“As part of the ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation) application process, applicants will be required to submit their biometrics.
“At the outset, however, we will only require facial images from ETA applicants, until such time as there is a technological solution which will allow them to self-upload fingerprints of the required quality, as we will not require them to visit a visa application centre to give their fingerprints.”
However, the Conservative Party MP said that Irish citizens “will not be required to obtain an ETA”.
Jenrick added: “All other non-British and non-Irish nationals arriving in the UK, including those crossing the land border into Northern Ireland, need to enter in line with the UK’s immigration framework: this will include the requirement to obtain an ETA when it is introduced.
“However, as now, the UK will not operate routine immigration controls on journeys from within the Common Travel Area, with no immigration controls whatsoever on the Ireland-Northern Ireland land border.
“The UK is currently working with Ireland to consider whether there is scope for a workable UK/Ireland data-sharing solution to determine whether a person is a lawful resident of Ireland, and so could potentially be exempt from the ETA requirement for travel into the UK.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/ireland-britain-immigration-6369683-May2024/,"THIS WEEK STARTED with the postponement of a planned meeting between Ireland’s Justice Minister, Helen McEntee, and the UK’s Home Secretary, James Cleverly, ahead of the latest British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
Top of the agenda had been a discussion on the Common Travel Area (CTA), amid rising tensions between the UK and Ireland on the issue of asylum seekers entering Ireland via Northern Ireland.
That the meeting didn’t proceed was of significance given its timing, with this brewing row doing little to aid UK-Irish relations, already cooled in the wake of Brexit and the UK’sLegacy Act.
McEntee claims that over 80% of new asylum seekers in Ireland have travelled from the UK through Northern Ireland. While this number has not been verified, it does give a broader indication that there has been a notable change in the patterns being observed, and that the Irish Government is worried about it. The UK has ardently taken the position that it will not countenance accepting any asylum seekers returned from Ireland, meaning, in effect, that the two are in a stand-off on the issue.
There are a number of elements to this that make it difficult to resolve. Legally, the situation reflects a quagmire of overlapping considerations, namely the CTA, Northern Ireland’s specific post-Brexit arrangements, EU law, UK domestic law and international law. This immediately makes it complex and necessitates close cooperation between the UK and Ireland to reach a mutually agreeable outcome that is also compliant with these legal requirements.
Politically, the subject itself is deeply contentious in both places, making it difficult for either side to be seen to cede ground. The rise of the far right and anti-migrant views in Ireland have been making regular headlines. Meanwhile, the current UK Government has made immigration a cornerstone of its agenda, and post-Brexit – where the UK sits outside EU legal obligations with regard to asylum seekers – it has pursued drastic policies aimed at deterring migrants from seeking refuge in the UK. A particular focus of this has been individuals arriving from France to the UK’s southern shores.

Divisivelegislationwas passed, formalising what has been known as the Rwanda policy of the current UK Government. The purpose of this is to allow for the transfer of some asylum seekers to Rwanda while applications are being processed, and for permanent residence there if successful. This is despite the UK Supreme Court finding that Rwanda could not be considered a safe place to send asylum seekers – a finding circumvented by the subsequent Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration)Act2024, which effectively acts as the UK’s formal means of declaring that it considers Rwanda to be a safe country for this purpose.
The picture is complicated further by a recent Irish High Courtcase,which found that Ireland’s basis for designating the UK as a ‘safe third country’ for the purposes of returning asylum seekers was incompatible with EU law. This has contributed to disagreement as to whether or not, and to what extent if so, formal post-Brexit arrangements exist for the return of asylum seekers from Ireland to the UK.
Britain’s Prime Minister Sunak has argued that the UK is under no legal obligation to accept asylum seekers back from Ireland/the EU; Ireland’s Justice Minister has argued that this is contrary to arrangements already in place that require Irish legislation in order to become effective, addressing the issue raised by the High Court.
As Murray and Peersnote, the often informal nature of the CTA, which also sits at the heart of this issue, is such that there is scope for misinterpretations to arise. This suggests that there is some veracity in the arguments on both sides, however, it doesn’t make reaching a solution any easier, particularly with wider political contexts hardening stances.
The specific circumstances of Northern Ireland add further to this already complex picture. In respect of asylum seekers, Northern Ireland potentially presents an anomaly to the application of the UK’s Rwanda legislation. Under the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, human rights protections have a different, and stronger, basis than elsewhere in the UK due to Article 2 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, which contains a commitment to non-diminution of pre-Brexit rights.
A legalcaseis already in progress challenging the UK’s Illegal Migration Act 2023 on the basis of incompatibility with, in part, Article 2 of the Protocol, and until the outcome of this is known, much remains uncertain in terms of how this controversial legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
It potentially means that Northern Ireland could become something of a safe haven for asylum seekers fleeing the Rwanda policy in Great Britain and fearful of being returned to the UK should they enter Ireland.
What is clear though, and equally as absent from wider discourse on the current issue, is that Northern Ireland is woefully unprepared for any such situation. It is also unlikely that any support would be forthcoming from Westminster given the current Government’s political plans to create as many deterrents as possible to any future migrants seeking refuge in the UK.

The political rhetoric around the issue has only further aggravated the situation. Elections are imminent in the UK and Ireland, and incumbent administrations are eager to be seen as tough on this problem. The difficulty is that the tougher they try to prove themselves to be domestically, the more divisive the matter becomes diplomatically.
And, as it ever feels, Northern Ireland is akin to being caught in the middle between two arguing parents, unable to do much, if anything, to help alleviate the situation for the human beings at the centre of it all.
The multilevel legal complexities alone always meant that any formalisation of the Rwanda plan would have ripple effects far beyond the UK. Neither the UK nor Ireland are likely to back down, and the longer exchanges at this level continue, the more difficult it will be to reach agreement on how to proceed.
Dialogue and cooperation are the only way forward.

FOR A WHILE now, I have been calling it ‘Donaldson’s Trimble Moment’ — not to suggest anything as heavy as the weights carried by the late Ulster Unionist leader on Good Friday 1998, but for Sir Jeffrey Donaldson this was the biggest test of his political leadership.
Would he, could he, return the DUP to the Stormont Executive in the face of significant opposition from both inside and outside his party?
The answer is yes – delivered in words he spoke after midnight and after a detailed briefing to the party’s Executive, outlining his negotiations with the UK Government.
Soon, all of the plays of the past two years will be overtaken by something else, as Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin steps into the position of First Minister, in an office of equals, but in a place where titles always matter.
First Minister sounds better than deputy First Minister, the position the DUP is now relegated to in the changing politics of the North and after the results of the May 2022 Assembly Election.
The past two years have been about post-Brexit trading arrangements, about the so-called Irish Sea border, about Northern Ireland’s status within the Union — about things that created something of a ‘constitutional crisis’.
It was a tough lesson that politics is not just about what you want (Brexit), but what comes with it — the Protocol, the Windsor Framework, the sea border and the convulsion that has been this latest long standoff at Stormont.
We wait now for the UK Government to publish legislation to see how many of the DUP’s seven tests have been met; and to hear not just Donaldson’s assessment of that, but what others have to say.
Tests in negotiations become hooks, and how to get off them has been the challenge of this negotiation.

On Monday, with things moving within our politics, the Northern Ireland Office finally briefed the Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie on the proposed legislation.
The building anger in his voice in recent weeks must have finally pierced the walls of the NIO.
And it will be interesting now to hear his assessment of that legislation, and how generous, or otherwise he is, to the DUP when giving his verdict on how it compares with the seven tests.
Recently, inside this negotiation, there has been a sense of things being in a better place; of there being a chance of getting a deal over the line.
That Donaldson was close to a decision, and in turn, the UK Government had set a new, and short deadline, of 8 February.
It is something I spoke about on the Explainer Podcast last week.
The Explainer·Is power sharing in Northern Ireland finished?
The deal that we now wait to see being sequenced and implemented is not just about what will change in relation to the post-Brexit trading arrangements, but includes a significant financial package of £3 billion-plus put on the table by the UK Government, but conditional on the Northern Ireland Executive being restored.
It is for public sector pay, to address an overspend and to help transform public services; there will be new tiles on the fiscal floor.
It is yet another new start for this place.
NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has been the UK Government’s face and voice in this negotiation, but in the background former Secretary of State Julian Smith, who with then Tánaiste Simon Coveney managed the last rescue mission in 2020, has again been a significant player.

There was a small protest outside that DUP Executive meeting last night, and a running commentary on social media.
Donaldson ignored that. Held his ground.
And has manoeuvred his party back in the direction of Stormont.
There are bigger challenges to come.
A deal to restore the Northern Ireland Executive is a low bar.
How to finally achieve a politics that works, how to take the drama out of Stormont, is the bigger task; the hard work yet to be done.
In the 25 years since Good Friday, our politics has struggled in the peace.
We now need a wide ranging review that asks the question: Why?
Stormont for the sake of Stormont is not worth having.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-newsletter-extract-sausage-war-poots-putsch-5471291-Jun2021/,"FROM THE LOFTY heights of international diplomacy, to the myriad global challenges the world faces – what threatened to disrupt Boris Johnson’s G7 summit last weekend was the very ordinary matter of sausages being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Ahead of what was meant to be a glorious moment in the world-stage spotlight for a post-Brexit ‘Global Britain’, Johnson instead spent a significant portion of his time defending his approach to post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
Though the row includes all chilled meats, sausages became the epitome of how complicated things have become: a viral photo of DUP MP Sammy Wilson clutching a bunch of sausages in front of a Union Jack, while calling the Protocol “farcical”, may have captured the height of the food fight.

But the simple sausage is just a practical example of what is actually a complicated quirk of the post-Brexit trade deal, and the Northern Ireland Protocol contained within it.
Under EU rules, chilled processed meats such as sausages and minced meat cannot be imported to the EU from third countries – which the UK now is after Brexit.

But because Northern Ireland has slightly different post-Brexit rules than Great Britain, as per the Protocol that aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, there have been some problems with GB-to-NI trade, including on the trade of chilled meats.
At the start of the year, a six-month grace period was put in place that would mean this ban on chilled meats going from GB to NI would be postponed until July – meaning the North’s citizens could still buy British sausages.
But the UK is now requesting that this is extended for another three months until 30 September – and had threatened to take this action unilaterally.
At the G7 summit, after a strong public statement from US President Joe Biden, a fiery exchange with French President Emmanuel Macron, and a testy conversation with Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, Johnson was left bruised from the diplomatic ambush over Northern Ireland trade.
It was reported that the EU had hoped to bypass the dogged UK Brexit minister David Frost and come to an agreement on some of the biggest issues Brexit has caused in Northern Ireland. But in one meeting, Johnson is reported to have said that he is not the softer touch on this issue.
In a knee-jerk response, he threatened to do what it takes to keep sending British sausages to the North – but days later, the UK did in fact ask politely for the EU to grant an extension to waive those EU checks. Where things go from here is anyone’s guess.
The Poots putsch could derail Protocol progress
Speaking of guessing games, who could have predicted the resignation of Edwin Poots as leader of the DUP, just 21 days after taking the reins.

It all kicked offafter a post-midnight deal with Sinn Féin and the DUP, when the UK governmentcommitted to passing Irish language laws in the autumn if the Stormont Assembly does not do so before then.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that the deal with the British Government was necessary to stop the DUP obstructing the Irish language act for the guts of the last 10 years, which could have resulted in Sinn Féin withdrawing their support from the Executive.
But the DUP beat them to it – after the Irish language act deal was done, members of the DUP began expressing their unhappiness that Poots had facilitated the deal.
The anger was so palpable that before the end of the day, Edwin Poots announced that he was resigning, and would stay in the role only until a new leader was elected.
The whole bitter row has left the Irish Government concerned that it could derail progress on the Protocol, with Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney warning that the threat of a snap election in the North could be a de facto referendum on the Northern Ireland Protocol – after it being in place for just six months – and divide the sides even further.
As Coveney said, this is the last thing Northern Ireland needs.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-warns-of-serious-consequences-if-the-uk-decides-to-trigger-article-16-5593395-Nov2021/,"
THE EUROPEAN UNION today warned Britain of “serious consequences” if the UK follows through on threats to suspend part of the Brexit treaty dealing with Northern Ireland.
The two sides are locked in talks seeking to resolve problems caused by the trading arrangements for Northern Ireland agreed as part of the Britain’s acrimonious departure from the EU.
The EU has offered to ease customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom, a key point of anger for pro-British parties in the province.
But London says it could move to suspend the protocol unless Brussels agrees to more sweeping changes to rewrite the accord.
“This was a big move by us, but until today we have seen no move at all from the UK side,” said European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic after a fresh round of talks with Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost in Brussels.
“I find this disappointing, and once again, I urge the UK government to engage with us sincerely.”

Sefcovic hit back at threats from the UK to trigger Article 16 of the agreement that could lead to its suspension.
“There’ll be no doubt that triggering Article 16 to seek the renegotiation of the protocol would have serious consequences – serious for Northern Ireland… and serious also for the EU-UK relations in general,” he said.
He said the two sides would hold talks again in London next Friday, adding “I see next week as an important one”.

Talks on ‘gaps’
The differences over Northern Ireland have soured relations between Brussels and London and risk causing a trade war that could bring bilateral trade to a standstill.
A British government statement after the talks said progress has been “limited”, but added “these gaps could still be bridged through further intensive discussions”.
“The EU’s proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating,” the statement said.

Britain has previously threatened to use Article 16 if the EU does not redraw the protocol. Europe could retaliate a month later under the terms of the treaty.
A European diplomat said Brussels was increasingly readying itself for the possibility London could trigger Article 16 and warned of a “strong reaction” from the EU if that happened.
The diplomat said that might involve Brussels suspending the overall post-Brexit trade deal – a move that could plunge ties between the two sides to an acrimonious low and take them back to square one.
The dispute over Northern Ireland comes as Britain and France are locked in another furious post-Brexit dispute over fishing rights.
The row has added to a litany of problems between the Channel neighbours in the wake of Brexit that has plunged relations to a level of belligerence rarely seen in recent years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-5965126-Jan2023/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Jan 2023
A WEEK INTO 2023, the Brexit issue is still ongoing.
Seven years on from the UK voting to leave the European Union and almost three years on from the Withdrawal Agreement being signed, the outworkings of Brexit remain an issue and, while not as dominant, continue to play a role in Irish politics.
While there has been some movement in the last day, there are still significant hurdles  for the two sides in the divorces – the UK and the EU – to overcome before the issue around the Northern Ireland Protocol is resolved.
The DUP is continuing to block the sitting of the Assembly and the establishment of an Executive over the Protocol, and say they will do so until they are satisfied with an agreement.
Before Christmas, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that therewere “mistakes” made over the handling of Brexit.
He told political journalists at a roundtable in December that the Protocol itself was “too strict” and that he understood the concerns of Unionists.
“We are willing to show flexibility and to make compromises. We do want there to be an agreement,” Varadkar said.
In the last 24 hours, there has been some progress made between the EU and UK.
Yesterday, a joint statement from UK Foreign Minister James Cleverly and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic announced that there had been an agreement on data sharing.
The agreement itself is around EU access to UK IT systems, with both sides hailing it as a key step in moving forward to solve the ongoing row over the Protocol.
“They agreed that while a range of critical issues need to be resolved to find a way forward, an agreement was reached today on the way forward regarding the specific question of the EU’s access to UK IT systems,” reads the joint statement issued yesterday.
The meeting itself was described as “cordial and constructive”, with both Cleverly and Sefcovic noting that this sharing of data systems was a “critical prerequisite” to building trust between the EU and UK.
The meeting will now allow for renewed discussions between UK and EU technical teams, who “will work rapidly to scope the potential for solutions in different areas on the basis of this renewed understanding”.
But what exactly was the issue?

Previously, the EU had complained about a lack of access to real-time UK data on goods that were entering into Northern Ireland from Britain.
These goods would cross the Irish Sea border – which was created by the Northern Ireland Protocol – with the EU not having all the information required on what was crossing into Northern Ireland.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has welcomed the progress made between the UK and EU, calling it a “breakthrough”.
“It’s very positive progress after over a year with no progress at all,” Varadkar said.
“I think it does open the door to further agreement on how we can make the protocol more workable and more acceptable.”
Varadkar added that he would be travelling to Northern Ireland this Thursday to engage with parties and that he expected to speak with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
The agreement has also been welcomed by Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin, who told reporters in Brussels that it was a “very significant building block to to a potential agreement”.

“I think confidence and trust is essential to any relationship and I think the agreement yesterday does signify, sort of, a growing, trusted relationship with European Union negotiators and the United Kingdom negotiators, which I think is welcome.”
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also said that the agreement was an “important step forward” but that there were “still significant issues at the heart of the protocol”.
Martin also spoke with parties in Northern Ireland yesterday and said that he had “good engagement” with them ahead of his meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris later this week.
Today, the Tánaiste is due to meet with Sefcovic in Brussels for discussions on the Protocol, particularly around yesterday’s agreement.
Both Cleverly and Sefcovic have also said that they will be “taking stock” of the technical talks between UK and EU negotiators in a meeting on 16 January.
There are hopes that a final negotiating ‘tunnel’ can be reached when the technical discussions are complete.
The key date ahead is 10 April, the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, with hopes that a deal can be reached to allow for the restoration of both the Assembly and the Executive.
However, whether or not a deal will be able to unlock power-sharing due to the DUP’s veto is still unknown.

Sinn Féin Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill described a “good call” with Martin.
She tweeted: “We share a common commitment on way forward to get negotiated outcome on Protocol and immediate restoration of power-sharing.
“My priority is to work with all parties & both Governments to achieve this in days and weeks ahead.”
Meanwhile DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson welcomed what he termed recognition in London, Dublin and Brussels that the protocol is a problem for unionists.
“It was a mistake for the protocol’s authors to press ahead with an agreement that has harmed Northern Ireland’s constitutional and economic place within the United Kingdom,” he said.
“More and more voices now recognise the unanimous view amongst unionist MLAs.
“We have an opportunity to get an outcome from these negotiations which replaces the protocol by arrangements that restore NI’s place in the UK internal market and our constitutional position is respected.
“I am committed to the restoration of Stormont, but such a restoration can only be durable if it is built on solid foundations which are supported by unionists and nationalists.”
He described his telephone conversation with Martin earlier as “a useful conversation as the Republic of Ireland is an EU member state and fits as part of a wider programme of engagement with influential voices in London and Brussels”.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he discussed with Martin “the urgent need to restore the powersharing institutions at Stormont”.
“I had a productive call with the Tánaiste this morning,” he said.
“Our shared priority remains the restoration of the devolved institutions at Stormont. With crises facing the delivery of public services and household finances in every community, it is vital that the Assembly and executive are back up and running as soon as possible.”","5.54pm, 9 Jan 2023",

France’s Europe minister Clement Beaune warned the UK against celebrating “quick wins” over neighbours, with the need to work together on security matters and foreign policy.
He said tonight that France wants a “constructive solution” over the number of licences granted to trawlers to fish in British waters, which he described as still being “not at all” satisfactory.
But he said Paris would consider taking action if the dispute is not solved, with threats including tighter checks and a ban on British trawlers landing catches in French ports.

“We still have all options on the table, including these measures, we will prefer to have it on the EU level but if nothing happens at the EU level we will take French measures. But I don’t want to go into that,” he told an event hosted by the Politico website.
“It would be a mistake to think you can have quick wins, or short-term wins, with your neighbours.
“If we want to work together … on defence, and security, and foreign policy, and crises like the one we see in Belarus, or maybe in Ukraine, in the Balkans, which is a big concern for the UK as well, you need trust and to be true to your words. If we have doubts, it’ll never work.
“So I say to the UK again, this is (in) your best interest to settle this.”
Talks are ongoing between Britain, France and the European Union to settle the main source of contention, which is the number of licences granted to smaller French vessels to fish in waters around the British coastline.
Beaune made clear that France remains unhappy about the situation, saying: “We’re not there yet, that’s clear. So it’s not a satisfactory issue, not at all.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-article-16-5591354-Nov2021/,"A DECISION TO trigger Article 16 would have “far reaching implications” for the UK government’s relationships with Ireland and the EU, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.
An Taoiseach said the trade agreement between the UK and the EU was conditional on the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit deal being implemented.
The British Government has threatened to trigger Article 16, a move that would effectively unilaterally suspend the treaty, and is calling for the removal of the oversight role European Court of Justice in its operation.
The Taoiseach said that such a move would be “irresponsible, unwise and reckless” and would shake the foundations of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland.
Martin said he had spoken with US President Joe Biden at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this week, who told him “how the Good Friday Agreement matters very deeply to his administration” and that this position had been made “unequivocally clear” to the British Government.
Speaking in the Dáil today, Martin said: “In my view, it would be irresponsible, it would be unwise, and it would be reckless to invoke Article 16 as a response to the proposals from the European Commission.
Advertisement
“I think it also would have implications for the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the Irish Government, because such an action would not be in accordance with the spirit of partnership that has informed the peace process from the get-go.
“And that has informed the creation of the entire architecture that underpins the Good Friday Agreement. That is my very strong view.”
Martin suggested a move to invoke Article 16 could have implications for the post-Brexit trade deal struck between the UK and the EU.
“The British Government signed up to the protocol as condition of the trade cooperation agreement” he said.
“The trade cooperation agreement would not have been signed off by the European Union without the protocol having been signed off in advance.
“So the British Government knowingly signed up to that.”
He said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Charles Michel had been “very clear in terms of the implications that would arise if such a decision was to be taken”.
He also revealed that US President Joe Biden had used the COP26 conference to underline his support for the Irish peace process.

The Taoiseach said: “At the COP26 President Biden did ask for a brief conversation with me after one of the sessions, he called me over.
Martin hit out at the UK’s demands on the ECJ in response to efforts by the European Commission to ease the implementation of the Protocol.
He said proposals brought forward by the Commission’s vice president Maros Sefcovic “went beyond what many people thought the European Union would present”.
“In respect of SPS, for example, you’re looking at an 80% reduction in checks, in respect of customs a massive reduction in checks, and in respect of medicines, a full solution to that and then said he’s open for discussions with people,” he added.
He continued: “To oppose the ECJ as a response to the Sefcovic proposals is very disingenuous, and simply wrong.
“Because anybody who knows about this knows that in respect of any issues that arise from the operation of the single market the ECJ has to be the governing body, that’s accepted.
“It’s in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland that they have access to the single market.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-leader-jeffrey-donaldson-early-stormont-election-protocol-5585214-Oct2021/,"DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has said that his party could call an early Stormont election will if the British government does not act over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He was speaking after pressing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the Brexit arrangements in the House of Commons.
He put to Johnson during Prime Minister’s Questions that the conditions for invoking a get-out clause of the protocol have “already been met” and the government should consider using it if “rapid progress” isn’t made in talks with the EU.
“Does the Prime Minister accept that the conditions now exist to trigger Article 16 of the protocol in the event that the current negotiations with the EU fail to arrive at an acceptable outcome?” he asked.
Johnson responded saying: “He is completely right, I am sad to say, in what he says”.
Advertisement
He went on to say his government was “working hard to secure an agreement by negotiation” but that they “need some real progress”.
“If we can’t see progress – as we have been saying now for some months – if we can’t see rapid progress in the way that we spelled out in our command paper then I think it is clear to everybody that the conditions for invoking Article 16 have already been met,” he said.
Article 16 allows the EU or the UK to take “unilateral” action in Northern Ireland, in the event of ‘serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade’.
Speaking afterwards, Donaldson welcomed the statement by Johnson but said if government does not act, he would have no option but to call an early Stormont Assembly election.
He said the protocol is costing Northern Ireland “£850m per year”, as well as “polluting politics, undermining the union and is diverting trade within the United Kingdom”.
He said in the last month he had warned both London and Brussels that the Stormont Assembly “could not be sustained if the government continued to stand by the protocol and unionist ministers are forced to implement measures harmful to our place in the UK”.
“I am glad that the government has stepped up and our pressure has brought Brussels back to the table. That is progress from the days of ‘no, nay, never’ to changes. But endless negotiations without product will not suffice.
“It is welcome that the Prime Minister wants to see rapid progress and recognises that the conditions to trigger Article 16 have already been met.
“If Brussels is not prepared the make the kind of changes envisaged in the July Command Paper, then it is time for the government to act unilaterally and protect this part of the United Kingdom in line duty it’s NDNA (New Decade New Approach deal) commitment.
“If the government fails to act, then I will have no option but ask the people of Northern Ireland to make their voice heard at the ballot box.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/medical-internship-anomaly-brexit-5829028-Jul2022/,"A BREXIT ‘ANOMALY’ that prevented people studying medicine in Northern Ireland and Britain accessing medical intern posts in Ireland is set to be resolved through new legislation from Health Minister Stephen Donnelly.
The issue as it stands prevents students from Ireland, who are studying in UK universities, from applying for medical internships within the Irish health service
This also applies to students who are studying medicine in Northern Ireland and has left them unable to apply for internships in organisations like the HSE.
Students need to be either be a graduate or in their final year at medical school in one of the following countries to be able to apply for an internship in Ireland.
Prior to Brexit, both Northern Ireland and Britain were locations where students could study and still receive internships in Ireland.
The main aim of taking an internship in Ireland is to receive a ‘Certificate of Experience’, which allows holders to work within the Irish health service.
Due to the anomaly, people studying medicine in Northern Ireland and Britain cannot attain a ‘Certificate of Experience’.
Advertisement
The issue was first reported byThe Journalin February, with one medical student from Dublin who was studying in Northern Ireland saying it would impact students who were graduating from Queen’s University.
“I applied to study in Northern Ireland on the basis that I would have no issues in Ireland. They need to get that changed fast,” she said.
Under Donnelly’s plan, which was approved during the last Cabinet meeting of the summer this week, the bill will override the current issue and allow students with UK medical degrees to apply for Irish intern positions.
According to the Government, the Publication of Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will restore the tradition of doctors moving between Ireland and the UK to train.
Donnelly has also waived pre-legislative scrutiny of the bill, to speed up its passing through both the Dáil and Seanad.
In a statement, the Department of Health said that the bill would progress through the Dáil following the summer break.
“When enacted, the legislation will once again allow holders of a UK medical degree to apply for internships in Ireland,” said a spokesperson for the Department.
The issue itself was caused after the UK left the EU, giving it ‘third country’ status and it no longer fulfilling the requirement for medical students to study within the European Union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/housing-crisis-ireland-5-6071020-May2023/,"BREXIT AND COVID have dominated headlines – and politicians’ preoccupations – at different times over the past decade.
Health is a perennial concern. Referenda on same-sex marriage and abortion passed overwhelmingly. But, it doesn’t seem controversial to say that housing is the defining political issue of our times. This perma-crisis is unlikely to improve before the next general election.
There were 90,000 homesbuilt in Ireland in 2006, but that past feels like a foreign country. The global financial crisis and the homegrown property crash decimated our construction sector and much else, so very few houses at all were built in the decade that followed. By 2016, the economy was back on its feet but it already felt like a housing crisis was brewing. After the general election that year, the Fine Gael-led government made housing a priority and unveiled theRebuilding Irelandplan targeting 25,000 new homes annually by 2020.
Targets were missed, rents soared, homelessness kept increasing, Fine Gael lost votes and seats in the 2020 election. Perhaps bravely, Fianna Fáil insisted on the housing Ministry in subsequent government negotiations. They hoped to end the housing crisis and reap the political benefits. As we were coming out of the Covid pandemic, we got a new housing strategy.Housing for Allwas published in September 2022, targeting average annual housing construction of 33,000 until 2030.
New strategy, same result: targets continue to be missed, rents continue to soar, homelessness keeps hitting new records. That’s not to say there has been no progress at all. More homes are being built. Money is being set aside that could see record social housing construction if it was all spent. Cost rental schemes are proving wildly successful, and new subsidies are being introduced that could see these being scaled up to become a real alternative for more families.
Even if the Housing for All building targets were met, they would not be sufficient to meet the needs of our growing population to 2030 and beyond, yet alone to address the housing shortfall that has been allowed to build up over the past 15 years.

Politicians operation with a shorter time horizon. We are now less than two years out from the next general election, and a year out from the staging post that will be the 2024 local and European elections.
Homelessness hit a new record high just short of 12,000 in March. The numbers in emergency accommodation were at all-time highs even before the end of the no-fault eviction ban on 31 March. With private rental supply near record lows and rents continuing to hit record highs, it’s hard to see how homelessness won’t continue surging in the months and years ahead.
The cost of renting a home continues to drive consumer price inflation. Private rents increased by 8.8% in the 12 months to April. Thankfully, this marks a slowdown from a peak of just under 13% in the middle of 2022. But, private rents are still increasing faster than both wages and headline inflation, to which rents are an important contributor.Daft.ie reportedonly 959 rental properties availableon 1 May. Even if this is up marginally from the851 available a year earlier, it is still one of the lowest rental stocks recorded since 2005. Nationally, Ronan Lyons, author of theDaft.ie rental price report for Q1 2023, notes that the total stock of rental properties, whether available or occupied, is actually falling. Looking forward, it’s possible that rental price inflation will continue to moderate, but this is more likely to be due to a weakening economy than increasing rental supply.
Writing last October, it looked inevitable that house price growth would slow, and could turn negative. When data for that month was published, it turned out to be the first month that prices in Dublin fell, and they have fallen every month since. In January of this year, prices in the rest of Ireland followed suit.New data publishedrecently confirmed these trends. With the economy slowing, real wages falling and interest rates increasing, it’s hard to see these trends reversing during 2023.
The good news is that falling prices means improved affordability for first-time-buyers. But, if higher interest rates mean banks are willing to lend less, increased affordability is only theoretical. The bad news is that the majority of households own their own homes, these homes constitute the bulk of household wealth, and falling house prices mean homeowners feel poorer. Falling prices also reduce the incentive for private property developers to start building. We shouldn’t take it for granted that theup-tick in residential unit commencements in the first three months of the yearwill continue. Because of the tail-off in commencements through 2022, it is quite possible that Housing for All construction targets, inadequate as they may be, will be missed in 2023 and 2024.
All in all, if the next general election is to be a ‘housing election’, it’s really hard to see how the situation will have improved between now and then.
If 90,000 new homes were built in 2006, then surely it must be possible to consistently build at least half that number every year. Even that would mean a 50% increase in construction from where we are now. We have seen plenty of demand side policy interventions – whether budgeting for social housing or subsidising private purchases by first-time buyers – but not enough has been done on the supply side to make sure the construction sector has sufficient capacity.
As was the case in the early years of the century, with the economy at what economists call full employment, we urgently need tens of thousands of immigrant construction workers. This pool of workers will also need to be counted on if we are to meet the national target ofretrofitting half a million homes by 2030. Just as Irish immigrants are often credited with building England and America in the 19th and 20th centuries, Ireland now needs an influx of construction workers. Specifically,as the ESRI has suggested, we should expand the occupations eligible for the critical skills employment permit.

With interest rates on the increase, lack of financing is becoming increasingly acute. Understandably, the Irish banks have become risk averse when it comes to property lending. For them, the pre-2008 period really is a foreign country.
The availability of public resources is not the issue. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) already has about €15bn under management, of whichmore than €900mhas been committed to residential construction.
Annual budget surpluses are expected to amount to a further €65bn over the next three years, a good chunk of which is to be squirrelled away into a sovereign wealth fund. The ISIF shows that we can target a double bottom line: support housing investment and save for the future. What we need is a vast scaling up of ambition.

THOSE OF US who witnessed events at Stormont in the early weeks of 2020, learned all we needed to know about Boris Johnson – the clown Prime Minister who reduced government to a circus.
Then NI Secretary Julian Smith had spent patient months with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney piecing together a deal that would put a Northern Executive back in place.
We had been waiting for three years on such a British-Irish initiative – for the type of leadership that would make it possible.
Smith and Coveney presented it in a moment of crafted political theatre. On 9 January 2020 in the dark and freezing cold on Stormont’s hill overlooking Belfast, they published New Decade, New Approach and dared the Northern Ireland parties to reject it.
His shallowness, his lack of detail, were obvious in the words he stumbled over.
Within weeks, he sacked Smith, the most-popular NI Secretary since Mo Mowlam.
Antipathy
At that moment, we could see how little Johnson cared about this place.
Smith was not a nodding dog. He had fought the Prime Minister on proroguing parliament and hadn’t played along with the no-deal and security cooperation threats on Brexit.
He knows detail. We heard it when he spoke in Parliament recently on his concerns relating to the UK Government’s legacy plan.
A new Prime Minister should consider asking Smith to return here, to fix the latest mess – much of it the product of Johnson’s wrecking ball approach.
For many, Johnson is a figure of fun here; someone characterised by farce.
The former BBC Political Editor in Belfast Stephen Grimason, the journalist who broke the detail of the Good Friday Agreement at Easter 1998, tweeted on a possible going-away present for Johnson:

Suggestions for Boris Johnson's going away present. Let me kick off with a wallpaper steamer. Down with that sort of thing - careful now!
In Johnson’s world, there is nothing more important than him. His clinging on in the chaos of now a confirmation of that.
Those who ran with him down the blind-alley of Brexit should reflect on that.
In low-key, sporadic, violence, we watched as it played out on the streets last year.
Brexit was Johnson’s England project. Northern Ireland an afterthought.
‘Wrecking-ball politics’
In the here-and-now, Stormont has collapsed again. Not as dramatically as last time. There are still caretaker ministers, but no Assembly, no Speaker and no Executive.
We are back in the mess that Smith and Coveney had tidied up.
The UK Government under Johnson is rewriting the Brexit script and the story of the Protocol as if they had nothing to do with it.
As a consequence, relationships everywhere are strained and broken – UK-Europe, Britain-Ireland, North-South and at Stormont.
If Unity is achieved, they might build a statue to Johnson and Brexit, and to how they have hurried things along.

Track the developments since that referendum – unionists losing their overall majority at Stormont, their second seat in the European Parliament, no longer holding a majority of the Northern Ireland seats at Westminster and Michelle O’Neill now the First Minister designate.
New voters?
In the politics of Northern Ireland, Orange and Green are no longer all of the story. There is a significant third-force – called other. It will have a major say in the future direction of this place.

Johnson has fooled people, here and elsewhere, many of them, more times than once.
Their’s is an initiative designed to close down the past, rather than open it up to questions and answers.
In relation to Northern Ireland, retired Political Editor Ken Reid, who spent many years watching Johnson, used just two words to sum him up – “ignorance” and “lies”.
We all remember the denial of the sea border and then the fallout from that lie as it turned the centenary year in Northern Ireland into a crisis.
No government should allow a re-run of the Stormont pantomime that stretched from 2017 to 2020.
A Conservative government was part of that mess and part of what is happening now.
They should speak to Julian Smith about the importance of relationships. Good working relationships.
Nothing works here unless the two governments are working together.
Boris has broken a lot of what had been patiently built.
Who can fix it? How long will it take?

https://www.thejournal.ie/truck-driver-skills-shortage-5562833-Oct2021/,"A CHRONIC SHORTAGE of Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) operators in the United Kingdom could have knock-on effects for Ireland where the supply of truck drivers is already tight, industry experts have warned.
Although not nearly as acute as the situation in the UK — where drivers, many of them Eastern European, have returned to their home countries as a result of Brexit — some related issues are rearing their heads on this side of the Irish Sea.
A long-flagged skills shortage coupled with the impact of the pandemic has put pressure on freight companies in the run-up to Christmas.
As the UK braces for a difficult festive season, Irish supply chain experts say our own shortage of drivers is not likely to lead to empty shelves.
But there are concerns that the British government’s efforts to lure drivers from other EU countries could compound longer-term issues in Ireland around pay and conditions. This could prove problematic for an industry that is already facing major challenges.
“In terms of the problems we see with supply chains at the moment, [the driver shortage in Ireland] is not even near the top,” Alan Holland, Chief Executive of Cork-based supply chain software company Keelvar, toldThe Journal.
The ongoingglobal ocean freight crisis remains the biggest issuefacing supply chains this Christmas, Holland said.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government campaigned for an end to free movement across Europe during Brexit, promising to “take back control” of what it saw as unchecked immigration.

But last weekend it reversed entry rules to offer foreign truckers a three-month visa waiver, hoping to ease the driver shortage that has hit supply chains more generally.
Holland doesn’t believe the Conservative government’s proposition will be a particularly “attractive prospect” for drivers.
He said, “They’re being asked to sacrifice whatever they’re working at now to come to the UK for three or four months to save Christmas, and then it’s, ‘Pack your bags. Off you go.’ It sends all the wrong signals.”
However, he said there is a “danger of spillover” from the UK driver crisis if British trucking companies start “trying to poach drivers more aggressively”.
“The unfortunate thing is it’s an EU-wide issue, so we’re fighting for the same people,” Aidan Flynn, General Manager of the Freight Transport Association, toldThe Journalthis week.
“We are hugely reliant on Polish drivers here.”
Flynn said Ireland had a window of opportunity to attract European drivers from Britain in the wake of Brexit. However, he said when the time would have been right to roll out an ‘outreach’ advertisement, the Irish Government was busy grappling with the pandemic.
Wexford independent TD Verona Murphy, a former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said Brexit has also made Ireland a less attractive place to work for truckers.
She toldThe Journalthat many Eastern European drivers used to drive UK landbridge routes from Ireland to mainland Europe. But since Brexit, those routes have become more difficult, the result of extra regulatory and customs checks, resulting in long delays.
“So many drivers have gone back to Poland, and to the [former] Eastern bloc countries, and they avoided the hassle that way,” Murphy said.
Related ReadsNeale Richmond: Boris' Brexit is the real cause of the haulage and energy crisis in Britain
Relatively low pay is another factor.
Because Ireland is “an island off an island” off the edge of Europe, it needs “a competitive edge” to offer drivers to work here, Murphy said.
“Many drivers are contacting me and they feel very hard done by… Very little is offered to drivers, and they can easily get other jobs that pay better and are not as antisocial,” she added.
These are long-standing issues that the Government has attempted to address in recent times.
The Department of Transport established the National Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group in 2019 to “support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors”.
In a statement this week, the department toldThe Journal, “The Minister of State for Transport, Hildegarde Naughton TD, has asked the Group to examine the specific issue of driver shortage in the industry and make recommendations on actions that can be taken by Government to ameliorate the supply of qualified drivers.
“The Group is expected to present its recommendations to the Minister shortly and these will be considered and implemented as soon as possible.”

THE UK GOVERNMENT will delay a number of post-Brexit border controls due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a minister has confirmed.
A written ministerial statement by Brexit minister David Frost said the timetable for bringing in the “same controls on incoming goods from the European Union as on goods from the rest of the world” would be delayed beyond the plans set out in March.
The border checks were initially due to be brought in on 1 January to reflect that Britain is no longer in the single market after its divorce from Brussels and the end of the transition period.
But the changes, which mainly relate to controls on agricultural and food products, have been pushed back and will not be implemented for at least another three to nine months, the UK government confirmed on today.

Frost said: “The pandemic has had longer-lasting impacts on businesses, both in the UK and in the European Union, than many observers expected in March.
“There are also pressures on global supply chains, caused by a wide range of factors including the pandemic and the increased costs of global freight transport. These pressures are being especially felt in the agri-food sector.
Frost added: “The timetable for the removal of the current easements in relation to full customs controls and the introduction of customs checks remains unchanged from the planned January 1.”
The move comes only a week after the UK extended the truce in the so-called “sausage war” with Brussels by rolling over grace periods associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol to allow goods, including chilled meats, to continue to cross the Irish Sea without checks after September.
Frost said the delays on post-Brexit checks applied mainly to “sanitary and phytosanitary goods” coming from the EU, with new requirements for export health certificates pushed back by as much as nine months – from October 1 to July 1 2022.
The announcement comes after ambassadors to the UK from both France and Germany criticised Frost’s threat to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol amid cross-Channel negotiations over reforming the Brexit terms that have caused issues for trade across the Irish Sea.

Yesterday, Frost told the House of Lords that there was “ample justification” for triggering Article 16, a statement French representative Catherine Colonna called “troubling”, while German diplomat Andreas Michaelis accused the UK of becoming “less flexible” in talks to resolve the problems caused by the protocol.
Following the decision to delay bringing in extra checks, the Food and Drink Federation reacted angrily, arguing it “penalised” those who had prepared for the checks, some of which were due to come in to force next month.
Chief executive of the federation Ian Wright said: “Many food and drink manufacturers will be dismayed by the lateness of this substantial change.
“Businesses have invested very significant time and money in preparing for the new import regime on October 1. Now, with just 17 days to go, the rug has been pulled.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/france-eu-litigation-proceedings-fishing-row-uk-5625718-Dec2021/,"FRANCE IS PLANNING to ask the EU to begin “litigation proceedings” if an ongoing row over post-Brexit fishing licences is not resolved.
The European Commission has said the dispute must be settled by 10 December – but Downing Street said today it did not recognise the deadline, threatening to further inflame tensions between the nations.
The row surrounds licences to fish in UK and Channel Islands waters under the terms of Britain’s post-Brexit trade deal with the EU – the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA).
The main source of contention is the number of licences to fish in waters around the British coastline for smaller French vessels that can prove they operated there before Brexit.
France says Britain has not handed out enough licences to its fishermen while the UK Government has insisted the overwhelming majority of applications have been granted.
France’s seas minister Annick Girardin said today that if the deadlock remained by Friday evening, France would request a meeting of the partnership council, which oversees the implementation of the Brexit agreement, to “note the UK’s failure to respect its signature”.
“If that is not satisfactory, we ask that litigation proceedings be opened by the European Commission,” Girardin told a senatorial committee.
She said the proceedings could take “many months” but that “France will never give up its rights”.
“No-one should stay on the dock,” she said.
Girardin said the UK had issued 1,004 licences but that 94 licences were still pending.
The UK Government has previously said it has licensed “nearly 1,700 EU vessels to fish in our waters”.
France’s minister for Europe Clement Beaune said on 1 December that the dispute was not a Franco-British issue, but a problem between the whole of the EU and the UK.
He called on the EU to take retaliatory measures against Britain if the 10 December deadline was missed.
No 10 said today the UK had “never set a deadline” itself and the EU cut-off point was “not one we’re working to”.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I’m not aware of certainly any communication we’ve had from the French government, certainly not to the Prime Minister. There’s a technical process still ongoing based on evidence rather than set deadlines.
“We’ve never set a deadline. I recognise they themselves have set one but it’s not one we’re working to.”
Environment Secretary George Eustice was expected to hold further talks with EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius on Friday.
In his comments, Johnson’s spokesman added: “George Eustice spoke to commissioner Sinkevicius last night about the progress on a range of licensing issues and they agreed to speak again later this week to take stock.
“All the talks on this issue have been constructive.”
On 1 December, Beaune said French punitive measures – such as a ban on British trawlers landing their catches in French ports and tighter customs checks to hamper cross-Channel trade – remained “on the table” if a deal could not be reached.
He told French radio network RTL: “It was the European Commission that told the British – so all of Europe together – that if you don’t make big gestures with a lot of licences on 10 December, we are no longer in a European dialogue.”
On the potential ban by the French, Beaune said: “It’s one of the possible options but it’s better, to be honest, to have European measures.
“All options are on the table, because it’s better to have a dialogue, but … if it doesn’t bear fruit we can take European measures.”
It is not the first time the UK has faced potential punitive measures over the dispute – but previously France threatened to act alone, rather than alongside other EU states.
It had warned that Paris could block British boats from landing their catches in French ports and tighten customs checks from midnight on 2 November.
But French President Emmanuel Macron backed down at the 11th hour, saying negotiations must continue.
French fishermen have since blockaded the Channel Tunnel and major ports in a protest over the row.
The dispute sits against a backdrop of tensions between Britain and France, recently inflamed by the deaths of 27 people attempting to cross the Channel in November.
Amid the bitter feud, it was reported Macron had labelled Boris Johnson a “clown” and a “knucklehead”.

UNIONIST SUPPORT FOR peace process agreements in Northern Ireland is “falling away” due to the Brexit protocol, Jeffrey Donaldson has warned.
The DUP leader offered the assessment after the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) said it could no longer support the 1998 Good Friday agreement because in its opinion the Irish Sea border had undermined its central plank – the principle of consent.
Donaldson also condemned recent outbreaks of violence in certain loyalist communities, including the hijacking and burning of two buses – incidents that have been linked to protests against the protocol.
The PUP, which is politically aligned to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, said there was no basis for unionists to retain support for the peace deal that established the power-sharing institutions at Stormont.
Reacting to the move, Donaldson said: “The PUP are very clear – they’re not wanting people to go back to violence and they have condemned violence on our streets.
“But it is a matter of concern that support for the agreements and political institutions is falling away, and not least within unionism itself.
“I’ve been warning about this now and warning that this is one of the consequences of the protocol, because the protocol upsets the very delicate constitutional balance that is at the heart of the agreement, it undermines our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom in a way that is unacceptable to unionists.
“Let’s not lose sight of the fact there isn’t a single unionist elected representative that supports this protocol.

“So, in a way, I understand where the PUP are coming from. But I want to get to a place where we put this right, where we get the political stability that we need.”
Donaldson also accused Dublin and Brussels of engaging in “megaphone diplomacy” over the potential of a trade war with the UK.
He said comments from the Irish Government and the EU around the prospect of retaliatory action if the UK suspends the protocol – potentially in the form of terminating the Trade and Cooperation Agreement – were causing “harm and damage”, and ratcheting up tensions.
He branded “disgraceful” a comment attributed to an unnamed EU diplomat quoted in the Daily Telegraph who said the EU was “ready for peace but prepared for war”.
The phrase has particular connotations in Northern Ireland as it was a slogan used by loyalist paramilitaries during the peace process to sum up their attitude to the political agreements. A well-known mural on a loyalist estate in north Belfast still bears the message.
The Ulster Unionist Party has also condemned the unattributed remark and UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt asked Stormont deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill to join that condemnation during Assembly question time today.
“Can I say that anybody who holds public office needs to be very careful in terms of the language which they use,” the Sinn Fein vice president replied.
“I note the comment that the member’s referring to, it’s not attributed to anybody so I don’t know where it’s coming from, but language of that nature isn’t appropriate or in any shape or form.”
O’Neill accused the DUP of feeding a narrative that has inflamed and encouraged recent violence on the streets of Northern Ireland.
She pointed to the party’s boycott of north-south political meetings and its threat to pull down Stormont in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Related ReadsEU warns of 'serious consequences' if UK decides to trigger Article 16Frost accuses EU of ignoring political sensitivities in Northern Ireland
The Sinn Fein vice president made the claims during Assembly question time as she commented on recent violent attacks in the region, the latest of which saw a bus hijacked and burned out on the loyalist Rathcoole estate on Sunday night.
Donaldson expressed doubt the EU would risk the trade deal, given its reliance on UK consumers.
“The EU does a lot of trade with the United Kingdom,” he said.
“Germany, the biggest trading nation in the EU, the United Kingdom is its biggest market in Europe, it’s the second biggest market for Germany in the whole world.
“Does anyone seriously believe that the Germans want to open a trade war with the United Kingdom? That’s not the answer here.
“The answer is to sit around the table and agree a solution. If the EU can’t do that, if the EU prefers instead to choose rhetoric, to choose a trade war over the need to protect the political process in Northern Ireland, then I’m sad about that.
“But it means the UK Government then must take decisive action to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market and respect what the Belfast Agreement says – that Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the United Kingdom, unless the people of Northern Ireland decide otherwise.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/edwin-poots-micheal-martin-meeting-5457180-Jun2021/,"LAST UPDATE|4 Jun 2021
DUP LEADER EDWIN  Poots has said a meeting with Taoiseach Micheal Martin about tensions surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol was “positive, frank and useful”.
Poots made his first visit to Government Buildings in Dublin since becoming party leader after warning that relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic had “never been as bad”.
But following the meeting with the Taoiseach, Poots struck a more conciliatory tone and said that he would lead a team to the next north-south ministerial meeting on 18 June.
“North-south relations have never been as bad, I don’t blame the current Taoiseach for that, I blame the last Taoiseach,” Poots told reporters last night.
He added however that he would “lead the DUP team” at the next north-south ministerial meeting.
In a statement issued after the meeting, the Taoiseach said the two party leaders had “an open exchange of views across a number of issues”.
These include political developments, Covid-19, North-South cooperation and the NI Protocol.
“The Taoiseach highlighted the critical importance of the stability and good functioning of the NI Executive and all the Institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,  in these challenging times,” the statement said.
“Recognising and understanding the genuine concerns in unionist and loyalist communities around the Protocol, the Taoiseach said the focus needs to be on getting issues resolved and on reducing friction where we can.”

The statement said Poots and Martin discussed the importance of “practical North-South cooperation continuing” and they agreed to remain in touch in the coming period.
Last month, Poots described his relationship with the Dublin Government as “really, really bad”.

He said he has respect for Micheál Martin but was critical of his predecessor and Coveney.
Ahead of the meeting, Poots said he hoped to “fix” the relationship which he claims was “damaged by the last Irish government” headed up by now Tánaiste, then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.
He accused Varadkar and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney of using historic issues to “taxi drive forward” the agenda that ultimately resulted in the Northern Ireland protocol.
“Northern Ireland cannot be a plaything of the European Union or indeed the southern government. Northern Ireland people are more important than that,” he added.
A spokesperson for the Tánaiste said that “North-South relations are about more than relations with any one political party”.
“Relations are strained because of Brexit and its knock-on effects which continue to play out. Minister Coveney and the Tanaiste were against Brexit as were the majority of people, parties and politicians in Northern Ireland. We are doing our best to minimise the damage to Ireland, North and South. We will not be distracted from that work.”
Poots said there is “a lot of anger over the protocol”. He claimed that the actions of Varadkar and Coveney “hurt people in Northern Ireland”.
Varadkar and Coveney are responsible for interruptions to food and medicine in Northern Ireland, he claimed, irrespective of whether that was the intention.
“They have to reflect on that and rectify that,” he said.
Ahead of the meeting, Poots was asked if he expected a cordial meeting with the Taoiseach. He said he had “come to actually do business with people”.
He added he wanted “good” relations across the border, and wanted to work with people who want to achieve that also.
Earlier today, he saidhe had not refusedto attend any North-South meetings.
Sinn Fein and the SDLP are seeking legal advice over the non-attendance of DUP ministers at recent North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings.

It hit the headlines again last week after the EU proposed invoking it during a row over Covid-19 vaccines. The proposal was withdrawn hours after being made public, after much criticism from Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain, but the uproar lingered.
So, what is Article 16, what does it mean and why has it been causing so much hassle? That’s what we explore in this weeks podcast.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-2-5644405-Jan2022/,"THE DUP HAVE said there will be “major implications” at Stormont if the Foreign Secretary fails to swiftly set a formal deadline to end negotiations with Brussels over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Days after the EU’s chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic claimed “London has breached a great deal of trust” with Europe over the protocol, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said Liz Truss needed to provide a “clear date” for ending the talks.
“We need a clear date now, we need a clear timeline in which there is an expectation of real progress or the Government takes the action that is necessary,” Donaldson told The Sunday Telegraph.
“It is crucial that Liz Truss moves this process forward quickly and that we get real and meaningful progress on a range of issues, not least of which is removing the checks on the movement of goods within the United Kingdom internal market.”
Donaldson would not specify a reasonable deadline for Truss to make progress when asked by the Telegraph, but said: “January is going to be an absolutely crucial month.”

“If we don’t get rapid and decisive progress, and one side or the other is kicking the can down the road, this will have major implications for the stability of the political institutions in Northern Ireland,” Donaldson added.
European Commission vice president Sefcovic on Thursday told German news website Der Spiegel that problems with the protocol – a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit – meant the UK “broke international law” in trying to get round the arrangement.
Sefcovic told Der Spiegel he is “pragmatic” about Truss taking on responsibility for post-Brexit negotiations with the EU, after Brexit minister Lord Frost resigned last month.

But he warned if Truss was to trigger Article 16, a move that would effectively unilaterally suspend the treaty agreed between the UK and the EU, it would throw into jeopardy “the foundation of the entire deal” reached between the two sides.

UK BREXIT MINISTER David Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis have issued a joint statement stating that the Northern Ireland protocol, agreed between the EU and UK after four years of negotiation, be renegotiated.
Brexit minister Frost told the House of Lords that the proposals will require a “significant change” of the Protocol, which is the set of post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland.
“We cannot go on as we are,” he said today.
The Irish Government and the EU have come out to say that the Protocol will not be renegotiated, and said the joint committee negotiations needed to continue, which are part of the Brexit trade deal.
European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said: “We are ready to continue to seek creative solutions, within the framework of the Protocol, in the interest of all communities in Northern Ireland. However, we will not agree to a renegotiation of the Protocol.”
Ireland’s European Affairs Minister of State Thomas Byrnetold Sky Newsthat the EU would be “flexible, creative and constructive”, and said there’s “enough leeway” within the treaties and protocol to “move forward” post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
What did the UK government say
In a statement to the House of Commons, Lewis said that there has been significant disruption as companies change supply change, as well as “societal disruption” at Easter.
“There has been significant disruption to East-West trade, a significant increase in trade on the island of Ireland as companies change supply chains and considerable disruption to everyday lives.”
He said that this warranted the UK Government’s use of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol – a nuclear option in the EU trade deal that cuts all arrangements. But said that although this was considered, it wouldn’t be used yet.
He suggested a “standstill period” on ongoing legal actions and processes, and continuing the operation of grace periods.
Lewis namechecked difficulties going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland with medicines, pets, on the movements of live animals, plants, and seeds. The EU announced in June that it is working on changing its laws to continue the trade of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland once that grace period ends.
The Northern Ireland Executive has estimated that from January to March this year,the volume of checks represented approximately 20% of the EU total, and morethan any single EU Member State – despite Northern Ireland’s population of 1.8million people being 0.5% of that of the EU as a whole.
Stephen Farry, Alliance Party MP, said that this proposal created more instability and uncertainty for Northern Ireland. Members of the DUP accused those criticising the announcement of representing the EU above their constituents; while SDLP MP Claire Hanna said that renegotiating the protocol would hamper businesses from prospering.

An ‘honesty box’ trading arrangement
The Financial Timesreported today thatFrost’s strategy seeks to eliminate most checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.
In a bid to deliver on that aim, the FT said Frost will push for an “honesty box” approach to allow companies in Great Britain that declare their goods are only destined for sale and use in Northern Ireland to skip border checks.
PA ImagesPA Images
The document published by the UK Government, entitled‘Northern Ireland protocol – next steps’, suggests creating “a full dual regulatory regime in Northern Ireland”.
“Of course, goods destined or produced for the EU Single Market would need to meet EU rules in full.”
The document also recognises “the significant efforts [by the EU] that have been put into considering responses to some specific issues, such as livestock movements, the movement of assistance dogs, and aspects of the issues we have faced on medicines”.
An announcement on these issues was made last month as part of the EU-UK Joint Committee on the Brexit trading agreements and their implementation.
The document also calls for the removal of the European Court of Justice and other EU institutions to enforce the provisions of the Protocol. Frost’s document calls this “most unusual”, and says that the same arrangements in the trade agreement should be in place for the protocol.
“The UK refused to accept this in the negotiations on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and only agreed to it in the Protocol because of the very specific circumstances of that negotiation.”
The document also states: “This is why the current situation is not sustainable. The way the Protocol is working needs to change. That requires us to address the significant issues that the Protocol has caused, and to do so in a fundamental way.”
Fine Gael TD and spokesperson on European Affairs Neale Richmondsaidthat Brexit was causing the problems in Northern Ireland, and not the protocol.
“This change of direction outlined by the British Government is both simplistic and disappointing,” he said.
“While the full paper will need to be examined more closely, we must remember that the Protocol was jointly negotiated by this British Government and the EU.
Background
The Protocol was negotiated as part of Britain’s divorce from Brussels to avoid a hard border with Ireland, by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.

But the introduction of checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea has angered Unionists, who have protested against it in recent months, arguing the Brexit arrangement has weakened Northern Ireland’s links with the rest of the UK.
The UK Government has argued that the checks and added red tape have caused trade between Britain and Northern Ireland to decline.
Ireland and the US listening closely
Separately, US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters it would be “watching” events in the UK.
He added: “As we’ve consistently said over time, we do support a close relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and we encourage them to negotiate within the existing mechanisms when differences do arise.
“We’ve consistently said that we welcome the provisions in both the trade and cooperation agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol between the UK and the European Union, which, importantly, help to protect the gains of the Belfast and Good Friday Agreement.”
Frost is due to give a statement to peers on his proposed solutions for the Protocol
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson used a phone call yesterday with his Dublin counterpart Micheál Martin to urge “pragmatism” in order to mend the issues being created by the post-Brexit terms.
The Taoiseach told Johnson that the proposals set to be announced in Westminster would be “carefully considered”, according to the Irish Government.
Martin also stressed that there was already a EU-UK framework for dealing with issues related to the Protocol.
The men had been due to meet in person in the UK, until Johnson was told to self-isolate after coming into close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for coronavirus at the weekend.
Frost – who negotiated the UK’s split from the EU – told MPs on Monday that the UK Government was “keeping all options on the table” to resolve issues with the Protocol, including triggering Article 16, which would allow the unilateral overruling of the agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-proposals-northern-ireland-protocol-5573199-Oct2021/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Oct 2021
THE EU HAS unveiled a series of proposals that would slash the red tape burden on Irish Sea trade created by Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
The European Commission measures would see an 80% reduction in checks envisaged for retail agri-food products arriving in the region from Great Britain.
The requirement to submit documentary information online ahead of shipping the goods will remain, but the EU said it envisages an 80% reduction in both identity checks on lorries arriving at ports and the more intensive physical inspections of their contents.
The proposed changes to the contentious post-Brexit trading arrangements would also remove the prospect of certain British produce, including Cumberland sausages, being banned from export to Northern Ireland.
The plan also includes a 50% reduction in customs paperwork required to move products into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
More products and companies would be exempt from customs tariffs as a result of expanding trusted trader arrangements and a concept that differentiates between goods destined for Northern Ireland and those “at risk” of onward transportation into the Irish Republic.
European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said the EU proposals to change the Protocol are a “direct and genuine” response to concerns raised.
He said: “We have listened to, engaged with and heard Northern Irish stakeholders, from political leaders to businesses and a cross-section of civic society.
“Our proposed solutions are a direct and genuine response to concerns they had raised.”
“In effect, we are proposing an alternative model for implementation of the protocol.
“One the one hand the flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be facilitated for goods that are to stay in Northern Ireland. On the other, robust safeguards and monitoring mechanisms should be put in place to make sure that they stay in Northern Ireland.”
Sefcovic said the EU’s proposals on customs were “ambitious” and would combine with the relaxations on agri-food checks to effectively create an “express lane” to greatly improve the facilitation of Irish Sea trade.
“With this robust package of practical, imaginative solutions we can continue to implement the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland for the benefit of all communities on the ground,” he said.
“It not only cements stability and predictability – an indispensable ingredient for the local economy to flourish – but also paves the way for enhanced opportunities.”
He added: “We continue to stand united behind Northern Ireland while at the same time remaining determined to protect our internal market.
“Now I invite the UK Government to engage with us earnestly and intensively on all our proposals. With them I’m convinced we could be in the home stretch when it comes to the protocol.”

The EU has also offered to legislate to ensure no disruption to the supply line of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

Under the protocol, this supply chain would have been severely disrupted when an ongoing grace period lapses, as Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are in different regulatory zones for pharmaceuticals.
The EU law change would allow GB-based pharma suppliers to maintain their current regulatory arrangements. It would mean companies in GB could continue to act as a hub for the supply of generic medicines to NI, without the need to establish bases in the region.
The EU has said the medicines supply chain issue is not confined to Northern Ireland and applies to other small markets, including the Irish Republic, Malta and Cyprus. The steps being suggested would guarantee pharmaceutical supply chains to all of those markets.
The commission has also pledged to enhance engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including politicians, business representatives and other members of civic society.
This would see the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues related to the implementation of the protocol.
It would also see stakeholders invited to some meetings of the joint UK/EU committees that oversee the protocol. The EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Stormont Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.
It also intends to create a website to show how EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland.
However, the proposals contained in four separate papers published by the bloc on Wednesday evening do not offer any concession on a key UK Government demand, the removal of the oversight role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The EU said the proposals were based on flexibilities inherent within the protocol but also went a bit further.
In return for the scaled-back checking regime, the EU has asked for certain safeguards to be implemented to provide extra assurances that products said to be destined for Northern Ireland do not end up crossing the Irish border.
These include labelling of certain products, making clear they are for sale in the UK only, and enhanced monitoring of supply chain movements and access to real-time trade flow information.
It said access to the real-time data, and the construction of new checking facilities at ports in Northern Ireland, were commitments the UK had already made but was yet to deliver on.
While the range of measures would go some way to reducing everyday friction on trade caused by the protocol, they do not address a UK demand over the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
UK Brexit minister Lord Frost has made clear the removal of the ECJ’s oversight function in policing the protocol is a red line for the Government if a compromise deal is to be struck.
Speaking at a press briefing this evening, Maros Sefcovic said the role of the ECJ was mentioned to him only once during discussions and interactions with representatives in Northern Ireland.
Sefcovic said: “Referring to my visit to Northern Ireland, it left me with very lasting impressions and I really met a lot of stakeholders and I saw big positive excitement about the opportunities dual market access represents.
“Many of the proposals we are putting on the table were indeed inspired by one of the first meetings I had in Northern Ireland with the Business Brexit Working Group. I heard from the representatives of the business communities, I heard from business leaders at Stormont, I heard from representatives of civic society.
“I can tell you that in all the meetings I had, and I had quite a few interactions, exchanges and discussions, the issue of the European Court of Justice was mentioned once.
“When I first heard about this issue it was probably in the Command Paper which was published by the UK Government just before the summer break.”

ECJ issue
Under the terms of the deal struck by the UK and EU in 2019, the ECJ would be the final arbitrator in any future trade dispute between the two parties on the operation of the protocol.
The UK now wants to remove that provision and replace it with an independent arbitration process.
Sefcovic has insisted that the EU will not move on the ECJ issue.
He has pointed out that Northern Ireland would be unable to retain single market access – a key provision of the protocol – if the arrangement was not subject to oversight by European judges.
It is anticipated that a new round of negotiations between Brussels and London will take place in the weeks ahead.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to sidestep the major obstacle in the Brexit divorce talks – the border.
It achieved that by shifting regulatory and customs checks and processes to the Irish Sea.
The arrangements have created new economic barriers on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.
This has caused disruption to many businesses in Northern Ireland and also created a major political headache for Boris Johnson, as unionists are furious at what they perceive as a weakening of the Union.
However, other businesses have benefited from the terms of the protocol, which provides traders in the North unique unfettered access to sell within the UK internal market and EU single market.
Under the original terms of the protocol, the North was to fall within the EU regulatory zone for medicines from 2022 – a move that would have restricted the ability to import products from Great Britain.
UK Reaction
The UK Government has said “intensive talks” should follow the European Commission’s proposals to change the Northern Ireland Protocol.
A British Government spokesperson said: “The EU have now published their proposals in response to those in our Command Paper. We are studying the detail and will of course look at them seriously and constructively.
“The next step should be intensive talks on both our sets of proposals, rapidly conducted, to determine whether there is common ground to find a solution.
“Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland.
“We need to find a solution which all sides can get behind for the future, which safeguards the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, and which puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing. We are ready to work hard with this in mind.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-cargo-dublin-port-5413932-Apr2021/,"THE VOLUME OF goods flowing through Dublin Port declined significantly in the early months of 2021 because of Brexit, according to new figures from the Dublin Port Company.
Overall cargo volumes at the port declined by over 15% in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2020, driven mainly by a decline in trade with Britain.
The volume of cargo travelling between Dublin and UK ports fell by 29% over the period to 160,000 units, the Dublin Port Company said this morning.
Trade with other EU ports, meanwhile, increased by nearly 18% in the first quarter to 158,000, suggesting Irish firms are abandoning the UK landbridge in order to trade directly with the continent. Other Irish firms are opting to transport goods to Britain via Northern Ireland.
Overall, imports fell by 14.4% to 4.7 million gross tonnes through the first quarter while exports via Dublin Port declined by 16.6% to 3.1 million gross tonnes.
Due to lower demand for transport as a result of the pandemic, bulk liquid imports of petroleum products also fell by nearly 25% in the first quarter compared to last year.
Commenting on the numbers, Eamonn O’Reilly, chief executive of Dublin Port Company, said, “The first quarter of 2021 was very weak with overall cargo volumes back by 15.2% compared to the first quarter of 2020.

“This is mainly because of Brexit. However, it is too early yet to say what the long-term effects of Brexit will be and whether the declines we have seen so far in 2021 will persist at the same level for the rest of the year.”
‘Dislocation’
O’Reilly described the “dislocation of a lot of volume to ports in Northern Ireland” as a “worrying” trend.
“Back in 1990 before the Single European Market was established, more than a third of roll-on, roll-off trade chose services to and from Northern Irish ports rather than use services in and out of Dublin Port,” he added.
“We won’t get a proper sense until later in the year as to how much of the 29% decline we have seen in GB roll-on, roll-off trade is due to the new border regimes and whether this dislocation will be a permanent feature for the years ahead or not.”
However, O’Reilly said the increase in trade between Dublin and other EU ports is a positive development, which confirms that the company’s investment decisions in recent years “were correct”.
“It also shows the responsiveness of the shipping market to rapidly provide the capacity needed for the changes in demand patterns which Brexit has caused.”
O’Reilly said he expects “that the pivoting of trade from Great Britain to continental Europe will, in time, re-establish the long-term growth trends we have seen in Dublin Port for many decades”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/voters-split-northern-ireland-protocol-5480552-Jun2021/,"PEOPLE IN NORTHERN Ireland are evenly split on the Protocol, a new poll has suggested.
When asked whether the Protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% of respondents said that it is but the same number disagreed.
Similarly, 43% think that the Protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think it isn’t.
However a clear majority are concerned about the effects of the Protocol on Northern Ireland, in particular the cost of products and the choice of goods for consumers.
Over half of people (57%) told researchers for Lucid Talk and Queen’s University Belfast that they would like to see the UK agreeing to regulatory alignment with the EU to address issues caused by the Protocol, which has seen a raft of checks on goods arriving at ports from Britain.
A minority (38%) said that they would like to see such checks and controls moved from ports and airports in Northern Ireland to the Irish land border.
Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission’s vice president,told the NI Assembly this week that it is prepared to consider “bold steps”to reduce the required checks under Brexit’s Irish Sea border to an “absolute minimum”.
Introduced as a result of Brexit, the Protocol has drawn anger from Unionists and sparked protests as loyalists regard it as separating the North from the the rest of the UK.
It is set to be one of the big issues at the next election in the North, with three-quarters of respondents to the Lucid Talk poll saying it would be a key factor in their ballot.
The poll, which surveyed 1500 people, found that the majority (67%) agree that Northern Ireland does need “particular arrangements” for managing the impact of Brexit, but they are nonetheless divided on the Protocol itself.
The margin of error is plus or minus 2-3%.

However, 56% agree that the Protocol provides Northern Ireland with a “unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities”, according to pollsters.
The researchers said: “[The poll] reveals that, although people’s concerns are still considerable, the protests and political debate over the Protocol since April have not led to any significant growth in the proportion of voters objecting to it.
“This suggests that positions on the Protocol are already quite well entrenched.”
The biggest concern for people is the cost of certain products (69%), in contrast to the choice of products for consumers (61%) or the existence of checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain (58%).
Trust in parties
A high level of distrust exists in the DUP and UK government’s ability to manage the impact of the Protocol, with just 5% trusting the UK government and 86% distrusting it.
A split is identified when people were asked whether they trust the EU on the issue as 40% trust the European Commission. 48% distrust it.
Co-investigator on the project, Professor Katy Hayward, from Queen’s University Belfast and a Senior Fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, noted: “People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against – and in equal proportions. The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the Protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next Assembly election.”
The poll found that the DUP is distrusted by eight out of ten voters regarding the Protocol, while Sinn Féin is distrusted by six out of ten. Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP are distrusted by around 4 in 10 respondents.
The researchers noted that a third of poll respondents are still to make up their mind as to whether they trust the UUP or not on the topic.
Trust in parties over the Protocol is important because of the democratic consent vote that MLAs will have, researchers said.
This is because, at the end of 2024, the NI Assembly will vote on the continued application of Articles 5-10 of the Protocol, which relate mostly to the movement of goods).
“Most respondents (91%) have a view on how they wish MLAs to vote, and, again, this is evenly split: 46% in favour of the continued application of Articles 5-10 and 45% against.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson greets French President Emmanuel Macron at the G7 summit.PA ImagesPA Images
THE EUROPEAN UNION has been urged to back down in a dispute with the UK over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Boris Johnson was holding talks with the EU’s key players today as the dispute threatened to overshadow his hosting of the G7 summit.
Johnson was meeting European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the margins of the gathering in Cornwall.
Johnson has warned Brussels he will not hesitate to take unilateral measures to protect the position of Northern Ireland in the increasingly bitter row over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
While Downing Street characterised the discussions as “constructive”, Johnson complained that some of the leaders failed to understand the UK is a single country.
“I just need to get that into their heads,” he said.
He warned that unless there was a solution he would invoke Article 16 of the protocol which allows either side to take unilateral action if its implementation were to lead to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.
His comments followed a series of talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council leader Charles Michel.
The Prime Minister told Sky News: “I think we can sort it out but… it is up to our EU friends and partners to understand that we will do whatever it takes.
“I think if the protocol continues to be applied in this way, then we will obviously not hesitate to invoke Article 16, as I have said before.
“Don’t forget, the EU themselves invoked Article 16 in January, to disapply the protocol, so they can stop removal of vaccines from the EU to the UK.
“I’ve talked to some of our friends here today, who do seem to misunderstand that the UK is a single country, a single territory. I just need to get that into their heads.”
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the EU to take a more “pragmatic” approach to the Northern Ireland issue.
The main summit agenda will see the leaders of the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy commit to a new plan aimed at preventing a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Johnson also faces a potentially tricky series of meetings with the EU’s senior representatives.
Downing Street has indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.

Restrictions on British-produced chilled meats entering Northern Ireland are due to come into force at the end of the month.
Delaying the checks without Brussels’ agreement risks triggering a “sausage war” trade dispute, with the EU threatening to respond to any breach of the deal signed by Johnson.
Johnson has suggested the EU is taking an “excessively burdensome” approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.

Raab told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “They can be more pragmatic about the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way that is win-win or they can be bloody-minded and purist about it, in which case I am afraid we will not allow the integrity of the UK to be threatened.”
During the meeting in Cornwall, Macron reportedly told the Prime Minister the UK-France relationship could only be “reset” if Johnson stood by the Brexit deal, according to French sources.
The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the European single market to avoid a hard border with Ireland, meaning a trade barrier in the Irish Sea for goods crossing from Great Britain.
Johnson’s official spokesman told reporters in Cornwall the immediate priority was to find “radical and urgent solutions within the protocol”.
But “we keep all options on the table”, he added, indicating the possibility of a unilateral extension of a grace period to allow sausages to continue to be shipped across the Irish Sea.
Downing Street played down expectations of Johnson finding a resolution to the impasse at the Carbis Bay summit.
The spokesman suggested the meeting was “not the forum in which he is necessarily seeking to come up with an immediate solution”.
At a press conference ahead of the G7 summit, von der Leyen insisted the protocol is the “only solution” to prevent a hard border with the Republic and must be implemented in full.
Macron also warned the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin meanwhile welcomed the intervention of US president Joe Biden this week in the row over the North’s Brexit arrangements.
Speaking today on Newstalk Breakfast, Martin said that “the intervention from Joe Biden is significant – but it makes sense from the American perspective”. He also said, from his perspective, the US intervention involves a lot of common sense.
The Taoiseach said it’s important for countries with similar values to be aligned and so the EU-US relationship is very important regarding restoring that transatlantic relationship. However, the UK need to also be aligned in that restoration.
Speaking to reporters at an event in Dublin, Martin said: “I think it is significant in the context of the message from President Biden and his administration that the sensible thing to do is to have alignment between the UK and the EU and the US – we all share common values as democracies.
“I think he’s saying ‘let’s do the sensible thing here’.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-lose-lose-barnier-5640183-Dec2021/,"THE EU’S FORMER Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that Brexit has been a “lose-lose” event.
His comment comes a year on from the trade agreement he helped strike, after years of complicated fraught negotiations between the EU and UK.
The UK’s fiscal watchdogsaid earlier this yearthat the impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse in the long run than the Covid-19 pandemic, with Brexit expected to impact the UK’s GDP by 4% and the pandemic by 3%, according to current forecasts.
Meanwhile, trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland has increased in both directions as trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is stifled compared to before due to new post-Brexit trade rules contained in the Protocol.

Barnier said today: “One year later, Brexit remains a lose-lose decision.”
Last year’s Christmas Eve deal put in place the arrangements for continued trade between the EU and the UK outside the Single Market and Customs Union.
The deal also secured details of the Protocol for Northern Ireland – a special trading relationship that keeps Northern Ireland within the Single Market but aligned to the EU’s custom rules, which has caused some disruption to trade in practice.
Talks on how to resolve this disruption have been ongoing – the UK has appointed a new lead negotiator Liz Truss to steer talks on the Protocol with the EU’s Maroš Šefčovič, after the intractable civil-servant-turned-politician David Frost resigned as a minister over Covid regulations.
Talks on the Protocol and the oversight of the European Court of Justice is to continue in the New Year.
Barnier said today that the European project “deserves to be defended and reformed”, adding that it needed the same unity and energy as the Brexit trade talks were given.

Following the signing of the Brexit trade agreement, Barnier launched an unsuccessful run for the French presidency – for which the election will take place next April.
Although the trade deal meant the potential chaos of a no-deal Brexit was avoided, relations between the UK and EU have remained difficult: the UK has been locked in a bitter dispute with France over fishing rights and migration across the English Channel.

THE DELEGATION OF US politicians on a fact-finding mission to Ireland are in Derry today after a day in Dublin yesterday that angered the DUP.
The delegation – led by senior US Democrat Richard Neal – spent time in Brussels and London before travelling to Ireland at the weekend as part of a mission that examines post-Brexit trade relations and the Northern Ireland Protocol.
In Dublin yesterday, Neal said the issue over the Northern Ireland Protocol seems to be “manufactured” and that it could be resolved “quickly”.
The comments promptedanger from unionist politiciansincluding DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson who accused him of “distorting the truth” and a “slavish adherence to Sinn Fein dogma”.
An article attacking Neal penned by former DUP leader Arlene Fosterpublished in today’s Daily Express newspaperwas titled: “Meddling Americans are the real threat to peace in Northern Ireland”.
UUP leader Doug Beattie tweeted: “Unbelievable – is this really helping the situation in any way.”
Neal is expected to meet with DUP representatives later having met with SDLP politicians in Derry earlier today today.
Asked about his upcoming meeting with Donaldson, Neal said: “I have known him for a long period of time, I don’t want to trespass. I have had a good relationship with him over the years.”

On his visit to Derry, Neal was asked about the negative reaction from some unionists to his use of the word “planter” when addressing the Seanad yesterday.
Neal said he was using a historic reference in relation to the establishment of the plantation in the 17th Century.
“That was the point that I made,” he said. “I also referenced the historical term of the gael, the gael and the planter, because those are entirely accurate historic references.”
Asked if he accepted that some people had been offended, he replied:
PAPA
Neal also said that the issues with Protocol are for the UK and EU to resolve.
He described the issues with the Protocol as “significantly disproportionate” compared with issues dealt by the two communities in Northern Ireland previously.
“People here took up much more severe challenges … this is an issue for the European Union and for the UK government to sift and sort,” he said.
Neal said he was “optimistic” that a resolution to the Northern Ireland Protocol row could be found.
“I am easily optimistic, I’m over the moon with optimism,” he said.
During their visit, the congressional delegation walked across Derry’s Peace Bridge. They also walked the city’s historic walls and visited the popular mural dedicated to the hit TV show Derry Girls.
Neal revealed that he had watched some of the show about Derry children growing up during the Troubles, describing it as “extraordinary”.
“It made an impression,” he said.
‘Manufactured’
Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told reporters in Dublin yesterday that “it was up to London” to help find a solution on the Protocol, and that there was “vagueness” from the UK over what protocol issue had led it to table its own legislation.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is also visiting Northern Ireland today and spoke to media while visiting a haulage company in Lisburn, some 16km outside Belfast.
“I am in Northern Ireland to talk about our solution on customs, putting in place a red and green lane to make sure that we remove customs bureaucracy for those goods that are travelling from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, so we can restore the balance between the communities and restore the working of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,” she said.
Truss claimed that the Uk government has no plans to scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol, but instead “fix the issues”.
“What we have been clear about is the Protocol is causing political instability, so we haven’t seen the Northern Ireland Executive in operation since February,” Truss said.
She added: “Everybody in Northern Ireland recognises our issue is with the protocol, we are not talking about scrapping the protocol, what we are talking about is fixing the issues so we can protect north-south trade whilst at the same time making east-west trade easier.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/barry-andrews-brexit-and-anglo-irish-relations-5619619-Dec2021/,"I ENTERED THE European Parliament in unusual circumstances. Brexit brought me in in two senses.
I ran for election because I felt that there would be a shift in the relevance of Brussels post-Brexit.
Also I won the fourth seat in Dublin in May 2019 which only became effective when the UK left in January 2020.
My maiden speech in February 2020 focused on trying to ensure that the UK was treated not as a rival, but as a partner.
However, current Tory ideology (if dishonesty is an ideology) is having an extremely negative impact on the island of Ireland.
We are aware of how little Ireland really counts in Westminster politics – unless, as occasionally happens, a unionist party holds the balance of power. The orthodox view for years was that, for UK Prime Ministers, there was nothing to be gained in getting involved in Ireland; it was a case of, ‘leave well enough alone’.
This orthodoxy was rejected by John Major, who invested a lot of political capital in laying the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 via the Downing Street Declaration of 1994. Major’s demise unfortunately bore out the wisdom of the orthodoxy.
Despite the British-Irish governance architecture in the Good Friday Agreement, few of the mechanisms are really effective.
Advertisement
The British-Irish Council (comprising Ireland, UK, and the devolved administrations) has none of the familiarity of the Nordic Council because the UK has largely ignored it, with Prime Ministers rarely, if ever, attending – the last to attend was Gordon Brown in 2007.
Equally, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is underused. It didn’t even meet between 2007 and 2018. There is blame on both sides for that.
Acknowledging these deficits, Taoiseach Micheál Martin set up a Shared Island Unit within the Taoiseach’s department in December 2020.
It is his view that there will not be a border poll in the next five years. Instead, his main focus is on building trust with the unionist community in particular through infrastructure projects, health, trade missions, and school curriculums. He even calls upon the Marshall Plan as an inspiration for the level of investment needed. Uniting people comes before uniting territory, although not merely a means to that end.
The knock-on impacts on our relationship with the EU also requires work.
The EU is determined to drive an integration agenda. This will be super-charged if Emmanuel Macron is re-elected as French President in May next year. The new German government is distinctly pro-EU and has set its sights on further EU integration.
This should ring alarm bells in Dublin.
Our economic model is based on inward investment primarily from the US, a pro-business climate and tax autonomy. All of these foundations are under threat. Equally plans for a European Defence Union hardly sit well with our traditional military neutrality.
Having painted this negative picture, it should be said that rumours of Ireland’s difficulties in the EU are much exaggerated. Ireland’s influence on the shape of the Brexit negotiations demonstrated a very strong diplomatic effort – ‘statecraft’, as some rather pompously call it.
Winning a seat on the UN Security Council from the group of death – which included Norway and Canada – was also a great achievement.

Finance Minister Pascal Donohoe’s success in becoming Eurozone President was also a remarkable coup. What was almost the greatest coup was nearly winning the right to host the European Banking Authority following a tied vote with France. The appointment of Philip Lane as Chief Economist of the ECB and Emer Cooke as head of the EMA are also worth noting.
Joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 was the biggest contributor for stability on the island of Ireland because of (i) funding towards peace projects and reconciliation; (ii) opportunities for relationships between politicians and diplomats to be formed outside of the context of the Troubles; (iii) softening of the Irish border; and (iv) allowing for the concept of nationality to evolve.
It is important to ensure that the UK’s exit from the EU does not erode these contributors to stability on this island.
We have not fully escaped the morass of Brexit but once we do, great care will have to be taken to triangulate policy based on the sets of relationships that matter to us most; the EU, the US – and the UK.
We can position ourselves as the gateway to Europe for both of our Atlantic neighbours.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-checks-edwin-poots-5671186-Feb2022/,"LAST UPDATE|2 Feb 2022
NORTHERN IRELAND’S AGRICULTURE Minister Edwin Poots has ordered a halt to Brexit agri-food checks at Northern Ireland ports from midnight – checks which are legally required under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The move has been criticised as “grandstanding” by Stormont’s Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long; while Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd questioned where Poots received his legal advice in favour of suspending the checks.
Alliance Party MLA John Blair said Edwin Poots and the DUP were “addicted to disruption”, while TUV leader Jim Allister welcomed Edwin Poots’ decision, saying “We need now to see the total dismantling and the unbedding of the Protocol.”
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said the checks suspension, if carried out, would be a “breach of international law”.
Earlier today, Poots said he had sought legal advice on whether he can unilaterally halt Brexit checks on agri-goods coming from Great Britain at Northern Ireland ports, after Sinn Féin vetoed a Stormont motion in relation to the Brexit checks.
Poots has argued that in the absence of Executive approval, he no longer has legal cover to continue the documentary checks and physical inspections.
It is yet unclear whether the senior civil servant in his department, Anthony Harbinson, will comply with the order.
Some politicians have insisted the civil service has a duty to comply with Stormont’s legal obligations to carry out the checks under the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.

Speaking at Stormont this evening, Poots said he had received legal advice which stated that he could order a halt to Northern Ireland Protocol checks without the approval of the Executive.
“I have taken legal advice in relation to my position from senior counsel. Earlier today I received that legal advice.
“A decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval.
“I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on 31 December 2020 from midnight tonight.
“I will prepare a paper for Executive consideration in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward.”
At the weekend, Poots was not selected by the DUP as a candidate for the South Down area, ahead of Stormont Assembly elections to be held in May. Poots had indicated he wanted to leave his Lagan Valley constituency and stand in South Down – today he blamed DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson – his successor as DUP leader – for the failed attempt.
The party nominated Diane Forsythe as its candidate for South Down instead.
Poots gave an interview on the BBC’s Good Morning Ulstertodayin which he said “Edwin Poots hasn’t gone away” and that his political demise had not happened yet.
The Northern Ireland Assembly had been due to vote on whether to retain the post-Brexit Protocol arrangements in 2024, under the consent mechanism of the Brexit deal – the DUP has been arguing for the Protocol’s complete suspension since it first came into force.
What happened in Stormont last Thursday?
PA ImagesPA Images
Poots sought the legal advice on unilaterally ending agri-checks from GB-to-NI after trying to secure the wider approval of all ministers of the Stormont Executive to continue checks on agri-foods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
The agriculture minister has argued that in the absence of Executive approval, he no longer has legal cover to continue the documentary checks and physical inspections.
His move to seek a ministerial vote at the Executive last week was branded a stunt by other parties.

They insist the Executive has already agreed that Poots’ department has responsibility for carrying out the checks and he does not have the authority to halt processes that are required under the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement – an international treaty.
Poots is arguing that the authority of the wider Stormont Executive is needed to conduct the post-Brexit checks now in force for over a year under the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Claiming recent court rulings have clarified that such authority is required, Poots tried to secure the approval of the Executive by asking for the matter to be considered at last Thursday’s meeting of ministers.
He did so in the knowledge that if the issue was elevated to the Executive, his party could at that point exercise a veto to block approval for the checks.
Realising that, Sinn Féin used its own veto to prevent the issue from getting on the agenda – Poots is now claiming that this means the devolved administration has not given its approval for the Brexit checks, meaning he can suspend them.
Is this actually legal?
Poots said he would make a decision on whether to halt the checks once he considers the opinion of the senior counsel.
“I expect to receive senior counsel advice on that imminently and I will take my decision shortly after I consider that,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.
“If the advice leads me to a conclusion that the staff need to have the legal basis to operate there, which stems from having Executive approval, then I’ll have to act on that.”
Speaking in Seanad, Minister Coveney said: “If a political decision is taken by a minister in Northern Ireland to stop all checks in ports on goods coming across the Irish Sea, coming into Northern Ireland, that is effectively a breach of international law.
“It was agreed and ratified by the UK and the EU. And its implementation is not only part of an international treaty, but it is part of international law.
“It’s essentially playing politics with legal obligations. And I certainly hope that it doesn’t happen, as has been threatened.”
Justice Minister Naomi Long said that Poots had “received clear legal advice in March 2020 when he first tried this stunt”.
Long said the advice was clear that the Department of Agriculture is “obliged by law to undertake these checks”, adding: “Step up and do the job or step aside.”

DUP threats over the Protocol
The DUP has repeatedly threatened to withdraw ministers from the Stormont Executive if major changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol are not secured.
Such a move would prevent the administration from functioning properly and would remove its power to take significant decisions.
Poots blamed the Protocol for creating instability within the powersharing institutions – while Sinn Féin MLAs have argued that businesses and citizens are benefitting from access to both the United Kingdom and the EU.
Poots has said: “I am worried about what the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to the Executive, I’m worried that the European Union has driven a coach and horses through the peace agreement that exists in Northern Ireland.”
On the prospect of Stormont collapsing, Poots added: “What we have currently is entirely unacceptable and if people think that is something that we’re just going to allow to grind on and on and on then that’s not going to happen.”
The minister said “time and space” had been afforded to UK and EU negotiators to find a resolution – some new changes to the Protocol have already been implemented.
He said implementation of last year’s UK Government command paper on changes to the protocol would “help greatly” – this paper has been criticised as not being detailed enough to put into action.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-risks-further-angering-eu-with-response-to-post-brexit-legal-threat-over-northern-ireland-protocol-5867279-Sep2022/,"THE UK HAS risked further antagonising the European Union by responding to legal threats over the Northern Ireland Protocol by refusing to fully implement the post-Brexit agreement.
Ministers are understood to have responded to Brussels’ seven infringement proceedings by saying they will unilaterally continue with the grace periods on checks currently in place.
Britain’s mission to the EU formally replied by the end-of-Thursday deadline, despite politics as normal being paused during the mourning period for the queen.
The PA news agency was told that the response said the UK would continue with the current approach of not forcing retailers and exporters to adhere to all the agreed checks.
The response with unilateral action is liable to anger the bloc, which has stressed the need to find joint solutions to the trade barrier created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.
But Britain hopes that delaying the checks will help create the space for solutions to be found.
Four infringement procedures were triggered by the European Commission in July, adding to three already launched a month earlier.

Speaking to reportersafter the first set of these procedures were triggeredin June, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said it represented “a step up in response from the EU”.
He called on the British government to hold talks with their European counterparts in a bid to halting any legal action.
Meanwhile, European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said the UK’s move had “no legal or political justification”.
However, the EU has been further angered by the UK’s threat to override parts of the protocol with new legislation, which the bloc argues would break international law.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be in Westminster for the queen’s funeral on Monday.
It is unclear if she will be meeting British Prime Minister Liz Truss while in London, although Truss is expected to hold some talks with political leaders during their visits.
There have been unconfirmed suggestions that Truss will speak to Taoiseach Micheál Martin on the margins of the funeral amid tensions over the protocol.
The European Commission declined to discuss the contents of the UK letter, as did the UK Government during the mourning period. Neither side was planning to publish the document.
Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie told reporters in Brussels: “I can confirm we have received a reply from the UK. We will now analyse the reply before deciding on the next steps.”","2.07pm, 15 Sep 2022",

UK FOREIGN SECRETARY James Cleverly and EU post-Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic have agreed to continue “scoping work” to solve the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
After a video conference today, they released a joint statement saying: “The two sides discussed the range of existing challenges over the last two years and the need to find solutions together to tackle comprehensively the real-life concerns of all communities in Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market and the integrity of the EU’s single market.
“They agreed that this scoping work for potential solutions should continue in a constructive and collaborative spirit, taking careful account of each other’s legitimate interests.”
Cleverly thanked Sefcovic for the video conference and expressed hope that a solution can be found “that works for the people of Northern Ireland and protects the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement”.

Meanwhile, Sefcovic tweeted that “scoping work for potential solutions will continue in a constructive, collaborative spirit, taking careful account of each other’s legitimate interests”.
However, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said he does not think the UK and EU are close to a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“It was clear from our conversations with James Cleverly last Wednesday when he visited Belfast that there are still substantial gaps between the two sides,” said the DUP leader.
“There is still a lot of ground to be covered. I don’t think we are close to a deal at this stage.
“Our position remains unchanged. We need to get an agreement that restores Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom and its internal market.”
Speculation had mounted in recent days that the two sides could be edging towards a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland Protocol, amid suggestions that cross-Channel relations have improved since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister.
The announcement last week that a deal had been reached on sharing real-time data on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland was seen as a step towards an overall resolution.

Labour said signs of progress were “promising” and urged Sunak to ignore the right wing of his party to secure a protocol pact with Brussels.
Talk of pushing through the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, heavily criticised by the EU for the way it would unilaterally override parts of the treaty signed by former prime minister Boris Johnson, has grown quieter in recent months.
There has also been a flurry of activity in Northern Ireland, with Cleverly and Labour leader Keir Starmer’s Belfast appearances last week adding to speculation that a protocol announcement is moving nearer.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin also paid visits to Belfast last week.
Speaking to the PA news agency about today’s talks, a UK Government source said: “We’d all prefer a negotiated solution but significant gaps remain.
“It is the conversations with the commission that will either bring that about or not.
“Nobody should be under any illusions that this is complex and difficult but the desire to work together on a solution seems to be there.”
Alongside the EU-UK talks, Labour will send a delegation to Derry to meet business leaders and learn about how the protocol has affected Northern Ireland trade.
Labour’s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle and shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Chapman will visit Foyle Port, a gateway that handles two million tonnes of cargo a year.
Party officials said they were going to “see first-hand how red tape from the Conservatives’ deal and ongoing uncertainty are affecting trade”.
The protocol was agreed to in 2019 by Johnson as a way of breaking the Brexit deadlock.
In order to avoid a hard border in Ireland, customs and food safety checks and processes were moved to the Irish Sea, creating economic and administrative barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
The protocol is vehemently opposed by many unionists and the DUP is blocking the functioning of a devolved government in Stormont in protest at the arrangements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/unionist-leaders-denounce-ni-protocol-5565247-Oct2021/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS been warned by the DUP leader Donaldson that the Irish Sea border needs to be removed “for the future of the union”.
The leaders of Northern Ireland’s three main unionist parties shared a platform to strongly criticise the Northern Ireland Protocol at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference today.
Donaldson also met with the Prime Minister where he reiterated his call for action by the Government within weeks.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
Unionists in Northern Ireland are opposed to its terms, which see additional checks on goods arriving in the region from the rest of the UK, regarding it as a border in the Irish Sea.
Last month, Donaldson threatened to collapse the power-sharing institutions at Stormont if his demands on the protocol were not met.

He told the Manchester fringe event: “We simply cannot allow this situation to continue. And we need to see action taken by the Government within weeks.
“What we need now is to move beyond the words of the command paper published in July which were good and provided a road map for a way forward. We need action.
“We need the Government to sit up, and to take action to remove this Irish Sea border, remove the barriers to trade within the United Kingdom, and fundamentally to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market. At the heart of this is the future of the union itself.”
On his threat to collapse Stormont, Donaldson said: “I cannot sustain a situation where we are required to use the political institutions in Northern Ireland to implement the protocol that is designed to undermine our place within the union.”
Earlier, Brexit minister Lord Frost delivered a speech to the conference where he said if the UK and the EU cannot strike an agreement, Britain will consider what is seen to be the nuclear option of triggering Article 16.
Donaldson responded: “Triggering Article 16 has its use in the short term, but what we require in order to restore Northern Ireland’s place fully within the United Kingdom is UK legislation.”
The DUP leader was joined at the event by Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie, TUV leader Jim Allister, and former UUP leader Lord Trimble.
Beattie told the fringe event that he did not agree with the threat to bring down the Stormont institutions.

He said: “I do not think collapsing the institutions is good for Northern Ireland. I do not think it is good for the people.
“I cannot look at the people in the face, those 300, 000 on hospital waiting lists and say we are going to collapse an institution that is supposed to be looking after you.”
Allister told the meeting that the protocol had separated Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
He said: “In Manchester today – under the principles and purposes of the protocol- I am in a ‘third country’ as far as protocol ruled Northern Ireland is concerned.
“That is an affront to our supposed status as an integral part of the United Kingdom and an intolerable affront to our Britishness. Is it an affront to the Conservative and Unionist Party?”
He added: “Brexit was supposed to be about ‘taking back control’; in our case, it was about handing away control. We did not get Brexit, we got the Brexit-denying Protocol.

Donaldson held talks with Taoiseach Micheál Martin in Dublin today, which were described as “frank and open”.
The Lagan Valley MP said he warned the Taoiseach that unionists “cannot be expected to work as normal” with Ireland when Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK is “being harmed on a daily basis” by the protocol.
The Taoiseach, speaking separately, said he acknowledged “the concerns of the unionist community are sincere”.
“But I indicated as well that the mechanisms are there in the UK-EU trade agreement to resolve these issues and the issues around the protocol,” he said.
“Our sense has been that the EU Commission has been flexible and ready to respond to the situation.
Unionists are strongly opposed to the impact on the additional checks under the protocol on trade between Northern Ireland and Britain, arguing it places a border down the Irish Sea.
Legal action has been taken against the protocol while loyalists have been holding a series of demonstrations against the post-Brexit arrangements.

Donaldson said he told the Taoiseach that unionist concerns over the protocol are growing, and of the potential for it to cause further political harm later in the year.
He said the harm to the east/west relationship may have consequences for the north/south relationship in Ireland.
“Unionists cannot reasonably be expected to work as normal on a north/south basis when our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom is being harmed on a daily basis by this protocol,” he said.
“That is simply the reality of the political situation that we face.
“I don’t want to see a political crisis in Northern Ireland, I don’t want to see the political institutions being harmed, I want to see a Northern Ireland where we move towards a more united community, but the protocol is harming our capacity to build that united community.”
Donaldson said issues around the protocol need to be addressed, and quickly.
“We need to remove the border that has developed between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in trading terms, we need to recognise that for unionists that cuts across the very Act of Union itself, which is the very fundamental building block of our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.
“Unionists cannot in any circumstances support such a situation and therefore the Irish Sea border needs to be removed, and we need to find practical solutions that will enable trade to return to normality between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and at the same time put in place measures that protect the integrity of the EU single market.

Inspections at Larne and Belfast ports were suspended last night after sinister graffiti and reports of intelligence-gathering on inspectors carrying out the checks.

Lorries arriving at new inspection facilities at Belfast Port this morning were turned around and redirected by Border Force officials.
Police in Northern Ireland will hold talks with inspection agencies later.
Former agriculture minister Poots said: “It is difficult for politicians to (control) the level of anger that is in the community in respect of this and it is a time for calm heads and a time for wise behaviour, but these things have certainly created a lot of tension in the community.”
His officials are among those to be withdrawn.
There is no indication at this stage whether the threat is coming from an organised paramilitary source, rather than an individual or individuals.
The senior Democratic Unionist, who stepped down at midnight ahead of undergoing cancer surgery, added: “Ultimately the people who are doing their jobs, who are going to their work, are not their enemies.
“They are people who are simply carrying out a job, whether it is the Department of Agriculture, the local council or Food Standards Agency.”

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the tensions are linked to potential curbs on British Army movements across the Irish Sea and follow withdrawn EU threats to restrict vaccine supplies.
Loyalists are angry at the imposition of a new economic border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

The suspension move came as focus on the protocol intensified following Friday’s ill-fated move by the EU to suspend aspects of its operation amid the furore over vaccine supply in the bloc.
The European Commission swiftly backtracked after facing intense criticism for attempting to hinder the free flow of movement across the Irish border in respect of vaccines.

Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said that it had decided yesterday “in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast” pending further discussions with the PSNI.
Full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual.
Poots said: “The Protocol, as has been established, has made Great Britain a third country to Northern Ireland when we are all part of the sovereign UK.
“The EU laws that have been established to deal with materials coming in from third countries such as Brazil and Argentina is a totally disproportionate application to have that applied to Great Britain whenever Northern Ireland is part of the UK, remains part of the UK, but over 50% of our trade in foodstuffs is coming from Great Britain and the impact upon the people of Northern Ireland is immense.”
PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said his officers have increased patrols at Larne Port and other points of entry in order to reassure staff and the local community.
Twelve Mid and East Antrim Borough Council staff assisting officials from Daera and UK Border Force with checks at Larne Port were withdrawn from their duties with immediate effect on Monday.
The council said it followed an “upsurge in sinister and menacing behaviour in recent weeks”.
Graffiti appeared in the area last month, referring to tensions about the Northern Ireland Protocol and describing port staff as “targets”.
There have also been a number of daubings in Belfast amid anger at the protocol, with a raft of new checks on goods arriving at ports from Great Britain introduced at the start of the year.
In addition to fears over graffiti, it is understood staff expressed concerns that individuals had been spotted taking down number plate details.

Police last month warned that discontent in loyalist communities was “growing” over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is designed to allow the country to follow the EU’s customs rules and has caused delays at ports because of new declarations and checks, but said their feedback was not causing significant concern.
The DUP has been vociferous in opposition to the protocol’s operation.
The party’s North Antrim MP Ian Paisley condemned the threats to staff but said the protocol was “bound to cause these problems”.
“Such tactics have no place in a democracy,” he said.
“This is the sad reality of those who imposed terms on Northern Ireland without the consent of the delicate community balance which exists here. The protocol was bound to end in tears and here we have society’s structure falling apart.
“When (former Irish premier) Leo Varadkar shamefully distributed copies of border posts being blown up in Newry 30 years ago around EU Commission members, he demonstrated that violence and the threat of violence has a seat at the table.
“At the heart of progress in Northern Ireland has been cross-community consent.
“Those who thought they could impose something against the will of every unionist are now reaping the seeds of division they have sown.
“The protocol was bound to cause these problems given the triumphant approach by republicans and nationalists and the wilful ignorance that 50% of the population was opposed to the protocol.
“It’s time for the Government to step up and invoke Article 16, set it aside and let’s get back to proper trade without restrictions.”
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it is time for political leaders to “dial down the rhetoric”.
He said: “In Northern Ireland, words can have very dangerous consequences. So does (Michael Gove) agree with me that it is now time for all political leaders to dial down the rhetoric and deal with the actual issues that exist around this protocol?
“Of course, recognising that the Protocol is a direct consequence of Britain leaving the customs union and the single market.”
Gove responded: “It’s incumbent on all of us to calmly and purposefully seek to resolve the issues on the ground and I’m grateful to all the parties in Northern Ireland Executive, and in particular the First Minister, for the calm and purposeful way in which they’ve addressed the challenges that we share.”","7.32am, 2 Feb 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/rishi-sunak-stormont-protocol-5997666-Feb2023/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS said he is “quietly confident” that an agreement between the EU and UK on the Brexit protocol could be achieved “within the next week or two”.
It comes after British prime minister Rishi Sunak held bilateral meetings with all five of the main Northern Ireland parties at a hotel on the outskirts of Belfast amid mounting speculation that a UK/EU deal on the Irish trading arrangements is close.
Following his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.
There is mounting speculation that a deal between the EU and UK could be unveiled early next week.
While Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin has cautioned that he believes there is a “distance to go yet”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he is “quietly confident” that an agreement between the UK and the EU could be reached soon.
“A lot of progress is being made, we are not there yet but certainly a lot off trust has been built up between the European Commission and Ireland and the British government,” Varadkar told reporters in Limerick today.
“I do believe the prospect is there of having an agreement possibly within a week – it’s not finalised we haven’t all seen the final text yet, but we are getting there,” he continued.
“I’m quietly confident that within the next week or two we could be in a position to sign off on an agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom and that would be a big boost I think, first of all because it would allow us to normalise political and trading relationships between Britain’s and the European Union and Ireland, putting an end to a very difficult period that started with the Brexit referendum.”
“But most importantly, it opens the prospect of getting the Assembly and Executive up and running in Northern Ireland so that people have a government functioning in Northern Ireland and have the Good Friday Agreement working again.”
Speaking to broadcasters in Downing Street this evening, Sunak said he had “positive conversations” with political parties to resolve the Protocol issues, but that “there is more work to do” on finding a deal.
“Now it is clear that we need to find solutions to the practical problems that the Protocol is causing families and business in Northern Ireland, as well as address the democratic deficit,” he said.
“There is more work to do, and that’s why my ministerial colleagues and I will continue talking to the European Union intensely to find solutions that protect the Belfast Good Friday agreement and Northern Ireland’s place in our single market.”
In another apparent sign of progress, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly met with European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic.
The cross-community Alliance Party was the first in to meet Sunak at a hotel on the outskirts this morning. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP also met with Sunak.
Speaking after his meeting with Sunak, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said that “progress has been made across a range of issues”, but that there is “still some areas where further work is required” to get a deal.
“The decisions that will be taken by the Prime Minister and by the European Commission will either consign Northern Ireland to more division or they will clear a path towards healing and towards the restoration of the political institutions,” Donaldson told reporters.

Donaldson said the party has not seen the final text of an agreement yet, adding there will be further discussions between the UK government and the EU.
“If and when a final agreement is reached, we will want to carefully consider the detail of that agreement and decide if the agreement does, in fact, meet our seven tests,” he said.
Donaldson said the DUP has been “very clear with the Prime Minister that those seven tests remain the basis upon which we will judge any agreement”.

It was put to Sunak that Donaldson had said the EU needed to “stretch itself to achieve a deal”.
Asked if he agreed, the UK Prime Minister said he had set himself “tests” on any potential agreement with Brussels, including “crucially that we address the democratic deficit”.
Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said that indications of progress on the Northern Ireland Protocol was heartening.
“It’s clear now that significant progress has been made and we’re very heartened by that,” she said after meeting with Sunak.
When asked about whether a deal on the protocol had been done, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said:
“It was a very constructive meeting and it was my first occasion to meet the Prime Minister, but I look forward to many further engagements with him,” McDonald said.
“He accepts that the core of the protocol has worked and he has expressed the need to negotiate and to figure out how to resolve those parts that need a smoother application, or, as he put it, ‘the parts that weren’t working’.
“There’s no doubt, the protocol is a consequence of Brexit and the protocol is necessary, and the Prime Minister is in absolutely no doubt of that.”

Speaking after engaging with Sunak this morning, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said he is in listening mode, and that there is “some heavy lifting still to be done” to secure a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol.
She said it was “a very constructive and very positive meeting”.
“He was very much in listening mode and keen to hear our views. It seems apparent that while he was not in a position to brief us about the details, that things are gradually moving in the direction of a potential deal,” Long said.
“But we are not over the line yet. That doesn’t mean that we won’t be very soon, but there’s clearly some heavy lifting still to be done.”

The UK and the EU have been engaged in substantive negotiations over the workings of the protocol, agreed to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish land border after Brexit.
The protocol instead created economic barriers on trade being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
It has proven to be deeply unpopular with unionists, who claim it has weakened Northern Ireland’s place within the UK, and the DUP has collapsed the powersharing institutions at Stormont in protest at the arrangements.
Emerging from his meeting with Sunak, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British Prime Minister had given “scant” detail on the potential deal with the EU.
He said he believed that Sunak was “ticking the box” of engaging with the Stormont parties.
“I think he’s very careful not to get into too much detail until the deal is done and I suppose that’s fair enough,” he said.
Eastwood said he made clear to Sunak that the dual market access provided for in the protocol, allowing business in Northern Ireland to sell unfettered into the EU single market, must be preserved.
“He said the deal is not done yet,” he added.
“I think he’s clear that lots of progress has been made and that’s what we’ve been hearing from the European side and from Dublin as well. But he says it’s not done and he’s going to Munich to see Ursula von der Leyen (European Commission president) and we’ll see what comes out of that.

A number 10 spokeswoman said the British Prime Minister was meeting Northern Ireland parties as part of the “engagement process”.
She added: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.”
The UK Foreign Office also confirmed Cleverly’s Brussels meeting with Sefcovic, saying it was part of “ongoing engagement and constructive dialogue with the EU to find practical solutions that work for the people of Northern Ireland”.
Cleverly said his meeting with Sefcovic was “constructive”.
“We discussed the work ongoing between UK and EU to find a solution on the NI Protocol. Intensive work continues,” he tweeted.
Sefcovic also called the meeting “constructive” and said there had been “good progress”.
“The shared objective clear: joint solutions, responding to the everyday concerns of people in NI. Hard work continues,” he tweeted.

‘Fundamental’
Senior figures within the DUP and the European Research Group of the Tory party have warned that any deal must remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Northern Ireland as well as dealing with trading difficulties.
While it is understood the EU and the UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to end the application of EU law in the region.
The EU says a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in the region.
Deputy chairman of the ERG David Jones tweeted yesterday: “The Protocol won’t be fixed by displaying green and red signs and pretending the ECJ hasn’t got supreme jurisdiction in Northern Ireland when it manifestly has.
“NI must cease to be subject to laws made in Brussels. It’s as simple as that. Anything less won’t work.”
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said it was “fundamental” that Northern Ireland was not separated legally from the rest of the UK.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, and asked if there is a system they would accept that involves oversight from the European Court of Justice, Wilson said:
Asked if that is what he is calling for, he said: “It would ensure that Brexit actually applied to Northern Ireland, it would ensure that the UK Government had sovereignty over this part of the United Kingdom and that Northern Ireland was not separated legally from the rest of the United Kingdom as a result of the protocol.
“That’s fundamental. Indeed, that is not something that we have been asking for alone, the Government itself in its command paper last autumn, and in the Protocol Bill which is now stalled in the House of Lords, was demanding that as well and saying that if the EU did not come to that point in negotiations, that they would act unilaterally to ensure that that happened.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dunkirk-port-ireland-5936261-Dec2022/,"THE PORT OF Dunkirk is looking to mount a significant expansion of trade routes with its Irish counterparts, as the French company sees Ireland as an “underestimated” market even post-Brexit.
In an interview withThe Journal, its deputy chief executive said it was eyeing stronger links with Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, while also creating new routes for the first time with ports in Cork and Waterford.
Representatives from the port, based in northern France, were in Dublin this week with a range of companies in logistics, transport, pharmaceutical and agri-food to discuss trade links with Ireland.
Britain’s departure from the EU had the effect of removing the land-bridge often used by hauliers traveling to and from Ireland, leaving eastern ports to step in and take on the extra traffic to the EU.
This is best represented in Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford which says it has seen European freight passing through its doors increase by a staggering 370% compared to 2019.
In contrast, trade through the UK is now around 20% lower compared to 2019.
“The decision to have a direct service between Ireland and Dunkirk has been pushed by Brexit for sure,” Daniel Deschodt, deputy chief executive of the Port of Dunkirk toldThe Journal, adding that the port had been examining the viability of increased services for some time.

“I think that we all – all the actors – underestimated the market, the volume of cargo, leaving Ireland going to continental Europe and vice versa.”
Deschodt said the port’s “strategy” is to trial pilot routes for a number of Irish ports. This could involve transship or ‘lo-lo’ cargo – where containers are transported by crane – or ‘ro-ro’, which involves good being rolled on and rolled off vessels.
“We’d love transship cargo containers in Dunkirk to Dublin as as we do today, but we’d like to go to Cork, we’d like to go to Waterford, we’d like to cover Ireland either by ro-ro -  the aim for Rosslare – or by lo-lo which is the case for Dublin, with some space to grow for Dublin and for other ports.”
He said they are “working actively” at adding routes, with negotiations taking place alongside market studies to examine the viability of each new service.
Deschodt said they have been pitching Dunkirk as “one of the best places to to land” for companies to distribute to Northern Europe, due to a strong road network connecting with the port.
Glenn Carr, the director of commercial business units at Irish Rail and head of Rosslare Europort, toldThe Journalthat there is “no denying the switch we’ve seen in the supply chain” which has allowed Ireland to become France’s “nearest EU neighbour” to its west.
“There are opportunities for further growth but that might be in other areas like lift on-lift off (lo-lo),” he said.
A Rosslare-Dunkirk route was launched almost two years ago, operated by leading Danish ferry company DFDS, but launched a trial for earlier this year for holidaymakers in Ireland and in northern Europe for passenger services.
Carr said he foresees this becoming more established from next summer with the addition of new vessels by operators catering specifically for tourists, to include restaurants and private cabins on board.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tobias-ellwood-rejoin-eu-uk-criticism-5781932-Jun2022/,"A FORMER TORY minister has come under fire for suggesting the UK should rejoin the EU single market to ease the cost-of-living crisis.
Tobias Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, argued there is an “appetite” to make “course corrections” to the current model, claiming recent polling suggests “this is not the Brexit most people imagined”.
The chairman of the Commons Defence Committee said “more radical thinking is required if we are to energise our economy through these stormy waters”.
“If an Army general, mid-battle, is mature enough to finesse his strategy to secure mission success, then Government should do the same,” he added.
He said Brexit in its current form had sparked a number of challenges, including shrinking exports to Europe and issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, and that these and other problems would “disappear” if the UK chose to rejoin the single market.
But he was met with forceful rebuttals from Tory colleagues, including Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat, who said: “Let’s plan for the future and stop looking back. This decision is made.”
Former chief whip Mark Harper said: “The UK voted to leave the EU. That meant leaving the single market and putting an end to freedom of movement. The end.”

Treasury minister Simon Clarke said he was “pleased to reassure Mr Ellwood” that the UK would not be rejoining the single market, as this would “extinguish half the freedoms that make Brexit so important”.
Former Brexit minister Lord Frost appeared to suggest that Mr Ellwood – who has publicly said Prime Minister Boris Johnson no longer has his support – would not be suited to the top job, saying: “Brexit really is not safe in his hands or his allies’.”
Writing in The House magazine, Mr Ellwood conceded his suggestion “would require acceptance of some EU regulations”, but argued “one common standard” may be better than two for UK industry.
He also acknowledged there are “understandable reservations” about the free movement of people in relation to benefit claims which “would need addressing”, but claimed this is “not insurmountable”.
“Let’s not forget, both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher endorsed this model, with the view that the potential economic benefits outweigh the drawbacks,” he wrote.
“If joining the single market (with conditions) results in strengthening our economy, easing the cost-of-living crisis, settling the Irish problem at a stroke and promoting our European credentials as we take an ever greater lead in Ukraine, would it not be churlish to face this reality?”
Speaking to Times Radio on Thursday, Mr Ellwood described the issue as a “hot potato”, but said people should not “shy away” from the subject.
“Joining that single market, I believe, would strengthen our economy because it would remove so much red tape, it would ease the cost-of-living crisis, it would actually settle the difficult Irish problem on the Northern Ireland Protocol… and finally, it’s also to do with boosting our European credentials,” he said.
“Because we are now taking a lead in Europe on Ukraine, but the fact that this Brexit issue – particularly on Northern Ireland – is unresolved means, you know, we’re pulled back on this.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-budget-sunak-stormont-5585213-Oct2021/,"RISHI SUNAK HAS announced the Stormont Executive will receive an extra £1.6 billion annually as part of the UK budget.
The British chancellor of the exchequer also promised that flights between airports in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales will be subject to a new lower rate of Air Passenger Duty from April 2023.
The Conservative Party MP also promised that the devolved administrations will be given the “largest block grants” since 1998, with an increase to Scottish Government funding in each year by an average of £4.6 billion, £2.5 billion for the Welsh Government, and £1.6 billion for the Stormont Executive.
The chancellor opened his budget statement promising the “stronger economy of the future”.
He said the UK Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had forecast a faster bounce back, with growth expected to be 6.5% this year rather than the 4% previously expected.
But he acknowledged rising inflation, blaming it on the global reopening of economies following the pandemic, and promised further action to address strained supply chains.
The chancellor said, “Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising.
“Today’s Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people — stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.
“Stronger public finances, with our debt under control. Stronger employment, with fewer people out of work and more people in work. Growth up, jobs up, and debt down. Let there be no doubt – our plan is working.”
But he said inflation in September was 3.1% “and is likely to rise further” – the OBR expects CPI to average 4% over the next year.
Scarring effect
Sunak promised “help for working families with the cost of living”.

The UK budget watchdog said the economy was expected to return to its pre-Covid level at the turn of the year and scaled down its assumption of the long-term scarring effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.
It is now forecasting lower UK growth in 2022 than previously expected – down from 7.3% to 6% – partly because of the stronger performance in 2021, while in 2023 it is expected to be 2.1%, in 2024 1.3% and 1.6% in 2025.
Government borrowing will also be lower than previously forecast, falling from 7.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) – a measure of the size of the economy – to 3.3% next year, then 2.4%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.5% in the following years.
The better-than-expected public finances allowed Sunak to make a series of major promises on public spending.
“Today’s Budget increases total departmental spending over this parliament by £150 billion,” he said. “That’s the largest increase this century, with spending growing by 3.8% a year in real terms.”
It would mean a real-terms rise in spending in every single government department, he told MPs.
Business rate cuts
The chancellor announced £7 billion in business rate cuts, with the cancellation of next year’s planned increases and a 50% discount on business rates for a year for a series of retail and hospitality venues.
A wider reform of business rates will make the system “fairer and timelier” with revaluations carried out more frequently, every three years.
Other reforms to corporate taxes included slashing the levy on bank profits and extending a corporation tax break on investment.
Sunak also promised a new, lower rate of air passenger duty on domestic flights within the UK.
The chancellor also announced a series of reforms to alcohol taxes from February 2023 – including a 5% cut in duty on draught products to help support pubs.
“That’s the biggest cut to cider duty since 1923. The biggest cut to fruit ciders in a generation. The biggest cut to beer duty for 50 years,” he said. “It’s a long-term investment in British pubs of £100m a year. And a permanent cut in the cost of a pint by 3p.”

Ryanair said: “As indicated at our interim results, and following subsequent shareholder engagement, Ryanair has decided to request the cancellation of London listing as the volume of trading of the shares on the London Stock Exchange does not justify the costs related to such listing and admission to trading, and so as to consolidate trading liquidity to one regulated market for the benefit of all shareholders.”

The company had previously floated the idea of a delisting earlier this month and said Brexit played a significant factor in the decision.
At its results in early November, the firm said: “The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens purchasing Ryanair’s ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals following Brexit.”
Back in September the airline started the process of selling off around one million shares bought by non-EU nationals since 1 January – mainly British investors – due to company rules and Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-government-grace-period-agrifoods-northern-ireland-5371013-Mar2021/,"LAST UPDATE|3 Mar 2021
IRELAND AND THE EU have both strongly criticised the UK’s decision to unilaterally extend a grace period that was given to supermarkets in Great Britain exporting agri-foods to Northern Ireland.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he was “disappointed” by the decision while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that it “clearly undermines” previous commitments given last week.
Under the trade agreement the UK and EU struck on Christmas Eve, decisions around the Northern Ireland Protocol must be taken jointly between both sides.
But the UK has said today that it will extend the grace period due to expire on 1 April, until 1 October this year – a six-month extension.
In a statement this evening, the Taoiseach said:
“We have worked continuously in support of efforts to find sensible means of implementing the Protocol that respond to challenges identified. We will continue to do so, but unilateral action undermines the trust necessary to reach agreement.”
“I call on the British Government to engage urgently with the European Commission, and to work towards agreed outcomes.”
Coveney similarly criticised the unilateral decision, saying that such an approach “is deeply unhelpful to building the relationship of trust and partnership”.
Coveney has also told the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and the new Cabinet minister responsible for EU-UK relations David Frost of his “regret that the UK had moved in a unilateral way”.
He said that the British Government’s decision “clearly undermines” made in joint statements issued on 11 and 24 February.

“This includes in respect to modest extensions to grace periods being agreed between the UK and the EU in a spirit of partnership.”
European Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovičtweetedthat he would be speaking to Frost tonight to raise the EU’s “strong concerns” about the UK’s decision.
In a statement ahead of that phonecall, Šefčovič said that the UK’s unliteral actions would “breach international law”.
“This amounts to a violation of the relevant substantive provisions of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland and the good faith obligation under the Withdrawal Agreement. This is the second time that the UK government is set to breach international law,” he said.
What the grace period means
Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, health export certificates are required for agri-foods being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
But out of concern that this additional paperwork and checks would hamper the North’s food supplies,a grace period was givento major supermarkets in order to keep shelves stocked.
On 3 February, the UK formally requested that the European Commission extend this grace period, which would waive new checks and required paperwork for agri-foods, along with a number of other sectors, until 1 January 2023.
But today, it announced that it was unilaterally making the decision to extend it for six months.
The UK statement
A UK government spokesperson for Northern Irelandsaidtoday: “For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October. Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme.
“In addition, further guidance will be provided later this week on parcel movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to provide necessary additional time for traders beyond 1 April. Guidance will also be set out to help address practical problems on soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.”

The issue of GB-to-NI parcel deliveries was one of the other issues that the British government had requested an extension of grace periods over, along with the extending the six-month grace period of the ban on chilled meats.
A request to extend the adjustment period for medicines to be sent from GB to Northern Ireland was also made.
As it stands, here is the plan for more Brexit checks that the UK still need to introduce:

Political reaction
In addition to his claim that the UK’s move was a breach of international law, Šefčovič said that it risked the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.
“The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is the only way to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland,” he said.
In Ireland, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonaldsaidthat today’s “solo run from the British government was completely unnecessary, totally undermines the work of the Joint Committee and puts it on an immediate collision course with the EU.”
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmondsaid: “There will be very serious concerns about this, not with the ends but the means. Given the Brexit [trade agreement] still isn’t ratified, how will this build trust and allow for a positive reset of relations?”

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-visits-northern-ireland-common-sense-5435100-May2021/,"BREXIT MINISTER DAVID Frost has urged the EU to take a “common sense, risk-based approach” to the Northern Ireland Protocol following a visit to the region.
He said the UK and the EU must find a solution “rapidly” after he and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis met business and community representatives in Northern Ireland during the two-day visit.
The Protocol, which was a red-line issue that forms part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, and aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, has Northern Ireland following a range of EU customs and regulatory rules.
The UK and EU are at loggerheads on efforts to reduce some of the bureaucracy the arrangements have created on the movement of goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland so that day-to-day life in Northern Ireland is minimally disrupted.

David Frost and Lewis have said the EU needs to take a pragmatic approach to the protocol if key elements are to be sustainable, according to Downing Street.
Following the visit, Frost said in a statement: “It’s clear from my visit that the Protocol is presenting significant challenges for many in Northern Ireland.
“Businesses have gone to extraordinary efforts to make the current requirements work, but it is hard to see that the way the Protocol is currently operating can be sustainable for long.
“We’re committed to working through the issues with the EU urgently and in good faith.
He said “solutions must be found rapidly” to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to “minimise disruption” to the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland.
Frost added: “As the Prime Minister has made clear, we will continue to consider all our options in meeting our overriding responsibility for sustaining the peace and prosperity of everyone in Northern Ireland.”

In his first official visit to Northern Ireland, Frost met business bosses from several sectors, including aerospace and manufacturing, to understand how they are adapting to the new arrangements.
He and Lewis also visited Larne Port, where they met Border Force and Daera (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) officials, as well as EU Commission staff present under the protocol arrangements.
Lewis added: “It is vital that the experiences, opportunities and challenges faced by people in Northern Ireland are understood and at the heart of our approach.
“I will continue these constructive and practical discussions in the weeks ahead, supporting Northern Ireland’s business needs and minimising the risk of disruptions at a crucial time.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/factors-of-northern-ireland-disorder-5403451-Apr2021/,"THE STREET DISORDER that has flared in various parts of Northern Ireland for more than a week can be attributed to a multitude of factors.
At its heart is loyalist anger at post-Brexit trading arrangements that have created economic barriers between the region and the rest of the UK.
For loyalism, Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol has undermined their place in the Union.
But it took an event unrelated to the Irish Sea border furore to set a match to resentment that has been simmering since the consequences of exiting the EU became a reality at the start of January.
The announcement by prosecutors last week that no action would be taken against 24 Sinn Fein politicians, including deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, for attending a huge republican funeral during the pandemic sparked outrage among some loyalists.
In several loyalist working-class areas, many still in the grip of the malign influence of paramilitary gangs, sporadic rioting has since flared.
Belfast, Derry, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Ballymena have all witnessed scenes of violence that many hoped had been consigned to the history books.
There have also been bouts of disorder within republican areas in recent days. In the most stark, youths on both sides of a west Belfast peace line pelted petrol bombs and other missiles at each other through last night.

For loyalists, the funeral of former IRA leader Bobby Storey last June hardened a long-standing perception held by many within their community that the institutions of the state afford preferential treatment to republicans.
For apparent confirmation, they pointed to police engagement with the Sinn Fein funeral organisers prior to an event that saw around 2,000 people take to the streets of west Belfast when tight limits on public gatherings were in place.
This interaction with the planners was one reason why senior prosecutors concluded any prosecution of O’Neill and her colleagues was doomed to fail – the other being the “incoherent” nature of Stormont’s Covid-19 regulations at the time.

Criticism of the PSNI approach was not confined to hard-line elements within loyalism and all the main unionist parties subsequently called for chief constable Simon Byrne to resign, claiming he has lost the confidence of their community.
DUP First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will no longer engage with Byrne.
Her lack of communication with the region’s police chief during a time of escalating street violence, and coming only weeks after she met with representatives of loyalist paramilitaries to discuss the Brexit fall out, has drawn sharp criticism from political rivals.
Non-unionist parties have accused Foster and other unionist political leaders of stoking up tensions, not only in relation to the Storey funeral but also in respect of the Irish Sea border.
The DUP leader and other prominent voices within unionism and loyalism insist they are only reflecting genuinely held concerns they say must be addressed – specifically by way of Byrne’s resignation and the binning of the Protocol.
Amid the current unionist clamour for Byrne’s head, and claims of “two tier” policing, it is worth noting that two months ago the PSNI chief constable was facing similar claims of discriminatory behaviour from within nationalism.

Those were prompted by a controversial police operation in Belfast that saw a man badly injured in a loyalist gun massacre during the Troubles arrested at the scene of a commemoration event after officers intervened to probe suspected Covid regulation breaches.

Following that incident at the site of the 1992 Ormeau Road betting shop murders, Ms O’Neill claimed there was a “crisis in confidence” in the PSNI among nationalists, albeit she stopped short of calling for Mr Byrne to quit.
The Protocol and funeral controversy have not created the loyalist perception that the system is weighed against them, but have built upon a narrative articulated by an increasing number within loyalism that the peace process – particularly the Good Friday accord of 1998 – has handed them a raw deal.
They cite underinvestment and deprivation in loyalist working class areas as further proof that they have missed out on the gains of peace.
Nationalists and republicans reject this premise, insisting their communities have experienced just has many problems with poverty and unemployment since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.
Paramilitary elements are undoubtedly involved in much of the disorder witnessed across the region in recent days – either directly or by orchestrating young people to riot on their behalf.
However, in Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus an added factor is at play.
In those areas, the PSNI believes paramilitary involvement is less motivated by Brexit or the Storey funeral and more to do with a rogue faction – the South East Antrim UDA – reacting to recent police operations targeting its criminal empire.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-protocol-working-martin-5709211-Mar2022/,"MICHEÁL MARTIN has said there is an increasing view within Northern Ireland that the Brexit protocol is working.
The Taoiseach said everyone he has met in Northern Ireland wants continued access to the EU single market.
His comments come after Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson said on Friday he will not go back into the Stormont Executive until the matter of the protocol is dealt with.
Martin was asked what the Irish government’s communication channels were like with the DUP and how likely it is that the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol will be resolved by the time of the elections.

Speaking to reporters at the Embassy of Ireland in London, Martin said the Irish government has good channels of communication with all parties in Northern Ireland.
He said: “What’s very interesting from our perspective though is that what’s increasing and growing is a view within Northern Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland business and industry, that the protocol is working in terms of inward investment into Northern Ireland, and in terms of access to the EU single market.
“So anybody I’ve met in Northern Ireland all want to continue access to the EU single market. It’s a good basic principle to start off on. And my view, given the improved relationship between the UK and the EU as a result of the partnership on Ukraine, I would like to think that in the fullness of time we will be able to resolve this issue.
“But we’ll take it step by step. And there’s a channel there between the European Union and the United Kingdom that’s ongoing and we’re going to take this step by step.”
Donaldson was applauded at Crossgar Orange Hall on Friday night as he said his party would not re-enter the Stormont Executive until the Government acts to “protect Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom”.
Paul Givan resigned as first minister earlier this year as part of the DUP’s action against the protocol in a move which also removed deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill from the joint office.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-3-5352565-Feb2021/,"UK AND EU leaders have reiterated their “full commitment” to the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol following talks in London last night.
A joint statement from UK Cabinet Office Minister Gove and and EU Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said the pair had a “frank but constructive discussion” in which they agreed to “spare no effort” in implementing solutions.
The two politicians agreed to convene the joint committee tasked with implementation of the protocol no later than 24 February to provide “the necessary political steer”.
The protocol requires regulatory and customs checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but it has caused disruption to trade since it came into force on 1 January, with various grace periods in operation.
Unionists in Northern Ireland are deeply concerned about the arrangements, insisting they have driven an economic wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
They have called on the UK to trigger a mechanism within the protocol – Article 16 – which enables the government to unilaterally suspend aspects it deems are causing economic, societal or environmental problems.
The statement said the two sides had agreed to find “workable solutions on the ground” and are set to further engage with business groups in Northern Ireland.
Both Gove and Sefcovic also reiterated their “full commitment” to the Good Friday Agreement, and impacting as “little as possible” on those living in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, according to the joint statement.
Following the meeting, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney described it as a “good day’s work” and said the focus was now on cooperation between the EU and UK to implement the Protocol.

It comes after Stormont’s First Minister Arlene Foster said that more rigorous implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol is “not going to work”.
The DUP leader, who is campaigning to scrap the post-Brexit trade agreement, said Northern Ireland should not be used as a political football.
Unionist demands for Article 16 have intensified since the EU briefly triggered the mechanism itself, though swiftly backtracked on the move, amid its efforts to restrict the export of Covid vaccines out of the bloc.
Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said both sides “need to dial down the rhetoric” on the protocol and said there were bound to be teething issues.
Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland, he said people needed to bear in mind that it is only about six weeks since the Brexit deal was agreed.
Last week, Gove wrote to Sefcovic asking for an extension of a series of grace periods that are currently in operation that limit the level of bureaucracy associated with the protocol.
The government wants to extend these grace periods, some of which are due to expire at the end of March, to January 2023 in order to provide space to find permanent solutions.
In reply, Sefcovic said there is an urgent need to “fully and faithfully” implement the protocol as a prerequisite before the UK’s requests for further facilitations are “necessary and justified”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/liz-truss-protocol-northern-ireland-5766198-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|17 May 2022
THE EU HAS said it “will need to respond with all measures at its disposal” if Britain goes ahead with  unilateral changes to the part of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland.
The announcement, made by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, “raises significant concerns,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said in a statement.
“The (Northern Ireland) Protocol is an international agreement signed by the EU and the UK. Unilateral actions contradicting an international agreement are not acceptable,” he said.
This afternoon, Liz Truss revealed plans to introduce legislation to alter the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Truss made the announcement before MPs at the House of Commons just after 12.30pm.
Addressing parliament, she said: “I am announcing our intention to introduce legislation to make changes to the Protocol.”
Truss said that a deal with the EU is still on the table and a more favourable outcome than introducing the new legislation.
The Foreign Secretary said that she will invite EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to talks over the Protocol.
Responding this afternoon, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the British move was a “damaging” one.
“I deeply regret the decision of the British government to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that will unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.
“Such unilateral action in respect of an internationally binding agreement is damaging to trust and will serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the Protocol is being implemented,” he said.
In the House of Commons this afternoon, Truss said the Good Friday Agreement is “under strain”, adding: “Regrettably, the Northern Ireland Executive has not been fully functioning since early February.
“This is because the Northern Ireland Protocol does not have the support necessary in one part of the community in Northern Ireland. I would also note that all of Northern Ireland’s political parties agree on the need for changes to the Protocol.
“This is not about scrapping the Protocol.”
Truss said the practical problems include producers facing “onerous” restrictions due to sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions, adding in the Commons: “These practical problems have contributed to the sense that the east-west relationship has been undermined.
“Without resolving these and other issues we will not be able to re-establish the executive and preserve the hard-won progress sustained by the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement. We need to restore the balance in the agreement.”
Truss said the UK’s preference is to “reach a negotiated outcome” with the EU.
She added that the proposed bill “is consistent with our obligations in international law”.
She told the Commons: “To respond to the very grave and serious situation in Northern Ireland, we are clear there is a necessity to act to ensure the institutions can be restored as soon as possible.

“Before any changes are made, we will consult businesses and people in Northern Ireland.”
Truss has claimed the Bill will put in place the “necessary measures to lessen the burden on east-west trade” and will “ensure the people of Northern Ireland are able to access the same benefits as the people of Great Britain”.
She went on: “The Bill will ensure that goods moving and staying within the UK are freed of unnecessary bureaucracy through our new green channel. This respects Northern Ireland’s place in the UK in its customs territory and protects the UK internal market.
“At the same time, it ensures that goods destined for the EU undergo the full checks and controls applied under EU law. This will be underpinned by data-sharing arrangements that I have already set out.
“It will allow both east-west trade and the EU single market to be protected whilst removing customs paperwork for goods remaining in the United Kingdom.
“The Bill will remove regulatory barriers to goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland. Businesses will be able to choose between meeting UK or EU standards in a new dual regulatory regime.”
The row over the protocol has affected the formation of a new executive in Stormont, as the Democratic Unionist Party has refused to join a new administration unless its concerns over the arrangements are addressed.
A majority of Stormont MLAs represent parties that support the protocol.

Reaction
Future UK trade deals could be damaged by any threats to interfere with Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade arrangements, the British Labour Party has said.
Its shadow Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said: “Britain should be a country that keeps its word.
“The rest of the world is looking at us and wondering if we are a country that they want to do business with.
“There are wide-ranging and damaging repercussions undermining our ability to hold others to account for their own commitments, when we should, for example, be pulling together in support of Ukraine, not fuelling divisions with our European allies.”
He later asked: “Will they set out clearly to the House why this doesn’t break international law?”
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told the Commons: “The statement today is a welcome if overdue step that is a significant move towards addressing the problems created by the protocol and getting power-sharing based upon a cross-community consensus up and running again.
“Therefore, we hope to see progress on a bill in order to deal with these matters in days and weeks, not months. As the legislation progresses we will take a graduated and cautious approach.
“We want to see the Irish Sea border removed and the Government honouring its commitment in the New Decade, New Approach agreement to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. The statement today indicates this will be covered in the legislation.”
He reiterated that he wants to see the political institutions “possibly functioning as soon as possible”, but said “to restore unionist confidence decisive action is now needed in the form of legislation to repair the harm done by the protocol”.
He called for “sensible arrangements” and said: “The words today are a good start. But the Foreign Secretary will know that it is actions that speak louder than words. I welcome her commitment to such decisive action in this statement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/paris-london-stock-exchange-brexit-5919971-Nov2022/,"BREXIT HAS “PERMANENTLY damaged” the UK economy, former Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders warned as London was deposed as Europe’s biggest stock market.
The French stock market now has a combined value of 2.823 trillion US dollars, marginally above the UK stock market which is worth 2.821 trillion US dollars altogether, according to figures from Bloomberg.
In 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum, British stocks were collectively worth 1.5 trillion US dollars more than those listed in Paris.
As well as shifting consumer patterns, the market capitalisation calculations also reflect currency movements, with the pound dropping 13% in value against the US dollar this year while the euro has fallen by a milder 9.2% against the American currency.
Meanwhile, the success of the UK’s independent trade policy – one of the key reasons for leaving the European Union for many Brexit-supporters – was also questioned by Tory former Cabinet minister George Eustice, who said an agreement reached with Australia was not “a very good deal” for the UK.
The economic impact of the decision to leave the EU was blamed by Saunders for the scale of the tax rises and spending cuts that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to unveil on Thursday.
Saunders, a former external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, told Bloomberg TV there had been a “chaotic period” since the 2016 referendum.
“The UK economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit,” he said.

“It has reduced the economy’s potential output significantly, eroded business investment.
“If we hadn’t had Brexit, we probably wouldn’t be talking about an austerity budget this week – the need for tax rises, spending cuts wouldn’t be there, if Brexit hadn’t reduced the economy’s potential output so much.”
In the Commons, former environment secretary George Eustice – who campaigned for Brexit – criticised key elements of the flagship trade deal with Australia, the first to be negotiated from scratch by the UK outside the EU, and a similar arrangement with New Zealand.
“The truth of the matter is that the UK gave away far too much for far too little in return,” Eustice told MPs.
“We did not actually need to give Australia nor New Zealand full liberalisation in beef and sheep. It was not in our economic interest to do so – and neither Australia nor New Zealand had anything to offer in return for such a grand concession.”
A benefit of Brexit is the ability to diverge from standards set in Brussels, with rules set in the UK instead, but the shift to the new UKCA product safety marking system has been delayed for a further two years, with goods carrying the European CE symbol continuing to be recognised until the end of 2024.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: “This move will give businesses the breathing space and flexibility they need at this crucial time and ensure that our future system for product safety marking is fit for purpose, providing the highest standard for consumers without harming businesses.”
Whilst the UKCA marking can be used now this extension means businesses can choose to use the CE marking until 31 December 2024.
The shift to UKCA had originally been planned for January 2022.
The government said it did not want to burden businesses given the difficult economic conditions created by post-pandemic shifts in demand and supply, the war in Ukraine and the associated high energy prices.","8.00am, 15 Nov 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/an-post-blames-uk-parcel-issue-5944711-Dec2022/,"AN POST’S CHIEF executive has stated that parcels arriving to Ireland from the UK are being sent back due to the UK’s post office system not following Brexit-related customs measures.
David McRedmond toldRTÉ Radio’s Morning Irelandtoday that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the most impacted by local post offices in the UK not enforcing EU-mandated codes for the sorting of parcels.
When these parcels arrive to An Post facilities here, they need to be send back, he explained.
“The cost of us implementing the customs is anywhere of up to €20 million. So it’s been extremely expensive for An Post. It’s difficult for us to calculate the exact cost for British SMEs because we don’t know the value of all the packages. But we’d estimate somewhere between €150 million and €200 million in one year is lost.”
“There could be a shoemaker in Carlisle, who goes into Carlisle post office and there’s a few customers in Ireland, and the post office in the UK isn’t telling them you’ve got to put in these codes,” McRedmond said.
“So we’ve been going blue in the face,” he added.
Advertisement
McRedmond had a letter published in the British newspaper the Financial Times yesterday, in which he said the disruption had caused a 52% decline in postal trade between Britain and Ireland in one year.
Ireland became the first country to implement post-Brexit postal regulations for the UK, with the other 26 EU countries adopting the system from January.
“The EU customs rules are mandatory across the EU so the disruption with Ireland will be repeated with every other EU country, if the necessary actions are not taken,” said McRedmond.
He also blamed the lack of coordination on a “dysfunctional relationship” between the UK’s Royal Mail and the state-run Post Office.
“I think if Royal Mail owned the Post Office, I think that the post offices would have the systems in place. There doesn’t seem to be any incentive for the post office to put the systems in place.”
“I’m just hoping that the British government can see sense,  that if they want SMEs to be able to trade with the EU you’ve got a new a new regime, deal with it and put the systems in place,” McRedmond said.
Irish people in the UK sending packages hope for Christmas won’t be affected however, as the issue relates to businesses trading through the Post Office in the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/frost-sets-december-deadline-protocol-agreement-5583856-Oct2021/,"A DECEMBER DEADLINE has been set for the UK and the European Union to find a solution on the Northern Ireland Protocol, according to David Frost.
The Brexit minister said both sides wanted the dispute over the post-Brexit terms “settled one way or the other” before the winter as he admitted there were still “significant” gaps between them on reaching an agreement.
Frost also reiterated, when giving evidence to MPs earlier today, that the UK would not accept a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as an arbitrator of the protocol.
Asked how long Britain was prepared to carry on talks with the European Commission before invoking Article 16 of the protocol, a move that would effectively unilaterally suspend the treaty, the Conservative peer signalled that the UK Government and Brussels wanted the issue resolved by December.
Frost told the European Scrutiny Committee: “We have always been clear we don’t want this situation to run on for a very long time and, to be fair to the commission, they have said that as well.
“We all see this as an issue for this autumn, to be settled one way or the other.”
The comments come as the EU and the UK prepare for another round of negotiations in London on Tuesday with the aim of finding a solution to the protocol, following similar conversations in Brussels last week.
During his appearance before the Commons committee, Cabinet minister Frost was adamant that the UK would not be willing in those talks to concede on allowing a role for European judges in any overhaul of the current terms.

He said he wanted to ensure the future relationship between the UK and EU was “not ultimately policed by EU institutions including the courts of justice”, adding that Britain was not interested in any arrangements which kept the court by some other name.
Reform measures put on the table by the EU would see an 80% reduction in checks envisaged for retail agri-food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain, with customs paperwork slashed by half.
The proposed changes also remove the prospect of certain British produce, including Cumberland sausages, being banned from export to the region.
The EU has also offered to legislate to ensure no disruption to the supply line of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, in a move Frost said was welcomed.
However, the measures put forward by the bloc do not offer any concession on a key UK Government demand, the removal of the oversight role for the ECJ, which Frost has made clear is a red line in the negotiations.
Frost, while praising some elements of the EU plan, said some of the ideas put forward were “problematic”.
“The problem with them is that they don’t go far enough,” he told MPs.
“I’m not sure they would quite deliver the kind of ambitious freeing up of trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland that we want to see, but what we’re trying to test is whether they could find the basis to go further than what they have put on the table.
“That’s the kind of discussions we have been having and it has been quite constructive so far, but the gaps between us remain significant.”
Despite the differences, Frost stressed that it would be “much better for stability, prosperity and certainty” in Northern Ireland if an accord could be struck before the winter deadline.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-negotiations-with-europe-britain-5755315-May2022/,"A MOVE AGAINST the Northern Ireland Protocol is unlikely to feature in the Queen’s Speech, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has intimated.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has urged the Government to act on unionists’ concerns around the post-Brexit trading arrangements, criticising them as harmful to the union and calling for Northern Ireland’s position in the UK internal market to be protected.
However this evening Lewis said the Government wants to resolve issues with the protocol by agreement with the European Union.
Asked if the Government is planning to introduce a new law allowing it to waive elements of the protocol, Lewis signalled that it would not be in the Queen’s Speech.
He told an interview with ITV’s Robert Peston: “Our focus is on resolving the issues with the protocol, ideally we want to do that by agreement with the European Union. The challenge we’ve got at the moment…”
Pressed on whether an announcement would come next week, he said: “No, Robert, we’ve not said that.”
Lewis said: “What we’ve been clear about is at the moment, the protocol is causing problems in civic society, it’s causing problems with the Good Friday Agreement.
“Our duty to the people of Northern Ireland is to resolve those issues. Yes, we want to do that with the EU and that’s what Liz Truss has been focused on.”
Lewis later tweeted: “We will do whatever it takes to protect the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It is clear that the Protocol does not have the support of the unionist community and is not working for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.

“We have to address the outstanding issues and we want to do that by agreement with the EU, but as we have always made clear, we will not shy away from taking further steps if necessary.”
The DUP withdrew First Minister Paul Givan from the Stormont Executive in February in protest at the protocol, a move which left the institutions unable to fully function.
Donaldson has made his call for action against the protocol a key part of his party’s campaign for the Stormont Assembly election which takes place on Thursday.
He said his party will not enter a future Executive unless the government takes action on the protocol.
He has addressed a series of rallies which have taken place across Northern Ireland in recent months against the protocol which is regarded by unionists as a border in the Irish Sea.
Donaldson tweeted a message to voters on Wednesday evening to use their vote to “send a clear message – the Protocol must go”.
“The NI Protocol has created a border in the Irish Sea & represents an existential threat to future of Northern Ireland’s place within the Union. The longer the Protocol remains, the more it harms the Union itself,” he tweeted.
“The Government knows that the Protocol does not enjoy the support of Unionists and Brussels can be in no doubt that the Protocol has cast its long shadow over Northern Ireland’s political arrangements and harming our economy.
“Now is the moment to send a clear signal that the Irish Sea border must go and the Protocol must be replaced by arrangements that restore Northern Ireland’s place fully within the U.K. Internal Market.”
TUV leader Jim Allister said if the government is “resiling (again) from action against the protocol”, then, unionists “must use the election to send the strongest rejection of the iniquitous protocol by voting TUV – No Sea Border”.
He described his party as the “voice of unrelenting opposition to the protocol”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-meeting-northern-ireland-political-leaders-5537745-Sep2021/,"TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR is meeting political leaders and business representatives in Northern Ireland for talks which are expected to be dominated by post-Brexit arrangements and Covid recovery.
Varadkar is meeting Sinn Féin Finance Minister Conor Murphy this evening ahead of talks with DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson tomorrow.
But Donaldson has said in advance that the meeting will be “meaningless” unless Varadkar adopts a new approach on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The protocol, part of the Brexit divorce deal agreed by the UK and Brussels, effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
This means checks on goods being sent from Great Britain into the single market and in some cases could result in prohibitions on certain products that do not comply with EU rules.
The protocol was put in place to ensure there would be no hard border with Ireland, but it has instead effectively placed a trade barrier in the Irish Sea and is deeply unpopular with unionists who have insisted it should be removed.

Donaldson said: “A fresh visit from Leo Varadkar to Northern Ireland will be meaningless unless he comes with a fresh approach.
“He has championed a protocol which fundamentally undermines the Belfast Agreement and he has dismissed economic and constitutional concerns with patronising comments about the colour of our post boxes.
“It was Leo Varadkar as the then Taoiseach who insisted on such arrangements with fellow EU leaders. If the Irish Sea border remains, then Mr Varadkar will return as Taoiseach with a legacy of relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic fundamentally undermined and political progress in Northern Ireland reversed.”
The DUP leader added: “Mr Varadkar faces a choice. He can continue with the rhetoric of recent years and watch those events unfold or he can adopt a new spirit of positive co-operation.
“Arrangements which respect both the EU single market and Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market are not just achievable but would deliver on the promise of protecting the Belfast Agreement.”
Murphy is representing Sinn Féin at the meeting with Varadkar after deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill contracted Covid-19.
He said: “I welcome the opportunity to meet the Tánaiste. I am sure issues like the all-Ireland response to Covid will be on the agenda.
“I have no doubt issues around the European Union and the British government’s negotiations on leaving the EU and the protocol will also be up for discussion.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-australia-uk-ireland-5822933-Jul2022/,"IRELAND CANNOT BE a bargaining chip in the British Government’s Brexit “power play” or in its negotiating stance with Brussels, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said.
Speaking yesterday during her trip to Australia, McDonald described the outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s interactions with Ireland as “wholly negative” and his stance as “really dangerous”.
McDonald said Johnson had been involved in “the deliberate and reckless intent to break international law” in regards to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.
Speaking toThe Journallast night at a dinner event hosted by the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Trinity College alumni, she said: “I would like to see a new British prime minister actually adopt practices of operating in good faith. It’s the only way forward.”
When asked who she would want to see take up the position in September – Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss – McDonald laughed and dismissed the question.
“That’s a matter for the Tory grassroots and I could assure you they’re not looking for my advice on that subject.”
“We need to a change of direction,” she added. “The Tory party and whomever is in Number 10 Downing Street needs to understand Ireland can’t be a bargaining chip in their power plays or in in their negotiating stance with Brussels. They’ve been wholly unreasonable in how they have conducted themselves.”
While Sunak managed to garner more votes in the contest among MPs, he is currently behind Truss in support among the Tory membership.
In the immediate aftermath of Johnson’s resignation, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a new leader of the Tory Party would present an “opportunity” to reset the partnership between Ireland and the UK.
However, with Truss as the favourite, this looks less likely due to her bringing forward legislation to override most of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Asked whether she was actively seeking Australia’s newly-elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to lobby the next British Prime Minister for a border poll in Ireland, she said:

“Democrats everywhere should support the ending of division and the reunification of Ireland including political leaders such as [Australia’s] new Prime Minister, Mr Albanese,” added McDonald.
The Sinn Féin leader is in Australia as part of a national tour which includes briefing Federal and State Government representatives about the changes she foresees for Ireland, particularly reunification.
During her trip she told audiences that within the decade there will be a referendum on Irish unity, saying that Ireland was in “the end of days of partition”.
“So we must prepare. Both governments have a responsibility to prepare. The Irish government in particular has a duty to change from bystanders into persuaders for unity. The people of Ireland are ready,” said McDonald.
While McDonald did not provide a date for any proposed referendum, she said that political change is beginning to manifest across all of Ireland.
McDonald has been on a whistlestop tour of Australia in recent days, visiting Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
During her time in Sydney, she wasquestioned about her attendance at a dinner event where a ‘Gold Table’ was on sale for €2,000and whether or not that sent the wrong message.
McDonald brushed off the suggestion, saying that it was not a Sinn Féin event and that she had been invited by Trinity College alumni and the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce.
“I’ve been invited by the Trinity alumni and the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce. I’m delighted to be here in that capacity. It’s not my event. It’s their event and, as I think you can see from the people going in and out … they’re a very regular bunch of people.”
The Journalpreviously reported that a spokesperson for Sinn Féin said that the party “will not be receiving any income from the tour”.
“It is to engage with the Irish community in Australia, with political representatives and with businesses and trade unions on issues in Ireland; north and south,” the spokesperson said.
There had previously been criticism of McDonald attending, with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar saying that she would be “clinking” glasses with the Trinity alumni who are co-hosting the event.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-supports-20-would-vote-different-now-6100706-Jun2023/,"AT LEAST 20% of Brexit supporters would vote differently if they were asked now, a poll of hundreds of people on BBC Question Time has found.
Audience members were quizzed on whether Brexit was the right thing to do, with the results showing 70% still agreed, 20% would vote differently while 10% were unsure.
The poll was carried out as part of a special episode of the show in which the audience was made up solely of Leave voters.
It was recorded in Clacton-on-sea, Essex, on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the EU referendum on 23 June.
The Tendring area of Essex – which includes Clacton – had one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum, with almost 70% of people voting for Brexit.
One audience member, who admitted he would vote differently now, said: “I don’t see any benefit from it all”, while another blamed the efforts of politicians to “frustrate” the process and said: “We haven’t started Brexit yet, when’s it going to start?”
The questions discussed during the show included the impact of Brexit on the cost of living, the benefits and downsides of Brexit, the effect of Brexit on immigration and what the Conservatives and Labour should offer as a Brexit strategy for the next election.
Conservative MP John Redwood said the cost of living is “not at all” to do with Brexit and said a fall in inflation “should be coming quite soon”.
He added that it was a “dreadful mistake” by Western banks including the Bank of England to depress interest rates and said: “They created the money and credit explosion.”
Former No 10 press secretary Alastair Campbell received a round of applause from the audience for his opening comments in which he said the British public were “lied to” and called for Boris Johnson to be held accountable.
He said: “You were lied to. You were told that it would be pain-free. You were told that it would all be upsides, no downsides.

“We’re all of us paying a higher price in our cost of living and everything else because of the lies we were told.”
Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Jenny Chapman criticised the Government’s handling of Brexit but added “we can put the ‘great’ back into Great Britain”.
She said: ”What you can’t have is this kind of mess of a government who are more concerned about peerages for their mates and partying during lockdown.
“They’re spending far more time on those things than they are on fixing the deal.”
However, businessman and Reform UK member Ben Habib said: “The reasons we haven’t seen the Brexit dividends we should have seen are because we haven’t Brexited properly.”
He blamed a lack of deregulation, stating: “We are hitched at the hip to the EU, and that’s why we haven’t got the dividends because we can’t deregulate, we can’t cut taxes and we can’t put more money in your pockets.”
On the subject of borders, he received a round of applause for his comments on Britain’s reliance on immigrant workers.
He said: “The reason we’ve got rampant unchecked legal migration is because the Government hasn’t got joined up thinking on how to skill up our own native population.
“One of my biggest problems with this Government is it no longer pays to work in the United Kingdom if you are a low skilled worker.”
Regarding Labour’s Brexit Policy at the next election Baroness Chapman ruled out re-entering the EU and highlighted the UK-EU Veterinary agreement, the European Horizon research and innovation programme, qualifications and getting rid of red tape as key areas of focus for a potential Labour government.
Habib on the other hand called on the current government to scrap the deal with Northern Ireland.
He said: “The Windsor framework needs to be ditched.
“What we’ve got now is a border right down the middle of the United Kingdom – that is an abomination to me.”","7.40am, 23 Jun 2023",

IRISH FISHERMEN HAVE gathered in Dublin city centre this morning as part of a protest to raise awareness of the challenges their industry faces – with the renegotiation of quotas in Irish waters and the protection of coastal communities among their concerns.
A flotilla of 50 vessels travelled up the River Liffey in the early hours of this morning, passing through the East Link Toll Bridge and berthing at John Rodgerson Quay.
An estimated 500-600 fishermen and women and their supporters, marched from there to Guild St Park at Spencer Dock, next to the makeshift Dáil at the National Convention Centre.
A list of demandswere handed in to Taoiseach Micheál Martin at around 1.30pm by children at the protest.
The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue met with industry reps after receiving their list of demands.
Following the meeting, the Minister said the talks were “constructive”, and called for “continued engagement with the industry”.
The Minister also today committed to visiting ports and harbours and meet with fishers and coastal communities on a tour of Ireland over the coming months.

Fishermen have been raising their concerns about their industrysincea Brexit trade deal was signed before Christmas that was seen to seriously disadvantage the Irish fishing sector; and a recent EU ruling that means fish need to be weighed on piers.
“The greatest thing that is required for the fishing industry is for the government to develop a backbone and a willingness to fight at European level to save the Irish fishing industry from decimation,” Brendan Byrne of the Irish Fish Processors & Exporters Association toldThe Journalthis morning.
“That’s the one element that’s consistently missing over the last 48 years of our membership of the EU. We’re completely subservient to every rule, regulation or guideline that has ever come from the European Union.
“And successive governments have failed to recognise the true potential of the Irish fishing industry.”

Liam O’Sullivan, said to be the last fisherman in Fenit, Co Kerry, also explained that the industry in his area had been in decline for the past two decades.

“When they got rid of salmon fishing, it was the worst thing that happened the south-west coast of Ireland,” he said.
“Every young fella used to go salmon fishing during the summer, that’s how they were introduced into fishing.”
O’Sullivan explained that in one village where there used to be up to 80 fishing boats, there are now only two or three in operation.
Mark, the skipper of the Vigilance vessel in Killybegs, says “we’re being regulated out of existence”.
In response to the protest today, the Minister for Agriculture said in a statement:
“The Government and I stand with our fishers and we continue to welcome all engagement with fishers, their representatives and with coastal communities, I welcome fisher representatives to the Department today to hear their concerns in person.”
The statement added that the Minister is pursuing “every opportunity” at EU level to increase the available quotas for Ireland’s fishing fleet.

Many fishers at the protest spoke about wanting a dedicated Minister for the Marine, rather than the portfolio being shared alongside Agriculture and Food portfolios.
Some want the Brexit trade deal revisited, others accept that this is a done deal, but ask that the Common Fisheries Policy, which is up for renewal shortly, be used to get a better deal for Irish fishers.
The two main organisers of the protest today, and the co-signatories of the list of demands, John Lynch from Howth in Dublin and Patrick Murphy from Bantry in Co Cork, toldThe Journalthat the industry has been neglected for years.
Lynch, who has been a fisherman for nearly 40 years, is now acting CEO of the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation.
“Some boats are tied up for long periods due to a lack of quota, bigger boats could be tied up six months of the year.”
“The Brexit and the withdrawal of the weighing derogation were the two straws that really broke the camel’s back. Brexit took away 15% of our already minimal quotas, and that’s a really hard blow to the industry. It equated to 25% of the industry’s income. So that’s every year forevermore – that fish is gone to the UK.
“Around the Irish coast, we only have 7.5% of the monkfish quota, and in hake, we only have 3%, so it’s very low.”

Murphy is the CEO of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation. When asked why over years of neglect, fishers were organising marches now, he said:
“If you’re embarrassed about something, and you’re ashamed about something, you don’t really want to talk about it. So fishing has been the poor relation of the agri-industries of this country, so I think there’s a bit of guilt there that makes them easier to target.”
Because the quotas are much lower than they used to be, fishing over the allocated quotas can be easily done.
The issue of non-EU migrant workers in the fishing industry was also raised, where they haven’t the same protections after working in the country for a number of years. Two Filipino fishermen who have worked in Ireland for a number of years spoke to the rally about how they need better rights afforded to them to stay in the country.
Murphy said that the industry is blamed for the poor working conditions of migrant workers, when it’s a case of non-EU/EEA workers not being afforded the same rights as EU citizens.

The two final straws: Weighing fish on piers,and Brexit
The European Commission found that Irish authoritiesdidn’t have a proper plan in place for weighing catches at factories, and that the weighing system was being manipulated by some, which means that fish now must be weighed quay-side – something that fishermen and women strongly object to.
One fisherman toldThe Journallast month that rules mean fishermen are “scraping the ice” off fish before they are weighed on the pier,sometimes on a hot day and with seagulls defecating on the pier, which they say could lower the quality of the catch.
The Brexit trade deal has also raised atwo-fold problemfor Irish fishermen:
There are also other challenges their industry faces: the viability of the small-boat-based Irish fishing industry is seen as under threat by bigger vessels from other countries and corporations; and the new rules and standards needed for environmental sustainability.
A Government taskforce was set up in January to deal with the future of the Irish fishing sector, which was pushed for in the aftermath of the Brexit trade deal by Cork TD Christopher O’Sullivan. It is aiming to look at the sustainability of the fishing industry – but there are already concerns among fishermen that it may not go far enough.
Last month, a flotilla of around 60 fishing vessels from around Ireland travelled up the River Lee to deliver a letter of demands to Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s office in Cork.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-medicines-into-northern-ireland-brexit-5633616-Dec2021/,"THE EU HAS announced proposed laws to assist the free flow of medicines from Britain into Northern Ireland, in a move it said would create momentum to resolve other disputes over Brexit’s Irish Sea border.
European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic announced the legislative proposals in Brussels earlier today.
The move has been welcomed by Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
UK Brexit Minister David Frost said London would look “positively” at the EU proposals but he expressed disappointment that solutions to wider issues linked to the Northern Ireland Protocol had not yet been resolved.
He said there was an urgent need to resolve the disputes on issues such as customs paperwork, agri-food checks and the oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the new year.
Frost reiterated the UK’s threat to suspend operation of parts of the protocol – by triggering its Article 16 mechanism – if an agreement cannot be found next year.
I have spoken to@MarosSefcovictoday and I have now issued a statement on the state of play in the talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol. The negotiations will resume early in the New Year.The full text is here:https://t.co/rhnWL9Dvjepic.twitter.com/g2Am1F3SYr— David Frost (@DavidGHFrost)December 17, 2021

DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has welcomed the announcement, but said it still left “significant problems for our constituents”.
“It is shocking that in the middle of a pandemic there is uncertainty over our access to medicines because of the NI Protocol,” he said.
Donaldson said Brussels should have no role in deciding Northern Ireland’s access to medications, adding that this was “another blatant breach” of the Good Friday Agreement.
“A foreign power should have no role in dictating to this part of the United Kingdom whether we can access medicines at the same time as the rest of the United Kingdom. Our constituents should be able to access the same drugs at the same time as the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.
“We are seeking meetings with medicine suppliers to gauge the impact of this decision but given the EU still seeks to retain an element of control over medicines we expect the latest announcement by the EU to still leave significant problems for our constituents.”
The issues surrounding medicines stem from the outworking of the regulatory differences the protocol has created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Under the terms of the protocol, which was agreed as part of the Brexit divorce deal to ensure a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland remains covered by the EU’s pharmaceutical regulations.
As Northern Ireland receives most of its medicines from suppliers in Britain, there had been concerns that their movement could be impeded when a grace period expires.
Grace period
That grace period was originally due to end in January but in the autumn the UK extended it unilaterally – along with other temporary exemptions associated with the protocol – pending efforts to find negotiated solutions to the issues.
The unilateral EU move to change its laws would enable the continued movement of medicines between Britain and Northern Ireland without the restrictions that would have applied under the original terms of the protocol.
Sefcovic said: “During my visit to Northern Ireland in September I promised to do whatever it takes to ensure a long-lasting solution on medicines, all the more so in the light of the current pandemic.
“I kept my word and today the Commission is delivering in the form of a legislative proposal ensuring that everyone in Northern Ireland has access to the same medicines at the same time as in the rest of the United Kingdom.”
Sefcovic said the proposed legislation covers both generic medicines and innovative new medicines, such as those for cancer treatment.
“In a nutshell this will be possible because all the regulatory functions of pharmaceutical companies supplying medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland can remain in the UK, while no additional batch testing, manufacturing and licence authorisation or separate packaging is required,” he said.
Sefcovic added: “I am confident that this is an important milestone and that our proposals will deliver on the objectives.
“On the one hand, they answer all concerns raised by stakeholders during our extensive outreach and at the same time we have engaged intensively with the UK Government to reach an appropriate solution.
“I’m convinced that the issue of medicines show that the protocol has the flexibility to work on the grounds.
“Therefore, we must carry this momentum into the other areas of discussion.
“The EU’s objective remains the same – to jointly identify durable solutions to ease the flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This covers both customs and the movement of sanitary and phytosanitary goods.”

The legislation will need to be ratified by both the European Council and the European Parliament before coming into operation
Protocol talks are set to resume in January when efforts will intensify to resolve the areas of dispute.

Sefcovic said he hoped there would be a “gear change” in the wider negotiations with the UK on protocol issues next month.
“Today is a further demonstration of the EU’s unwavering commitment to stability and predictability for citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland and I urge the UK Government to reciprocate our efforts,” he said.
“The EU and the UK are partners with shared values and shared global challenges so it is time to change gear and bring our partnership to the level on which it belongs.”
European Court of Justice
One of the thorniest remaining issues is the oversight role of the ECJ.
The UK Government has previously insisted the total removal of the ECJ’s function was a red line, while the EU made clear Northern Ireland could not retain unfettered access to the single market without the ECJ overseeing matters of EU law.
It remains unclear whether a compromise position can be reached,  potentially one that could see a more limited role for the ECJ – confined to only EU law matters – with an independent mechanism dealing with wider arbitration issues.
While acknowledging the EU move on medicines, David Frost said there had been “much less progress in other areas”.
“Overall, with the potential exception of medicines, I do not believe that the negotiations are yet close to delivering outcomes which can genuinely solve the problems presented by the protocol,” he said
The Brexit minister said the UK had been prepared to consider an “interim agreement” on the outstanding issues pending a “comprehensive solution” being reached.
He said even an interim agreement had not been possible at this point.
“It is disappointing that it has not been possible to reach either a comprehensive or worthwhile interim agreement this year,” he said.
“A solution needs to be found urgently early next year. For as long as there is no agreed solution, we remain ready to use the Article 16 safeguard mechanism if that is the only way to protect the prosperity and stability of Northern Ireland and its people.”
The proposed EU law change on medicines would allow GB-based pharma suppliers to maintain their current regulatory arrangements.
It would mean companies in GB could continue to act as a hub for the supply of generic medicines to Northern Ireland, without the need to establish bases in the region.
The proposals would also apply to other small markets which use British medicines, including Ireland, Malta and Cyprus.
Irish Government response
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence, Simon Coveney has welcomed the update today by the EU and the UK on the ongoing talks on the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.
“Access to medicines has been at the top of my agenda. The plan announced today turns commitment into solutions.
“By ensuring the continued long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and in addressing other supply issues for Ireland, it provides reassurance to people across the island that they will continue to have access to the medicines they need.
“I hope that this solution on medicines can act as a catalyst for solving the other Protocol issues early in the new year,” he said.
Coveney said the Irish Government were supportive of EU and British Government efforts to continue talks on the Northern Ireland protocol.
“I firmly believe the Protocol will work, if we allow it, with flexibility and pragmatism. A positive outcome to the current talks remains our key objective. I welcome the fact that the EU and the UK have agreed on the importance of continuing talks in the New Year.
“This is the best way to bring about substantive progress and find durable solutions to the practical problems faced by people and business in Northern Ireland.
“Brexit has been one of the dominant issues on my agenda this year and I spent a lot of time listening to stakeholders in Northern Ireland in order to understand the genuine challenges they face. Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has done likewise. Ireland continues to strongly support his solution-driven approach,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tanaiste-describes-northern-ireland-protocol-as-a-little-too-strict-5885820-Oct2022/,"THE NORTHERN IRELAND Protocol as it was originally designed is a “little too strict”, the Tánaiste has said.
Leo Varadkar said the protocol was working despite it not being fully implemented, demonstrating there is room for “further flexibility for some changes”.
He added that a “window of opportunity” now exists for agreement to be reached between the EU and the UK.
His remarks come as negotiations between officials on the protocol are due to get under way later today.
The European Commission earlier this week confirmed the two sides will meet for technical level talks.
A meeting between Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is scheduled to take place in London this evening ahead of Coveney co-chairing a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference with Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on Friday.
Varadkar said: “We should not forget that the protocol is working. It was designed to prevent a hard border between north and south, and there is no hard border between north and south.
“It was designed to protect the integrity of the single market and it has, and also the Northern Ireland economy is outperforming the rest of the UK economically.
“But one thing that I would concede is that perhaps the protocol, as it was originally designed, was a little too strict.
“The protocol has not been fully implemented and yet it is still working.
“I think that, you know, demonstrates that there is some room for further flexibility for some changes that hopefully would make it acceptable to all sides.”
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as part of the Withdrawal Agreement and sought to avoid a hard border with Ireland post-Brexit.

But the arrangements have created trade barriers on goods being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The protocol is vehemently opposed by many unionists in Northern Ireland and the DUP is currently blocking the formation of a powersharing executive in Belfast in protest.
Varadkar said an agreement would be “very beneficial” as it would allow for the restoration of powersharing in the North.
Stormont collapsed earlier this year amid a row over the protocol and has not returned despite elections in May.
Speaking after an industrial relations conference at University College Dublin, Varadkar also told reporters:  “There is a window of opportunity now over the next couple of weeks to see if we can come to an agreement on the protocol.
“That would be very beneficial for Ireland and Northern Ireland because it would allow us to get the executive up and running, and could be helpful for Britain as well in economic terms.”
The Tánaiste welcomed the UK’s Northern Ireland Minister Steve Baker’s apology over his previous “ferocious” negotiating stance on Brexit but said it would remain to be seen if they would prove to be significant.
Baker, a former strident Brexiteer and member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs, said relations with Ireland are not “where they should be”, and added that ministers need to act with “humility” to restore relationships with the Republic and the EU.
Varadkar said: “It remains to be seen what the significance of them are, but they are very welcome comments and (I) would agree with the Taoiseach on that.”
Asked about the political instability surrounding British prime minister Liz Truss, he said the Government does not concern itself with the UK’s domestic politics.
“That’s just not the way we operate. Liz Truss is the prime minister, and the British government is the British government, and the European Union, including Ireland will negotiate with them and try and come to an agreement if we can,” he said.
“We won’t concern ourselves about any individual country’s domestic politics.”
Legislation to enable the UK Government to effectively tear up parts of the protocol is to return to Westminster on October 11.
The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill has already cleared the House of Commons and will be debated at second reading by the House of Lords, which is expected to consider it at length, next week.","1.30pm, 6 Oct 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/british-versus-the-french-on-fishing-fleet-rights-post-brexit-legal-action-threats-5588160-Oct2021/,"THE UK IS “actively considering” starting legal proceedings against France due to its threats over fishing licences as cross-Channel tensions deteriorated.
Brexit minister David Frost has warned the European Union it would be “in breach of its obligations” under the post-Brexit trade deal with the UK if Paris carries out its threats to block British boats from landing their catch at French ports while tightening checks on vessels.
France has given the UK until Tuesday to grant more licences for small French boats to fish in British waters or face border and port sanctions.
But the UK has warned France that, if it does act next week, then it is prepared to kick-start legal proceedings, arguing that Paris will have violated the terms of the trade agreement with Brussels.
Both Boris Johnson and David Frost have stepped up their lobbying of the EU in a bid to encourage bloc leaders to pull France back from its proposed reaction.
In a meeting with the EU’s top official, Ursula von der Leyen, at the G20 in Rome, Downing Street said the Prime Minister warned that the threats did “not appear to be compatible with the UK-EU Trade Co-operation Agreement (TCA) or wider international law”.
The comments came after Johnson had refused to rule out triggering the dispute mechanism resolution clause in the trade agreement – which could result in fines or even the treaty being suspended – if France does not back down.
Frost on Saturday repeated his assertion that the UK was prepared to commission legal action as a result of the fishing dispute.
In a series of tweets, the Conservative peer rallied against comments made by French prime minister Jean Castex in a letter to European Commission president von der Leyen, that the UK should be shown “it causes more damage to leave the EU than to stay in”.
Frost said: “To see it expressed in this way is clearly very troubling and very problematic in the current context when we are trying to solve many highly sensitive issues, including on the Northern Ireland Protocol.

“This is all the more so as the threats made by France this week to our fishing industry, to energy supplies, and to future co-operation, for example through the Horizon research programme, unfortunately form part of a pattern that has persisted for much of this year.
“As I set out yesterday to (European Commission vice-president) Maros Sefcovic, these threats, if implemented on November 2, would put the EU in breach of its obligations under our trade agreement.
“So we are actively considering launching dispute settlement proceedings as set out in Article 738 of the TCA.”
The Prime Minister and French president Emmanuel Macron are due to talk on the margins of the G20 summit this weekend, with suggestions they could meet on Saturday.
During interviews in Rome, Johnson left the door open to finding a resolution with Mr Macron as he described the UK as being “very keen to work with our friends and partners”.
Johnson repeated the statement he made on the plane over to Italy, vowing to “take steps to protect UK interests” if there is a breach of the TCA with the EU.
At the centre of the dispute are the licences for small boats, which are issued only if the vessels can demonstrate a history of fishing in British waters.
According to No 10, Johnson stressed during his conversation with von der Leyen that the UK was “happy to consider any further evidence” for licence applications which had been rejected. The UK has said only 2% of EU licence bids had been denied.
In comments made before the Rome talks, a commission spokesman said the trade deal made provision that “vessels who were fishing in these waters before (Brexit) should be allowed to continue” and implored Britain to look at each case, “boat-by-boat”.
The wrangle over fishing access escalated this week after French authorities detained a Scottish-registered scallop dredger after accusing it of fishing without a licence.
The captain of the Cornelis Gert Jan vessel, understood to be an Irish national, has been told to face a court hearing in August next year.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss took the rare step of ordering an allied nation’s envoy to be summoned as she called Catherine Colonna, French ambassador to the UK, to the Foreign Office on Friday afternoon to challenge her over France’s stance.

https://www.thejournal.ie/latest-stormont-powersharing-deadline-set-to-fall-5972924-Jan2023/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Jan 2023
TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has urged patience with the negotiations to resolve the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute, insisting a mountain has to be climbed.
Speaking to reporters at Farmleigh House in Phoenix Park this evening where he met with his UK ministerial counterparts at a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, he said the talks between the EU and UK should be given “time and space”.
“The issues are very challenging,” he said.
“So I don’t understate the formidable challenges and the mountain that has to be climbed. So I do think it’s worth the effort.”
Martin added: “It makes sense to be patient here and just to see how this evolves and unfolds.”
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris declined to offer any detail on the negotiations between the UK and EU.
“I’m working with what I know I think we can deliver and let’s not pre-empt anything,” he said after the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
“I’m looking forward to seeing what the talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union can bring forward and I very much hope that we can move forward from there.”
His comments come as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the Irish government has had no indication yet from Heaton-Harris that he intends to call an election.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said:
“We haven’t heard any indication from him yet. I know he’s in regular contact with the Tánaiste, so probably best for me not to speculate on what he’s going to say.”
Minister of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker told reporters in Dublin today that the public needed to know that today’s meeting was a “great success”.
“I’m pleased because we’re now on a positive trajectory together. And we’re going to work together. We’re always going to face problems, but we’re going to face those problems together,” he said, adding that he was very pleased and proud of the group’s work today.

Another deadline for forming a devolved executive in Northern Ireland is set to fall by the wayside as the deadlock over post-Brexit trading arrangements continues.
If the Stormont parties do not agree to form an administration in Belfast today, the UK Government assumes a legal duty at midnight to call a snap Assembly election in the region.
An ongoing DUP block on the functioning of powersharing, in protest at Brexit’s , means it is almost certain the day will pass without an executive being convened.
19 January is the latest in series of deadlines the parties have been given to resurrect devolution following the last election in May.
As the institutions can only function with the cooperation of the largest nationalist party and largest unionist party, the DUP effectively holds a veto on powersharing returning.
The party has made clear it will only go back into government if significant changes are delivered on the protocol.
Heaton-Harris said on Twitter today that if no Executive is formed today, “I’ll be under a legal duty to hold elections to the Assembly in the next 12 weeks”.
“I’ll use the next few weeks to carefully assess all options about what happens next and continue to talk to all interested parties before I make any decisions,” he said.
The Stormont impasse is sure to feature prominently when Heaton-Harris attends the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference which is taking place in Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park this afternoon.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Micheál Martin will represent the Irish Government at the conference. He will be joined by Minister for Environment, Climate, Communications and Transport, Eamon Ryan and Minister for Justice Simon Harris.
The British Government will be represented by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Rt Hon Chris Heaton-Harris MP, Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Steve Baker MP, Minister of State for Energy and Climate, Graham Stuart MP, Minister of State for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure, Julia Lopez.

Varadkar said today that it would be a “really good thing” if agreement on the Northern Ireland Protocol could be reached by the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in April.
“It is a real shame that the institutions created by the agreement are not really functioning, particularly the Assembly, the Executive and the North-South bodies. And I think that’s a real shame. So it would be really good, I think, if we could have an agreement and the institutions operating again by April.
“But if that’s not possible, that’s not going to cause us to stop. It isn’t an absolute deadline in law or anything like that. But of course, for lots of reasons, it’d be nice to have an agreement before then,” he said.
Varadkar said the Irish government is playing its part, as part of the European Union, to be “as flexible and be as reasonable as we can” as long as there’s no alteration to the basic principles of the agreement, such as no hard border between North and South and that the integrity of the single market is upheld.
NI Protocol
Many unionists in Northern Ireland are vehemently opposed to arrangements that have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, insisting the protocol has weakened the region’s place within the United Kingdom.
The EU and UK continue to engage in negotiations aimed at significantly reducing the red tape on Irish Sea trade, with both sides recently talking up the potential of an agreed solution being reached.
The DUP has made clear any agreement that may emerge must meet its tests on removing trade barriers if it is to countenance a return to Stormont.
If the latest deadline passes, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris assumes a duty to call an election within 12 weeks.
However, he does not have to announce a date for a poll immediately.

Polling day is usually around six weeks after an election is announced, so Heaton-Harris would have until mid-March to call a poll if it is to be held before the 12-week period expires in mid-April.
That would give Heaton-Harris another six weeks to see what emerges from the UK-EU talks on the protocol.
If a deal emerges in the coming weeks, and the DUP agrees to re-enter powersharing on the back of it, the Northern Ireland Secretary could then ask Parliament to retrospectively extend the 19 January deadline for forming an executive – meaning the parties could return to Stormont without the need for a fresh election.
Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said she would like to see a deal between the UK and EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol deal with concerns around “overly burdensome checks” between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the administrative burden.
“These are issues that have been raised, these are issues that are amenable to solutions, I think we’re very close,” she told Sky News.
“A majority of people elected in the north of Ireland support the protocol, people in business will say, ‘here are the difficulties’, but everyone accepts that the protocol needs to be finessed, but we need the protocol as a consequence of Brexit.”
Asked about the DUP’s concerns about a trade border down the Irish Sea, McDonald responded: “The DUP have their view, they express their concerns, and that’s fine. There are other views, they do not represent the majority view in the north of Ireland.
“We need everybody back in Stormont and what we need is an acceptance for powersharing to work, you have to be prepared to share power. We also need a democratic acceptance that in order for government to work, you have to come at things in a reasonable frame of mind, and it can’t be a case of my way or the highway, that’s not fair.
“I would challenge the DUP in this regard, so many important things that really matter in people’s day-to-day lives have either been delayed or haven’t happened at all because we don’t have government in the north.
“If their view is that they can crash the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in hope of a return to direct rule from London, that is not an option,” said McDonald.
Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said that she wanted all the parties back around the Executive table, as she called for a solution that is “pragmatic, that’s long lasting, to provide certainty and stability”.
“The DUP have to shoulder some responsibility for bringing us to the point that we’re in today,” she told BBC Newsnight.
“I believe in power-sharing. I believe in all the parties working together. I believe in all voices being heard. And I want to see a solution here and I want to get us back into the executive.”
Expressing some optimism about progress towards a deal on the protocol, she said: “I am encouraged by the conversation this week that’s been heard between both the EU and the British Government.
“I’m encouraged that [Foreign Secretary] James Cleverly is the United States because the United States are a big friend of the peace process.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-leave-uk-brexit-5774418-May2022/,"ALMOST TWO-THIRDS of people in Northern Ireland believe that Brexit has increased the likelihood of Irish unity, according to the results of a social attitudes survey.
The 2021 results of the NI Life & Times survey, a joint initiative between Queen’s University and Ulster University, also show 48% support for Northern Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom, a decline since 2016.
The survey also suggests that unionist and nationalist identities have become stronger, and the proportion of those who are neither unionist nor nationalist has decreased since 2018.
The results are contained in the report, Political Attitudes In NI After Brexit And Under The Protocol, co-authored by Professor Katy Hayward, Dr Milena Komarova and Ben Rosher of Queen’s University.

Key points of the survey include:
The report covers the four main themes of the Good Friday Agreement, political identities, constitutional status, and Brexit and the protocol.
Prof Hayward said: “If the Northern Ireland Assembly election of 5 May was a defining moment, it only compounded the political flux that has troubled Northern Ireland since the Brexit referendum.
“The NI Life and Times Survey offers a unique insight into how the local population is responding to the realisation that things won’t and can’t be the same again.
“The differing expectations and concerns reflected in this data will no doubt prove testing for our democratic institutions as well as for our politicians in the months and years to come.”
The survey is taken from a randomised sample of 1,397 of the adult population in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-how-far-apart-are-the-eu-and-uk-5574739-Oct2021/,"IT’S ALL TOO familiar: In the past two weeks, public rows between the EU and the UK have reemerged, over the supremacy of the EU’s European Court of Justice; and, of course, trading arrangements in Northern Ireland.
This week alone has seen the announcement of two proposals for how trade in Northern Ireland should work from now on – one that was well-flagged from the EU, and a surprise announcement the day before from the UK.
Addressing a conference in Lisbonon Tuesday, Frost said that the Protocol was drawn up “in extreme haste at a time of great uncertainty”, and said that the EU was an organisation that was suspected of not always wanting the UK to succeed.
He said that a proposal for a replacement to the NI Protocol – rather than a tweaking of the current trading arrangements in Northern Ireland – would be submitted to the EU.
The following day, the European Commission unveiled its updated, improved version of the current Protocol, containing some of the requested changes that the UK government had asked for in previous negotiations.
But EU figures are concerned at the politicised tone of the lead up to this point: ‘ramped-up rhetoric’ against the EU at the Tory Party conference earlier this month was noted.
This is despite reports from both Tory figures and EU political representatives in recent weeks that both sides are “over” the other one – the fact that this political row has erupted might suggest otherwise.
So just how different are these two proposals from each other, and how far away are they from the arrangements already in place?
First: What has been happening up until now?
Since the trade deal agreed between the EU and the UK came into effect on 1 January, officials in Britain, Northern Ireland, Ireland and the rest of the EU have been implementing the new trade rules between the EU and the UK.
In Northern Ireland, these trade rules apply differently. The two sides signed up to this in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
This has resulted in additional customs checks and paperwork required at ports and airports in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, instead of placing infrastructure along the island of Ireland.
In the immediate aftermath of these new post-Brexit trade rules being applied in Northern Ireland, some problems emerged with trade going between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Customs and regulatory obstacles caused problems for sending plants, pets, supermarket goods and chilled meats from Great Britain to the North – grace periods were introduced to alleviate these specific issues until a more permanent solution was found.
Talks between the UK Government’s Michael Gove, and the EU’s Maroš Šefčovič hoped to resolve detailed issues with the Protocol through talks held regularly in London and Brussels –problems which were, essentially, inevitableas experts from Northern Ireland weren’t at negotiations where the EU and UK decided how the details should work.
In July of this year, the UK publisheda ‘Command Paper’on the Northern Ireland Protocol. The EUrespondedto say there was enough leeway within the Protocol itself to make certain changes and move things forward, but ruled out a renegotiation.
The main suggestions in this paper have been outlined in the latest statement by Frost.
The new proposals: What do both sides want?
The UK want a “light-touch” traders scheme that will mean businesses can self-declare where their goods are ending up if they enter Northern Ireland; less SPS checks on the highly-regulated agri-goods sector; and an international arbitration mechanism to solve disputes over the Protocol instead of the EU’s court.

The UK are not happy about EU State aid rules applying in NI, or that the EU will not allow pet passports from GB to NI – these are both parts of the Protocol that have caused problems before.
It’s worth noting that this proposal has still not been published by the UK government.
What the EU says it is offering and what it is actually offering seem to be slightly different: but it isaimingto reduce checks on agri-food retail products going from NI-to-GB by 80%, and on customs paperwork for NI-to-GB goods by 50%.
It’s claiming the ‘sausage war’ issue is resolved, and that a trusted trader scheme of sorts will be in place to differentiate between British goods that stay in the North, and those at-risk of spilling over into the Single Market by crossing the Irish border undeclared.
Sinn Féin MEP Chris MacManus said that the changes mean that “a truck transporting different food products (eg; dairy, meat, fish, confectionary, fruit and vegetables, etc.) from Britain to the north will now just need one certificate, instead of hundreds”.
“A business importing products of animal origin (eg, yoghurt, cheese, chicken or turkey) into the north from Britain will no longer be subject to the same level of checks. More than 80% of the identity and physical checks previously required will now be removed,” he adds.

The response of experts to the EU proposals are mostly positive, but not glowing.
Former advisor to the UK’s Brexit Department Raoul Ruparel saidin a widely shared Twitter threadthat “the possibility of a wider scope for not at-risk goods is welcome and requirement for less info could certainly streamline things. But the text doesn’t really set out how this will happen at all”.
Ruparel also adds that while a commitment to reduced SPS checks would be welcome, “some of the caveats give me pause… We know the current approach in EU legislation doesn’t really allow for even minimal risk, so remains to be seen how this would work.”
Policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute Anton Spisaknotedthat the proposals are significant “because they move us away from general application of EU rules to NI to a world where aspects of EU law can be exempted for NI. This is a big shift for the EU.”
Spisak notes that the British government “will feel vindicated that the hardball strategy is somewhat working”, and that the EU proposals prove a victory of sorts for their negotiation tactics.

Why did the UK agree to the Protocol in late 2019 if it didn’t like it?
On Tuesday this week, Vote Leave architect and former adviser to Boris Johnson Dominic Cummingssaid on Twitterthat Boris Johnson hadn’t a “scoobydoo what the deal he signed meant. He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until 11/20. In 1/20 he was babbling ‘I’d never have signed it if I’d understood it’.”
Cummings said that “getting Brexit done” was of much greater importance at the time that the deal was struck than concerns about breaking international law at a later date.
When asked why the UK Government signed up to the Protocol in the first place, and whether it was acting in bad faith when it did so, Frost said in Lisbon this week: “We knew, as we said in our Command Paper, we knew that some aspects of the Protocol agreed in 2019 were problematic. We didn’t particularly support them ourselves.
“We agreed with them because it was the right thing to do for the country overall looking at the wider political debate and the need to deliver on Brexit. We knew we were taking a risk and we hoped that we’d be wrong.
“It turns out we were right and they were risky, and that’s why we’ve come back to them.”
What’s the view from the EU on this?
The European Union wants to know what specifically about its new Protocol proposal the UK government is unhappy with – based on suspicions that it is acting in bad faith.

Green MEP for Dublin Ciarán Cuffe called on the UK government to “engage constructively” with the EU and avoid “this yearly brinkmanship”.
“We should remember that the UK signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol, and agreed to the role of the ECJ. It is not helpful or credible for Prime Minister Johnson to now renege on this agreement and paint these as red lines.”
Independents4Change MEP Clare Daly said: “The main reason peace in Northern Ireland has been jeopardised in the last few years has been that Westminster has acted without a thought for people in the North, so when Lord Frost claims that preserving peace on the island of Ireland is the reason a new Protocol is needed, it is a bit rich.
“At the same time, we have to take the matter seriously. People on both sides of the Irish border cannot contemplate a deterioration in relations. The desire for a firm, even punitive, response from Brussels is misguided. Talk is the only option.”
Sinn Féin MEP Chris MacManus suggested that the British Government “obviously see a media benefit and electoral advantage in fighting with the EU”.
“The European Commission negotiators and members of the European Parliament’s Contact Group didn’t bat an eyelid at the grandstanding of David Frost.
“What is interesting is that while the Commission publishes all its proposals the British government is wedded to secrecy – presumably because their proposal will be a rehash of the tired old rhetoric that again misrepresents the Good Friday Agreement and completely ignores the fact that the majority in the North voted against Brexit.”
Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher said that Frost’s announcement this week came as somewhat of a surprise to Ireland, as the main stumbling blocks over the Protocol to date have been technical issues related to customs clearances, new paperwork, and inspections at port facilities between Great Britain and the North – not the ECJ.
“They elevated the ECJ as most important issue, even though it was part of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that they signed up to,” the Ireland South MEP said. “Now, all of a sudden, they’ve spotted this about the ECJ being the final arbitrator – it just couldn’t have been new to the British Government.”
Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič – who is tasked with handling post-Brexit relations with the UK, and making improvements to the Protocol – said that during his engagements with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, ECJ oversight was only raised with him once.
Kelleher said that the UK are “consistently elevating issues,” and “almost negotiating in bad faith” at this stage.
The Journalasked the Cabinet Office for details on what specific elements of the current Protocol, and the EU’s recent suggested changes to that Protocol, the UK Government is unhappy about, and why the ECJ oversight is only being raised as an issue now.
A response has not yet been received.
How likely is Article 16 to be triggered, and what happens next?
There is also the small matter of Article 16 – a ‘nuclear option’ contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol that would cut all those hard-fought for trading ties if the UK government can legally argue that they are causing more harm than good.
When Frost was asked whether he was willing to risk a trade war by triggering Article 16, and whether the UK would trigger it over ECJ oversight, he said:
“There’s obviously a couple of hypotheticals in there… It would be for the EU to decide whether it made sense to retaliate. I don’t think it would make the situation any better by doing so, it won’t help the situation in Northern Ireland which is what it’s all about, but obviously it’s not in our hands. But it’s obviously not our decision.”
Trade and legal experts say that though the Article 16 option is contained in the Protocol, it is unlikely to be triggered as it would possibly unravel elements of the Protocol that do work, and plunge the two sides into trade negotiations almost from the start.
The next step will be further negotiations, with the hope that the two sides can meet somewhere in the middle between their two demands before Christmas – they managed a Christmas Eve deal in 2019, after all.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-government-ni-protocol-5373217-Mar2021/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has moved to unilaterally ease another element of the contentious Brexit arrangements governing trade to Northern Ireland.
A ban on importing plants potted in soil from Great Britain to the region has been temporarily lifted.
While most agri-food goods are, or will be, subject to extra regulatory processes to enter Northern Ireland under the terms of Brexit’s NI Protocol, some have been banned altogether.
That prohibited list includes plants or vegetables potted in British soil or with traces of soil still attached to them. This has caused problems for many businesses in Northern Ireland, particularly garden centres.
It has become somewhat of a touchstone issue in the public debate over the merits of the protocol, with its critics citing the ban on pot plants as evidence of excessive and disproportionate bureaucracy.
The British government has now relaxed the prohibitions related to soil.
The move comes in a week when London has also unilaterally extended grace periods that currently limit regulatory checks on imports of agri-food retail goods and customs declarations on GB parcels sent to the region.
Although the agri-food health certificates were the only sector of the above to receive an extension by the UK, the statement released on Wednesday by the UK government also said that ”further guidance will be provided later this week” on parcel deliveries and for problems with soil attached to trading plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.
The European Commission is taking legal action against the British government for those moves, accusing it of breaching the protocol.
The latest easements will allow bulbs or vegetables with soil attached to be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
It will also allow plants grown in soil to be moved with soil attached, provided they are from an authorised business that meets GB plant passporting requirements.

Plants can also be moved in containers with growing medium attached if the containers meet the conditions required under GB plant passporting purposes.
The protocol has also imposed tight rules on the movement of agricultural and forestry machinery from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, preventing vehicles and equipment with soil attached from entering.
The British government has told traders they can now move machinery without the need for certification, as long as excessive soil and plant debris is removed.
That will enable equipment with same amounts of soil attached to enter the region.
A UK Government spokeswoman said: “We are committed to meeting our protocol obligations in a pragmatic and proportionate way, but some challenges are having a direct, and often disproportionate, impact on lives and livelihoods, including an unacceptable disruption to the flow of critical goods.
“These temporary, practical arrangements recognise the need to ensure biosecurity on the island of Ireland is not compromised whilst addressing barriers which stop goods moving into Northern Ireland.”
Legal action
Brussels has warned it will launch legal action “very soon” following the unilateral moves to delay full implementation of the protocol.
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said the initial announcement by the British government on Wednesday had come as a “very negative surprise”.
The British government has insisted its actions are temporary and have been taken to allow time for permanent solutions to be worked out.
It has provoked a furious response in Brussels, with the EU accusing the UK of going back on its treaty obligations in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
In an interview with today’s Financial Times, Sefcovic – who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the agreement – said the European Commission is now working on “infringement proceedings” against the UK.
“We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon. The most precise term I can give you is really very soon,” he said.
Related ReadsThe latest Brexit row: UK's solo run has left the EU in a tricky positionEU taking ‘very belligerent approach’ to issues caused by NI Protocol, Arlene Foster says
In response, Northern Ireland First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster accused the EU of belligerence.
“The number of checks that are occurring between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are so disproportionate to the risk to the EU single market that it has become completely out of step with what the protocol was meant to do,” she told BBC Radio 4.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to play down the dispute with the EU, saying the Government is simply taking some “temporary and technical measures” to ensure that trade keeps flowing.
“I’m sure with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable,” he said.
However, MEPs in the European Parliament have already taken steps to delay formal ratification of the wider trade and co-operation agreement between Britain and the EU pending the outcome of the latest row.
The Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement was designed by the EU and UK to avoid a hardening of the border on the island of Ireland.
It means keeping Northern Ireland aligned to various EU rules, requiring checks on goods arriving into the region from Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the White House has again stressed the support of new US President Joe Biden for the Good Friday Agreement which the protocol is intended to protect.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said: “President Biden has been unequivocal about his support for the Good Friday Agreement.
“It has been the bedrock of peace, stability and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland.”
Prior to last year’s election, Biden – who is intensely proud of his Irish roots – warned that the agreement must not become a casualty of Brexit.

IRELAND TODAY DEEPENED its links with France in the wake of Brexit by opening an honorary consulate in the western port of Roscoff.
“France is now Ireland’s closest EU neighbour and Brittany the closest region to us,” said James Browne, Irish minister of state at the department of justice.
“This has created a Brexit bounce – even perhaps a Breton bounce – in our relations,” added Browne of the move to deepen links between Dublin and Paris by opening the facility at the port headquarters of Brittany Ferries.
“French businesses thrive in Ireland and France is one of the main markets for Ireland’s goods, services and agricultural products.
“We enjoy this freedom to travel and to trade through our shared European membership. Ireland is proud to celebrate 50 years of EU membership this year,” added Browne.
He underlined that “maritime connectivity has tripled and two-way trade in goods jumped by 18% last year” between the two countries.
Browne saluted Brittany Ferries president Jean-Marc Roue, named as honorary consul, as “a proud Breton”, whose “expertise and leadership in the areas of transport, agriculture and maritime issues will be a real asset in this new role.

“We value his counsel and will look to him to help us as we advance our common agenda for deepening Ireland–Brittany relations.
Stephane Perrin, vice-president of the Brittany region international playfully welcomed the boost the move would afford “perspectives for partnership between French and Irish ports which we could not have guessed at, thanks to Brexit. Thank you Boris Johnson!”
Irish ambassador to France Niall Burgess said Brexit had created “new challenges for Ireland and for France. But where there are challenges there are also opportunities”.
Burgess said weekly crossings between Ireland and France had quadrupled inside the past two years from 12 to almost 50.
Roue stated passenger traffic between Ireland and France had risen 43% since 2019 and freight was up 15%.
Head of Enterprise Ireland France Patrick Torrekens said Irish companies were increasingly looking to maritime links to the continental mainland for their exchanges with fellow EU states rather than first having to go through now former EU member the United Kingdom.
That enabled them, said Torrekens to “avoid additional customs formalities” and potential delays.

Speaking at an event hosted by the Brexit Institute at Dublin City University (DCU) today, the former Fianna Fáil leader said loyalists view the arrangements as being solely about identity.
Unionist politicians have since hit out at the comments.

Great contribution from ex-#TaoiseachBertie Ahern in our Q&A, exploring impact of#NIProtocolon#GoodFridayAgreement, potential border poll and whether most people understand the Protocol#NIProtocolConf@DCUpic.twitter.com/qhXq67UrH2
The former Taoiseach said the contentious post-Brexit arrangements are not properly understood by the community, and viewed as a backdoor to a united Ireland.
He said: “I spend a lot of my life still in the North. The reality is in East Belfast and in the ghettos and in the areas where you’re likely to get trouble, is that people haven’t got a clue about the protocol, not a clue.”
“They see it as identity.”
“They see it as a road to the Dublin Government taking over again and this is a pathway to that.”
“That’s the hard reality.”
Implementation
The EU and the UK remain deadlocked in negotiations over its implementation, with the new barriers to East/West trade creating tensions in some loyalist and unionist communities.
Bertie Ahern, who is one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, said the idea that Protocol is about trade “just passes them by.”
He added: “In fact they’re not interested.”
“It’s seen as a trick by the south to move the border from across the island, and to put it down the Irish Sea, as a trap for government.”
“That’s how they see it.”
“Even those who you might consider to be a bit more intelligent and articulate. That is the difficulty.”
Ahern said negotiations over the protocol are made more difficult by this view.

He said: “We’re trying to do two things.”
“We’re trying to solve the difficulties of medicine and meats and everything else in the protocol.“
“But there’s another issue in the protocol, and that’s what is in the head and the ideological one, and that’s a far more difficult one to deal with.“
“(DUP leader) Jeffrey Donaldson well understands how we might get over the detail, and the reason he keeps on about the other issue is because he’s trying to – which I don’t blame him for – he’s trying to serve the loyalist community as well.”

DUP reaction
DUP MP for East Belfast Gavin Robinson called on Ahern to apologise for his comments.
“To associate East Belfast with a ghetto and suggest loyalists are not able to understand the protocol is demeaning and degrading,” he said.
“People in my constituency who can’t get their Amazon parcels from another part of the United Kingdom well understand the impact of the protocol.”
“Rather than belittling those who oppose the protocol, Bertie Ahern should seek to understand why not a single elected unionist in Northern Ireland supports the protocol.”
“As a man who was central to the Belfast Agreement being negotiated, Bertie should be honest in recognising that the protocol does alter Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom single market without any consent from people living here.”
Senior DUP MLA Diane Dodds was also critical.In a post on Twitter, she said: “Coming from the Dublin elite the snide comments in this piece about loyalist communities are despicable.”
EU package
Speaking earlier, the Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the EU had offered a comprehensive package to the UK, aimed at easing the effects of the Protocol.
He said: “This package represented a significant compromise for the EU.”
“The lack of any evident reciprocal willingness to compromise from our UK partners to date has been deeply disappointing.”
“The protocol was agreed by Lord Frost and Prime Minister [Boris] Johnson, approved by this British government and ratified by the current UK Parliament.”
“They have a duty to deliver on their commitments.”
“It is very important we do not lose sight of the goal here, ensuring an outcome that is best for the people of Northern Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/sunak-promises-to-be-resolute-in-protocol-talks-6001620-Feb2023/,"RISHI SUNAK HAS promised to be “resolute” in defending Northern Ireland as he seeks a deal to rewrite the terms of its post-Brexit arrangements.
The British Prime Minister indicated that he would put any new deal to MPs House of Commons for a chance to express their views, risking a showdown with Eurosceptics on the Tory benches.
The UK Government and the European Union are still negotiating changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol, the arrangements aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“I am a Conservative, a Brexiter and a unionist, and any agreement that we reach needs to tick all three boxes,” Sunak told MPs during Prime Minister’s Questions.
“It needs to ensure sovereignty for Northern Ireland, it needs to safeguard Northern Ireland’s place in our union, and it needs to find practical solutions to the problems faced by people and businesses,” he said.
“I will be resolute in fighting for what is best for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.”
Labour leader Keir Starmer said his party’s MPs would vote to get a deal through the Commons, suggesting that Sunak should rely on opposition support rather than trying to win over the “irreconcilables”, the “malcontents” and “wreckers” on the Tory benches.
He said the British Prime Minister had to be “honest” that there would be a continued role for the European Court of Justice and Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow some of Brussels’ laws.
Being forced to rely on Labour votes to overcome a revolt on his own benches would undermine Sunak’s leadership and he is determined to win over potential rebels.
Sunak said he wanted a deal that guaranteed “sovereignty for Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland’s place in our precious union” and provided “practical solutions to the problems faced by people and businesses”.
He added: “I have a good understanding of what is required and I will keep fighting until we get it.”
Sunak said Starmer’s approach was to “give the EU a blank cheque and agree to anything they offer. It’s not a strategy, that’s surrender”.
Pressed on whether MPs would get a vote on any changes to the protocol agreed with Brussels, Sunak said: “Of course Parliament will express its view.”

The protocol, agreed as part of the UK’s Brexit deal, effectively kept Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, meaning checks on products crossing from Great Britain.
The situation led to the collapse of powersharing in Northern Ireland, with the DUP protesting about the barrier to trade with the rest of the UK.
With the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in April, there is symbolic importance in getting a deal which could allow the Stormont administration to be re-established.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson told Sunak: “It is unacceptable that Northern Ireland has been put in this place with a protocol imposed upon us, that harms our place in the UK.
“It must be replaced with arrangements that are acceptable and restore our place in the UK and its internal market.”
He warned that it was “unacceptable” for EU laws to be imposed on Northern Ireland with no democratic scrutiny or consent and said any deal must not involve simply “tweaking” the protocol but instead “rewriting the legally binding treaty text”.
Sunak said addressing the “democratic deficit” was an essential part of the negotiations with Brussels and he had heard the DUP’s concerns “loud and clear”.
Donaldson addressed Tory Eurosceptics last night, and the views of the DUP on any deal will carry significant weight for potential Conservative rebels.
UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic have held a series of talks in recent days as intensive work to finalise a deal has continued.
Sefcovic yesterday said the EU has made “good progress” with the UK on the protocol talks and that they can clearly see the “finishing line”.
He said the EU is “ready to progress as quickly as possible”, but added the negotiations are very complex and detailed.
“Therefore, we want to make sure we cross all the t’s … and arrive at a joint solution with our UK partners,” he said.
Minister of State for European Affairs Peter Burke yesterday said it’s very important to grasp what he’s calling a “very narrow window of opportunity” when it comes to talks on the protocol.

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-knuckle-down-on-protocol-talks-5606028-Nov2021/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS urged the UK and EU to resolve the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements.
UK Brexit Minster David Frost will hold further talks with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic tomorrow, with the UK still warning that it could unilaterally suspend parts of the NI deal unless major changes are made.
But Micheál Martin has said this evening he was encouraged that progress is being made and the “mood music” has changed.
In a BBC interview, Martin cautioned the UK against taking the step of triggering Article 16 of the Protocol, the step which would suspend parts of the arrangements.

Martin said the European Commission had put forward a “comprehensive package of measures” to address the concerns raised about the protocol, adding that some EU members thought Sefcovic had gone “too far” in the concessions he had offered to reduce checks.
He said he believed serious talks were taking place between the UK and EU and “where there is a will, there is a way, and I think both sides just need to knuckle down and get it resolved”.
Negotiations on the Brexit trade deal a year ago stretched until 24 December and Martin said “don’t leave it to Christmas Eve this year”.
Asked whether he could trust UK prime minister Boris Johnson, the Taoiseach said: “I get on well with Boris Johnson on a personal level.”
Today, Frost told peers that the option of using Article 16 remained on the table despite speculation a deal was within reach.
Martin said “my own view is that unilateralism never works” and using Article 16 would have a “very negative” impact.

In UK Parliament, Frost said Brussels should not interpret his “reasonable tone” in talks to imply any softening of the UK’s position.
He told the House of Lords: “Whatever messages to the contrary the EU think they have heard or read, our position has not changed.
“But I want to be clear, I would not recommend any outcome from the negotiations that I did not believe safeguarded political, economic or social stability in Northern Ireland.
“In such circumstances, we would obviously need to provide the necessary safeguards using Article 16 and those safeguards are very much on the table and they are a legitimate provision in the protocol.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/belfast-court-rejects-unionists-legal-challenge-against-protocol-5481506-Jun2021/,"LEGAL CHALLENGES AGAINST the lawfulness of the Northern Ireland Protocol have been dismissed by a High Court judge in Belfast.
Mr Justice Colton rejected arguments that the contentious post-Brexit trading arrangements breached the terms of the 1800 Acts of Union and the 1998 legislation that underpins the Good Friday Peace Agreement.
In a lengthy judgment, the judge agreed with the applicants’ contention that the Brexit Withdrawal Act, in which the Protocol is enshrined, conflicted with the 1800 Acts of Union.
But he ruled that both were constitutional legislation and said that the Withdrawal Act, which was expressly agreed by Parliament, effectively overrode the provisions of the 200-year old law.
The judge also dismissed the arguments put forward by the applicants that the Protocol breaches key provisions of the 1998 Northern Ireland Act, in particular related to the consent mechanisms contained in the law that flowed from the historic peace deal of 23 years ago.

He ruled the Protocol did not breach articles 1 and 42 of the Act.
The judge also refused the judicial review ground that Northern Ireland citizens’ human rights are being breached by being unable to influence the EU laws that apply in the region, by not being able to elect MEPs to the European Parliament.
He also rejected the argument that the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol breach EU law.
The lead judicial review case was pursued in the names of unionists and Brexiteers from across the UK, including former DUP leader Arlene Foster, former UUP leader Steve Aiken, TUV leader Jim Allister, Belfast Agreement architect and former First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Kate Hoey.
An adjoined case was taken by Belfast pastor Clifford Peebles.
Both were dismissed by the judge in Belfast today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/joint-eu-uk-trade-enforcement-consideration-dup-6102147-Jun2023/,"A SYSTEM OF mutual enforcement on post-Brexit trade by both the UK and EU merits “serious and sustained consideration”, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said.
The suggested replacement for the Northern Ireland Protocol/Windsor Framework is set out in a report drawn up by pro-Brexit think tank the Centre for Brexit Policy.
The group contends the current arrangements, which involve checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland, have failed and only a radical redrawing of the trading arrangements will be enough to convince the DUP to return to powersharing at Stormont.
The DUP has been blockading devolution in Northern Ireland for more than a year in protest against the protocol.
Leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson said the proposals could ‘end the logjam’
The party says the Windsor Framework, struck by the EU and UK earlier this year as a way to reduce red tape on trade between GB and NI, does not go far enough.
Donaldson has made clear the DUP will not return to Stormont until the UK Government provides further legislative assurances around Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.
The mutual enforcement system would see the UK and EU implement the other’s trading rule and regulations to protect their respective markets.
Under the proposals, UK officials would enforce the laws of the EU in the UK, and EU officials would enforce UK laws inside the single market.
That would see UK exporters to the EU who break EU rules being punished by UK courts, with no role for the European Court of Justice in Northern Ireland, while EU exporters to the UK would be policed by EU officials inside the bloc.
The paper, which has been presented to the UK Government, will be launched at Westminster on Tuesday.
The think tank insists mutual enforcement would address DUP concerns about Northern Ireland’s sovereignty as part of the United Kingdom and still provide for a free flowing border on the island of Ireland.
Donaldson, who has penned a foreword to the report, said the “corrosive impact” of the protocol has been undeniable.

“The DUP wants to see Stormont back up and running again as soon as possible and on a sound and stable foundation,” he wrote.
“The stakes are extremely high and this necessitates a willingness on all sides to engage constructively with proposals that could help end the logjam and protect our place in the internal market of the United Kingdom.
“Although the DUP has set out criteria against which we will assess any proposal, we have been clear throughout that mutual enforcement is a concept worthy of serious and sustained consideration in terms of delivering a longer-term solution.
“The vast majority of trade from Great Britain is destined for, and remains, within Northern Ireland. There is a negligible risk to the integrity of the EU market.
“Indeed it is hard to find a single reported case of goods crossing the border since 2020 which have been a threat to their Irish and EU consumers – despite many EU rules not having been applied.
The DUP has been blockading devolution at Stormont for more than a year over the protocol
“Even where goods are destined for the EU, it seems reasonable that each side could maintain regulatory autonomy whilst enforcing whatever rules the other seeks to impose on only those goods crossing the border.
“In the longer term, this would sustainably address the potential problems caused by the imposition of regulations by an entirely separate regulatory regime and respect our constitutional position as part of the UK.”
David Jones, the deputy chairman of the ERG, has also written a foreword.
“It is clear that the protocol is not a sustainable long-term arrangement,” he said.
“Sooner or later – and preferably sooner – it will have to be replaced by something better.
“This paper presents a workable solution to the problem. Mutual enforcement is an elegant and effective arrangement that respects the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and restores the full place of Northern Ireland in our Union.
“Equally, it protects the integrity of both the EU single market and the UK internal market. It dispenses with the anomalous state of affairs whereby the court of one party to the Withdrawal Agreement has jurisdiction over the other.
“Mutual enforcement, in short, will normalise relations between the UK and the EU, thrown out of kilter by the Northern Ireland Protocol.”","12.42pm, 25 Jun 2023",

POLITICS IN THE North is often a story of elastic deadlines – dates for doing things that are often stretched.
We are in one of those waiting rooms right now… waiting to see if 28 October really is a decision day.
Before this month is out, NI Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris might have to decide whether to send the Stormont parties to yet another election – this a consequence of our once-more broken politics.
He says he will do so if there’s not a fully-functioning Stormont Executive by then.
But will he, or will the date disappear as so many others have?
We wait to see.
DUP holding firm
In the long saga of the post-Brexit Irish Sea border row, the DUP is refusing to nominate for the position of deputy First Minister.
They are no longer the largest party at Stormont.
It means that the joint office at the top of the Executive can’t function. So, Michelle O’Neill remains First Minister designate.
For now, that date in October – the 28th – is the deadline to try to fix things.
It is about the Union itself and Northern Ireland’s place and status within it.
One of the party’s senior figures, former short-time leader Edwin Poots, raised the possibility of a funeral for the Good Friday Agreement in its 25th anniversary year of 2023 if the issue of the Protocol is not resolved and there is no government.
More a wake than a celebration.
But that comment triggered another thought in my head; that in such circumstances another line would be written into the long obituary of the Union.
The idea of a British Government-only decision-making process in Northern Ireland is not the real world. Not anymore.
Advertisement
The ‘New Ireland’ conversation would get louder.
A sense of losing
Perhaps change is the real crisis in Northern Ireland.
That it is not just about the sea border. There is this wider script, seen in the electoral trend since 2017.
Unionists have lost their overall Stormont majority. Their second seat in the European Parliament in the 2019 election.
The results of the UK General Election in that same year mean they no longer hold a majority of NI seats at Westminster.
What would happen if the secretary of state decided on another election in just a few weeks’ time – stuck to the date on his calendar?
An election when so many people will be cold in their homes, struggling to put food on the table, to pay mortgages, to breathe in this cost-of-living crisis. And with Christmas and its costs to think about.
How would the party-blocking government perform against that backdrop?
The broken glass of Brexit
The story of recent years is of damaged relationships – the shattered and scattered pieces of Brexit.
Broken glass cutting deep.
Goodwill bleeding out of the relationships that have gotten us this far.
Internal NI relations damaged, North-South, East-West.
When you break the template, you break the process.
In the here and now, in the mess that they have made, you would imagine elections there or here would be the last thing on their minds.
Not that they would admit to that.
In all the noise of now, two sounds were heard above all else in recent days; cans being kicked down the road, and a penny dropping.

There has been a clear attempt to de-escalate things, change the language, make a better mood. Try to find some trust. Start the talking again – UK-Europe and UK-Ireland.
We’ve all heard the new and measured words. Seen the pictures. Yes, the gaps on the Protocol are what they were – still wide.
That’s what the then NI Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney did in the talks that saved Stormont in their agreement of 2020.
It is what the governments and Europe must do now.
That’s the real world. How politics works.
None of this will be done in a hurry.
Not before 28 October.
There’s a decision to be made by the DUP.
If it is to continue to block the Executive, then there is a decision for the NI Secretary of State.
A winter election, with all its cold and costs.
Who wins? Who loses?
There is also a bigger question.
Can we have political stability while in the waiting room of that other question – Union versus Unity?
We don’t know when it will be asked or what the answer will be.
But it is part of the everyday conversation now. Brexit has shattered the old certainties.

In his speech to the Conservative Party spring conference in Blackpool, Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom”, with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”.
The comparison was criticised by Tory peer Gavin Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the European Union.
In his speech, Johnson said: “I know that it’s the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time.
“I can give you a couple of famous recent examples.
“When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I don’t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. It’s because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.”

In an invite seen by the PA news agency, DUP party executive members were invited to register for a short-notice meeting at 7pm on Monday.
It says that Donaldson “wishes to provide a detailed update on the current political situation”.
The DUP has stayed out of the institutions at Stormont for almost two years in an effort to force the Government to act on unionist concerns over the impact of the Windsor Framework on the union.
The party has been criticised for its stance both by those frustrated at the effective collapsing of Stormont, and those within the wider unionist movement, claiming it has not achieved enough to protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK.
Earlier this week, Donaldson said he has faced threats, and also urged others against opposing a deal that has yet to be agreed.
A DUP spokesperson said: “We do not comment on internal meetings.”
DUP MLA Edwin Poots told BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show on Friday that his party has been working “extremely hard” to resolve the impasse.
“That piece of work continues,” he added.

He declined to comment on what happened at a meeting of the party officers last Friday, amid speculation there had been a planned vote on its deal with the Government, saying he respects the press statements that are put out.
The party said that evening that it was continuing to engage with the UK Government, and would not “give a running commentary on our position”.
“There is a course of work that has been done thus far and that’s a course of work that is ongoing and we are determined to bring that to a conclusion,” Mr Poots said.
“Some people are wondering about this but you will just have to wait and see what the party puts out in terms of its press releases on what happened at various meetings.
“The DUP is working constructively to try to find solutions to all of this.”
He also criticised some other unionists who have accused the DUP of being “traitors”.
“Why would we have done what we’ve done for the last two years and go back with nothing, and people should reflect on that,” he said.
Meanwhile he described reports that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak might offer to voluntarily limit divergence from EU rules in the future, to limit the impact of an Irish Sea trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as just “one element” of a prospective deal.
“That would be a win but on its own it wouldn’t be any use, if people thought that is what was on offer, that wouldn’t be acceptable on its own,” he said.

“The health and safety of our staff remains our top priority,” said a council spokesman.
Inspectors employed by Stormont’s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs were also withdrawn from duties on Monday evening. That move impacted both Larne and Belfast.
The department had not yet made a decision on their return this evening.
A spokeswoman said: “The department has received the findings of the formal threat assessment from the PSNI and is currently considering it alongside its own internal risk assessment.

Police blamed the graffiti and menacing online comments on disgruntled individuals and small groups and have made clear there is no evidence of wider paramilitary involvement in threats.
The council workers’ return to duties was announced as the European Commission said it was exploring all “flexibilities” available within Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade deal.
President Ursula von der Leyen recognised particular concern around the health certification of imported food products.
The DUP has vowed to scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol, which keeps the Irish land border open since the country follows EU regulations, following disruption to some supplies from the rest of the UK earlier this year.
Unionists and loyalists believe Northern Ireland’s position within the UK has been undermined by the new trading arrangements.
Von der Leyen told Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey: “I can assure you that the Commission has been exploring all flexibilities available under the applicable rules of Union law and within the framework of the protocol, in order to facilitate the implementation of the protocol, whilst fully protecting the integrity of the Union’s single market and customs union.”
Stormont’s First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster has said unionist frustrations at the trade border on the Irish Sea must be channelled through constitutional means.
PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne has warned of a “febrile” atmosphere.
Foster’s sentiment was echoed by the Taoiseach Michéal Martin who has said parties needed to “dial down the rhetoric” over the protocol amid rising tensions.
Supermarket shelves were partially emptied of fresh goods at the start of the year and some businesses based in Great Britain were ill-prepared for the extra paperwork required when shipping goods to NI.
Some parcel deliveries have also been affected and a series of grace periods limiting the extent of new regulatory and customs processes on incoming good from GB are due to expire as the year progresses.

She added: “We have made the case to the Prime Minister and now the people have made a very public appeal to the Government of their country to act.

A GREEN/RED LANE system for the movement of goods and “not for EU” labels are among key measures of the Windsor Framework coming into effect for Northern Ireland today.
Goods coming into the region which are travelling to the Republic of Ireland or elsewhere in the EU will use the conceptual “red lane”, which includes customs declarations and some checks.
Goods to be sold in Northern Ireland will use a notional “green lane” with minimal paperwork and no checks.
Companies that use the green lane will be signed up to a trusted trader scheme.
The Windsor Framework has already introduced the same VAT, alcohol duty and energy tax rules as the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland, which did not exist under the Protocol.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said the vast majority of Northern Ireland’s economic life remains “umbilically connected to the rest of the UK”, with most of the economy untouched by anything in the Windsor Framework, adding that concerns over the supply of human medicines have been addressed.
The changes are designed to cut paperwork and red tape for many traders.
Heaton-Harris wrote in the News Letter on Saturday: “The steak bake or infamous sausage roll will never again need to be accompanied by a signed certificate from a vet to move into NI from GB, removing a major irritant with the old arrangements.”
Consumers may notice some changes in Northern Ireland and parts of the UK with the introduction of “not for EU” labels and other information in stores on some products, to prevent these from being sold in Ireland.
These labels on meat and dairy will apply in stores in Great Britain next year.
Stuart Anderson, head of public affairs for Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: “A significant amount of work has been undertaken in a short time to get us to this implementation phase, particularly by those involved in the retail supply chain.
“These are new processes being applied to what are often high-volume and complex movements.
“But business has worked hard to ensure we get off to the best possible start.
“This is new for everyone involved.
“Continued engagement and a solutions-focused approach with government will be important to help businesses adapt and deal with any issues as and when they arise.”
Chris Heaton-Harris opened his speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester today by saying his job as Northern Ireland Secretary is “the best job in Government”.

He said the Government agreed the Windsor Framework with the European Union after recognising flaws with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He said the framework removes trade barriers, allows goods available in Great Britain to move freely to Northern Ireland, and safeguards the regions place within the United Kingdom internal market.
“I know concerns remain in Northern Ireland about the Windsor Framework and we will continue to work to address them. There is scope to do so, based on the principle that the UK internal market must be promoted as well as protected.
“But let us also remind ourselves of the fundamental truth – the vast majority of Northern Ireland’s economic life is dependent on its connection with the rest of the United Kingdom and that reality will not change.
“It’s time to get on with business.”
Heaton-Harris told the Conservative conference that he has been working to get politicians back to Stormont and that there is “scope” to deal with unionist concerns.
“So I say to my friends in the unionist community we will continue working to answer your remaining concerns.
“You know, and we know, progress has been made and we are working in a constructive spirit.
“And it is clear that the vast majority of people and their political leaders want to get this done.”
In his speech, he hailed businesses such as the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding yard, Hinch Distillery, O’Neills sportswear and the Game Of Thrones Studios.
“O’Neills is just one example of how Northern Ireland contributes to our economy and the Union.”
He said he was also “actively exploring” a new ferry route between Larne and Liverpool.
Heaton-Harris said more than 1,600 new businesses have signed up to the UK internal market scheme, meaning “more traders than ever want to do business in Northern Ireland”.
Speaking on the main stage at the Tory conference, the Northern Ireland Secretary said: “Let me just give you one stat to demonstrate how the Windsor Framework is a major improvement on the protocol and how it will be noticed by the people of Northern Ireland itself.
“Over 1,600 new businesses have signed up to our new internal market scheme, meaning more traders than ever want to do business in Northern Ireland.
“Conference, I just want to say something about the future of Northern Ireland: there’s always been a lot of doom and gloom around this subject for too long.
“In reality, Northern Ireland’s economic prospects are unbelievably promising. A couple of weeks ago, I, alongside the Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi (Badenoch), hosted an investment summit in Northern Ireland, 160 international businesses came along, some visiting Northern Ireland for the first time.
“They came because business truly recognises the opportunities that exist.”","7.54am, 1 Oct 2023",1 Oct 2023
https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-stormont-minister-halts-construction-of-inspection-posts-ports-5366920-Feb2021/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S AGRICULTURE Minister has halted construction of permanent inspection facilities for post-Brexit checks on agri-foods arriving from Great Britain.
DUP minister Gordon Lyons has also stopped further recruitment of inspection staff for the port facilities and ordered an end to charges levied at the ports on traders bringing goods from GB into Northern Ireland.
The SDLP has called for an emergency Executive meeting following Agriculture Minister’s “unilateral” decision.
Lyons’s decision relates to ongoing work on new purpose-built inspection facilities at ports like Belfast and Larne. Ongoing Irish-Sea trade checks, which are taking place at existing repurposed port buildings and other temporary facilities, will continue.
“This is in and around a number of areas, first of all further infrastructure, any further infrastructure builds; the additional recruitment of staff; and also the charging at the ports,” he said.
The decisions come amid the ongoing controversy over disruption caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which implements Brexit trade rules that avoid a border on the island of Ireland.
Unionists are unhappy at the Protocol’s requirement for checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
They claim it has driven an economic wedge between the region and Great Britain, and has undermined the Union as a result.

Lyons said his move was in response to the “practical difficulties” caused by the Protocol.
He cited uncertainty over the movement of goods once grace periods – currently waiving other Protocol checks – end on 1 April. The UK government has requested an extension of these grace periods from the European Commission.
Both sides are in discussions with one another to find solutions to make the Protocol work for effectively.
Lyons said:
SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said that the DUP cannot “pick and choose” which duties and obligations of Executive leadership it wants to adhere to.
“It is deeply concerning that DUP Ministers are actively trying to sabotage the arrangements and inject further uncertainty into a difficult situation for local businesses to suit their own narrow political interests.”
SDLP deputy leader and Stormont’s Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said:
“This is a five party Executive facing two significant crises – a global pandemic and the impact of Brexit. We should be taking decisions together in the substantial common interests of the people we represent – not using political office for divisive stunts

The UK Government’s chief negotiator to the EU, David Frost, is to meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic today, in the latest round of talks about the Northern Ireland Protocol.
In October, the EU offered a series of changes to the protocol, which would remove 80% of checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the UK mainland.
But the UK Government wants further alterations, including removing the role of the judges in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the arbitrators of disputes.
The talks over the protocol, which is designed to maintain free-flowing borderless trade on the island of Ireland, remain deadlocked.
There is growing speculation that the UK is poised to use a get-out clause from the deal in the coming weeks.
Previous talks in London on 29 October.PAPA
Frost told the House of Lords on Wednesday that triggering Article 16 – which would effectively suspend elements of the arrangements – would be the UK’s only option if the dispute was not resolved.

He there was “a real opportunity to turn away from confrontation, to move beyond our current difficulties and put in place a new, and better, equilibrium” in the talks.
But he added it was “not inevitable” that Article 16 would be triggered.
He said: “In my view, this talks process has not reached its end.
“Although we have been talking nearly four weeks now, there remain possibilities that the talks have not yet seriously examined, including many approaches suggested by the UK.
“There is more to do and I will certainly not give up on this process unless and until it is abundantly clear that nothing more can be done. We are certainly not there yet.
“If, however, we do in due course reach that point, the Article 16 safeguards will be our only option.”
The Irish Government has held talks with US President Joe Biden’s administration about the protocol.
Yesterday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said contact with the US government was designed to “encourage progress” in negotiations.
The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market for goods, resulting in some checks for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.

“But we want to see Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market fully restored.”

Electoral pact?
Withpolls indicating that the unionist voteis being split between the three unionist parties, giving Sinn Féin a clear lead, it was reported today that DUP and The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have reached an agreement on how to cooperate in the forthcoming election.
News Letter reports reports comments from Donaldson who said that both parties are awaiting a response from the UUP on whether they will join the alliance.
“I think every political party has the right to contest an election in a democracy. But we need to cooperate. And I am happy to say Jim (Allister, TUV leader) and I have already agreed this. Unfortunately it is not yet agreed by all the unionist political partie, ” Donaldson said.
Upheaval
Northern Ireland was plunged into fresh political upheaval recently when the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in protest at the deal.
The party said the protocol, which has created trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, had undermined a cornerstone of power-sharing in the region – governance with the consent of both nationalists and unionists.
Johnson signed the protocol with the EU as a measure to stop a hard border being erected, and jeopardising the peace process, on the island of Ireland.

But his government is trying to renegotiate the deal, arguing that it is hampering the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland and damaging community relations.
Stormont Assembly elections are scheduled for May 5, but in the meantime there is no functioning Executive.
Donaldson said political decisions continued to me made, adding: “The departmental ministers remain in place and are able to take decisions. The Assembly continues to meet and passes legislation.
“But obviously without an Executive being able to meet, without the North-South Ministerial Council being in place, there are certain decisions that can’t be taken.
“Over two years later it has not done so and we believe the UK Government has dishonoured the agreement that was the basis upon which the devolved institutions were restored in Northern Ireland, and frankly we feel that it is now time for the Government to follow through and honour that commitment.”

IF THE UK Government moves to unilaterally override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the North could be in a “very dangerous place”, Michelle O’Neill has said.
The Sinn Féin Vice President toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthat such a move by the UK, and any retaliation from the European Union, would result in Northern Ireland being “caught out in the middle of a game of chicken”.
The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is today expected to declare her intention to bring forward legislation which rips up parts of the UK’s post-Brexit trade deal on Northern Ireland.
It is understood that Truss will make the announcement in a statement to the Commons following a full Cabinet meeting, in an attempt to restore power-sharing in the region.
The row over the protocol has created an impasse in efforts to form a new executive in Stormont, with the Democratic Unionist Party refusing to join a new administration unless its concerns over the arrangements are addressed.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Belfast yesterday to meet leaders of the Stormont parties in an attempt to secure progress – but he also used the trip to issue a warning to Brussels that the UK is prepared to rewrite unilaterally the terms of the Brexit deal he signed.
O’Neill today described the meeting with Johnson as “a very robust exchange of views”.
“I’m very firmly of the view – we’re very firmly of the view – that Boris Johnson is pandering to the DUP. He is assisting them in their nonsense in terms of trying to prevent an Executive being formed, a Government that will actually deliver to the public in the aftermath of an election,” she said.
O’Neill said if the UK attempts to unilaterally override parts of the protocol, there will be “further political instability and further economic uncertainty” in Northern Ireland.
She said that such a scenario could see the North “caught in the middle” and being used as “a pawn” in a row between the Conservative Party and the EU.

A majority of MLAs in Stormont’s newly elected Assembly represent parties that support retaining the protocol, with many arguing that the arrangement offers the region protection from some of the negative economic consequences of Brexit.
The threat of unilateral action has already gone down badly in European capitals, with EU leaders urging the UK Government to fully participate in talks.
Foreign Secretary Liz TrussPA ImagesPA Images
European Commissioner Mairéad McGuinness today said “there won’t be a knee-jerk reaction” from the EU.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, McGuinness said: “I think in all of this process, which has been lengthy and where there has been some testing of patience, we’ve held our patience because we see the need for both action and compromise … Despite provocations, we have to maintain that level of engagement.”
She continued: “We’re all a little bit confused as to what to expect because there have been many twists and turns in the last week as to what might happen around the protocol. We’ve had some very extreme language, we’ve had somepullback.”
McGuinness said the build-up to Truss’ statement “has not been pleasant at all” but “there is political will here in the European Union and the Commission to resolve the outstanding issues around the implementation of the protocol”.
“We can’t do that sitting at the table on our own. And indeed, the British Government can’t do it on its own in the House of Commons. We have to do it together.”
McGuinness added that the “vast majority” of elected members of the new Assembly in Northern Ireland “don’t want unilateral action, they don’t want to see further destabilisation”.
‘Not about picking a fight’
A Foreign Office source said “this isn’t about picking a fight with the EU”, saying that Truss’ priority is to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.
“The peace process and acting in the interests of Northern Ireland is what motivates her,” they said.

The PA news agency understands Truss’ ambition is to lay the legislation in Parliament within a couple of weeks, and certainly before the summer. But the overwhelming preference is thought to remain a negotiated solution.
The Global Britain (Strategy) Committee, which considers matters relating to the UK’s trade priorities, will meet first on Tuesday, followed by the full Cabinet, before Truss delivers her statement to the Commons.
Yesterday evening, the UK Foreign Secretary held calls with Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic.
In both, Truss said she underlined the importance of upholding the Good Friday Agreement and re-establishing the Northern Ireland Executive.
Sefcovic later said engaging with “flexibilities” offered by the EU would be preferable to taking unilateral action on the protocol.
He tweeted: “With political will, practical issues arising from the implementation of the protocol in Northern Ireland can be resolved.
“Engaging with us on the flexibilities we offer would be a better course of action than unilateral one. We’re ready to play our part, as from the outset.”
Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday said that the only way to resolve the row was “substantive talks” between the UK and the EU.

Donaldson had said in recent weeks that the UK government was “moving closer” to addressing his party’s concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, and that the coming weeks would be “vital”.
The party leader said today there were still “significant” gaps that require a resolution before a proposal could be presented to his party.
When asked if Stormont would return by the end of the year, he said he could not be sure.
“I don’t know if that is going to be the case, I can’t be certain that we’re going to get an agreement,” he said.
“But we’ll keep working at this because we want to see Stormont restored, but it has to be on the basis that unionists as well as nationalists can support, and that means restoring Northern Ireland’s place in the UK and its internal market.”

The DUP withdrew from Northern Ireland’s assembly in February 2022 in protest against the internal UK trade barriers created by the post-Brexit protocol.
Power-sharing is unable to function in Northern Ireland without the participation of the largest unionist party.
The UK and EU agreed the Windsor Framework earlier this year in an attempt to address unionist concerns about the protocol, but the DUP has indicated it will not return to the Stormont Assembly until the UK government provides further assurances over Northern Ireland’s place in the UK.
“We’re working on those issues and I hope we can make further progress in the weeks ahead, but we don’t yet have an agreement,” Donaldson told Cool FM.
“We’re not yet at the point where I can take back a comprehensive proposal to my party.
“We were engaged with the Government today, and will continue to talk to them to close those gaps, there are significant issues that need to be resolved and we’ll keep working at it until we get solutions.”
Asked whether the UK government would have other priorities next year as it prepares for a general election, Donaldson said: “We don’t have a deadline and we’ll keep working at this until we get the right outcome, I hope that that can happen sooner rather than later.
“In terms of where those gaps are that I’ve spoken of, they deal with significant issues, we’ve made progress on those issues, and I welcome that, and we need just to press on to get to the final outcome.”","8.10pm, 1 Nov 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-ni-protocol-port-checks-5443367-May2021/,"THE NUMBER OF checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain could be reduced by 80%, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said.
Coveney said that option exists within the Northern Ireland Protocol if the UK was willing to agreed a common approach to standards in relation to veterinary practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards on food.
A new raft of checks on goods at the ports of Belfast and Larne under the terms of the protocol have sparked anger among unionists and loyalists who feel Northern Ireland is being separated from the rest of the UK.
Both outgoing DUP leader Arlene Foster and her incoming successor Edwin Poots have insisted the protocol must be scrapped.
The UK and the EU remain in talks.
Speaking in Dublin as he welcomed his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian and the French minister for European affairs Clement Beaune to Farmleigh Estate in Dublin for talks, Coveney urged progress.
He emphasised the Northern Ireland Protocol was “negotiated, designed, agreed, voted on and ratified as part of the Withdrawal Agreement by both the UK and the EU”.
He also insisted that the disruption has been caused by the “type of Brexit that was chosen by the British Government”, not the protocol.
“The United Kingdom is of course raising questions around the implementation of the agreement now which is problematic and I think it is important to say that the politics around the protocol in Northern Ireland are dangerous, divisive and very polarising,” he said.
“So we do need to work together to find a way of implementing the protocol in a way that is consistent with the commitments in that protocol but in a way that limits the disruption for people who have genuine concerns in Northern Ireland.
“But I believe we can do that within the confines of the protocol itself, in terms of flexibility and pragmatism and I think that Vice President Sefcovic working with Lord Frost need to find a way of doing that, and I believe on the EU side, certainly they can.”

Coveney said: “For example, we could reduce the number of checks in ports in Belfast and in Larne by 80% if the British Government decided they were willing to agree with the EU a common approach to standards in relation to veterinary practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards on food.
“That option is there within the confines of the protocol and it could dramatically reduce the number of checks linked to the protocol that many people are upset about.
“There is a way forward here but it has to be on the basis of partnership, not a British Government trying to outmanoeuvre the EU politically in the context of articles in the Financial Times or the Spectator or in other newspapers.”
Coveney said unilateral action by the British Government would be “a disaster for relationships, for trust and for politics”.
Jean-Yves Le Drian said the protocol was agreed by the UK and it is binding.
Beaune was critical of the UK over fishing.
He said he expected “full and speedy compliance with the commitment made”.
“We negotiated side by side with Ireland and all of our European partners a deal that is binding, binding on the European Union and the United Kingdom,” he said.
Speaking ahead of the meeting Coveney thanked France for its “unwavering support” to Ireland throughout the Brexit process and its “dedication to the peace process and relationships on this island”.
Le Drian responded saying the Northern Ireland Protocol is “not just about complying with commitments made, but also about peace”.
“The United Kingdom remain a key partner for us and there are many things we have to do in our common interests, but now it is for the United Kingdom to tell us what they are ready for. We stand ready to work together like I told Dominic Raab a week ago,” he said.
He described an earlier visit to Dublin Port, where he saw the implementation of customs and health controls on goods arriving from Great Britain, as “very interesting”.
It was indicated that French president Emmanuel Macron would visit Ireland before the end of 2021.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-uk-trade-war-brexit-article-16-5626354-Dec2021/,"IN 1932, IN response to the newly installed Fianna Fáil government’s refusal to continue paying annuities for loans given to Irish farmers in the 19th century, the then-British government put a tax on Irish imports to Britain.
Éamon De Valera’s government responded by hitting British imports to Ireland with tariffs, kickstarting an Economic War between the two countries. The trade war would last until 1938, and would hit Ireland a lot harder than the UK.
In the end, despite the Irish government eventually winning a reduction in the amount they had to pay the British, the Economic War would damage the Irish economy, particularly larger farmers, for whom Great Britain was the main export market.
Today, almost 90 years later, there has been talk of another trade war involving the United Kingdom and Ireland, but this time Ireland is part of a larger adversary in the form of the wider European Union.
The dispute centres around the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, which came into effect this year, after the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.
The issue of contention relates to Northern Ireland, and whether or not the UK government will suspend key parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, which experts say will trigger a response from the EU, which in turn could start a trade war.
But does either side want a trade war? How likely is it to happen? And what would a trade war look like, and how would it affect Ireland?
Avoiding a hard border
After the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, years of negotiations took place (both between the EU and UK, and domestically within the UK itself) before Brexit formally happened in January 2020.
A transition period – during which nothing changed – was in place until 31 December last year, before the Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force, which handles the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and UK.
During negotiations between the two sides, one of the main sticking points was how trade would be handled with Northern Ireland, which is formally part of the UK but also on the island of Ireland.
Both sides stressed the need to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent a return to conflict. However, they disagreed on how to achieve this goal.
Eventually an agreement was reached, when the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland (known as the Northern Ireland Protocol) was signed in 2019.
Under the Protocol, Northern Ireland effectively remains in the EU customs union and the single market for goods.
Northern Ireland still adheres to EU standards, and so is allowed to trade freely with Ireland and the rest of the EU.
However, because the UK has left the EU, checks must now take place on goods coming into the North from England, Scotland and Wales, which has led to claims that the border has essentially been moved to the Irish Sea – angering unionists.
Misgivings
Since it came into force, the UK government and unionist parties in Northern Ireland have expressed serious misgivings about the Protocol.
The UK’s Chief Brexit Negotiator David Frostsaid back in Maythat “the Protocol is presenting significant challenges for many in Northern Ireland”.
The DUP has called for it to be scrapped,while businesses in Northern Ireland have saidthat elements are working, but that the Protocol is also causing them problems.
The EU subsequently proposed changes in October, which it said would result in an 80% reduction in checks for retail agri-food products arriving in the North from the rest of Britain.
However, the UK wants further concessions, and last month it was threatening to trigger Article 16 of the Protocol, which would suspend elements of it entirely.
This move – seen as highly aggressive by the EU – would likely result in a retaliation, which it has been speculated could lead to an eventual trade war between both sides.
So what would happen if the UK triggered Article 16?
According to Edgar Morgenroth, Professor of Economics at DCU Business School, the European Union would respond “very robustly” if the UK were to do this.
“They may not [trigger Article 16] at all, because ultimately I think the message has come through that the EU would respond very robustly. So that’s where we get into that trade war situation,” he said.
From there, he sees three main options the EU could choose in response.
“The easy option is for the countries through which a lot of the UK trade goes… to simply start controlling UK lorries very vigorously,” he said.
“You then get, essentially, a situation where without having imposed anything, trade kind of comes to a halt.”
A second option would be for the EU to pick out specific products and to target them with tariffs, which would affect different parts of UK society.

The third option, Morgenroth said, would be for the EU to “just go all out and say well we’re now trading on WTO [World Trade Organisation] rules and all the tariffs kick in.”
This would mean tariffs on a huge range of UK products, and would be the most aggressive of the options on the table. The UK would have similar options it could take to respond to any EU action.
Impact on Ireland
If a situation developed where ti-for-tat tariffs were placed on products, it would hit businesses across the EU and the UK.
Professor Morgenroth said that the UK would be in a worse position if a trade war took place, given that it is a significantly smaller economy than the EU as a whole.
However, due to the close proximity and trading relationship between Ireland and the UK, a trade war would likely hit Ireland the hardest out of all the EU countries.
“The fact that we trade more with the UK than other EU countries means that, whatever happens, if there is a trade war we’ll be more affected,” said Morgenroth.
He said that the UK could put on pressure by starting to inspect goods more thoroughly than they had before.
“If they simply went and started inspecting things more thoroughly and creating havoc that way, Ireland would be particularly hit because we still have a substantial amount of transit traffic through the UK and they could hurt us that way,” he said.
“Just simply by delaying stuff, because a lot of the perishables are still going through the UK, they don’t go the direct route because of speed advantages.”
According to Neil McDonnell, CEO of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association, Ireland is very closely aligned with the UK in terms of its products, and a trade war would damage the economy here.
“[A trade war] is not going to resolve anything,” he said.
“And the price is always paid on the domestic side. People are always thinking, ‘Oh. We’ll screw you with tariffs’, but tariffs only hurt your own importers.”
McDonnell said that it would be very difficult for Irish importers to change suppliers from UK-based companies to EU ones, considering how closely the nations are aligned.
“So on the consumer tastes stuff, you look at everything that’s in your cupboard: your breakfast stuff, in food, in clothing and consumer goods, you know, even down to our power sockets, you know, our three pin 240 volts stuff.
“That’s all stuff that we have in common with the UK. And it’s very difficult to change that by going to a French or Spanish or German supplier. It’s actually a tough ask.
“It’s very easy for the Department of Enterprise to say change your supplier. But if you’re actually on the ground doing this stuff, it’s far harder to do.”
How likely is a trade war?
Last month, the UK government seemed to be on the cusp of triggering Article 16, and Irish and EU officials and politicians were on high alert.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ’s This Week programme on 7 November that the UK looked set to do so.
He said that “whether that is part of an ongoing negotiating strategy to try to change, amend or end the Protocol is hard to know, but certainly the signals are not good”.
However, since then, the rhetoric from the UK has been significantly dialed down. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a number of domestic issues, including allegations of Tory sleaze, and recent allegations of a Downing Street Christmas party having taken place last year amid Covid-19 restrictions.
Professor Morgenroth said that he didn’t expect the UK to trigger Article 16 any time soon.
“I didn’t expect and I don’t expect the UK to trigger Article 16 this side of Christmas, if they ever were going to,” he said.
“It risks disrupting Christmas supplies even more than Brexit has already done.”
Morgenroth added that, economically, the EU is stronger than the UK, and that the UK would not be able to dictate trading terms in the future for this reason.
“At the end of the day the EU is strong, it holds the cards here, and the UK needs to get used to the fact that they’re the junior partner in this,” he said.
“They’re not going to dictate the terms to the EU. They’re very small in comparison.”
Neil McDonnell agrees, saying that the UK would come off worse in any trade conflict.
“Nobody wants to see any sort of trade conflict between Ireland and the EU,” he said.
“However, what I would say is, if there is that kind of trade battle, it won’t be like Dev and annuities in the ’30s. On this occasion, it will be far worse for the UK than it would be for the EU, though I appreciate it would be very rough for Irish businesses.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-brexit-tells-eu-to-make-changes-to-northern-ireland-protocol-5564907-Oct2021/,"THE UK “CANNOT wait forever” for Brussels to respond to demands to change Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal, David Frost said as he issued a fresh warning he might suspend parts of the arrangements.
In his speech to the Conservative Party conference, the Brexit minister said there would be “some rough waters” as a result of leaving the EU “but we will choose for ourselves how to steer our ship”.
The main issue of contention with the European Union is the Northern Ireland Protocol, the package of measures aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland.
The arrangements effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, but as a result have put a trade barrier for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.
The peer, who negotiated the deal including the protocol which was signed by Boris Johnson, said he worried that Brussels would not grant the concessions he was seeking to maintain cross-Irish Sea trade.
Lord Frost said he would soon share legal texts with Brussels setting out how the UK intends to resolve the issue – and could unilaterally suspend some of the current arrangements under Article 16 of the treaty if the EU does not respond.
“I set out in July a set of proposals that would establish a new balance for a lasting future – and I will soon be sending a new set of legal texts to the EU to support them,” he told Tories gathered in Manchester.
“We await a formal response from the EU to our proposals. But, from what I hear, I worry that we will not get one which enables the significant change we need.
“So I urge the EU to be ambitious. It’s no use tinkering around the edges. We need significant change.
“If we can agree something better, we can get back to where we wanted to be – an independent Britain with friendly relations with the EU based on free trade.
“But we cannot wait forever. Without an agreed solution soon, we will need to act, using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism, to address the impact the protocol is having on Northern Ireland.

“That may in the end be the only way to protect our country – our people, our trade, our territorial integrity, the peace process, and the benefits of this great UK of which we are all part.”
Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said: “Lord Frost negotiated every single word of the deal he now discredits at every opportunity.
“And as this speech proves, their approach is inflaming tensions while solving nothing.
“Communities in Northern Ireland are sick and tired of the political posturing from a Government they have long since lost trust in.
“Tory ministers should show some responsibility, and do what businesses across Northern Ireland have been telling them for months – get round the table and negotiate a veterinary agreement to help lower the barriers they created down the Irish Sea.”
Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng later told the Conservative Party conference that Brexit was an “opportunity” to reset the economy with higher wages and more skilled jobs.
He said: “We had essentially a low-wage, low-skilled, high-immigration economic model. That was what was happening. As a consequence of Brexit we have essentially broken free of that model and what we want to do, what we want to go into, is a high-wage, high-skilled economy.”
Mr Kwarteng added he remembered meeting a builder in his constituency during the 2016 Brexit referendum who told the MP he would vote to leave the EU because he had not had a pay rise in more than a decade.
Mr Kwarteng said: “It was then that I realised that actually not only would Brexit have a chance but, actually, if you got Brexit, it would be chance to reset the kind of economic model we have.”
Earlier this morning, European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said he would not comment on Lord Frost’s speech or on the implications of triggering Article 16.
He said: “As you know, we are working intensively to find practical solutions to some of the difficulties that people in Northern Ireland are experiencing.”
Mr Ferrie added: “We intend to come forward with solutions soon. It goes without saying we remain in close contact with our UK counterparts.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/maros-sefcovic-northern-ireland-protocol-5545670-Sep2021/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Sep 2021
THE DUP LEADER has indicated that he intends to pull his ministers out of the Stormont Executive before November if his demands on the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met.
Jeffrey Donaldson also said he made the decision because he feared that negotiations between the EU and UK Government over the protocol would be “dragged out” for years.
He has said that he wants the UK Government to legislate in October to protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market and avoid a collapse of the powersharing institutions and an early election.
The DUP leader’s position, which was set out in a speech yesterday, brought a furious reaction from other Stormont parties.
But speaking to the BBC Nolan Show today, Donaldson said he had been working on the strategy of opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol for months.
He said: “I have been reasonable, I have given people time to take the action that I feel is necessary to remove this Irish Sea border.
“I have worked with the Government, I have engaged with the EU, I have put forward proposals and suggestions in terms of how we can address these issues.
“The harm that is being done to our economy every day is not sustainable.”
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
It achieves that by moving many of the checks and processes required on goods to the Irish Sea.

Under the arrangements, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods and continues to apply EU customs rules.
Unionists in Northern Ireland have been vehemently opposed to its terms which see additional checks on goods arriving to the region from the rest of the UK.
Donaldson aid he expected the Government to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market, pointing out that this was a commitment in the New Decade, New Approach agreement which restored Stormont after a three-year suspension.
Asked if he would pull his ministers out of the Executive before November if the Government did not legislate in October, Donaldson said: “I think that is the sort of timescale we are working to now.
Donaldson met this week with the UK’s Brexit minister David Frost, and also with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and said he believes there is now a “realisation” that action needs to be taken over the protocol.
Europe’s stance
Delivering a keynote speech at Queen’s University in Belfast, Sefcovic said any attempt to renegotiate the post-Brexit agreement between the EU and the UK Government would cause “instability, uncertainty and unpredictability” in Northern Ireland.
Sefcovic also said that the Northern Ireland Protocol must be “properly implemented”, but said this would require compromises on both sides.
He said the EU had been “engaging constructively” with the UK Government to limit the impact of the protocol on everyday life in Northern Ireland.
He added: “The EU and the UK must continue these discussions in order to reach an understanding.
“Doing this would effectively mean cutting Northern Ireland off the EU’s single market and related opportunities. Instead, let’s see what can be done to further ease the supply of goods.
“And let’s see how to involve the people of Northern Ireland in our discussions on the implementation of the protocol.

Sefcovic also pledged to do “whatever it takes” to ensure that the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland is not disrupted because of the protocol.
But he added: “I also need to be honest: while we will continue looking for solutions to minimise the effects of Brexit on your everyday lives, we will never be able to remove them entirely – such are the consequences of Brexit and of the choices of the UK Government.”
Sefcovic continued: “I am, of course, acutely aware of how some in Northern Ireland feel about the protocol, in particular in the unionist community.
“I know it is possible for us to work together, if rhetoric on both sides is dialled down.”
Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Europe is in “solution mode” and wants to work hard within the existing arrangement to make the protocol work for the people of Northern Ireland”,
Speaking to reporters at the Fianna Fáil think-in in Co Cavan, Martin said that “from our perspective, the issue now is can we make this work”.
“What’s clear is all parties would like to see streamlining and more flexible operation of the protocol and that’s what we’re going to work on,” the Taoiseach said.
“It’s no secret that I’m passionately committed to maintaining the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and their full operation in all aspects north and south,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/boris-brexitmania-5943299-Dec2022/,"WHEN HYSTERIA SETS in, it can seem unstoppable before fizzling out. In 1518 the city of Strasbourg experienced what was known as the“the dancing plague”when hundreds of citizens started dancing manically against their will for days on end.
The delirium lasted for months before suddenly stopping – no one understood why it ended, much less why it started in the first place.
There is some hope that Britain is edging, tentatively, towards the end of what might called “Brexit mania”. Historians will argue about what triggered the mass delusion which poisoned British politics in the summer of 2016, but the causes of its demise will be fairly unambiguous. 56% of Britons in arecent pollsaid they think it was a mistake.
With the country in the grips of a recession, the public’s tolerance for fairytales about a Great British revival appears to have reached its limit.

A loss of face
The data is damning – the combative stance that Britain has adopted with the European Union has tied lead weights to the feet of British business. The government’s attempt to boost growth while ghosting its largest trading partner is an absurdity that it can’t credibly hawk to the public any longer.
Not dissimilar to theChequers dealthat Theresa May failed to flog to parliament back in 2018, the kind of arrangement enjoyed by Switzerland would have many practical advantages for the UK. It would solve the Northern Ireland border issue for one, and open the economy up for frictionless commerce with the rest of the continent.
But make no mistake; such a compromise would also be a humiliation for Britain. It would mean signing back up to the terms and conditions it so forcefully rejected, without any of the influence wielded by a member state. It would be like breaking up with your partner, only to crawl back after realising how much rent costs for a single person.
Regrets
The bitter irony is that Britain once had the most bespoke arrangement of any EU country, with all the benefits of membership while remaining outside of the Euro and the Schengen Area. It was a plum deal, one which will never be offered to anyone again. To accept a deal that leaves the nation no better off than where it was pre-referendum would be to admit that the whole project has been a misadventure. It’s a grisly message that no prime minister has been willing to be honest about.
With his economy in freefall and his party suspicious of his commitment to the cause, he’s too weak to bring either the EU or his own MPs to heel. With only bad options on the table, it’s likely he’ll simply do nothing, grit his teeth and hope for the best in the next general election.
What’s more troubling than Tory stubbornness is the lack of urgency from the opposition benches. Terrified of further alienating working-class voters who backed leaving the EU, Keir Starmer’s strategy appears to be as vague on the European question as possible. Like Sunak, he’s anxious to convince the electorate that he’s nothing like his colourful predecessor. Where Jeremy Corbyn was a proper Marxist, one gets the sense looking at Starmer that his greatest socialist ambition would be to make men’s hair gel available on the NHS.

All the best characters have been killed off. Johnson was the programme’s heart and soul, styling himself as Churchill with a Lads Mag twist. He joshed and japed his way through debates and sold Brexit as a great national mischief.
Take away the clowning and sleaze however, the project is being exposed for what it is – a rather boring negotiation of bilateral trade agreements, the fudging of which has made people poorer. When the finale finally airs, everyone will wonder how they let themselves get so carried away.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-bold-steps-reduce-irish-border-checks-5479645-Jun2021/,"THE EU IS prepared to consider “bold steps” to reduce checks required under Brexit’s Irish Sea border to an “absolute minimum”, the European Commission vice president has said.
Giving evidence to a special sitting of a Northern Ireland Assembly committee, Maros Sefcovic said the EU was willing to accommodate permanent flexibilities to the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol, but he said the UK had to reciprocate by demonstrating a commitment to the “full and faithful” implementation of the arrangements.
The appearance of the EU’s chief negotiator on Brexit before MLAs comes amid continuing dispute over the Protocol, which has created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
The arrangements, which were agreed by the EU and UK as a way to keep the land border on the island of Ireland free-flowing, have introduced a series of new checks and restrictions on goods moving from Britain into Northern Ireland.
Technical talks are ongoing between London and Brussels to try to hammer out ways to reduce the burden of red tape.
Sefcovic said there was a need to “de-dramatise” the rhetoric around the Protocol.
“We are willing to consider taking bold steps if the UK Government demonstrates a clear and concrete commitment to implementing the protocol in full,” he said.
A prohibition on British chilled meats entering Northern Ireland is due to come into force later this week, though the EU has indicated a willingness to grant a UK request to extend a temporary exemption period for a further three months to provide space to find an alternative solution.
During his virtual appearance, Sefcovic told MLAs he was not in a position to formally confirm the granting of the extension, but said he was “confident” a solution would be found in the next 48 hours.
He said the Protocol emerged from the long Brexit withdrawal negotiations as the “only possible solution” to keep the Irish land border free-flowing.
The senior European official said since then there had been no viable alternative put forward.

“Nobody has yet suggested a better workable alternative,” he said.
“The Protocol is a unique solution that the EU has never offered before. We are outsourcing the control of part of our border to a third country.
“The EU has demonstrated the pragmatism we are occasionally and wrongly accused of lacking. We have spared no efforts in trying to mitigate problems that have arisen in the implementation of the Protocol and have explored and put on the table practical and permanent solutions.”
Speaking this afternoon, NI deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said she hoped Sefcovic’s appearance at the Stormont committee would allow him to “hear first-hand that the DUP doesn’t speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol”.
“I welcome the fact that the Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic is meeting with MLAs. I hope that within that conversation there was a balance put on the fact that the Protocol is mitigation; the Protocol is the best effort we have against the worst excesses of Brexit,” O’Neill said.
“I welcome the fact that there is an indication in terms of the extension for the chilled meats that it is expected there is going to be a positive response. That is good, we should bank that, but what we need are longer term solutions and I hope that we can find those solutions in the period ahead.”
Sefcovic said a Swiss-style deal on agri-food shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would do away with the “vast majority” of new checks.
The agreement the EU has with Switzerland avoids animal and plant health checks because the Swiss align their own regulations with the bloc’s.
When the EU changes its rules, the Swiss change theirs to ensure continued alignment.
“I want to see necessary checks reduced to absolute minimum possible,” said Sefcovic.
“To mention one measure that would address some concerns and could be negotiated very quickly – a so-called Swiss-style veterinarian agreement with the UK continuing to apply EU SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) rules will do away with the vast majority of the checks in the Irish Sea and would not require checks elsewhere, say in Northern Ireland, including for travels with pets, for example.”
Sefcovic said a New Zealand-style deal would not do away with as many checks.
The EU and New Zealand agreement involves both parties mutually recognising that the other has high food safety standards. This reduces the proportion of checks required but allows New Zealand to continue to set its own SPS regulations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexiteer-northern-ireland-secretary-5859558-Sep2022/,"LAST UPDATE|7 Sep 2022
THE NEW NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has urged Stormont party leaders to form an executive “as soon as possible”.
In his opening remarks to the House of Commons, Heaton-Harris, who was appointed to the role last night, told MPs that he would be speaking to each of the party leaders in Northern Ireland about the current situation.
He told MPs: “I know the House shares my view that Northern Ireland needs a stable, fully functioning devolved government to deliver on the issues that matter to people most.”
The DUP withdrew from the Executive earlier this year in protest over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol, a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.
But the arrangement is deeply unpopular with unionists because it includes checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British government is progressing a bill to give ministers powers to override parts of the agreement.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has requested an urgent meeting with the Brexiteer to “press home the priorities for Northern Ireland”, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said his first job should be a functioning executive at Stormont.
Heaton-Harris, 54, was appointed to the role by new UK Prime Minister Liz Truss last night as she formed her new cabinet. The former Conservative Party’s chief whip represents the constituency of Daventry in England. He replaces Shailesh Vara who was sacked ahead of the appointment.
A self-described “fierce Eurosceptic” on his website, Heaton-Harris was chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs between 2010 and 2016.
Legislation
The new Northern Ireland Secretary has said he would prefer a negotiated settlement with the European Union, but the UK Government remained committed to progressing the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.
Conservative former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers said: “The main barrier to the resumption of devolved power-sharing government is of course the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“So will he undertake to push that legislation through as quickly as possible and use the Parliament Act to get it through if necessary?”
Heaton-Harris replied in the Commons: “We are committed to resolving the problems in the protocol, ideally through a negotiation, but, if not, through legislation, so yes.”
Jeffrey Donaldson has said he is looking forward to working with Heaton-Harris “to build a more stable and prosperous future for everyone in Northern Ireland and making the Union work for all our citizens”.
In a statement, Donaldson called for Heaton-Harris to take action on the NI Protocol.
He said: “Like England, Scotland and Wales, we require action with the firepower of Treasury to get businesses and households through this winter of soaring costs.

“Northern Ireland is further hampered in this cost-of-living crisis due to the NI Protocol inflating costs for businesses and consumers as well.
“This is exactly why we need to see the Secretary of State working to replace the Protocol with arrangements that unionists can support.
Donaldson also commended Vara for his work in Northern Ireland, saying he had “committed himself fully to the role and ensured Northern Ireland’s voice was heard in the Cabinet”.
Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle sought assurances from Heaton-Harris that the UK Government’s position on getting Stormont up and running was unchanged,
Heaton-Harris replied: “We’re very clear, the protocol negotiation is between the EU and the UK, but yes the position is completely unchanged.”
He later told Kyle: “I am very keen we try and negotiate a solution with the European Union and sort out the issues of the protocol. However, we do have legislation ready, we’ve discussed it in this House and if we do not get a negotiated solution, we will legislate.”
DUP MP Sammy Wilson (East Antrim) told Heaton-Harris: “I hope he will be successful in doing what is necessary to get Stormont restored, namely removing the poison of the protocol.”
Heaton-Harris is expected in Northern Ireland tomorrow for meetings with political leaders.
Congratulations from political leaders
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney  said he had known Heaton-Harris since they were both members of the European Parliament.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-brexit-minister-resigns-5634966-Dec2021/,"BREXIT MINISTER LORD Frost has resigned from the Cabinet, the Mail on Sunday has reported this evening.
Lord Frost, who has led negotiations with the EU, is reported to have handed in his resignation letter to Boris Johnson last week.
But the Mail on Sunday reported he had been convinced to stay on until January.
The newspaper reported it was the introduction of Plan B coronavirus measures that prompted Lord Frost’s decision, including the implementation of Covid passes.
It also said that he had become disillusioned by tax rises and the cost of net zero policies.
Lord Frost has recently been locked in tense rounds of talks with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic as the UK and the EU attempt to close gaps in post-Brexit arrangements.
Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the news represented “a Government in total chaos right when the country faces an uncertain few weeks”.

She tweeted: “@BorisJohnson isn’t up to the job. We deserve better than this buffoonery.”
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: “This shock resignation is a sign of the chaos and confusion at the heart of this Conservative government.
“The rats are fleeing Boris Johnson’s sinking ship as he lurches from crisis to crisis.
“Even the Prime Minister’s once-loyal supporters are now abandoning him, just as lifelong Conservative voters are switching in their droves to the Liberal Democrats.
“At a time we need strong leadership to get us through the pandemic, we instead have a weak Prime Minister who has lost the support of his allies and the trust of the British people.”
Earlier this week, the Liberal Democratsoverturned a huge Tory majorityto win a by-election in a seismic victory that will piled further pressure on Boris Johnson.
In what was one of the most comprehensive by-election defeats in recent decades, the Conservatives lost what was seen as an ultra-safe seat to Lib Dem Helen Morgan by 5,925 votes.
The defeat compounded a tumultuous period for Johnson after 100 Conservatives defied the leadership to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid health passes for entry to large venues – the biggest rebellion since he entered No 10.

Unionists politicians are seeking changes to the arrangement, with the DUP blocking the operation of the Stormont Assembly as part of its opposition to the Protocol as its currently instituted.
A majority of MLAs elected to Assembly last month are in favour of the Protocol and in their letter today said that it “offers clear economic advantages to our region”.

The letter has been signed by 52 of the 90 MLAs, including all nationalist members of the Assembly and all Alliance Party members, who designate as ‘other’. No unionist MLAs signed the letter.
The letter to Johnson states that the signatories “reject in the strongest possible terms your government’s reckless new protocol legislation, which flies in the face of the expressed wishes of not just most businesses, but most people in Northern Ireland”.

The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK following Brexit and was designed as a way of preventing the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The Protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU Single Market for goods but also keeps Northern Ireland in the UK’s Customs territory.
While the unique arrangement offers potential advantages for NI businesses to operate in both territories, unionists have criticised it because it has required some checks to be carried out on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Northern Ireland institutions will be periodically asked to consent on the continuation of the Protocol, with the first such vote due to take place in December 2024.

Labour shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle also told the party’s conference in Liverpool that the Conservatives have “squandered” with “lies and neglect” a Labour legacy of a Northern Ireland “increasingly at ease”.
Kyle said there are “problems” with the Northern Ireland Protocol, but said they can be solved and insisted “negotiation is the only path forward”.

Kyle told the conference: “Labour bequeathed the Tories a Northern Ireland that was increasingly at ease, but they squandered it with their lies and neglect.
“It was the Tories who proposed, drafted, negotiated and signed the Northern Ireland protocol into international treaty.
“Yes, there are problems with it, but they can be solved. We know that negotiation is the only path forward.”
Addressing his party’s proposed solution to the challenges, he said: “A Labour government would deliver rapid deals with the EU on the flow of goods, the sharing of data, and making it easier for agricultural products to move around the UK and the island of Ireland.”
“Labour delivered peace, prosperity and confidence to Northern Ireland. The Tories can’t even negotiate a prawn sandwich across the Irish Sea,” he added.
Meanwhile, Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill was a “kamikaze approach to diplomacy” and warned that if it passed it would risk “a trade war with our closest allies”.
Lammy also defended Labour’s approach to Brexit policy: “I think it’s completely legitimate for us in the Opposition to set out our ambition to solve problems that are emerging but to rule out joining the single market and customs union at this stage.”","7.09pm, 26 Sep 2022",

THE EU HAS pulled back on plans to prevent Northern Ireland from being used as a back door to funnel coronavirus vaccine from the bloc into the rest of the UK, following an outcry on both sides of the Irish Sea last night.
In a statement, the European Commission said the Northern Ireland Protocol will be “unaffected” by its plans to put limits on vaccines leaving the EU.
“The commission is not triggering the safeguard clause,” it added, signifying that the controversial Article 16 would not be invoked.
The protocol, with is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the protocol, goods should be able to move freely between the EU and Northern Ireland as the region remains in the single market for goods and still operates under EU customs rules.
The EU had signalled its intention to trigger Article 16 of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.
The move had caused alarm across the political spectrum, with the Irish government, the British government, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the DUP and other unionists all raising their concerns.
The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister spoke about the matter yesterday evening – with Number 10 describing it as a “constructive discussion” – before the EU withdrew its plans.
Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson both raised their concerns with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Responding to the u-turn late last night, Martin said it was “welcome”. “This is a positive development given the many challenges we face in tackling Covid-19,” he tweeted.

Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that “lessons should be learned” and warned that the protocol “is not something to be tampered with lightly, it’s an essential, hard won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many”.
Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster had earlier branded the EU’s triggering of Article 16 of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol to stop unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an “incredible act of hostility”.
In its statement yesterday evening, the European Commission said it was still ploughing ahead with measures to require that vaccine exports outside the EU are subject to “an authorisation by member states”.
“Should transits of vaccines and active substances toward third countries be abused to circumvent the effects of the authorisation system, the EU will consider using all the instruments at its disposal,” it said.

However, invoking elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol will no longer be such an “instrument” after the move earlier provoked a major reaction on the island of Ireland and in Britain.
High-level talks
It is understood that no prior consultation took place with the Irish government prior to the EU’s earlier decision.
An Irish government source said that the criticism of the decision was “unsurprising”.
The tumultuous evening came amid a deepening row over the allocation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after the company announced delays to its EU operations.
The EU’s move to activate Article 16 was aimed at frustrating any effort to use Northern Ireland as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.
In a statement after 9pm yesterday, a Number 10 spokesperson said Johnson had discussed the matter with the Taoiseach.
The spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister this evening had a constructive discussion with the Taoiseach Micheal Martin.
“The PM set out his concerns about the EU’s use of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol and what these actions may mean for the two communities in Northern Ireland.
“The PM stressed the UK’s enduring commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and said the EU must urgently clarify its intentions and what steps it plans to take to ensure its own commitments with regards to Northern Ireland are fully honoured.
“The PM stressed the UK’s commitment to working together with other countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic.”
In a conversation with von der Leyen, Johnson also expressed his “grave concerns”, according to Number 10.
Earlier criticism
The move had provoked fury from unionists.
Arlene Foster said: “By triggering Article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner – over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.
“At the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.”
The regulation means Northern Ireland will be considered an export territory for the purposes of vaccine sent from the EU/the Republic of Ireland.
Northern Ireland’s vaccines arrive from the rest of the UK at present so those will be unaffected.

The DUP leader added: “With the European Union using Article 16 in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.
“I will be urging the Prime Minister to act and use robust measures including Article 16 to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.”
The DUP has previously pressed the British Government to invoke the Article 16 mechanism because of disruption to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
The European Commission had said: “Exports of goods from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom cannot be restricted by Union law unless this is strictly required by international obligations of the Union.
“Therefore, movements of goods covered by this regulation between the Union and Northern Ireland should be treated as exports.
“Whilst quantitative restrictions on exports are prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland, in accordance with Article 5 (5) of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, this is justified as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article 16 of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal difficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states.”
Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill said this evening she’d spoken to the Irish government to raise her “very serious concerns” about the invoking of Article 16.
She said: “This is a totally ill judged move by the EU and should not have been triggered. Calm heads need to prevail, this needs sorted urgently.”
The move was also criticised by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.
He said: “The disproportionate decision to invoke Article 16 of the Ireland Protocol by the European Commission is a grave error in judgment that undermines the work that has taken place over the last five years to defend the interests of people on this island.
“We face a common threat. Our response to this virus, and to the supply of vaccines, should be characterised by our common values. I am a proud European because I believe in cooperation, compromise and solidarity across national borders. This decision sadly places the Commission at odds with those values.”
UUP leader Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed.
He added: “The EU is unilaterally invoking Article 16 to protect its own interests and it’s about time the UK Government did the same instead of being lead actors in a ridiculous charade that there is no border in the Irish Sea and that Article 16 can’t be invoked.”
The chairman of the House of Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, meanwhile, has said it was was “unconscionable folly” for the EU to escalate its vaccines row by triggering Article 16.
Simon Hoare said: “Vaccines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which account for 100% of Northern Ireland’s coronavirus vaccines, will continue so the public have no reason for fear, but it’s unconscionable folly to escalate a contract dispute with a supplier to affect the so recently agreed, and still bedding in, NI Protocol.
“We need calm, stability and level-headedness.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-brexit-checks-resume-at-ports-in-northern-ireland-5350533-Feb2021/,"POST-BREXIT CHECKS at all Northern Ireland’s ports will resume from today.
Inspections of animal-based food produce arriving at Belfast and Larne ports were suspended last Monday amid concerns over the safety of staff.
Mid and East Antrim Borough Council had raised concerns of “menacing behaviour” being aimed at workers.
Threatening graffiti expressing opposition to a so-called Irish Sea border had appeared in the Larne area.
Former Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots ordered the suspension of checks shortly before stepping down from the role to receive medical treatment.
His successor Gordon Lyons maintained the position.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has since said there was no evidence of “credible threats”.

Yesterday, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said checks will resume on a phased basis from today.
A spokesperson said the decision was arrived at after receiving the full threat assessment from the PSNI, conducting their own internal risk assessment and liaising with staff and unions to put mitigations in place.
“The department’s permanent secretary and chief veterinary officer have confirmed that physical checks on products of animal origin at all Northern Ireland’s points of entry are planned to recommence on a phased basis, as of tomorrow, Wednesday 10 February 2021,” the spokesperson said.
‘Serious questions remain’
Sinn Féin MLA Philip McGuigan welcomed the move but said “serious questions” remain for the agriculture minister.
“The safe return of workers is a priority and their safety must be paramount,” McGuigan said.
“While it is welcome that workers will be back in post, there are still serious questions to be answered by the Minister for Agriculture around how and why the staff were withdrawn in the first place and who made the decision.”
Unionists and Loyalists have voiced opposition to post-Brexit arrangements, which have seen the introduction of additional checks on some goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
Signs and graffiti opposing an Irish Sea border have appeared across the region.

TUV councillor Timothy Gaston said the new checks undermine the union.
“Violence and threats of violence were always and always will be wrong. Unlike some in Northern Ireland politics, TUV has always been clear on this point,” he said.
“We continue to believe that the checks at the ports, which by law can only be carried out by Minister Lyons’s department, should cease, not in the face of threats but as a point of principle.
“I would appeal to the new agriculture minister to take the bold and decisive political action which is required to show that Unionists are serious about defending our place as an integral part of the United Kingdom.
“The danger which the Irish Sea border poses to our constitutional status is clear. It’s time to take the robust action necessary to defend the Union.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-bill-eu-reaction-uk-5789760-Jun2022/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has published legislation to unilaterally override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said theNorthern Ireland Protocol Billis a “reasonable, practical solution to the problems facing Northern Ireland” and said it does not break international law.
The Bill would see customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain effectively scrapped and would give UK government ministers the power to change almost every aspect of the text.
It proposes creating green and red channels for traders to differentiate between goods that remain within Northern Ireland and those destined for onward transportation across the border into the EU.
Goods arriving through the green channel would move free of customs or regulatory red tape while the requirements of the Protocol would continue to apply to red channel produce.
Goods banned under the Protocol, such as certain types of plants and seeds, would be allowed to travel into the North through the green channel, as long as they remained in the region.
Red channel goods shipped to Northern Ireland would still have to apply EU customs codes and, if relevant, undergo single market agri-food checks.
The UK Government is also proposing a new framework where goods can be sold in Northern Ireland if they meet either UK rules or EU rules, or both.
Produce due to be moved onward to the EU single market would still need to comply with relevant European standards.
However, London wants to ensure that products made to comply with UK standards can be sold in Northern Ireland, even if they are not in line with EU rules.
Under the plan, goods made in the North could be sold freely in the rest of the UK, regardless of whether they apply EU or British standards.
The Bill would also end EU control over state aid and value added tax (VAT) in the six counties, as well as remove the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the final arbitrator in any future trade disputes over the Protocol.
The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK following Brexit and was designed as a way of preventing the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The Protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU Single Market for goods, creating checks on trade between Britain and the North, but it also keeps Northern Ireland in the UK’s Customs territory.

While the unique arrangement offers potential advantages for NI businesses to operate in both territories, unionists have criticised it because it has required some checks to be carried out on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Northern Ireland institutions will be periodically asked to consent on the continuation of the Protocol, with the first such vote due to take place in December 2024.
EU reaction
Vice-President of the European Commission Maros Sefcovic has said the EU views the UK Government’s decision with “significant concern”.
Speaking at the commission headquarters in Brussels, Sefcovic said the unilateral action by the UK could put the access of Northern Ireland businesses to the EU single market at risk.
He said the commission would now look at restarting “infringement proceedings” against the UK which have been on hold since September 2021.
“It is with significant concern that we take note of today’s decision by the UK Government to table legislation disapplying core elements of the protocol. Unilateral action is damaging to mutual trust,” he said.
“In particular, the Protocol provides business operators in Northern Ireland with access to the EU single market for goods. The UK Government’s approach puts this access – and related opportunities – at risk.
“Our aim will always be to secure the implementation of the Protocol. Our reaction to unilateral action by the UK will reflect the aim and it will be proportionate. The first step the commissioner will consider is continuing the infringement procedure launch against the UK Government in March 2021.
Sefcovic said the EU would not be renegotiating the Protocol.
“Renegotiating the protocol is unrealistic… No workable solution has been found. Any renegotiations would simply bring further legal uncertainty for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,” he said.
“From the very beginning, the EU has shown understanding for the practical difficulties in implementing the protocol. Based on our extensive engagement engagement with a wide range of stakeholders in Northern Ireland, the European Commission has put forward far reaching bespoke arrangements especially to facilitate the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
“With political will and commitment, the full potential of the flexibilities put forward should be explored, and the European Commission remains keen to do that with the UK Government as soon as possible.”
What happens next?
If the EU revives legal action against the UK, it could end with the ECJ imposing daily fines for non-compliance.
If the UK refuses to pay and comply with its judgement, the EU could end parts of the post-Brexit trade agreement and apply tariffs to British goods, which could result in an all-out trade war.

However, before then, the British Prime Minister may have some difficulty getting the Bill through the House of Commons due to opposition within the Conservative Party.
It has been exactly a week since Johnsonsurvived a confidence votein his leadership by a slim majority of 63.
With 148 of 359 Tory MPs voting against him, his authority has been dealt a significant blow and he may struggle to push through the legislation if he encounters cabinet opposition.
A number of Tory MPs are believed to be unhappy with the legislation.
TheFinancial Timesreported that an internal note had been circulating among those against the Bill, which said: “Breaking international law to rip up the Prime Minister’s own treaty is damaging to everything the UK and Conservatives stand for.”
Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Cabinet Minister Michael Gove have previously expressed concerns about the prospect of a trade war with the EU, and how the legislation would impact Britain’s reputation worldwide.
If the Bill is passed, it is likely that it wouldn’t become law for at least a year because it is understood that it would to face strong opposition by pro-EU members of the House of Lords.
Trading arrangements under the Protocol would also continue after it passed until London draft and implement a unanimous replacement system.
It also remains to be seen whether the publishing of the legislation will prompt the DUP to re-enter power-sharing in Stormont.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party is not under pressure to do so.
“I am not under any pressure. We have strong support from across unionism for the stand that we are taking.
“I believe that our pressure has brought about what we see today with this Bill being published. I believe that our pressure is seeing progress being made and we will continue to work with government to ensure that this legislation progresses.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/a-sausage-truce-marks-a-moment-of-peace-brexit-5481485-Jul2021/,"THE MOOD MUSIC in relation to Brexit trade talks between the EU and UK is, dare we say, starting to sound more positive, possibly for the first time this year – raising the question of what will be the next move of the new DUP leadership.
Since high-flying tensions at the G7 summit several weeks ago, things have simmered down a good deal, and sausages now seem the least of everyone’s worries.
The chair of Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Dorset MP Simon Hoare, toldThe Journalthat progress has been made because the EU has seen that a more relaxed standards system between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain has worked during grace periods; and also that the EU has shown it doesn’t dislike the UK and wants to strike a workable deal.
In proof of the progress made, a raft of solutions were announced this week by the European Commission for some of the sticking problems associated with the Protocol, including a three-month extension of the ‘sausage war’ issue – a grace period for chilled meats going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Yesterday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that “hopefully, when it comes to chilled meats the wurst is behind us, as I think Angela [Merkel] said, or maybe I said that.”
The other solutions included changes to allow for the movement of medicines, guide dogs, and livestock from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – and the European Commission scrapping the need for UK drivers to carry a ‘green card’ for insurance while in the EU, something that will benefit Northern Irish citizens in particular.
These tangible solutions are coupled with a legal ruling that has also smoothened the path for the Protocol to continue – a trading system that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world, and is all the more complicated for it.
A court challenge brought by unionists that argued that the Protocol contradicts the Good Friday Agreement and EU law were all dismissed by a Belfast judge.
Though the judge did acknowledge that the Protocol contradicts the Act of Union, he ruled that the agreement by Parliament effectively overrode the 200-year-old law. The challenge is to be appealed to Belfast’s Supreme Court.
While new DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldsoncalledthe Act of Union decision “politically significant”, saying that if it wasn’t resolved it will have “potential consequences for the future stability of political institutions”, practical solutions on the Protocol were made.

The right call. Let’s hope Westminster doesn’t have to step up but if we do; we willhttps://t.co/3AUpdh3PJS
Tory MP Simon Hoare has been chair of Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee since 2019. In that time, he and his committee of Tory, Labour, DUP SDLP and Alliance members have questioned the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brexit ministers, and British customs officials and on Brexit and the Protocol.
He hassaid previouslythat businesses and farmers in his constituency would “bite your hand off” to have the trading arrangements that Northern Ireland have.
Speaking toThe Journalthis week about the future of unionism and trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, he said of criticism of the Protocol: “No one said it was perfect.”
He said that HMRC [the UK's Revenue and Customs department] told the committee recently that ‘alternative arrangements’ to the Protocol, that had been suggested during Brexit negotiations, were dismissed as also requiring west-to-east checks and would be more costly.
“Because people have fabricated these constitutional anxieties about the Protocol, it has taken the focus away from considering what are the potential benefits.”
Responding to the verdict relating to the Act of Union, Hoare said: “There’s been SPS [plant and animal checks] between mainland GB and the island of Ireland for decades. Did anybody say, as a result of those trade checks ‘Oh, we are less British’? Of course they didn’t.”
Hoare also notes that the mixed messaging from the UK government hasn’t helped to depoliticise the trading arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
He said some figures in the UK government say the Protocol isn’t workable, some say it’s not working the way they had imagined, some said that they hadn’t understood what was involved with it, and some are saying that hard work needs to be done to get the Protocol to work properly.
“And so, we shouldn’t really be surprised if there isn’t some scratching of heads going ‘I wonder really what the position of the UK government actually is… It goes back to having the courage not trying to ride two horses.

Speaking about the current political state in Northern Ireland, Hoare said that as a Welshman representing an English constituency, he wonders whether political unionism can afford a fractured offering to the electorate, and why loyalists are turning away from the political process.

He makes the point that there seems to be such an “enormous disconnect” between political leaders of unionism and what their electorates appear to want.
“On the abortion issue, [it] was quite interesting that in all the polls, the majority of those who would describe themselves as unionists were in favour of having broadly the same abortion rights as prevail in England and Wales.
“If you were to take the negative out of the English language, some of these people would have absolutely nothing to say.”
He said that new communities are not “hog-tied by what Henry VIII might have done, or what Oliver Cromwell did”, and there is a growing middle ground in Northern Ireland that need to be catered for, aside from the “two traditions”.
“We need a united unionist voice which starts to say what it’s in favour of, what it likes, what it seeks to achieve.”
Hoare said that the new leader of the UUP Doug Beattie will be an interesting option for grassroots unionism, and said that there is room for a Northern Irish Conservative Party. When asked if there is work being done on this, he said he doesn’t know, but adds that if he’s ever asked by the party, he would say yes they should, and they should do it now.
Recently Tánaiste and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar announced that Fine Gael would launch a party branch in the North, but would not contest elections there.
It comes ahead of Stormont elections in Northern Ireland to be held next year, which will be hotly contested as this year’s census in Northern Ireland is expected to show for the first time a Catholic majority of the population in the North.
Recently, former DUP leader Edwin Poots suggested that a referendum on the Protocol would be held shortly – a vote in the Stormont Assembly is scheduled for 2024 as part of the Protocol and Brexit trade agreement between the European Union and the UK.

Micheal Martin said preparations made by the government in advance of Brexit had worked and that the UK had failed to make similar plans.
Amid warnings from hauliers that Ireland is facing a shortage of between 3,000 and 4,000 lorry drivers, the Taoiseach insisted: “We’re steady as she goes.”
Speaking from the Europort in Rosslare, Co Wexford, Martin said:
“Suffice to say from my briefings over in the port and here that the preparations that Ireland put in in advance of Brexit have worked.
“And it was done against a fairly tight timeline.
“Now there are wider issues, more than just Brexit afoot, within the UK.
“I’m not so sure the same preparations have occurred in the United Kingdom.
“I think the migration issue within the UK, the decision to, for example, create obstacles and barriers to people coming from Europe to work in the UK is a factor across the board. We don’t have that here.”

Martin said Ireland would “take nothing for granted”, and highlighted the need for more training courses and programmes for HGV drivers and the haulage industry.
“We need to be flexible in terms of people coming in to Ireland to want to work in this sector,” he said.
Asked if Ireland could avoid the situation seen in the UK, where driver shortages have seen petrol pumps run dry and left supermarket shelves empty, Mr Martin replied: “Yes, that is our ambition, that is our determination. Yes, we can.”
He said: “We’re steady as she goes, and as far as we’re concerned, we’re not getting the same impacts as are currently happening in the UK.”
Martin said the UK’s problems were down to more than just Brexit, but that its departure from the EU had made the situation worse.
“There’s no doubt that the bounce-back of the European economy and the global economy in terms of Covid-19 has created a whole lot of disruption to supply chains,” he said.
“So to be fair to everybody, there’s a broader issue than just Brexit.
“But I think the Brexit situation has exacerbated the situation in the UK, in terms of personnel for HGV drivers and so on, and indeed other sectors of the UK economy.
“We don’t have that sort of issue here. We’re part of the European single market, the free movement of people and so on.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-and-ireland-5999842-Feb2023/,"IRELAND’S FLIRTATIONS WITH the far-right usually end in farce. WhenEoin O’Duffy– former Garda commissioner and leader of right-wing paramilitaries the Blueshirts – led 700 or so men to fight with General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, the Irish Brigade distinguished themselves with ill-discipline anddrunkenness.
Unfamiliar with the Spanish heat and fine wine, the Holy War quickly descended into a glorified lad’s holiday; think Magaluf-with-marching. Franco was sounimpressedwith Ireland’s lumpen, bleary-eyed fascists that he sent them home in disgrace. If there was a European herrenvolk, the Irish were not part of it.
The recent spate of anti-immigration demonstrations suggest that extreme narratives are taking hold again in some of our communities. While O’Duffy’s men had been scandalised into action by often-sensationalised reports of communists burning churches and murdering priests, today unverified stories on social media have driven the outraged onto Irish streets.
Perhaps we were getting a little smug. Sandwiched between Trumpism on one side of the Atlantic and Brexit on the other, Ireland’s sleepy centrist political consensus made us feel like a lonely islet of moderation. As pivotal as the marriage equality and 8th amendment referenda were, these human rights were already established in most other Western democracies.

We allowed ourselves to forget, too, the nativism which began to emerge during our last economic boom. Ireland, possibly the whitest country in Western Europe, experienced mass immigration for the first time. The direction of traffic had traditionally been one way, but now people were moving here for a better life. I was in 6th class when four boys from Kosovo joined our school. The ink was still wet on the Good Friday Agreement, so the idea of people coming to Ireland to escape ethnic conflict must have seemed like someone’s idea of a bad joke. Nevertheless, they came.
I didn’t understand what other religions were all about. I’d only ever met one non-Catholic before. A boy in our class was being raised atheist, which we all considered pure odd. Didn’t he love Jesus? When we had prayer or rehearsal for our First Communion, he’d been excused to read by himself. “Enjoy your books, weirdo!” we’d thought. “We’re off to eat the actual flesh of Christ.” It’s only now living in England that I appreciate just how routinely strange and funny an Irish childhood could be.
The novelty wore off. In 2004 a referendum to remove the automatic right to Irish citizenship to children born in Ireland passed by 80%. Another referendum in 2008 confirmed the shifting mood when voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty. Led by a peculiar patchwork of the far left and the Catholic right the success of Ireland’s Eurosceptic movement stunned Dublin and Brussels. This rogue bout of national mischief was short-lived. A suitably bashful electorate passed a second referendum the following year as the depth of the global financial crisis emerged.
The experience should have been a reminder of what happens when we indulge our worst instincts. The UK is another warning of what happens when a country elevates identity politics above all other policy areas. Everyone knows Brexit has been a disaster, but even the opposition seems determined to see it through. Contrarianism, or the rejection of logic in favour of a priori assumptions about British exceptionalism, is the will of the people. That amajority of voters now apparently regret the decisionto leave the European Union is beside the point – the train has left the station and is bolting towards its inevitable dead end.
If Britain is pining for a glorious past, the reality in Ireland is that we’ve never had it better. Our old people – the demographic typically most likely to tilt towards conservatism – have watched the country transform drastically for the better over the course of their lifetimes. The same cannot necessarily be said of their kids and grandkids.
Younger people who grew up during the ‘Celtic Tiger’ boom years and took prosperity for granted are feeling increasingly shafted by a housing crisis with no prospect of a resolution. Even with the eye-watering growth statistics being reported, more than 70% of young people areconsidering emigration.

The economic calamity of 2008 and the following decade of underinvestment was not caused by families fleeing war in countries less fortunate than our own. Blaming refugees for our social problems is like blaming our hangover on the kebab we had on the way home from the pub. The responsibility lies with a reckless financial and political elite – most of them white, middle-aged and holding Irish passports. We misdirect our anger at our peril.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cost-of-bread-flour-5351803-Feb2021/,"THE COST OF bread in Ireland could be about to rise byat least 9%due to a combination of factors – including Brexit making flour more expensive to import from the UK.
Bakers are concerned about how Ireland will source the huge amount of flour needed for its bakeries which, up until now, has been imported from the UK as there are no mills in Ireland that produce industrial flour.
There is just one Irish flour mill, in Portarlington, Co Laois, which is run by Odlums and which produces ‘retail’ flour, or packets of flour, for consumers.
It’s not possible to simply switch to importing industrial flour from the EU, because Ireland and the UK are the only countries to use the type of flour to make sliced pans.
“Our difficulty is the flour we use in bread is different to continental Europe, there are higher levels of protein in our flour,” Senator Malcolm Byrne toldTheJournal.ie.
“And it’s unlikely that Irish tastes will change from the sliced pan to croissants or a baguette… I can’t see people eating a crisp baguette instead of a crisp sandwich.”
Senator Byrne, along with TDs Paul McAuliffe and Joe Flaherty, raised the issue at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting this week, where Byrne said the Taoiseach was “very much aware” of the concerns and challenges Brexit posed for the cost of bread.

Why exactly is the price increasing?
The increase in cost is due to ‘rule of origin’ standards contained in the trade agreement struck by the EU and the UK before Christmas, resulting in more strict rules and some tariffs, or trade taxes, for products being imported from the UK.
Around 80% of all flour used for making bread in Ireland is imported from UK mills.
UK factories use wheat imported from Canada and the US to make the flour that Irish bakeries use.
Because this makes up more than 15% of flour made in UK mills, and because the flour is now also processed in a third country (the UK), tariffs will apply to importing it into Ireland.
The new Brexit-related tariff means €172 must be paid per metric tonne of flour being imported from the UK, which will most likely mean increased costs for Irish consumers.
Although the EU-UK trade agreement is already in force, the price of bread may not yet have increased as producers are likely to have stockpiled ahead of Brexit changes coming into force from 1 January.
‘The perfect storm’
Gerald Cunningham, secretary of the Flour Confectioners and Bakers Association, toldTheJournal.iethat a number of other factors have lead to “the perfect storm” that could make bread between 10-15% more expensive.

Along with Brexit-related costs, there are also increases in costs for other ingredients used to make bread, such as yeast, oils, and sugars, as well as an increased cost in labour.
“Bakeries are not a high-profit industry, it’s marginal profits that they make,” said Cunningham.
Senator Malcolm Byrne is calling for a derogation on flour, to help keep costs down for consumers and keep bakeries open.
He suggested that some of the EU Brexit Fund could be used to subsidise bakeries in the short-term.
He admitted that both these suggestions are short-term measures, and that the longer term result may be that Ireland begins to import more flour from continental Europe and tastes begin to change, though he said that this is unlikely.
Another option is that an industrial mill is opened in Ireland, Byrne said.
“There are a number of factors here. There’s the cost of bread feeding into the Consumer Price index and inflation, the security of food supply, and environmental reasons – the more goods we can produce closer to home, the better.
“The challenge is that we need to diversify into other products, if we can. Derogation or the EU Brexit Fund are only short-term solutions, we need a sustainable [option].”

https://www.thejournal.ie/euroscepticism-brexit-5609656-Dec2021/,"“YOU’RE NOT LAUGHING now” was how Nigel Farage attempted to rub salt into the wounds of MEPs in the European Parliament five days after the 2016 Brexit vote.
Farage was in full gloating mode and then-Commission president Jean-Claude Junckerwas baited into replying: “The British people voted for the exit. Why are you here?”
If only it were so easy. As Brexit dragged on, Farage remained in Brussels for almost four more years until the UK officially left the EU andlost all its MEPs.
But whether he meant it or not, there was a deeper meaning to Juncker simply asking Farage why he thought it necessary to be in the chamber.
The question of why Farage was there can also be taken to mean why someone so implacably opposed to the European project would devote so much time and effort to being there in the first place.
Many argue that in Farage’s particular case self-interest played a huge part – but speaking more generally, is the European Parliament the best place for a hardline eurosceptic?
It can be fairly argued that the best place to oppose the EU is at its heart, and that UKIP proved this by ultimately wedging the UK out.
But what if your goal isn’t an exit but rather to oppose greater integration?
Dr Ariadna Ripoll Servent is professor of EU politics at Salzburg Centre of European Union Studies and has written extensively about EU institutions and euroscepticism.
She has spoken about the various shades of eurosceptic MEPs elected to the European Parliament and says you can roughly group them as being either ‘hard eurosceptics’ or ‘soft eurosceptics’.
While the former may be opposed to membership or the very existence of the European Union, the latter are merely opposed to its goals and policies.

“Soft eurosceptics could be those that are more critical of specific policies or are critical of the system not being democratic enough,” she tellsThe Journal.
She adds: “Some of the criticisms are perfectly fair: issues of transparency or migration policies, which, if you think of the EU becoming a “fortress Europe”, is something that the radical left tends to criticise a lot and many people agree with. So yes, I think it can be good for democracy and offers a broader range of opinions.”
2019
The European Parliament elections in May 2019 were among the most closely-watched such votes in the history of the bloc, a fact that was reflected in EU-wide turnout that reached a 25-year high.
The Brexit vote itself, and to a larger degree the election of Donald Trump in 2016, had many EU politicians nervous that a surge of eurosceptic MEPs would be elected as part of a wider populist wave.
The result saw an increase in the number of eurosceptic MEPs elected but themuch-expected revolution failed to materialise.
Instead, the outcome led to a greater fragmentation within the European Parliament and alliances that are less clear.
In ananalysis Ripoll Servent carried outin the months after the vote, she determined that about 31% of MEPs elected in 2019 could be considered eurosceptic, an increase on the 27% following the 2014 vote.
This 31% would however drop to 28% within the year when the Brexit Party’s members departed along with the rest of the UK’s cohort.
The nature of Brexit also had an impact on euroscepticism across Europe.
While some sceptics may have been emboldened by the result, the tortuous negotiations that followed did not present an attractive proposition for eurosceptics to sell to voters.
Brussels-based Dutch journalist Caroline de Gruyter has covered European politics for well over a decade and says that Brexit has caused eurosceptics to change tack.
“Many eurosceptics have seen that actually it’s not very smart to go for an exit,” she explains.
“What they do want now is instead to stay in and change the EU from the inside. And this is what many of them are doing. They are forming groupings on a European level, contacting each other ever more frequently.”
De Gruyter argues that in the case of the UK – Northern Ireland issues aside – Brexit should have been “relatively easy” because the country wasn’t part of the Euro or the Schengen travel area, whereas other Member States are more intertwined.
Namechecking Poland and Hungary, she adds that another issue for eurosceptics in some states is that their countries “depend on the money” from the EU.
“UKIP never depended on European money. But the the ruling party in Poland does, Fidesz in Hungary [does]. [Hungarian prime minister] Viktor Orban’s power base is almost is almost exactly based on European subsidies and how they are distributed among partners or friends,” she says.
Ireland
When it comes to euroscepticism, making a precise calculation about how prevalent it is within a parliament or a political system is difficult because parties either reject the label or because the label simply doesn’t fit.
It is also complicated by the fact that euroscepticism exists from both left and right of the traditional ideological divide. It is for this reason thatthe term ‘Lexit’ became popular during the UK Brexit debate, representing those in favour of Brexit from a left-wing standpoint.
In last year’s book Euroscepticism and the Future of Europe, the book’s three editors outline this phenomenon:

The book goes on to detail the prevalence of euroscepticism in the politics of each member state, including Ireland.
The specific chapter on Ireland is written by Róisín Smith of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) and notes that “there are no true Eurosceptic parties influencing the political system”.
This would likely lead to some debate, with political opponents frequently pointing out that Sinn Féin has opposed every Irish referendum that sought greater EU integration.
Sinn Féinrepresentatives have defended this historyand have argued that critiquing “the European project” should not equate to the label of eurosceptic.
In any event, Smith’s contention that euroscepticism does not influence Irish politics does not mean it doesn’t exist here, but rather that there is “no evidence” to suggest it is “shaping the political landscape”.
Candidates for the Irish Freedom Party, for example, which directly campaigns for an Irish exit from the EU,received 2% or less in first-preference votesin last year’s general election.
Smith writes:
Smith goes on to argue that the initial rejection of the Nice and Lisbon treaties in Ireland “had more to do with domestic and anti-establishment stances than hard euroscepticism”.
She adds that the “Brexit factor” has also improved the status of the EU among Irish people, arguing that it has “harnessed support for the EU”.
Anannual poll by the European Movement Irelandhas tracked sentiment about Ireland and the EU since 2013.
This year’s poll found only 9% of people supported Ireland leaving the EU whereas, in 2015, 23% of people said the country should leave if the UK voted to do so.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
The coming year represents an important juncture for the EU’s stability and for the development of euroscepticism across the bloc, specifically the euroscepticism of the far-right.
A growing east-west divide washighlighted during last month’s EU summitwhen Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic stood in opposition to Brussels after Poland’sSupreme Court had ruled that certain EU lawswere unconstitutional.
It came onthe back of a showdown at an earlier summitwhen Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban defended his parliament’s anti-LGBTQ law from criticism from various EU leaders.
Orban’s authoritarian regime in Hungary has been an increasing concern for many western nations and earlier this year his Fidesz party wasforced out of the EPP European Parliamentgrouping which includes Fine Gael.
The departure of Fidesz from the group ended the debate between EPP parties over whether to kick Orban’s party out or keep his MEPs inside the tent to prevent them siding with far-right eurosceptics.
This fear was realised a number of months later when Orban, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party and 14 other parties across the right and far-right said they would work towards a “grand alliance” in the European Parliament.
Efforts at forming a coherent eurosceptic alliance of the right have long provided elusive but the joint declaration by the parties sought to move it a step closer.
Other signatories included Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s anti-immigration League, Santiago Abascal of the Spanish populist movement Vox and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland’s governing PiS party.
In the statement, they say that the EU “continues to pursue the federalist path that inexorably distances it from the peoples who are the beating heart of our civilisation”.
They urged “reform” of the bloc, adding that Europe’s “most influential patriotic parties” had “understood the importance” of joining forces.
Crucially, both Le Pen and Orban are facing elections next year that will go a long way to determining how influential the alliance may be.
Le Pen is facing an uphill struggle and, based on current polling, may not even make the run off vote against Emmanuel Macron, as she did in 2017.
Even if she or her similarly far-right rival Eric Zemmour do make the head-to-head vote against Macron, it is not expected that they will win the presidency outright.
Le Pen was in Budapest last month and met with Orban, refusing while there to criticise Hungary’s anti-LGBTQ law that’s at the centre of the row with Brussels.
Orban himself is facing tough parliamentary elections in April 2022 after six opposition parties took the unprecedented step of backing a single candidate as part of their efforts to unseat him.
Marki-Zay became the opposition candidate after a primary, consolidating an anti-Orban coalition in the first-past-the-post electoral system.
Polling is said to be neck-and-neck in the contest but the UN has already warned about the staunchly pro-Orban media attempting to “distort” the race.
Reflecting on the coming year, De Gruyter says that while you “never know” what can happen in elections, there have been various examples in recent years of centrist parties defeating populism in places like Switzerland and Austria, a fact she hopes is repeated:
“If we put our heads down and let them walk all over us, we can get into the kinds of scenarios where the far-right wins. But under normal circumstances we should keep answering these guys, because perhaps while they ask the right questions they never provide answers, so we should keep answering them and when they attack democracy, we should defend it.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/protocol-deal-latest-5999627-Feb2023/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Feb 2023
THE UK AND the EU appeared to inch closer to a deal over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol after “productive” talks were held during an “intensive” phase of negotiations.
It comes after the DUP attempted to dampen hopes that it will support any deal on the Protocol, despite Downing Street raising hopes of an imminent announcement of a deal.
Downing Street earlier insisted a “final deal” had not been struck as they seek an agreement that will satisfy the demands of the DUP.
A spokesperson denied reports that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been forced to delay an announcement – widely expected as early as this week – amid backlash from senior Tories and the DUP.
British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and the European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic agreed to hold a face-to-face meeting in the coming days after a video discussion this afternoon.
In a tweet, Cleverly welcomed today’s discussions with the European Commission vice-president, saying that they are “focused on finding a durable solution” for Northern Ireland.
“Intensive work continues and we agreed to talk again in the coming days,” he added.
Sefcovic described their video call, which was also joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, as a “productive” attempt to find joint solutions.

“Our top priority is to succeed for the benefit of all communities. Hard work continues. We’ve agreed to meet later this week”, he tweeted.
Sources in Brussels welcomed the move to schedule in-person talks as a positive step, but said a location had not been set.
Unionists politicians are seeking changes to the trading arrangements, with the DUP blocking the operation of the Stormont Assembly as part of its opposition to the Protocol.
Changes to the Protocol might pave the way for the DUP to end their effective parliamentary veto of the Assembly but senior DUP politicians have suggested that the bar for such changes has not yet been reached.
The DUP has warned it would not support a deal retaining the oversight role of the European Court of Justice.

Downing Street officials held talks with their Brussels counterparts yesterday on how to give local politicians a greater say in the application of EU law in the region, addressing what unionists call the “democratic deficit”.
Senior DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the party had “heard nothing” from the Government on this “fundamental issue”.
“The progress made so far is very slim. The fundamental issues have not been addressed,” Wilson told Channel 4 News yesterday.
Wilson went further today, stating that he does not believe there will be a deal this week between the UK Government and the EU.
Wilson said that Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market is also a non-runner for his party.
“If a deal is agreed which still keeps us in the EU single market, as ministers in the Northern Ireland Assembly we would be required by law to implement that deal and we are not going to do that because we believe such an arrangement is designed to take us out of the United Kingdom and indeed would take us out of the United Kingdom,” he told Sky News.
“Increasingly we would have to agree EU laws which diverge from UK laws and in doing so would separate our own country from the United Kingdom.
According to a report in The Times, Sunak is willing to go ahead with a UK-EU accord even without the DUP’s support.
Referring to the DUP’s issues around the European Court of Justice, the newspaper quoted an unnamed British official as saying that it would be “unhelpful” to “set a bar that is not necessarily in the interests of those we are trying to negotiate for”.
If a deal is reached between the UK and the EU it is likely that Sunak would have sufficient votes in the House of Commons to approve as it is likely to have the backing of the Labour party and a sizeable number of his own Conservative MPs.
Earlier in the day, Conservative former minister Simon Clarke backed a call by Boris Johnson for ministers to press on with legislation enabling them to override parts of the Protocol.
But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman stressed the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which is currently stalled in the House of Lords, remains “important” in “the absence of a negotiated solution”.
The spokesman told reporters: “It’s clear that we need to find solutions that protect Northern Ireland’s place in our internal market, safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and resolves the practical issues that the protocol is causing for families and businesses.
“The Prime Minister has been clear that we have not resolved all of those issues and no deal has been done as yet.”
Meanwhile, UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman described the Protocol Bill as “one of the biggest tools that we have in solving the problem on the Irish Sea”.
Braverman, a longstanding Eurosceptic, argued that Sunak is right to be “committed to finding a pragmatic solution to resolve these issues”.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said Downing Street will remain “in close contact” with the DUP and other parties, but added: “It would be wrong to say there is a final deal.
“There’s intensive work to do with the EU, that work is ongoing.”
Downing Street declined to commit to a Commons vote, with the official spokesman only saying: “You will hear more from us should an agreement be reached with the EU that reaches the challenges the Prime Minister has set out.”
Labour leader Keir Starmer, speaking to broadcasters during a visit to Essex, said: “I think it should be put to a vote, and I’m very clear to the Prime Minister I will put the country first and the party second and he should do the same.”

Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels today.
The meeting of EU foreign ministers was said to be dominated by the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but discussions on the Protocol are also likely to feature.
Speaking to reporters, he was asked about the issue of democratic consent and whether Brussels would countenance a deal that gave politicians in Northern Ireland more of a say in shaping the EU laws.
He said it was important that any agreement needed to have have mechanisms so that parties could have ongoing “inputs”.
“People want to make sure that this negotiated resolution between the EU and UK sustains into the future and so, within the joint committees there are mechanisms there that can be developed to facilitate inputs, to make sure that this agreement sustains into the future, and those concerns have been heard by all concerned.
Martin said there are “substantive” and “problem-solving” talks ongoing between the UK and EU.
He added, that trust between the parties has improved in recent months:
“It’s the resolution of these concerns by negotiation of the subject matter and the process has been ongoing over the last three to four months. It’s clear to me that very, very good progress has been made and also that the nature of the engagement has been a genuine one, and trust has built up .”

https://www.thejournal.ie/used-car-prices-rise-pandemic-brexit-5571053-Oct2021/,"USED CAR PRICES are now nearly 50% higher than they were just before the beginning of the pandemic in January 2020, a survey reveals.
The report, published by DoneDeal, found that the pandemic and “Brexit-induced shock” has had a “staggering effect on prices”.
In just three monthssince June 2021used car prices have increased by 10.6%, the largest quarterly price inflation seen in used car prices in Ireland since the start of the DoneDeal data in 2011.
“Not only are prices still increasing but also the rate of increase appears to be speeding up, not slowing down,” the report found.
“DoneDeal’s Car Price Index, modeled by TCD and NUIG economist Dr. Tom Gillespie, shows that depreciation and increased mileage is still making cars cheaper, but the overall price inflation (from decreased supply and increased demand) is eclipsing that negative effect, and therefore cars are appreciating in value for many models.
“The number of cars required to bring prices back to ‘normal’ levels is in the region of 110,000 additional cars based on pre-pandemic levels,” the report added.
The study found that the Car Price inflation appears to be much more acute at the lower end of the market where supply is constrained due to fall out of the end of life Celtic Tiger cars and Brexit reducing the number of imports.

“Choked supply due to Brexit and pandemic-induced delays on the production of new cars - coupled with increased demand from increased savings – are widely cited as causes of this abnormal price growth, and these contributing factors are showing few signs of abating in the short term.
“The pandemic and Brexit-induced shock to the market has had a staggering effect on prices – used car prices are now nearly 50% higher than they were just before the onset of the pandemic in February 2020.
“Although the pandemic-induced supply shock has affected most car markets globally, Ireland’s case is exacerbated due to the compounding effect of Brexit. New barriers to trade have disrupted the regular flow of UK used cars into the Irish market.
“Imported used car registrations are declining fast from a peak of 110,000 per year in 2019 to about 80,000 in 2020, and – with only 30,000 registered so far in 2021 –  this year may see only half the 2019 number of used cars being imported into Ireland,” the report found.
Demand for cars has increased, the report suggests, due to the pandemic causing an increased reliance on cars.
“For example, people moving out of cities are necessarily more reliant on cars as public transport is less developed and operating at a reduced capacity due to restrictions,” the report speculated.
The problem of increasing costs appears to be worst at the lower end of the market where supply is constrained due to end-of-life Celtic Tiger cars and Brexit reducing the number of imports.
Inflation is lower in the upper quarter of the market in cars worth €13,000 or more, running at 3.9%.
The report said that to bring the prices back to pre-covid-19 levels there is a need for 110,000 additional cars. Cash buyers make up around 50% of the market at present, DoneDeal says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-imperial-measurements-announcement-5777296-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|29 May 2022
BORIS JOHNSON IS set to make an announcement that could pave the way for increased use of imperial measurements after the UK’s break with the European Union, reports have said.
The UK government is preparing to open a consultation into how to further incorporate imperial measurements in Britain, the PA news agency understands.
Brandon Lewis, a Conservative MP and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has said that voters and businesses are “pleased” with the move
Ministers are preparing to consult on how to further incorporate imperial measurements in Britain after Brexit, with Boris Johnson reportedly keen to announce the move on Friday to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.
The move has faced criticism from the Conservative backbenches, with Alicia Kearns – one of at least 20 Tory MPs to declare they have lost confidence in the Prime Minister over his handling of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street – calling the idea “a nonsense”.
But Lewis said that while the policy was “light-hearted” and a “smaller” freedom provided by Brexit, there were people who “want to go back” to using imperial weights, such as pounds and ounces, and measures such as yards and miles.
The EU weights and measures directive came into force in 2000, with traders legally required to use metric units for sale-by-weight or the measure of fresh produce.
It remains legal to price goods in pounds and ounces but they have to be displayed alongside the price in grams and kilograms.

But the consultation, which is being co-ordinated by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, could change those stipulations, allowing traders to choose how they price fresh items.

Kearns, an MP for Rutland and Melton, tweeted that “not one constituent, ever, has asked for this”.
She added: “This isn’t a Brexit freedom. It’s a nonsense.”
Lewis, however, said it would allow the likes of greengrocers and pub landlords to run their businesses as they see fit following the UK’s exit from the European Union.
He told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: “This gives people and businesses the freedom.
“There are sectors out there – I know people out there in my constituency, the market traders and vegetable traders as well as some of the pubs – which will be pleased to be able to go back to those imperial measurements.
“We’re just saying you now have a choice, and now we’ve left the EU we can do that.
“Yes, it is one of the smaller things we can do since we left the EU, there are other bigger things we can do and want to do, but it is an indication we now have the freedom to make these decisions ourselves.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/terror-threat-northern-ireland-mi5-5717768-Mar2022/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Mar 2022
THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE agency MI5 has lowered the terror threat in Northern Ireland from severe to substantial but warns that an attack is likely.
The agency has responsibility for internal intelligence operations within the United Kingdom.
A statement from Brandon Lewis, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said the decision was made independent of the British Government.
The assessment from MI5 has recommended the change for the first time since September 2010.
“Despite the change in the threat level, terrorism remains one of the most direct and immediate risks to our National Security and to communities in Northern Ireland.
“There remains a small group of people determined to destabilise the political settlement in Northern Ireland through acts of terrorism.
“Substantial means that a terrorist attack is likely and might well occur without further warning,” a British statement said.
Chief Constable Simon Byrne, of the PSNI, welcomed the reduction but cautioned that the threat remains high but said that it showed the success in combatting terrorist groups in Northern Ireland particularly in targeting the New IRA.
“The independent assessment means the threat has moved from an attack is ‘highly likely’, to ‘likely’.
“Unfortunately, there is still a small group of people within our society who are intent on causing harm and dragging Northern Ireland back to the past.  We will continue to pursue those individuals and bring them before the courts.

“The public won’t see an immediate change in how we deliver policing and our priority will remain the same, to deliver a visible, accessible and responsive community focused policing service to keep people safe,” Byrne said.
The reduction in threat level comes as discussions continue around the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol.
Recent reports of violence and threats from Loyalists as well as Republican dissidents has raised concerns among politicians.
Loyalist activitiesincluded extensive street violence in Aprilof last year – there is also concerns of a border campaign by dissident republican elements.

There have also been a number of arrestsin the border county by gardaí investigating dissident republican activities.
Sources have said that concerns are high among security agencies north and south of the border that Brexit fuelled disquiet could cause a spike in terrorist activity.
Previously a former commander of the Real IRA, John Connolly, said in this publication thatcustoms infrastructure on the borderwould cause attacks and be a recruitment bonanza for dissident republicans.
A Department of Justice spokesperson in Dublin said that Irish agencies were working closely with British efforts to prevent terror attacks.
“Any level of threat from the terrorist activities is a major concern for the Government.
“There is ongoing close co-operation between An Garda Síochána and their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain to counter the threat from terrorists,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-uk-relations-6082289-May2023/,"RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EU and UK have improved significantly this year following the change in leadership in Downing Street,The Journalunderstands.
The political upheaval in late 2022 after Boris Johnson was pushed to resign as prime minister, which ultimately led to the appointment of incumbent Rishi Sunak, marked a change in the post-Brexit diplomatic relationship between the two sides.
Less than a year ago, relations between the EU and UK were particularly terse as the British governmentpushed forward with the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, a piece of legislation that sought to override parts of the Protocol to scrap customs checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.
The landscape has changed dramatically since then with the change of leadership in the Conservative Party and the signing of theWindsor Frameworkthis spring.
Speaking to reporters today in Brussels, Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly said there was now “good news” on Brexit after “four or five horrible years under Boris Johnson, a buffoon who didn’t take anything seriously and you couldn’t take him seriously”.

“But thankfully, the Brits got sick of Johnson eventually. Liz Truss lasted 44 days, and along came a mature politician with a sense of responsibility in Sunak.”
Kelly said that the Windsor Framework has “changed the whole dynamic and things are now beginning to work at least”.
“Brexit obviously can never be as good as being in the European Union, for the UK or for probably us either, but at least we’re moving in a responsible manner politically.”
Turning to Northern Ireland, he said that if the Stormont institutions – which have been prevented from forming a functioning Executive by the DUP over its discontent with the post-Brexit deal – can get “up and running”, then “we may be able to talk about how the future would look and prepare for the future”.
The Journalunderstands that the EU Commission also considers relations with the UK to be in a better place than they were last year, with more constructive discussions on the future relationship between the bloc and its ex-member state.
The tone and level of cooperation in meetings with the UK are considered to have improved in recent months compared to the dynamics under Boris Johnson’s leadership, which are remembered as difficult engagements.
However, there is a sense on the EU side that the extent of the impact of Brexit on the UK will continue to become clearer in the years to come and that the economic effects will be significant, even with improved relations.

The Windsor Framework, which wasagreed uponin March after months and months of negotiations, is seen by the EU Commission as having allowed discussions about the future to move forward significantly.
The framework was born out of intense back-and-forth over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the post-Brexit trading arrangement that allowed goods to pass freely between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland and instead face checks when crossing the Irish Sea.
Under the framework, a new system of checks on goods from Britain to Northern Ireland created a ‘green’ and ‘red’ lane respectively for goods with a destination in Northern Ireland and goods moving onwards to Ireland or elsewhere in the EU.
Progress is still ongoing between both sides on how to navigate trading arrangements in the wake of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

REPORTS THAT RISHI Sunak’s government is considering putting the UK on the path to a Swiss-style relationship with the EU is “categorically untrue”, a spokesperson has said.
The spokesperson said: “These reports are categorically untrue.
“This Government is focused on using our Brexit freedoms to create opportunities that drive growth and strengthen our economy.
“Brexit means we will never again have to accept a relationship with Europe that would see a return to freedom of movement, unnecessary payments to the European Union or jeopardise the full benefit of trade deals we are now able to strike around the world.”
Senior figures in Sunak’s government are reportedly considering putting the UK on the road to a Swiss-style relationship with the EU, according to The Sunday Times.
The paper has reported that the move could take place over the next decade as the British government eyes up a closer relationship with the EU that avoids the current barriers to trade.
Any such shift, only a few years after Boris Johnson secured a deal with the EU after years of back-and-forth negotiations, would likely inflame backbench Tory Brexiteers.
Downing Street sources rejected the report but the Times suggested that behind closed doors some in Government have indicated that the pursuit of a frictionless trading relationship with the bloc requires moving to a Swiss-style arrangement over the next 10 years.
According to the paper, this would not extend to a return to freedom of movement.
Switzerland and the EU have a close economic relationship based on a series of bilateral agreements, giving the country direct access to parts of the EU’s internal market including the free movement of people.

The UK is locked in long-running talks with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement for the region designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.
Unionists have opposed the protocol as impeding trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, placing a border in the Irish Sea.
This has resulted in the collapse of the Stormont Assembly, with top civil servants left to run government departments.
However, there have been renewed hopes in recent weeks that a deal can be secured and the relationship improved between the UK and the EU after years of tensions.
A Swiss-style veterinary agreement has been one of the options mooted by some on the EU side as a solution to the protocol dispute, while in the years after the Brexit vote a deal inspired by the Swiss-EU relationship was seen as one among many options for the UK after it voted to leave the bloc.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt this week admitted that Johnson’s Brexit deal caused damaging trade barriers with the European Union, as he said immigration will be “very important” for the economy.
Hunt also insisted the UK would find a way to improve trading ties with the EU without rejoining the single market.
Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, was among those to criticise any suggestion that the UK could pursue a Swiss-style arrangement.
The Tory MP tweeted: “I very much hope and believe this isn’t something under consideration. We settled the question of leaving the European Union, definitively, in 2019.”
Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator, also tweeted that he hoped if that the report was correct “the Government thinks better of these plans, fast”.
Labour does not want the UK to rejoin the European Union’s single market, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said.
He added that Labour would not adopt a Swiss-style relationship with the EU, which the Government is reportedly looking at.","8.51am, 20 Nov 2022",20 Nov 2022
https://www.thejournal.ie/the-protocol-northern-ireland-5615083-Dec2021/,"ANY HOPES THAT the talks between the EU and the UK over the changes needed to the Northern Ireland Protocol were actually going well appeared to be dashed, yet again, on Friday afternoon.
The UK’s David Frost told reporters that “the gap between our positions is still significant and progress on many issues has been quite limited” after his discussions with the EU’s Maroš Šefčovič.
The two sides are to have “intensified talks” in the coming days, RTÉ’s Tony Connollyreported.
Although an agreement on Protocol changes is still possible, and preferred by both sides, it’s unclear whether there will be full agreement this side of Christmas.
It is possible that agreement could be found on some elements before the end of the year, but that others will remain unresolved until the New Year.
It’s been suggested that full agreement in the springtime is a priority for the EU, not only to finish with Brexit and move onto more pressing topics, but to have the measures in place before the Northern Ireland Assembly elections next May – where it’s strongly expected that the Protocol will be used as a campaigning tool.
“Because of the elections, the Protocol will remain a live issue here,” one expert said. “The DUP in particular sees the majority of its supporters as anti-Protocol, so they will continue to bang that drum next year, which is rational for that party to do.”
A lack of trust from both the EU and UK is now dominating the talks on reaching a fix. A report from the House of Lords noted that the crux of the disagreement is, as always, based on suspicion and motive: the EU fears that the UK will undermine the Protocol, and “not live up to its political and legal commitments”, while the UK fears that the EU “will always prioritise the integrity of the Single Market over the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland”.
“This has contributed to a serious deterioration in relations between London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels,” it said.

Though this has led to the UK threatening to trigger Article 16 of the Protocol as a last resort, recent reports have suggested that the UK government is increasingly aware that this would not get rid of the Protocol, but would only suspend parts of it temporarily.
Cabinet Office minister David Frost this weekacknowledgedto Ulster Unionist Party politician Reg Empey: “Triggering it does not affect the standing of the Protocol as a whole.”
In order to adhere to the rules of triggering Article 16, the UK government would also have to clarify what aspects of the Protocol it will be suspending and why – if it doesn’t adhere strictly to these parameters of Article 16, it could face legal action from the EU.
Experts have repeatedly concluded that Article 16 looks increasingly less useful as a legal tool to opt out of the Protocol, or the problems associated with it. If triggered, the UK would only be able to suspend some parts of the Protocol temporarily, in very limited circumstances. It would still be legally obliged to implement the rest of the Protocol.
But experts have also acknowledged that Article 16 has so far proven a useful political tool – one saidthat it was like wielding a gun with no ammunition: far more effective as a threat than as an actual weapon.
The Protocol: a recap
Katy Hayward / DCU Brexit InstituteKaty Hayward / DCU Brexit Institute/ DCU Brexit Institute
The Protocol is essentially the rulebook of special post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. It means that despite the EU-UK trade deal struck for Great Britain, Northern Ireland has a different set of rules in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and maintain the peace and stability set out by the Good Friday Agreement.
In order to avoid that border going through the island of Ireland, a ‘regulatory’ border was agreed along the Irish Sea, while Northern Ireland also remains ‘aligned’ to the EU’s Customs Union – meaning product standards and customs are checked when goods arrive at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports instead of at the Irish border.
In short, this means that Northern Ireland is in the Single Market, while England, Scotland and Wales are outside of it. This ‘regulatory border’ means that it is easier for NI exporters to send their goods to EU member states than it is for Great Britain, while NI businesses are also able to send goods to the rest of the UK, most without extra checks or costs.
For importing British goods into Northern Ireland, trade is more difficult than before. Because Northern Ireland is in the EU’s Single Market, goods being sent there need to have the correct paperwork, possibly pay additional costs, and they need to meet certain standards, so as not to dilute the value of the EU marketplace.
This has resulted in reports of some GB businesses not sending goods to Northern Ireland that they had sent there before, due to the level of additional bureaucracy.

Katy Hayward, professor of social science at Queen’s University, said that a “lack of clarity” over what to expect from the Protocol “arises from the different versions of it” there have been over the years of Brexit negotiations.

“The backstop was an insurance policy, if the UK wasn’t aligned enough, but the Protocol, or the ‘frontstop’, was coming into play no matter what -  it was always going to have an impact on arrangements for Northern Ireland,” she toldThe Journal.
“That was not spelled out or admitted by the British government. The transition period in 2020 was spent on the future relationship talks, rather than giving businesses information on what GB-NI trade would look like.”
“On 1 January 2021, there was still a lot of doubt or gaps in information in what was needed for goods going from GB to NI. When there is a new regime, a big part of managing that is making people familiar with the rules.”
The products that are harder to send
One clear example of where this has raised problems with the Protocol in action over the past year is the EU ban on importing chilled processed meats from ‘third’ countries – think sausages, mince, chicken nuggets, and pre-made lasagnas.

The sanitary and phytosanitary checks (also known as SPS checks) on animal and plant-based products have also caused problems: products like milk and eggs need to be inspected, while pets, guide dogs, potted plants and seeds have been prevented entirely from being imported from GB to the North.
Many people say that this is the deal the UK government agreed to last Christmas Eve.
But the UK government may have been under the impression that the checks wouldn’t be applied as rigorously as they are, or that some wouldn’t be appliedat allif NI businesses could prove that goods imported from Great Britain were staying in that region, and not moving on to Ireland and the rest of the EU.
As one manufacturing expert toldThe Journal: the essence of the differences between the two sides is that the UK thinks checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland should be treated as “innocent until proven guilty”, and that the EU thinks vice versa.
A possible solution was highlightedwell in this piece by Anton Spisakfor the Tony Blair Institute:
There have been other suggestions too: Professor Duncan Morrow of Ulster Universitytold a House of Lords committeethat a UK-EU veterinary agreement was “probably the single biggest thing that could be done in practical terms” to alleviate the burden of the Protocol.
The National Farmers’ Union and Ulster Farmers’ Union stated that they would welcome a long-term SPS agreement covering all affected products, including live animals, products of animal origin, plants and plant products, prohibited and restricted goods, growing media, and machinery.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneyhas suggested previouslythat this would eliminate the need for 80% of GB-to-NI checks.
Jess Sargeant, senior researcher for the Institute for Government, said that a UK-EU veterinary agreement could take several forms, including a Swiss-style agreement, with complete regulatory alignment and removing the need for almost all paperwork and checks; or a New Zealand-style agreement, which would reduce the frequency of checks.
The UK and EU have been trying to fix these for a while

Talks have been ongoing since the spring to sort out what UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called “teething problems” with the Protocol. The Joint-Committee, headed up by Cabinet Office minister David Frost and Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič, was created to handle how the Withdrawal Agreement is being implemented.
Despite these ongoing talks, and because of the chasm in the different approaches in implementing the Protocol, the threat of triggering Article 16 has been used by the UK government since January, after the European Commission suggested triggering Article 16 as part of a vaccine supply row with AstraZeneca.
Though it’s hoped a breakthrough can yet be made, it’s unclear whether an agreement will be struck.
There is one eye on Northern Ireland elections due in May: whatever Stormont Assembly is elected will give the power to the incoming MLAs to vote on whether to keep the Protocol in place for another four years, another eight years, or to get rid of it entirely.
The European Commission recently published suggestions on how to ease the problems in trade with the Protocol, based on conversations with Northern Ireland businesses. It is now in the process of demonstrating to the UK government how these changes would reduce the volume of customs checks on British goods by up to 50%.
But the UK has also been calling for the oversight of the European Court of Justice to be removed from the Protocol – despite this not being a priority for communities in Northern Ireland. It’s also not clear how the oversight of the ECJ could be lifted under the limited provisions of Article 16, as it hasn’t been used yet to show that it has caused “serious difficulties”.
As a recent editorialin the Financial Times noted: “This reflects more the ideological preoccupations of Frost and fellow hard Brexiters with ‘sovereignty’ than realities in Northern Ireland. The unionist community is more concerned with making the deal function than with who is the ultimate arbiter.”
It’s not straightforward how Article 16 would work

Article 16Article 16
When Britain threatens to trigger Article 16, there is uncertainty over exactly how that would even work. The provision, which is in other EU trade deals, has never been used before.
There are also a lot of caveats to triggering Article 16 – some of which contradict the Protocol itself, and others that aren’t clear on how arbitration measures would work.
It is supposed to be an emergency clause, that can be used if the Protocol causes “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist”, and cannot be solved by negotiation. The idea is that if the Protocol arrangements are causing such problems, Article 16 can be triggered in order to lift the measures that are causing problems.
British Brexit Minister David Frost speaks to the media ahead of a meeting in Brussels. 19 November.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
In a briefing paperby John Curtis, a Senior Clerk at the Commons Library, it’s pointed out that because Article 16 hasn’t been triggered before, and because this is an unusual trade dispute that is highly politicised, the “safeguard” measures under Article 16 and retaliatory “counter-balancing” measures aren’t straightforward:
Robert Howse argues that the phrasing in the Protocol that measures should “least disturb” how the Protocol works suggests that any measures brought in under Article 16would“disturb” how the Protocol works.
If the UK does trigger Article 16, it’s likely to do so over customs and the movement of goods, but VAT, the Single Electricity Market, or state aid could also be affected.
In response to these, the EU could threaten to withhold cooperation on Gibraltar negotiations, data adequacy and financial services, or even suspend the entire EU-UK trade deal, as has been threatened publicly.

Primarily a political tool
Though the threat of Article 16 has loomed all year, domestic politics has played into the UK government’s decision on whether to pull that trigger.

One suggestion is that the UK government was legitimately planning to trigger Article 16, but after the Tories became embroiled ina sleaze rowand corruption claims, it cooled off on the idea.
“There’s enough going on [right now],” an adviser toldthe Financial Times, referring to inflation, cost of living, energy prices, and Covid-19 pressures.
The other side of that coin is the Article 16 row flared up in order to distract from the sleaze row the Tories were coming under pressure from at home – which saw Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party take a hit that put them behind Labour for the first time in 12 months.
That sleaze row, which invoked outrage among the public after Conservative MPs voted against suspending an MP accused of breaking lobbying rules, began with a Commons vote on 3 November.
There were murmurings and then chatter and then shouting in the British press that Article 16 could be used by mid-November. But by 22 November, things had cooled off: junior minister Anne-Marie TrevelyansaidArticle 16 wouldn’t be used this side of Christmas – and there hasn’t been much mention of it since.
Katy Hayward toldThe Journalthat Article 16 is “primarily a political tool”.
“Even referring to it might be a negotiating tactic, rather than an economic strategy,” she said.
This idea has been echoed by others. International Law Professor Robert Howse of the University School of Law wrote in a report publishedthis month:
“In heated political quarters, Article 16 is held up as a weapon – but one gets the sense this is done with little certainty as to just what ammunition the weapon is loaded with”.
Hayward says the UK government also hasn’t been specific on what parts of the Protocol they would suspend under Article 16.
“We’re at a standstill on grace periods, so the fact that there is no full implementation of the Protocol, the question does arise: what would you use [Article 16] for? The UK government keep pointing to a diversion of trade, with North-South trade increasing, that’s forcing us to speculate: would they try to ease East-West trade?”
“Some people have also suggested that they would remove Articles 5-10 of the Protocol, which would include the Single Electricity Market, which would have an impact.

https://www.thejournal.ie/keir-starmer-brexit-6171360-Sep2023/,"UK LABOUR LEADER Sir Keir Starmer has said he will be seeking a closer trading relationship with the EU if his party wins the next election.
Starmer spent the weekend meeting fellow centre-left leaders in Montreal, Canada, including the country’s prime minister Justin Trudeau.
It comes amid a flurry of overseas engagements before party conference season, with Starmer expected to meet French President Emmanuel Macron later this week.
Speaking to The Financial Times, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister said he would be seeking a rewritten Brexit deal.
Labour has long been critical of the deal negotiated by the Conservatives under Boris Johnson, with the Trade and Cooperation Agreement up for review in 2025.
Starmer told the paper: “Almost everyone recognises the deal Johnson struck is not a good deal – it’s far too thin.
“As we go into 2025 we will attempt to get a much better deal for the UK.”
Labour has ruled out rejoining the customs union or single market, but Starmer said he was confident a better deal could be secured from Brussels.
“I do think we can have a closer trading relationship as well. That’s subject to further discussion,” he said.

“We have to make it work. That’s not a question of going back in. But I refuse to accept that we can’t make it work. I think about those future generations when I say that.
“I say that as a dad. I’ve got a 15-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. I’m not going to let them grow up in a world where all I’ve got to say to them about their future is, it’s going to be worse than it might otherwise have been.
‘Complete garbage’
Starmer earlier said it was “complete garbage” to suggest Labour planned to join an EU-wide migrant quota scheme as part of efforts to tackle small boat crossings in the Channel.
It comes after the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman accused Labour of planning to let the UK become a “dumping ground” for 100,000 migrants from the EU each year.
The political row emerged after the Labour leader indicated he could be prepared to do a deal with Brussels which would involve the UK taking a quota of asylum seekers who arrive in the bloc in exchange for the ability to return people who cross the English Channel.
“The idea that we’re going to join the EU scheme on quotas is complete nonsense. We’re not an EU member and that wasn’t what I was talking about,” he told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News.
Senior Labour figure Pat McFadden, questioned on the same issue on BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, said:
“I don’t think it’s going to be an allocation of numbers, we’re talking about individual cases where a child may have strong family links here.
Labour is also facing renewed pressure from its main union backer Unite, which is reportedly set to launch a grassroots campaign to call for more radical policies on energy and steel.
Unite general secretary Sharon Graham, who has called for public ownership of energy and has been critical of Starmer in the past, told The Guardian the union would be targeting so-called “red wall” areas as part of a bid to put pressure on the Labour leadership.","7.21am, 18 Sep 2023",

WHEN IRELAND JOINED what was then the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, the Irish punt was still linked to the British pound.
It was only later during that decade that the link was seriously questioned, with Ireland joining the European Monetary System at its inception in March 1979.
The UK stayed outside the system and Ireland went on to join the Euro. Not only did the UK not join the Euro, Brexit ultimately ended its membership completely.
The tale is an example of how Ireland and the UK’s journeys within the European Union started from a similar point before diverging dramatically.
Brexit has thrown up all manner of complex questions for Ireland, among them how Ireland’s EU alliances could change in the absence of our nearest neighbour.
There are other questions too, such as the extent to which Ireland will actually miss the UK as an ally and to whom the country may look to instead. As with most things Brexit-related, the answer to the first question is that it’s complicated.
The UK was an important EU ally to Ireland in certain areas but not so in others. The two had much in common in their strong support of trade and the single market but, when it came to agriculture, the two were almost diametrically opposed.
The Common Agricultural Policy, which for years was perhaps Ireland’s central concern, saw the country align much more closely with the likes of France.
During the 1990s, as London began to distance itself from Brussels, Ireland and the UK were also at different ends of the spectrum as the UK tried to rein in EU budget spending.
There was common ground of course, with the two countries often sharing a similar hesitancy to increased EU integration on defence. Ireland was keen to maintain its neutrality, with the UK suspicious of anything that might undermine its commitment to Nato.
More practically, joint membership of the EU also assisted with the improved UK-Ireland bilateral relationship that led to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, of course, the Good Friday Agreement.

Rory Montgomery, a long-time diplomat and former Irish ambassador to the EU, says  there are “many examples” of how Ireland and the UK working together at EU level helped their bilateral relationship.

New alliances
In recent years, Ireland’s alliances across the EU have not so much shifted but have become more dynamic and been increasingly issue-dependent.
One European Commission official described Ireland’s approach to the building of alliances as being “pragmatic”, with the country aligning with others on a policy level rather than a nation state level.
In the context of the UK, the same official said that, even long before Brexit, the UK had been “turning itself into the black sheep of the EU” and that common interests with Ireland had been dwindling for many years.
Instead, Ireland has been attempting to align with the Nordic nations of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden on issues such as trade, education and culture.
The Nordic strategy is also evidenced by Ireland’s effort togain observer on the Arctic Council, which also includes these countries.
Denmark in particular has frequently been cited as a naturally ally for Ireland, asDr Kathryn Simpsonof Manchester Metropolitan University explains:
Ireland’s most important EU allies in recent years have perhaps been the ‘Benelux’ countries of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, with the latter two of particular note in joining Ireland in opposition to a proposed digital tax.
Ireland’s late-in-the-day decision to agree toglobal OECD corporate tax reforms also pointed to where its priorities lie,with Estonia and Hungary the only other EU member states who left it so late to sign up.
Big tech

Data and big tech is another area where Ireland has taken an active approach to building alliances to protect its interests.
All EU member states have just signed up to the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which seek to increase oversight of big tech firms such as Facebook, Google and Apple.
The DSA attempts to clamp down on illegal content, while the DMA is an effort to increase competition in a field dominated by US multinationals.
As part of the agreements, each EU member state will continue to take the lead in policing the firms based in their own country, despite efforts from France to change this.
The EU’s long-held country-of-origin principle means that enforcement rules are handled by the national authority where a big company is based. France wanted other national regulators to be given greater power to intervene regardless of where a big tech firm is based.

Despite this small victory for Ireland and its allies, Montgomery believes issues around data and big tech will continue to be a sticking point for Ireland in the years to come.
“With any luck if the OECD deal holds it should, for the time being at least, remove quite a lot of the pressure we’ve been under – because there’s been very serious pressure for quite a long time now both on the corporation tax rate but also on the question of whether we’re facilitating digital companies to essentially avoid tax.”

If Ireland’s story within the EU was an opportunity for the country to increasingly demonstrate its autonomy from the UK, Brexit certainly hammered that message home.
Irish officials in Brussels say there are no positives from Brexit but it has at least put the country’s interests front and centre and demonstrated a cross-European unity in protecting them.
The ongoing debate over the Northern Ireland Protocol follows the mechanism formerly known as the backstop and the red line known as a hard border.
All of these Irish issues were given international prominence and have surely assisted in highlighting the negotiation skills of Irish diplomats. They have also shown that the country has determined allies in the ashes of Brexit.
Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald says she has been “struck again and again” by the level of understanding EU colleagues have shown but that it may be some time before Brexit is conclusively resolved.
“Somebody described the whole Brexit thing as being like an earthquake and we’re still in the aftershock period, so it’s going to take five to ten years for things to really settle down,” she says.
Simpson agrees and says the UK’s unsuccessful attempts to essentially “pit member states against one another” during early Brexit negotiations showed the strength of EU alliances and Ireland’s in particular.
“I think there would have been an expectation from the UK side in the initial stages of Brexit negotiations to kind of disunite the EU and try and pit member states off one another, and that has definitely not happened and still continues not to happen to this day. Even with current concerns over the Protocol; the EU is a bloc and it’s 27 and it’s firmly behind Ireland.”

Last week, British Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Robert Huey told a Stormont committee that Northern Ireland could soon be required to carry out the same number of agri-food checks as the EU currently does as a whole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today that the current stand-off with the European Union about trade regulations in Northern Ireland was “bound” to happen.
Asked about Minister David Frost telling Brussels to stop sulking over Brexit, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: “I think this is one of those issues we were always bound to have in the early stages of our new relationship with our friends in the EU and the various technical issues we are going to iron out.
Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in north London, he said: “I’m full of optimism about the future and the partnership we are building.”

Foster welcomed “small moves” by the UK government in extending some of the grace periods on checks under the protocol.
But she said minds must now concentrate on finding a replacement for the mechanism which keeps Northern Ireland in EU customs rules.
“I welcome the fact that government did move, but there’s much more to do, and actually the architecture of the protocol itself needs to be dealt with,” she told LBC Radio’s Swarbrick On Sunday show.
“There are other alternatives; of course those alternatives were rejected by the European Union, whether it was alternative arrangements, whether it was their own smart borders or indeed mutual enforcement which, of course, could be put in place as well.
“In order to find a solution, you have to have people who are willing to look for a solution, and up until now when we have indicated that the entire unionist community in Northern Ireland want this protocol gone. The answer you get from the European Union is ‘Yes, we should have more protocol’. It’s crazy, absolutely crazy.”
Foster said that once the grace periods on checks on goods under the Northern Ireland Protocol end, the number of agri-food certificates needed to come from Britain into Northern Ireland “will be close to the number currently processed by the European Union as a whole”.
“How is that proportionate in terms of what goes across from Great Britain into Northern Ireland?” she said.
“And what it is doing is causing a diversion of trade from GB into Northern Ireland, so Northern Ireland people are going to have to say ‘I need to find different suppliers’, and that’s not what Brexit is about.”

“Brexit was about the United Kingdom standing on the global stage, moving forward together, but because of this disastrous protocol that we have, that is not happening.”
The DUP’s partners in government, Sinn Féin, have a very different view of the protocol.
Earlier, Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy accused the UK government of “getting into a Mexican stand-off” with the EU.
He said the grace period extensions provide some short-term clarity for some people, but in the longer term it will damage the relationship between the UK and EU.
“The idea of doing a solo run on this, I think, is hugely damaging in the longer term, so if people think it might push that particular problem up the pipe for another few weeks or a month that’s well and good, but in the longer term business here need certainly,” he told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme.
“I’ve spoken to the American administration, we’ve been speaking to European people. They are looking at what is the long-term future here, and if the British Government are going to get into a Mexican stand-off with the European Commission, then we are going to be the casualty in the middle of that.”

Martin told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that there are bound to be teething issues since the UK left the EU and calm is needed.
A meeting in London is to be held later today between the European Commission’s vice president, Maroš Šefčovič, and UK Cabinet minister Michael Gove to discuss how to make the Protocol work more smoothly in practice.
Gove has asked that ‘grace periods’ for agri-foods and parcels being sent to Northern Ireland from Great Britain be extended until January 2023.
“We need to dial down the rhetoric on both sides,” Martin said in relation to the Protocol.
He added that people need to bear in mind that it is only about six weeks since the Brexit deal was agreed, suggesting that not enough time has been given to businesses to adjust.
“There are bound to be teething issues and teething problems, and certain people were not as prepared as they could have been in relation to the implications of Brexit,” he said.

Article 16
A row has ensued between the European Commission and AstraZeneca over the schedule of deliveries for EU member states in the first quarter of the year.
As part of the European Union’s response, it proposed triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has added fuel to a fiery row over post-Brexit checks and how they’re carried out in Northern Ireland.
Next Tuesday, Šefčovič is to appear before an Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to ask questions about how using Article 16 was first proposed.
Micheál Martin said today that the AstraZeneca dispute has reached “too high a pitch of a row” and that some member states need to “cool it” as well.
“I wasn’t too happy with the nature of the engagement over the last number of weeks,” Martin said.
“I’m engaged with the president of the Commission on the protocol to see if we can fine-tune it, and work on it.
Asked about the deteriorating relationship between the Irish Government and unionists, Martin said unionists need to “reflect and pull back” on the matter.
“Stand back from the nitty gritty and the teething issues that are undoubtedly there and they are there,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-afghanistan-us-brendan-boyle-5535607-Aug2021/,"IT WOULD BE “completely unacceptable” for the United Kingdom to abandon the Northern Ireland protocol, a US congressman has said.
Democrat Brendan Boyle said the UK must “live up” to the protocol that it agreed to with the EU on Northern Ireland, which deals with keeping the border open between Ireland and the North.
Instead of checks along the border, goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are inspected at Northern Ireland ports and can then be moved around the island under the terms of the protocol.
Leaders in Westminster and Stormont want to see the protocol renegotiated, claiming that it is dividing Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, but the EU and Irish governmentare opposed.
On Friday, Taoiseach Michéal Martin and DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldsonheld talksin Dublin over the protocol, with Donaldson saying he told the Taoiseach that unionists’ relationship with the rest of the UK is “being harmed on a daily basis by this protocol”.
The Taoiseach said he acknowledged the unionists’ concerns but that the current UK-EU trade agreement has the necessary mechanisms to resolve the issues around the protocol.
In an interview withThe Journal, Brendan Boyle said that “the UK, and specifically this British government, negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, signed the deal, then campaigned and passed the deal through its parliament, so it is clear that the British government, like all sides, needs to live up to that which it negotiated and agreed to”.
Boyle, whose father immigrated to the US from Donegal in 1970, said that it would be “completely unacceptable for the UK or any party to the agreement to renege on it”.
“The only way forward is through the NI Protocol to mitigate the damage that has been caused by Brexit and the hard Brexit that this British government opted for,” Boyle said.
“The US has not been shy about calling this out publicly and we will continue to do so.”

On the States’ role in the future of Northern Ireland, Boyle said that the US is “always going to maintain a strong interest and an active role in Ireland”.
He said that many of the politicians involved with US foreign policy “believe that the Good Friday Agreement was a major international achievement that wouldn’t have happened without a number of parties but especially the US and that we have a moral responsibility to remain engaged in that effort and to avoid any backsliding into the way things were for decades before the Good Friday Agreement”.
“Irish Americans are part of the mainstream of the US, yet still, for the most part, maintain an interest in what is going on in Ireland today,” Boyle said.
“There is really no segment or group in the US either politically or in society that opposes US engagement in this issue and so at a time of heightened polarisation, this is one of the few issues where members of both parties are able to work together and see things pretty similarly.”
Speaking hours ahead of the United States’ complete departure from Afghanistan, Boyle said that there are elements of the withdrawal that “could have gone better”.
The US’ final remaining troops and diplomats haveofficially left Afghanistan, ending a 20-year war after it invaded the country in 2001.
36 Irish citizens have been evacuated from the country since the Taliban took hold of the capital on 15 August – but many others remain.
At least 60 Irish citizens or their family members are still in Afghanistan, alongside 15 Afghans with Irish residency.

“I don’t think there is any scenario in which a withdrawal would have been easy,” Boyle said. “I think in the months and years ahead there’ll be plenty of analysis of what went wrong and what should have been done.”
“We also need to be realistic about the enormous challenge presented in any sort of withdrawal. I do believe leaving Afghanistan is the right decision, as difficult as it may be to watch right now.”
He said that the “biggest intelligence failure” was “believing the Afghan government would last longer than it did”.
“That clearly proved to be inaccurate and so now all of us are attempting to do our best despite the fact that the intelligence got that so dramatically wrong,” he said.

“Moving forward, we shall see what kind of a country the Taliban want. Do they want to operate in a world environment in which they are treated as a pariah?
“They need a tremendous amount of economic aid internationally. 60% of the Afghan budget is provided internationally through aid, so the Taliban has a lot of incentive to cooperate internationally, but of course we saw how the Taliban operated in the 1990s and they had very little interest in that.
“The Taliban today has to deal with their own extremist threat from ISIS-K and that gives them another incentive to work with the international community and cooperate, so only time will tell.”
Polarised politics
Later this week, Boyle is addressing the Kennedy Summer School, a festival of Irish and American culture and politics, on the polarisation of US politics, where tensions between Republicans and Democrats are increasingly strained.
“I think Ireland is very fortunate that you’ve not seen the same level of polarisation,” Boyle said.
“Irish politics has so far really avoided what we see in the US, the UK and other western democracies.”
However, he said there is “no guarantee that that would continue into the future because I do think this problem is bigger than and beyond just the US”.
Within the US, there’s “no question that politics today are highly polarised and there are far fewer swing voters today than there were 25 years ago”.
Boyle said the country is in an era that is “very bitterly divided politically”.
“Behind the scenes, there still is a lot of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, it just doesn’t get covered to the same degree,” he said.
“Also, there’s a function of American politics right now in which there can sometimes be a penalty for compromising with the other side – you see the Republican primary electorate punishing and voting out more of their elected officials who try to work with the other side. That’s the state of where we are right now.”
He said that social media has “helped exacerbate internal divisions in US society and has helped spread conspiracy theories, whether it was about the 2020 presidential election or about Covid and the vaccine”.
“In the US, we have a very strong first amendment which protects the right to free speech, but still within the constraints of the first amendment I do believe the US government has to adapt its laws to deal with the unique problems presented by misinformation on social media.
“The challenge obviously is balancing the right to free speech with the right to protect society overall. That is a constant struggle.
“There’s always been a tension of attempting to find that fine line. I think right now, when it comes to social media, we’re not in balance and we are being too permissive to those who are using and abusing social media to do real harm to other people and to society.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-northern-ireland-protocol-british-government-article-16-5595028-Nov2021/,"A UK MOVE to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol could see the EU doing likewise with the Brexit trade deal, Simon Coveney has warned.
Coveney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said it appeared the UK was set to follow through with its threat to trigger the Article 16 suspension mechanism within the post-Brexit arrangements for Irish Sea trade.
He said it looked as though the UK was laying the foundations to make the move when the Cop26 conference in Glasgow was over.
Coveney said the EU would respond in a “very serious way” to such a unilateral act.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed hope a trade war could be avoided.
He minister insisted the EU was in “solutions mode” and could go a “little further” in terms of trying to streamline checks required on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
However, he warned there was a limit to the EU’s flexibility and criticised the UK Government for adopting a tactic of asking for a lot while offering nothing in return.
Refuses to implement
Noting potential retaliatory action the EU could take if the UK triggers Article 16, Coveney highlighted that the Trade and Co-Operation Agreement was contingent on implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the protocol arrangements.
“I believe that if the British government essentially refuses to implement the protocol, even with the extraordinary flexibilities that are now on offer, and instead looks to set it aside then I think the EU will respond in a very serious way to that,” he told RTE Radio One.
He said that did not mean the introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The minister added: “It means that the Trade and Co-operation Agreement that was agreed between the British government and the EU was contingent on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, which includes the protocol.
“One is contingent on the other. So if one is being set aside, there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU.”
Coveney said he hoped the UK and EU were not set for a trade war.
“I certainly hope we’re not,” he said.
“I think it is important that people like me and others who’ve been involved in this process make it very clear to the British Government the consequences of what they’re considering doing in the context of the triggering of Article 16.
“I think I have a responsibility to perhaps set aside the diplomatic language that I’m expected to use as a foreign minister and be a bit more direct in relation to the consequences of that, as the Taoiseach (Micheal Martin) has done this week.

“This would be a significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland, and would put extraordinary pressure on parties in Northern Ireland also.”
Partnership
The minister said Northern Ireland only works when the UK and Ireland work in partnership with each other.
Coveney insisted the EU would remain united in the face of any UK move on Article 16.
“We act and we have always acted together on this in solidarity, and I believe that solidarity will hold,” he said.
Negotiations between London and Brussels over the protocol remain deadlocked and there is mounting speculation that the UK Government is poised to trigger Article 16 later this month.
The Government has repeatedly warned it will move to unilaterally suspend elements of the protocol if an agreed outcome is not reached.
The oversight role of the European Court of Justice in policing the operation of the protocol remains a key sticking point in the talks to resolve issues with its operation.
Coveney suggested the EU could offer more flexibilities around reducing checks on agri-food products but he did not mention any potential movement on the thorny ECJ stand-off.
“I think the EU can go a little further on some of these issues and have indicated that their package is not the final word from the EU, but they want the UK Government to work with them in partnership to try to actually bottom out the remaining concerns,” he said.
Rewrite the protocol
Coveney criticised the UK strategy in talks with the EU and said London was essentially asking to rewrite the protocol entirely.
“The negotiating tactic of the British Government, of the Prime Minister and of Lord (David) Frost, has been very consistent – it has been to offer nothing and to continue to ask for more,” he said.
“In the short term that is a successful negotiating tactic because throughout this year, each month that passes, the EU has tried to provide new solutions, new answers, new compromises, more flexibility and so on.
“But, at some point, the EU says ‘enough, we are not negotiating with a partner here that is acting in good faith’.”
Earlier, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said the entire Withdrawal Agreement could be endangered if the UK triggers Article 16.
On the prospect of the UK activating the suspension mechanism, Ms McDonald said: “It would demonstrate just again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland, the north of Ireland in particular, is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions.
“I would also say that if the British Government imagine that they hold all of the cards they are wrong and they’re playing a very, very dangerous game, up to and including perhaps jeopardising the entire withdrawal agreement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/cross-border-trade-ireland-northern-ireland-goods-brexit-esri-6108712-Jul2023/,"CROSS-BORDER TRADE in goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland has experienced substantial growth since Brexit, according to new research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).
In Northern Ireland, 35% of imported goods came from Ireland in 2021 while 53% of its exported goods went south across the border, totaling €‎2.6 billion and €‎5.6 billion respectively.
Trade between the North and the rest of the UK was not included when compiling these figures.
Although the proportions of Ireland’s trade in goods with Northern Ireland were smaller in the same year – almost 5% of exports (€160.3) and just over 2% of imports (€99.8 billion) – these are “sizeable shares given the much smaller size of the Northern Ireland economy”, the report stated.
These figures, according to the ESRI report, signify “high levels of trade integration across the border”.
Among the sectors that make up cross-border goods trade between the North and Ireland, chemical and pharmaceutical products as well as food and beverages feature prominently.
“Both Northern Ireland and Ireland have relatively high concentrations of trade in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector,” the ESRI report stated.
The breakdown of goods traded across the border shows marked differences when compared to the overall import-export activity of each country individually.
This, the report said, “mainly comes about from a much greater variety of goods being traded cross-border relative to the more specialised patterns of overall trade”.
“The food and beverages sector accounts for a considerably larger share of cross-border trade than it does in the overall trade structure, with 24% of goods going from Ireland to Northern Ireland in this sector, and 27% of goods going from Northern Ireland to Ireland.”

The analysis also presents data on the overall trading patterns of the two countries.
“The next most important export partner for Northern Ireland is Germany, accounting for 15 per cent of total exports” the report read.
The research was funded by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec), a business sector lobbying group, as part of a research programme on the all-island economy.
The aim of the programme is to provide insights into the nature of the cross-border economic relationship between Ireland and Northern Ireland, especially for those working in affected industries following the UK’s departure from the EU.
Commenting on the publication of the analysis, Ibec director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said, “the latest publication on all island trade will provide businesses with invaluable insights on trade and supply chain trends in a post-Brexit context”.
“Business is increasingly aware of the growing opportunities in the all-island economy. The ESRI research demonstrates the pace of this trade growth in recent years and the importance of trade with the EU for Northern Ireland businesses.”
“The research will inform a better understanding of the overall functioning of the all-island economy and also support development of the all-island macroeconomic model which the research programme will ultimately deliver,” he added.
The nature of trade across the border has been the subject of much political debate since the UK voted to leave the EU back in 2016, with many business lobby groups arguing that a “hard Brexit” would have had far-reaching negative consequences for the North’s economy.
The dispute centred around the fact that no hard border exists on the island and therefore arrangements would have to be made when it came to protecting the single market, from the EU perspective, and from the British point of view, keeping trade between Northern Ireland and Britain free from red tape.
After years of arguments and renegotiations between the UK and EU over the form those customs arrangements would take, those fears were finally allayed to some degree when the two sides managed to negotiate what was dubbed the Windsor Framework in February of this year.
The aim of the Windsor Framework is to simplify customs procedures, facilitate parcel post and expand the existing trusted trader scheme for those doing business in the North.
The framework is to be implemented in stages, with the first round of changes – the expansion of the trusted trader scheme – coming into effect on 30 September this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-difficult-vote-windsor-framework-6008783-Mar2023/,"LAST UPDATE|2 Mar 2023
BORIS JOHNSON HAS said that he wishes he had slashed corporation tax to “outbid the Irish”, he told a summit today while criticising Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal.
“What I wish we had done is put a big ‘Invest here’ sign over Britain as soon as we were out of Covid,” Johnson told the Global Soft Power Summit.
He also challenged Sunak to cut corporation tax to “Irish levels or lower”, arguing there is “no point in just emulating the high tax high spend low growth European model”.
The former Prime Minister also suggested he may not vote for Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, criticising it as “not about the UK taking back control”.
The British Prime Minister’s chief political rival said today he would find it “very difficult” to support the Windsor agreement despite claiming some credit for the new pact being brokered.
In his first major speech in the UK since being ousted from office, the former British prime minister urged his successor to not betray the ideals of Brexit.
Sunak managed to secure a new deal from the European Union to replace Johnson’s much-criticised Northern Ireland Protocol that had seen the DUP walking out of powersharing in Stormont.

Johnson conceded people “want to move on” and sign the deal, adding that “they don’t want any more ructions and I get that, I’ve got to be realistic about it”.
“I’m conscious of where the political momentum is and people’s deep desire just to get on,” he added.
However, he raised numerous concerns about the Windsor Framework at a global soft power summit before telling the audience: “I’m conscious I’m not going to be thanked for saying this, but I think it is my job to do so, we must be clear about what is really going on here.
“This is not about the UK taking back control, and although there are easements this is really a version of the solution that was being offered last year to Liz Truss when she was foreign secretary.
“This is the EU graciously unbending to allow us to do what we want to do in our own country, not by our laws, but by theirs.”
Under the deal “British genome edited tomatoes could not go into the making of a cheese and tomato sandwich in Northern Ireland, which is a matter of great regret”, Johnson said.
Johnson said he has “no doubt at all” that his controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill threatening to override international law “is what brought the EU to negotiate seriously”.
Sunak scrapped the Bill after brokering the new deal, but Johnson urged him to have the “guts” to bring it back if the agreement does not succeed.
Johnson added: “I’m going to find it very difficult to vote for something like this myself, because I believed we should’ve done something very different. No matter how much plaster came off the ceiling in Brussels.”

During the speech for the Brand Finance consultancy, Johnson argued Northern Ireland would remain under EU law, with Brussels still making regulations, but “with what they hope will be lighter bureaucracy” under Sunak’s deal.
He said he is “particularly concerned” about goods going through manufacturing in Northern Ireland from Great Britain undergoing checks in some instances which he argued seems “pretty crazy”.
But in a moment approaching humility, Johnson conceded he made mistakes with his protocol.
“I thought those checks would not be onerous since there isn’t that much stuff that falls into that category, most of the goods stay in Northern Ireland,” he said.
Muttering, he added: “It’s all my fault, I fully accept responsibility.”
Earlier in the day, Downing Street said that some people are “misunderstanding” the Windsor Framework signed with the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen on Monday.
Sunak is almost certain to win a House of Commons vote on the deal because he has Labour’s support, but he is not finding much in the way of vocal criticism in the Tory party either.

The UK officially left the EU at 11pm – midnight in Brussels – on 31 January 2020, after three-and-a-half years of political wrangling that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The Conservatives have celebrated the anniversary, with shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel saying it marked five years since her party “honoured the democratic will of the British people and got Brexit done”.
She said: “Since then, our country has reaped the benefits – securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels.”

Patel went on to warn that Labour, “driven by socialist ideology and blind to the will of the people”, was “determined to dismantle Brexit and drag us back into the EU’s grasp” and vowed not to “allow this betrayal to happen”.
Nigel Farage, one of Brexit’s top cheerleaders, told his GB News show on Thursday: “I still 100% believe it was the right thing to do.”
Farage admitted he was “disappointed in the way it’s been delivered”.
Since coming to power, Labour has sought a “reset” in relations with the EU, but has consistently ruled out a return to either the customs union or the single market.

But with polls showing a majority of the public thinks Brexit was the wrong decision, other opposition parties have called on the UK Government to pursue even closer relations with the bloc.
Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey used the fifth anniversary of Brexit to criticise the Conservative deal as “an utter disaster for our country” that had resulted in “farmers, fishers and small businesses” being “caught up in red tape”.
He reiterated his call for a UK-EU customs union deal, saying it would “unlock growth, demonstrate British leadership and give us the best possible hand to play against President Trump”.
Green MP Ellie Chowns also called for the UK to rejoin the customs union and agree a youth mobility scheme with the bloc, but added “full membership of the EU remains the best option for the UK” and said her party would pursue “a policy to re-join as soon as the political will is present”.

Their calls come as polling from YouGov suggested 55% of the British public backed rejoining the EU, with the same proportion saying leaving the bloc was the wrong decision.
Only 30% of people said Brexit had been the right decision, while just 11% said they thought leaving the EU had been a success.
However, the Government has been adamant that it will not rejoin either the customs union or the single market.
Yesterday, the official spokesman for British prime minister Keir Starmer said the UK Government’s approach was “to strengthen our ties on security and defence, improve the relationship on trade and investment and work with the EU to identify areas which are in the UK’s national interest”.
He added: “You can see through the work we’ve done so far working towards a security partnership, committing to six-monthly foreign policy dialogues, that we’re taking an approach that supports our ambitions to deliver greater safety, security and prosperity across the UK.”
Asked whether the Government was embarrassed about Brexit, a Downing Street spokesman said: “Our focus is very much on the future. That’s why the Prime Minister has spoken of the importance of resetting the relationship with Europe and that’s the job he is getting on with.”","7.31am, 31 Jan 2025",
https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-uk-relations-5444101-May2021/,"ONLY ABOUT ONE in eight Irish people trust the British government, according to polling carried out byIreland Thinkson behalf ofThe Journal.
The survey shows that about two-thirds of respondents either ‘distrust’ or ‘strongly distrust’ the British government, making it more distrusted than the US government and the European Commission.
The European Commission is the only one of the four governments or intuitions to have a net trustworthy score, with 13% saying they ‘strongly trust’ it and and 45% saying they ‘trust’ it.
The polling was carried out as part of theThe Good Information Project, which has been examining Ireland-China relations and the Far East nation’s growing global influence.
It found that the Chinese government was the least trusted of the four institutions asked about, with just 1% of Irish people saying they trusted it and 84% saying they did not.
Whiledistrusting the governance of the Far Easternpowerhouse is perhaps not of utmost importance to many Irish people, that such distrust exists between Ireland and its nearest neighbour is perhaps a greater concern.
Overall, 1% of people say the ‘strongly trust’ the British government with 11% expressing ‘trust’.

The poll does not track the relative trust over time but it’s not great a leap to say trust is at a comparative lull in recent history.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneystated back in Marchthat EU member states negotiating with the UK were “negotiating with a partner they simply can’t trust”.
At the time, Coveney was referencing the UK’s decision to unilaterally extend a grace period relating to the Northern Ireland protocol. A move theEU has said “breaks international law”.
Late last year, the UK government itself admitted that it proposed breaking international law “in a limited and specific way” as part of its efforts tocircumvent the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
Speaking to The Journal, Paul Gillespie of the UCD Institute for British-Irish Studies said the ‘hard Brexit’ path chosen by successive British governments almost has a built-in antagonism that sows distrust.
He points to the recent negotiations around a proposed UK-Australia trade deal that farmers all across the UK have expressed concerns about. UK domestic farmers say the zero-quota deal being pushed by Canberra would see them undercut by Australian rivals.
Gillespie says the UK government seems intent on ploughing ahead despite the opposition as a way of ‘justifying’ its Brexit path.
“They need to be able to justify their hard Brexit by doing the kind of trade deals that they said they could achieve,” he says.

Last week, the IIEA hosted a discussion on UK-Ireland relations between former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former UK prime minister Tony Blair.
During the discussion, both men spoke about how trust was built up between all sides ahead of the Belfast Agreement, with Blair arguing that the UK Cabinet must be centrally involved in maintaining the agreement instead of leaving the task to its Secretary of State.

Gillespie argues that both governments have been neglectful in not ensuring commitment to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
It was confirmed earlier this month that the body would meet in June, the first such meeting in two years.
“It’s supposed to be dealing with issues that aren’t devolved. That would include, in principle at least, a lot of the protocol stuff and EU stuff arising from it,” Gillespie says.
“They’ve managed to do that and agreed to hold one in June and I think several next year which is quite an achievement. The extent to which will actually compensate for the uncertainty and ambiguity of the British government’s policy position remains to be seen,” he adds.

https://www.thejournal.ie/remainers-not-hijacking-eurovision-6065530-May2023/,"PRO-EUROPEAN UNION campaigners have rejected claims from British news outlets the Daily Mail and Express that they are “hijacking” the Eurovision Song Contest.
Members from the Liverpool for Europe group plan to hand out 75,000 EU flags to audience members at this week’s Eurovision in Liverpool.
In its report, theDaily Mailsaid the campaigners plan to “hijack” the song contest by handing out the EU flags. TheExpressechoed the Daily Mail’s report, also claiming the group plans to “hijack” the competition.
The Eurovision is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) – an umbrella organisation for public broadcasters across the wider European area. While the EBU operates across the continent, it is not linked to the EU, and the 2016 Brexit vote had no impact on the UK’s participation on in the song contest.
Speaking toThe Journalin Liverpool, Peter Benson from Liverpool for Europe explained that the campaigners are “trying to highlight the impact [of Brexit] on musicians”.
“The broader issue is the lack of freedom of movement, which affects me personally. I’ve got two young daughters, 19 and 22, whose future careers will be blighted as a result of Brexit,” Benson said.
“It’s doing a lot of damage to the UK and more damage than people realise. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine has probably hidden a lot of that. But it’s now becoming more apparent that Brexit has done an enormous amount of damage to the UK economy,” he said.
“But one of the industries that is probably most heavily impacted is the culture and the music industry, who’ve been really, really, really badly affected by Brexit,” Benson added.

He noted the case of German punk band Trigger Cut, who wererefused entry to the UKfor their British tour last month.
Benson claimed UK musicians have also been stopped travelling around Europe.
“An Irish musician can travel right around Europe but a UK musician cannot,” he said.
“There’s so much red tape, it’s just not feasible,” he said.
When asked about the response from members of the public at the Eurovision this week to their campaign, Benson said they have been “absolutely stunned” by the response from by locals and international visitors.
“They’re literally grabbing the flags and the stickers off us,” he said.
“We’ve had a policeman who’s got a sticker on his shoulder, which I thought was very funny. We had someone who was waving from a shop window and they came down and they took a flag off us and it’s not up on one of the windows,” the campaigner added.
“We have had a phenomenal reception and we think the 75,000 flags that we have with us will be snapped up before Saturday.”
This year’s Eurovision final is being hosted by the UK in Liverpool on behalf of last year’s winner Ukraine.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/ceta-trade-deal-ireland-5349492-Feb2021/,"IF I STARTED this article by telling you I wanted to talk about a complicated international trade deal, I might struggle to hold your attention.
But if I wrote that I want to discuss an issue of national importance, which may affect how we organise our public services and make our laws, you might be more interested.
This is precisely the contradiction we face in relation to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, better known as CETA.
Trade deals, by their nature, do not generally become the focus of national debate and everyday political attention. Framed as complicated issues of little interest to the general public, issues like CETA often escape political scrutiny.
To its credit,The Journal.iedid cover CETA in December when the Government attempted to effectively ram ratification of the deal through the Dáil.
They scheduled just 45 minutes of debate, followed by a vote, allowing for a level of scrutiny and debate far less than what is needed on such an important issue.
Why say ‘no’ to CETA?
The Social Democrats, like many others, have issues with CETA. We are particularly concerned about the clauses that create a special Investor Court, a mechanism which (under other trade deals) has led togovernments around the world being sued by private corporationsfor taking decisions in the public interest.
The majority of such cases around the world have related to environmental regulations, with mining firms suing governments for sums amounting to billions of dollars.
We are aware that others take a different view. IBEC and Canadian Chamber of Commerce, among others, have indicated that they strongly favour Ireland’s ratification of the deal. The Tánaiste, Leo Varadkar, also made a strong case for the deal in response to a parliamentary question in December.
Advertisement
There is a range of ways to do this. Dáil committees could be given a role. Expert witnesses could be invited in. Government ministers could be questioned on areas of CETA which potentially impact their portfolios.
There are a number of possibilities, but our position is clear: it should not be left to the media and social media to scrutinise CETA; this must be done in our national parliament.
Investor Courts System
In particular, the implications of the Investor Courts System (ICS) need to be teased out.  Because the trade aspects of the deal are already in place since 2017, Dáil ratification of CETA by the Oireachtas is effectively the only ratification of the ICS.
As I have pointed out, this ICS creates a new judicial forum for corporations to potentially challenge national governments for creating policies that might negatively affect profitability. This is worrying, to say the least, and the potential implications require full scrutiny.
We are told that CETA will come before the Dáil again when normal scheduling resumes (the Dáil is currently sitting on a restricted basis). Rather than presenting a fait accompli, the Government should instead allocate the time necessary for opponents of ratification, including the Social Democrats, to present their arguments.
For us, there are fundamental issues about ratification, not just around the ICS but also about the implications for Irish agriculture and labour rights, as well as other areas.
It should also be noted that there is a case related to CETA before the German Constitutional Court, the outcome of which may fundamentally change the nature of the debate.
There is potentially a lot at stake. The Dáil needs to step up and do its job by conducting a proper and thorough debate on ratifying this deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-serious-harm-brexit-5413567-Apr2021/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS warned “very serious harm” can come if people keep trying to use Brexit as an issue to create dispute.
Micheal Martin said it had become clear in recent weeks what can happen “when sectarian tensions are left to grow and are then encouraged by political events”.
The Fianna Fail leader made the comments at his party’s annual 1916 commemoration at Arbour Hill Cemetery in Dublin.
Mr Martin said: “The terrible scenes on the streets of Belfast have deep roots which we must challenge – and it falls to all of us to play a constructive and moderating role.
“We understand that Brexit is one of the factors in this situation.”

Mr Martin described the Northern Ireland Protocol as “a fair conclusion to attempts to limit the potential destructiveness of Brexit on this island”.
“It is complex, but it is nowhere near as complex as it is presented,” he said.
“It is not as complex as the thousands of Brexit issues remaining in relation to trade and other contacts between Great Britain and the European Union. Rules and connections developed over half a century don’t come apart easily.
“With good faith and co-operation, disruption can be limited and we can resolve outstanding issues.”
He added: “It is important to say that very serious harm can come if we keep seeing people trying to use Brexit as an issue to create points of dispute or by presenting every single issue as a zero-sum, win-lose fight.
“When this approach is followed in relation to UK-EU relations the damage it causes is primarily economic.
“When it involves misrepresenting the arrangements for Northern Ireland the damage can go much further.”","3.31pm, 18 Apr 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-dutch-5553464-Sep2021/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said that the post-Brexit issues with Northern Ireland “can’t go on forever” as ministers consider the prospect of tearing up parts of an agreement with the EU.
He said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had come to the UK last week to “see if he could mediate on the issue”.
“We seek a solution, but it has to be one that allows the free movement of goods between all parts of our country,” Johnson said.
Speaking to reporters travelling with him to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Johnson insisted the UK is not “trying to stoke” the problems ahead of a meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House tomorrow.

Biden has repeatedly warned the UK Government not to damage the peace process amid continuing issues over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods.
But the UK wants to rewrite it because it says it has created trade barriers for goods crossing the Irish Sea from Britain.
Brussels has rejected the calls, leading to a stand-off where post-Brexit grace periods on goods have repeatedly been extended in order to prevent further shortages.
Brexit minister David Frost has argued that the threshold of triggering Article 16 of the protocol, which would effectively tear up parts of the deal he negotiated, has been met.
Johnson was asked if he could make the move in the days after meeting the US president.

“I hope everybody knows this isn’t something that the UK Government is trying to stoke up for our own political purposes,” he told reporters.
“On the contrary, we want to fix this, we want common sense. We want no barriers in the UK for trading in our country and it’s crazy at the moment that we’ve got the protocol being enforced or being used in the way that it is.
“I don’t believe it’s sensible, 20% of all checks in the whole of the perimeter of the EU are now done in Northern Ireland. So we do need to sort it out, we need to sort it out fast.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/business-leaders-northern-ireland-protocol-richie-neal-5775735-May2022/,"BUSINESS LEADERS IN the North have told a bipartisan US delegation the UK Government and the EU will both have to compromise to sort out difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The US group, led by Congressman Richard Neal, met a number of business organisations in the final engagement in their fact-finding trip to the island of Ireland to discuss issues around the post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Northern Ireland is without a functioning devolved executive after the DUP refused to support the re-establishment of powersharing at Stormont as part of their protest against the Protocol.
Unionists oppose the arrangements which have created barriers on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss recently announced an intention to introduce legislation to override some elements of the Protocol, but has stated that her preferred outcome is a negotiated agreement with the EU.
Business leaders told members of the influential House of Representatives’ Committee on Ways and Means today that the UK and EU should sit down in a room together with representatives from Northern Ireland to resolve the current trading difficulties.
The meeting with the US delegation included representatives from Logistics UK, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, the CBI, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, Manufacturing NI, the NI Meat Exporters Association, the Institute of Directors and retail groups.

Speaking afterward, Seamus Leheny, policy manager at Logistics UK, said: “We basically told them that the UK and the EU both have to move on this. It is a negotiation.
“Full implementation of the Protocol isn’t practical, it won’t work.
“We are working on a basis of partial Protocol implementation at the moment. That has proven problematical for some supply chains.
“It was made clear to them some areas where the Protocol is good, where it is beneficial. For our manufacturers and exporters, things are very good.
“But for the retail goods coming into Northern Ireland, that is where the difficulties lie.”
Leheny added: “It is going to take some negotiations. There have been good ideas put forward by both the UK and the EU of how to get there.
“We made it very clear to the Americans that we value their engagement, their influence and their mediation in this in seeking compromise and agreement.
“They have a genuine interest and a very good understanding. Normally for one of their committees to go and spend five days in a country, in Ireland north and south, it is unheard of. We are very lucky to get this amount of airtime.
“We made it very clear they are welcome and that their assistance in sorting out the protocol is welcome.”

He added: “They heard about the pros and cons of the protocol and it really just comes down to getting people in a room.
“As Congressman Neal said, what the US did with the Good Friday Agreement, getting people into a room and negotiating, that is what it is going to take.
“There is going to have to be compromise and ultimately getting to that agreement to make it work because what is the alternative?”
“We need the UK, the EU in the room with people from Northern Ireland to talk through what needs to happen.
“What is happening is that they are talking over each other a lot of the time. We are going round in circles.”
The US delegation has now left Northern Ireland. Earlier this week Neal faced intense unionist criticism for describing the protocol dispute as a “manufactured issue”.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson heavily criticised Neal after meeting him at Stormont, describing the delegation’s fact-finding mission as the “most undiplomatic visit” he had ever seen to Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-could-suspend-5744765-Apr2022/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Apr 2022
UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said the UK is ready to take measures if necessary to “fix” the deal with the EU governing post-Brexit trading arrangements with Northern Ireland.
Johnson claimed the Northern Ireland Protocol “does not command the confidence of a large part” of the population in the province.
His comments come after a Government minister issued a fresh warning that the UK could unilaterally suspend elements of Northern Ireland Protocol.
Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns refused to be drawn on a report by the Financial Times that ministers are preparing legislation giving them sweeping powers to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement.
“The protocol really does not command the confidence of a large, large component of the population in Northern Ireland. We have to address that, we have to fix that,” Johnson told a press conference in New Delhi.
“We think we can do it with some very simple and reasonable steps.
“We have talked repeatedly to our friends and partners in the EU. We will continue to talk to them.
“But as I have said many times now we don’t rule out taking steps now if those are necessary.”
The move by the British Government, which is likely to inspire anger among EU leaders, comes less than two weeks before the Northern Ireland Assembly election on May 5.
Unionist parties in the region have consistently declared their opposition to the protocol, which they argue cuts off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
Burns said it is clear the arrangements are not working in the way that was intended and the Government already has powers under Article 16 of the protocol allowing it to suspend elements of it.
He told LBC radio: “As far back as last July the Prime Minister said that we believed that the threshold for triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol had been reached.
“There is significant societal disruption in Northern Ireland due to the way that the protocol is being implemented.

“I hope Brussels are listening to this conversation and other conversations.
“I hope they will come back to the table constructively to allow us to change the protocol to make it work in the way it was intended.
“If they don’t hear that, then the Government reserves the right, as we have always said, as laid down in the protocol, to take remedial action.”
The UK Government has so far resisted calls from unionists and loyalists in Northern Ireland to trigger Article 16.
SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, said that the plans to abandon elements of the protocol are part of efforts to shore up Johnson’s position within the Conservatives as partygate rumbles on.
“Reports that the British Government is preparing to introduce new legislation that would unilaterally dump elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol demonstrate clearly that this government simply cannot be trusted,” said Eastwood.
“This is about shoring up his position with the hardline ERG and shoring up the DUP’s position ahead of an election. Come 5 May, Johnson will dump Jeffrey and the DUP again. They never learn.”
Labour’s Peter Kyle condemned the reported plan and questioned how Boris Johnson can negotiate a trade deal with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the same time.
The shadow Northern Ireland secretary told Sky News: “This is absolutely astonishing and incredibly damaging.
“Boris Johnson negotiated, his team drafted the Northern Ireland Protocol; they presented it to the EU, they negotiated it into the deal.
“It doesn’t work as well as it can do, that’s why the Labour policy is, you build on it – we can improve the protocol, we can smooth it, and we can do so without breaking the law and breaking our international treaty we signed with the EU.
“If we just recklessly pull out of it unilaterally, how will any other country in the world sign a deal with us and think that we will honour it?
“How will Prime Minister Modi react today when Boris Johnson asks for a trade deal if he is pulling out unilaterally of the last trade deal he signed?”

Ireland and Britain have had an intertwined history over the years. There’s – well, the obvious, but in more recent years, both joined the EU – then the European Economic Community – on the same day in 1973, both opted to stay out of the Schengen Agreement when it was implemented in 1997 in favour of a common travel area between the two, and both worked together on the Good Friday Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/another-fish-fight-uk-france-row-over-fish-5587149-Oct2021/,"ANOTHER BREXIT ROW has come to the fore – this time, between France and the UK over fishing rights in the Channel Island.
After the very public row over the Northern Irish Protocol and the role of the European Court of Justice (which is yet to be resolved), and the ‘sausage wars’ a few months previous (which is apparently sorted), we now have to contend with a bitter fish fight between France and the UK.
So what is the latest row about, and why is it so tense?
How it started: 200 French boats and Jersey island
A row broke out earlier this year, after the UK and Jersey turned down applications from dozens of small French boats requesting to fish in British waters, in what Paris said was a breach of Britain’s post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.
France had asked the UK to issue 169 fishing licences to its vessels, but they had to prove they fished in Channel Island waters before Brexit – which many small vessels struggled to find the paperwork to prove.
Since then, this issue of fishing access to waters off Jersey and neighbouring Guernsey – both British Crown dependencies off France’s northern coast (meaning they are under the foreign affairs and security policy of the United Kingdom) – has sparked a series of indignant exchanges between London and Paris post-Brexit.
In May, tensions boiled over and French trawlers briefly encircled Jersey’s main port at St Helier, leading to a standoff that saw Britain send two naval boats, shadowed by French coastal patrol vessels.

In the aftermath, one French minister threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey if a resolution could not be reached.
But at the end of September, Jersey said it would grant temporary licences to EU trawlermen, following talks with representatives from France’s Normandy region where it was decided that new licences for EU vessels would be issued the following week.
Though Jersey’s 100 small-boat fleet exports lobsters, crabs and scallops to Europe via French ports, some Jersey fishermen do want to see the volume of EU boats in their waters reduced.
But the UK government didn’t issue enough licences
Tensions rose again a few days later, after the UK government said it would grant just 12 out of 47 applications for new licences to small boats from the EU to fish in its waters, provoking anger from France.
London said it has pursued a “reasonable approach”, issuing nearly 1,700 licences to EU boats to fish in Britain’s exclusive economic zone, which is defined as being 12-200 nautical miles from the coast.

A total of 117 have been issued for the 6-12 mile zone, where EU vessels must provide evidence to the UK of a track record of fishing activity in those waters.
Of France’s 169 licence requests made to the Jersey authorities, 95 were granted, with just 65 of those full licences and the rest temporary.

France began threatening retaliation, with its Maritime Minister Annick Girardin saying:
“Our patience has clear limits,” France’s European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune said on 5 October. “We’ve negotiated calmly and nicely for nine months now, that’s enough.”
How did Brexit spark the fishing feud?
When the UK left the EU, it also left the common fisheries policy, which since 1970 has allowed members access to European waters outside the first 12 nautical miles of each country’s coastline.
The Brexit deal outlined how EU boats could continue to fish in UK waters, but British fishermen would get a greater share of fish from its own waters.
Most of the share is being transferred to the UK this year, and there will be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between now and 2025.
The post-Brexit fisheries arrangement is something that has also irked Irish fishers.
Then a British trawler was detained
The scallop vessel Cornelis was ordered to divert to the port of Le Havre after the French authorities said it was fishing in French waters without a licence.
The French said that another British trawler had been fined for obstruction after refusing to allow police to board to carry out checks.
The owner of the Cornelis, Macduff Shellfish, said the vessel had been fishing legally in French waters and called on the British Government to protect the rights of British fishermen.

French maritime minister Annick Girardin said that although the checks on the British boats were standard during the scallop fishing season, they had also been launched against “the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission”.

How has the UK Government responded?
Environment Secretary George Eustice said the French threats appeared to breach international law and warned the UK would respond in an “appropriate and calibrated” manner if they were carried out.
In an emergency Commons statement this week, Eustice said the vessel had been granted a licence by the EU but there were reports that it subsequently had been removed from the list of vessels permitted to fish in French waters for reasons that were unclear.

Downing Street said it was continuing to seek talks with the French government and the European Commission to resolve the dispute over fishing licences.
Eustice said the UK has licensed 98% of EU vessels that have applied for access post-Brexit – though the French say it’s closer to 90%, and the missing 10% is French vessels’ applications)
Eustice said more are expected to be granted following “constructive” talks with the European Commission.

What will happen now?
French officials say that since they started pressuring Britain and Jersey publicly over the last few months more licences have been issued.
France is also trying to rally the rest of the European Union to its side.
Ten out of the other 26 members of the EU signed up to a statement condemning Britain’s “incomplete and inappropriate” response on fishing.
Experts see little prospect for British-French ties to improve – with elections due in France next April, President Emmanuel Macron is keen to keep the politically powerful and vocal fishing communities on side.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-minister-david-frost-resigns-5635055-Dec2021/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Dec 2021
THE UK’S FOREIGN Secretary Liz Truss is to take over responsibility for the UK’s future relationship with the EU, Downing Street has said, following the resignation of Brexit minister David Frost.
Frost resigned with “immediate effect” on Saturday night, having previously agreed with the Prime Minister he would leave his job in January.
Citing “the current direction of travel” of the Government, as well as fears over “coercive” Covid measures and the wish for the UK to become a “lightly regulated, low-tax” economy, Frost’s departure was described as a “watershed moment” in what had been an extremely damaging week for the PM.
Downing Street said Truss would take over ministerial responsibility for the UK-EU relationship, and would lead negotiations to resolve issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Chris Heaton-Harris will move from the Department for Transport to become Europe minister and will deputise for Truss when needed.
‘The issues do not change’
Earlier, European Commissioner and Irish MEP Mairéad McGuinness said Frost’s departure was a surprise, but it doesn’t change the substance of the issues of the Protocol: “The name will change but the issues will not.”
“The concerns I will have is that Brexit was the result of divisions within the Tory party and from what I’m reading, those divisions haven’t gone away,” she told RTÉ’s This Week programme.
She said that in recent weeks there had been a shift from the UK Government on the oversight of the European Court of Justice, which Frost’s negotiating team had been aggressively pushing for during talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
David Frost, who has led negotiations with the EU, is reported to have handed in his resignation letter to Boris Johnson last week with an agreement to leave in January.
But in a letter to the PM released yesterday evening, he said that he was “disappointed that this plan has become public this evening and in the circumstances I think it is right for me to write to step down with immediate effect”.
David Frost thanked Johnson and said “Brexit is now secure”, but he said: “The challenge for the government now is to deliver on the opportunities it gives us.
Frost told Johnson he had “concerns about the current direction of travel”, with the government’s decisions on coronavirus regulations and tax rises reported to be among those issues, as well as a possible u-turn on triggering Article 16.
He also said he was sad the unlocking from Covid restrictions had not proved “irreversible” as promised, and added: “I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere.”
And he expressed his wish that the UK would become a “lightly regulated, low-tax” country.

In his reply, Johnson he was “very sorry” to have received his resignation.
Frost was appointed as Johnson’s so-called EU “sherpa” shortly after the British leader took office in July 2019, and became chief trade negotiator after helping to finalise last year’s Brexit divorce deal.
Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath told RTÉ’s This Week programme that the Irish Government isn’t expecting David Frost’s resignation to derail the progress on the Protocol that has been made over recent weeks.
“From our point of view in Ireland, our bottom lines remain unchanged: no hard border under any circumstances on the island of Ireland, protect the Good Friday Agreement at all costs, and also protect Ireland’s place at the heart of the European Single Market.”
He said that Northern Ireland had “the best of both worlds” under the Protocol, through access to markets in Great Britain and in the EU, adding: “We’re already seeing the economic dividend of that for the North, so we want those assets to be protected”.
Northern Ireland reaction
In Northern Ireland, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said David Frost’s departure was a bad sign for Johnson’s commitment to removing the Irish Sea border.
Donaldson said: “This government is distracted by internal strife, and Lord Frost was being frustrated on a number of fronts.
“We wish David well. We enjoyed a strong relationship with him and his team, but this raises more serious questions for the Prime Minister and his approach to the NI Protocol.”
David Frost had been tasked with finding a way to resolve issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, which aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The implementation of the Protocol has caused issues with customs, agrifood, trade, and medicines being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Movement was found this week on medicines, but red lines remain for both sides, including for the UK the oversight role of the European Court of Justice.David Frost said this week he expected negotiations with the EU to now run into 2022.
Stormont Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Northern Ireland would not become “collateral damage in the Tory chaos”.
She tweeted: “David Frost negotiated Brexit of which a majority here rejected. He has undermined the Protocol since, which limits the damage of Brexit on our people and economy.
“We now need momentum in the talks to make it work better.

“The North will not be collateral damage in the Tory chaos.”
And Northern Ireland’s former first minister Arlene Foster described Frost’s resignation as “enormous”.
In a tweet, she said: “The resignation of Lord Frost from the Cabinet is a big moment for the Government but enormous for those of us who believed he would deliver for NI.”
Tory party revolt
Boris Johnson is already reeling from a rebellion by 100 of his MPs in a parliamentary vote over coronavirus measures and the loss of a 23,000-majority seat in a by-election – as well as continued allegations over parties in Whitehall during lockdown restrictions..
Prominent Brexiteer Tory Andrew Bridgen told Times Radio that Frost’s departure was a “devastating blow for the Government and the Prime Minister” and suggested that many Conservative colleagues would be considering the PM’s future over Christmas.
In a tweet, he added Johnson was “running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative government”.
He said: “Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire.”
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: “This shock resignation is a sign of the chaos and confusion at the heart of this Conservative government.
“The rats are fleeing Boris Johnson’s sinking ship as he lurches from crisis to crisis.
“Even the Prime Minister’s once-loyal supporters are now abandoning him, just as lifelong Conservative voters are switching in their droves to the Liberal Democrats.
“At a time we need strong leadership to get us through the pandemic, we instead have a weak Prime Minister who has lost the support of his allies and the trust of the British people.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/dup-brexit-5361853-Feb2021/,"OVER THE WEEKEND we learned that several prominent DUP politicians will join a legal action against the Northern Ireland protocol of the EU-UK Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
This move is to compliment the political campaign already underway, a campaign that bluntly seeks to remove the protocol from the Agreement.
It must be said, again, that no tangible or workable solutions have been presented to replace this. We have seen recent attempts to rehash the already dismissed Alternative Arrangements, but these are not solutions.

An ill-judged challenge
A lot of work was done over several years on the impacts of Brexit on the island of Ireland, it’s not even two months since the protocol came into effect, there is no magic alternative.
One of the big concerns for the Irish Government through the original Brexit Referendum campaign was that little attention was given in England to the impact Brexit could have on the situation in Ireland. These concerns were either ignored or dismissed by the Leave campaign.
Alongside DUP politicians, the other parties to this case include former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib, Labour peer Kate Hoey, and Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. These three individuals are a collection of some of the hardest Brexiteers that have been prominent over recent years.
Mr Habib has repeatedlymade wild assertionsabout the situation in Ireland while Antrim-born Barroness Hoey has said the Good Friday Agreement is not a sustainable solution. An extreme Loyalist, Mr Allister has consistently been a vehement opponent of the Good Friday Agreement.
Not the time for posturing
There will be few with sympathy for the argument that the protocol, which prevents a hard border in Ireland and guarantees dual market access for local businesses, breaches the Good Friday Agreement, particularly when nearly all those bringing this challenge opposed the Agreement originally.
Related ReadsTaoiseach says there are 'benefits and opportunities' to NI Protocol as unionists launch legal action against itNI Protocol ‘only way to protect the Good Friday Agreement’, EU official saysSome port workers return to Brexit inspection duties in NI
The DUP’s stance on the protocol is disappointing if not surprising, the party were enthusiastic supporters of Brexit and indeed had the opportunity to shape the negotiations and solutions when they held the balance of power in Westminster from 2017 to 2019.
This type of politics is no good for anyone in my opinion. We all have an obligation to dial it down, to come together to discuss these questions. As public representatives, we must put politics aside and deal with the issues within an economic, social, and practical context.
Unionists in Northern Ireland have many legitimate concerns that should not be dismissed, however, none of these concerns will be sated by a pointless legal action destined to fail.

https://www.thejournal.ie/retrofitting-ireland-6026987-Mar2023/,"
THE GOVERNMENT IS to transfer €150 million of EU funding from the Brexit fund – aimed at sectors including agri-food and fisheries – to the Covid Recovery Fund, where a sizeable chunk will be put towards retrofitting, according to the Taoiseach.
Speaking in the Dáil this week, Leo Varadkar said that the Government “would have liked” to spend the money from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) Fund on businesses and the “agricultural sector”, but that it has come up against a range of obstacles in doing so.
The amount being transferred represents 20% of the €1.165 billion Ireland secured from the EU to help businesses, local communities, the agri-food sector and fisheries cope with the impact of Brexit.
The EU Covid Recovery and Resilience Fund (CRRF) was set up to help EU countries recover economically from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The CRRF is unique in that the payment to countries is conditional on them fulfilling pledged reforms and milestones that will make their economy more resilient.
Ireland’s plan is worth just under €1 billion, and its pledged reforms centre on green transition, digital reform and job creation.
Retrofitting already features in a range of the pledges Ireland has made, including working out the financial framework for a low cost residential retrofit loan scheme, and the commencement of retrofit works on public buildings.

A spokesperson for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) said that the Government has opted to transfer a portion of the BAR funds to Ireland’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), with the intention of spending it on initiatives that will fall into line with the EU’s plan to reduce the dependence of member states on Russian fossil fuel imports.

The spokesperson explained that the reason why the funds are being transferred is down to concerns that the money will not be spent on time, as it had to be spent between 2020 and the end of 2023, and also because of “the UK Government deciding not to impose custom checks on EU imports until the end of this year”.
Therefore, they said, the transfer of €150 million from one fund to another has been done with the intention of “mitigating the risk that Ireland would not be able to fully spend its BAR allocations within the eligibility period”.
They added that “at the same time”, this allowed “for additional new measures to be funded by the EU in the period up to 2026 that are well aligned with Government objectives to invest in energy efficiency and reduce dependence on foreign fossil fuel”.
Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on Agriculture Matt Carthy said that there will be “understandable anger” amongst small farmers and those in the agri-food sector that a large portion of the BAR fund money is being transferred, to be spent on other initiatives.
“I was in the European Parliament when we campaigned to get the lion’s share of this BAR funding, and we used the stories of farmers, fisheries, and local businesses to secure it.
“It is hugely disappointing that this Government has decided to now transfer  €150 million of that money out of the fund, without coming up with a strategy to use it to help the farmers, and communities that it was meant to help.
“If the political will was there to see this money directed towards the agricultural sector I have no doubt that it could be. With a bit of thought and creativity it would not have been that difficult.
Carthy added: “It is typical of this Government that they managed to find a way to give a €100 million of the Brexit funding to meat factories and other processors, but they have not even tried to direct this money towards farmers who are struggling.”
Independent TD Richard O’Donoghue asked the Taoiseachin the Dáil this weekwhy the funding was being transferred, when it was supposed to be spent in support of “Ireland’s economy” in order to “mitigate the impact of Brexit”.
Leo Varadkar said that the Government “would have liked” to spend a lot of the BAR funding on helping businesses and the “agricultural sector”, but that to do that it would have to “demonstrate that those businesses have lost their profits, and gone into the red solely as a consequence of Brexit”.
TD Richard O'Donoghue questioning the Taoiseach on EU funding allocation on WednesdayOireachtas TVOireachtas TV
Varadkar added that this is a difficult feat considering the “increased trade that’s occurred between Britain and Ireland”. He said that a lot of the BAR funding has been spent on upgrading port facilities, and on the fishing industry.

In response to O’Donoghue, Varadkar said that the Government has opted to transfer the money into the European recovery fund:
“That will be of benefit to the construction industry because it is the same people that carry out a lot of that work”.
Ireland was the biggest beneficiary of the BAR funding in the EU, but one of the smallest beneficiaries of the EU recovery fund.
It is not yet clear what other initiatives the €150m being transferred from one fund to the other will be spent on yet.
A DPER spokesperson said that the Department is considering a range of potential investment and reform proposals with the Departments of Environment, Climate and Communications, Finance and Taoiseach’s, which will be “subject to negotiations with the European Commission”.
Analysis byNoteworthy, in collaboration with journalists around Europe, found that many states, Ireland included,have repackaged old promisesas part of their pledged recovery reforms.
Ireland’s carbon tax promise is an example of this. The government committed to raising its carbon tax by €7.50 annually, which was already a longstanding government commitment with cross-party support.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-partygate-5669005-Jan2022/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS set out plans to capitalise on Brexit and is expected to move forward with the levelling up agenda this week as he awaits the findings of the highly anticipated “partygate” report.
Two years to the day since the UK left the EU, the British Government has launched a new “Brexit Freedoms” Bill as part of a drive it claims will “cut £1 billion of red tape” for businesses.
The long awaited Levelling Up White Paper is also expected to be published this week – although a policy trailed over the weekend was heavily criticised by the opposition.
The announcements will be seen as an attempt by Johnson to steer the narrative away from toxic “partygate” allegations that have dominated the news agenda in recent weeks.
But Downing Street was in hot water again last night as a senior official who worked in there during the pandemic lashed out at the Government over the scandal.
Writing in The Times, Nikki da Costa, who was formerly Johnson’s director of legislative affairs, claimed that Number 10 seemed to have “failed as a collective” to “live by the spirit and the letter of the rules” it was setting.
Questions have been looming over the future of the British prime Minister’s premiership as he awaits the findings of Whitehall and police inquiries into claims of lockdown-busting gatherings held in Downing Street.
Downing Street had still not received a copy of the highly anticipated Sue Gray report on Sunday evening.
The PA news agency understands that is it due to be delivered in a matter of days.
It was also reported on Sunday that the Government is expected to announce a U-turn on mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS and social care staff.
Facing Pressure
Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been facing pressure to scrap the requirement for health workers in England to be vaccinated by April amid fears it will lead to a major staffing crisis.
Trade minister Penny Mordaunt tweeted in response to the reports in The Telegraph: “This looks promising… Hope a sensible way through can be found for both health and social care.”
And Conservative former minister Steve Baker said: “What a relief. The right decision.”
In a taster of the policies to come in its Levelling Up White Paper, the British Government announced new plans at the weekend to “breathe fresh life into disadvantaged communities” across England.
The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said 20 chosen locations will be prioritised for a £1.5 billion Brownfield Fund made available from April 2022.
But pressed on where the money was coming from, the DLUHC clarified to the PA news agency that the cash to fund the work was allocated by the Treasury last year.

Labour’s shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy described the regeneration funding as “very small beer”.
Tensions
Meanwhile, tensions remain high between Russia and Ukraine, with Johnson expected to speak to President Vladimir Putin and travel to the troubled region early this week.
It emerged at the weekend that Johnson is looking at doubling the number of troops deployed to strengthen Europe’s borders.
Downing Street said it could send defensive weapons to Estonia while fast jets, warships and military specialists may be sent to protect Nato allies.
But Liz Truss, the British Foreign Secretary, said on Sunday that a situation in which British soldiers would fight alongside Ukrainians against Russia was “very unlikely”.
The Brexit Freedoms Bill announced today will affect the handling of retained EU law – Brussels-made regulations which were preserved in the UK statute book for legal continuity after the transition period ended in 2020.
The British Government has previously made clear that it intends to eventually amend, replace or repeal all of the retained law that it deems “not right for the UK”.
But Downing Street said that under current rules, changing or scrapping regulations in the pipeline of outdated legislation would take “several years” because of a long-winded alteration process.
It said the new Bill will “ensure that changes can be made more easily”, so the UK can “capitalise on Brexit freedoms more quickly”.
No 10 did not specify exactly what provisions the Bill will contain to speed up reforms, or how it calculated that businesses would save £1 billion through the cutting of red tape.
It comes after Truss insisted the British Government is “committed to cutting taxes” as the Prime Minister and Chancellor made the bold move of doubling down on plans to raise National Insurance.
‘Paid Back’
Truss said “taxes are never popular”, but significant amounts of money spent dealing with the Covid crisis “need to be paid back”.
She stood by the British Prime Minister yesterday, telling the BBC that he is “absolutely” the best person to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election.
Asked if she is tempted by the top job, she said: “There is no contest. There is no discussion.”
On Saturday, Tom Tugendhat, a backbench Tory MP who has been critical of the Government’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, became the first to announce that he intends to stand for leader if there is a contest soon.
The Independent later reported that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was putting the final touches to a leadership bid after telling allies he believed the scandal over alleged parties in Downing Street and Whitehall could be “unsurvivable” for the PM.
But the newspaper cited a source close to Sunak as saying these claims were “totally false”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-did-the-mahon-tribunal-find-about-bertie-ahern-5990783-Feb2023/,"FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has rejoined Fianna Fáil more than a decade after he resigned from the party.
The former leader is now back in the fold just ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
A spokesperson for Fianna Fáil yesterday said: “We received a membership application and it was accepted by the party.”
It is understood Ahern has rejoined the party as an ordinary member in Dublin Central. Members are considered provisional during their first year anddo not have voting rights.
Ahern resigned from Fianna Fáil in 2012 after the Mahon Tribunal published its final report. He stepped down as Taoiseach in 2008 and as a TD in 2011. He made the move before leader Micheál Martin sought to expel him from the party.
The tribunal (officially called the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments) found that Ahern did not truthfully accountfor payments of IR£165,000made to accounts connected to him.
The report did not make findings of corruption against Ahern, but proved hugely damaging to his reputation. Herejected its findingsand always denied doing anything illegal.
In September 2022, Martin indicated he would be open to allowing Ahern back into Fianna Fáil, noting that he had been consulting with his predecessor about Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Several Fianna Fáil TDs have welcomed the news, but many members of the opposition have criticised Ahern’s return and the message it sends amid ongoing debates about ethics andstandards in public office.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar appears to have softened his stance on Ahern – who he once compared to John Gilligan. In 2008, Varadkar compared Ahern to the convicted drug dealer over his disclosures to the Mahon Tribunal.
“A former Taoiseach has gone to the tribunal and essentially given the John Gilligan defence — that he won the money on the horses,” Varadkar said, speaking in the Dáil at the time.
“This is a defence for drug dealers and pimps and not the kind of thing that should be tolerated from a former Taoiseach and Member of this House.”
However, when asked about his commentsin Brussels this morning, Varadkar said that those comments were made at a certain point in time.
“I think that was at a particular point in time and if you look at the totality of Bertie Ahern’s career, you know, let’s not forget that he was one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement and that’s something that we’re going to recognise in a few months time,” he said.
“I don’t think anyone can diminish the role that he played. But, you know, who’s a member of Fianna Fáil is a matter for Fianna Fáil, it’s not my business,” Varadkar added.
Ahern’s return to Fianna Fáil will ramp-up speculation that he will seek the party’s nomination for the Irish presidency in 2025.
However, when asked about such a scenario in Washington yesterday, theIrish Times reportsthat Martin said: “Nothing like that has been discussed. That is just speculation. He just wanted to re-join his local cumann and it is as basic as that.”
When asked about a future presidential bid last October, Ahern replied: “When is that election anyway? 2025. Jesus, that’s a long way away. Number one, I have to stay alive and then ask me again.”

Speaking on thePat Kenny Show on Newstalktoday, Michael O’Regan, former parliamentary correspondent with The Irish Times, said Ahern’s return to the party has been expected for several months now.
However, O’Regan doesn’t think a presidential bid is in the works.
“It won’t happen, under any circumstances. Were it to happen, all the controversy surrounding Mr Ahern in the past would surface.”
So, what exactly was the controversy? What did the Mahon Tribunal find and what has happened since then?
The Mahon Tribunal was set up by Dáil Eireann in 1997 to investigate allegations of corrupt payments to politicians over planning decisions.

Initially, it began investigating claims of payments to Fianna Fáil Minister Ray Burke. Although Burke denied the allegations, he resigned from Cabinet and the Dáil.
Following on from hearings into this and other planning matters, the Tribunal began to look into claims made about Ahern.
Allegations began to surface midway through the 2000s that Ahern had received payments from developer Owen O’Callaghan.
The then-Taoiseach was interviewed about the topic by Bryan Dobson on RTÉ News in 2006.
RTENewsNow/ YouTube
Ahern rejected all the claims made against him – namely corruption, accepting bribes and wrongfully accepting money.
He claimed that a group of personal friends had raised thousands of pounds for him while he was going through a divorce in 1993.
“I’ve broken absolutely no codes, ethical, tax, legal or otherwise,” he said.
Ahern gave evidence at the Mahon Tribunal over the course of 15 days in September 2007. He persisted that he never “took a bribe or a backhander or anything from anybody”.
He was asked about not having a bank account for a number of years including when he served as Minister for Finance, and said there was “nothing in the law or the constitution” that he had to have one.
The then-Taoiseach did describe receiving a sum of money from a number of rich businessmen after speaking at a Manchester hotel, and also winning money through gambling on horses.
At all times, he maintained he had never done anything wrong. However, amid mounting pressure, he stepped down as Taoiseach in 2008 and as a TD in 2011.
In its final report in March 2012, the Mahon Tribunal rejected much of Ahern’s evidence.
While it accepted his claim that he didn’t have a bank account for years between 1987 and 1993, it rejected his assertion that he had built up around £54,000 in savings by the time.
In all, the Tribunal said that he didnot truthfully account for payments of £165,000made to accounts connected to him.
Separately, based on evidence from broadcaster Eamon Dunphy, the Tribunal said it was satisfied that developer Owen O’Callaghan had inferred to Dunphy that Ahern had received payments to ensure certain tax statuses for two major shopping centre developments.
It found that O’Callaghan had indicated that he generally found it necessary to engage in corruption in order to develop property in Dublin, and implied he had “taken care” of Ahern and given an inducement of some sort in return for a favour.
The Tribunal said this corroborated evidence from another developer, Tom Gilmartin, that O’Callaghan had personally implied the use of corrupt payments, including to Ahern.
However, the Tribunal did not label Ahern as “corrupt”.
In a statement following its publication, the former Taoiseach said that the Tribunal “has not made – nor could it make – a finding to support the scurrilous and untrue allegation” that he had received a corrupt payment from O’Callaghan.
Despite this, Ahern resigned from the Fianna Fáil party soon after the report came out.
Ahern was instrumental in peace process negotiations in Northern Ireland that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement being signed on 10 April 1998.
Amid speculation that US President Joe Biden and other notable politicians are set to visit Ireland in April to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark agreement, many people expected Ahern to rejoin Fianna Fáil in advance of attending commemorative events.
Ahern’s role in helping secure the GFA was somewhat overshadowed in the following years by controversy over his finances.
In 2018, Ahernwalked out of a German TV interviewafter being asked about the Mahon Tribunal.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the former Taoiseach became uncomfortable when presenter Tim Sebastian asked him about the tribunal.

The interview, on the Conflict Zone programme, first discussed the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and Ahern’s role in negotiations, before it turned to questions about the tribunal.
In the interview, Sebastian asked him: “Did you clear your name?” To which Ahern replied: “Yes, I did. I’m quite happy I cleared my name.”
When Sebastian noted that the tribunal “never reversed its decision” and said Ahern “wasn’t truthful”, the former Taoiseach said: “The tribunal gave its views … and I gave my evidence. I was very happy with my evidence.”
As Sebastian pressed him, Ahern said: “I’ve dealt with that issue and I am not saying any more about that issue.”
Ahern was largely absent from political life for some time but in recent years has reemerged is some likely, and unlikely, roles.
In 2019, he served as the Chairman of the Bougainville Referendum Commission – helping to oversee a referendum in which the region voted forindependence from Papua New Guinea.
Ahern has also positioned himself as a commentator on Brexit and related issues.
Just last month Ahern, when giving evidence to theNorthern Ireland Committee at Westminsteraround the workings of the Good Friday Agreement, he said that dealing with concerns around the Northern Ireland Protocol “isn’t rocket science” and a solution must be found.
Ahern said the current stalemate which has plunged the Stormont Assembly into flux is “beyond comprehension”. He emphasised that, with a bit of flexibility, it can be resolved.
“I really, really believe that this isn’t rocket science,” he said.
He said yet now “we can’t find a way of working out how sausages and rashers” can move between Britain and Northern Ireland.
“It’s beyond comprehension, there has to be a solution that is unique to Northern Ireland,” he said.

Speaking in September 2022, Micheál Martin said that he had been engaging with the former Taoiseach in recent times, particularly about issues related to the Protocol.
He said: “In terms of Bertie Ahern, I have been engaging with Bertie Ahern actually over the last year and a bit, since the rows on the Protocol, and he’s very involved in Northern Ireland issues, he maintains contacts with different groups.
“From my perspective, that level of consultation will continue because I think he has invaluable insights to all of that.”
Martin said that his former colleague has experience with a range of groups in Northern Ireland.
“He has reached out to communities in the north and is sort of picking up perspectives in different communities and that’s been valuable in terms of engaging and discussions on that,” the Fianna Fáil leader added.
“No one can take from the contribution he made to peace in Ireland and to the peace process, so the fullness of time certainly we will give him that consideration. It’s very relaxed when we meet.”
When reminded that he sought to expel his predecessor from the party, Martin said that he resigned in the wake of the tribunal.
“As far as I am concerned, it’s 10 years on, I’m conscious of the contribution he has made to peace in the country. He made a very significant contribution,” Martin added.

THE EU’S FORMER negotiator has said the bloc “must not and will not back down” on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Michel Barnier said that Brexit was “a unilateral decision by one party with negative impacts for itself, first of all, and for the 27 other member states”.
“Since 2016, the EU has worked to look for technical solutions to the problem created by Brexit,” Barnier said during a speech at Iveagh House in Dublin today.
He said that he worked with “objectivity, without any kind of ideology, just to find rational solutions to the problem created by Brexit, and only by Brexit”.
He said that despite “dogmatism from the consecutive British governments”, an agreement, which includes the Northern Ireland Protocol, was reached.
“The European Union must not and will not back down on the protocol of Ireland and Northern Ireland. We must ask that it be respected by the British government. This is international law.”
The Northern Ireland Protocol, signed by former prime minister Boris Johnson’s government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.
Devolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.
The UK government has introduced legislation which effectively tears up parts of the agreement, sparking a row with the EU.
Barnier also today described Brexit as a “blow” to the European Union, adding it had happened in part due to populism.
“Brexit has been and still is a challenge for Ireland, a challenge for Europe, a blow to the European Union project itself,” he said.
“Brexit is in great part the result of populism. We must be aware that this poison might still arm Europe again.
“But populism must not be mistaken with public opinion or public sentiment.”
‘Serious dialogue’
Earlier today, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said there is now a willingness in the British Government to have a “serious dialogue” about solving problems caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Speaking following a meeting with new Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris at Hillsborough Castle, Co Down, Coveney said the messages coming from London were “quite different” from those of recent months.
Heaton-Harris said that he preferred a negotiated settlement with the EU over the post-Brexit arrangement, but added that the Government would continue with its legislation to override parts of the treaty.
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic is due to have a conversation with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly later this week on the issue.

But ahead of that, Coveney said his meeting with Heaton-Harris had focused on rebuilding partnerships, stating the aftermath of Brexit had brought “unnecessary tension”.

Speaking about the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said: “We know what the obstacles are, they have been there for too long.
“There are new people effectively in the relationships now.
“It is not a coincidence that the new Prime Minister (Liz Truss) has met President (Ursula) Von Der Lyon, President (Joe) Biden, the Taoiseach (Micheal Martin).
“The conversations, from my understanding, have been positive in terms of trying to find a sensible way forward.
“From an EU perspective, they don’t want this issue to drag on.
“The last thing the EU wants to be doing is taking the British Government to court.”
He added: “What the UK and EU have in common far outweighs what divides us.
“The aftermath of Brexit and the protocol issue has been a source of unnecessary tension that we need to move beyond.
“That puts the onus on us, what does that look like in terms of practical compromise?
“We see the messages coming from London now as quite different from the messages we were getting some months ago.
“We do believe there is a willingness now for an honest and open, serious dialogue about trying to put these issues to rest.
Heaton-Harris said that the Government’s protocol bill was continuing its passage through parliament.
He said: “We want to negotiate a settlement here.
“We want to negotiate with our European partners to find the solutions here.
“But the bill will still go through its processes if that doesn’t work.”
The two ministers said they had also discussed how to restore the Stormont powersharing institutions and controversial government legislation on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
Heaton-Harris said: “Our joint top priority is doing everything we can to ensure an executive is re-established before an election has to be called.”","2.58pm, 28 Sep 2022",28 Sep 2022
https://www.thejournal.ie/christmas-deliveries-brexit-5557698-Sep2021/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has admitted he is concerned about the knock on effects Brexit might have on deliveries in to Ireland in the run up to Christmas.
Speaking ahead of his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York this afternoon, he said he believes the “fall out has yet to come” from Brexit.
When asked if he is concerned, about Christmas deliveries and fuel shortages, he said:
“I am indeed. I’ve been concerned for a long time in relation to Brexit. I think Covid has masked a lot of the issues around Brexit. Now, we’ve managed to weathered some of the storm because of preparation, we prepared well, and also because we’re opening up things to Europe and so on.
“But I think from SMEs, for example, in Ireland that they’re finding the lead in times for ordering goods and getting goods into countries much longer than it would have been before Brexit. Also SMEs within Britain are finding it difficult in terms of accessing the European market,” he said.
Warning for Irish shoppers
The Journalreported this monththat Irish shoppers are being advised to start planning their Christmas purchases as soon as they can.
Some of the biggest toy and home furnishing companies operating in Ireland have already said that they are experiencing major delays ahead of the busy season.
Shoppers are advised to buy early this year, a spokesperson for Smyths Toys toldThe Journalthis week.
Retailers have today warned the UK government that it has just 10 days to save Christmas from “significant disruption” due to the HGV driver shortage.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned that disruption to festive preparations will be “inevitable” if progress is not made to solve the shortfall of around 90,000 lorry drivers.
The stark warning came as BP, Esso and Tesco petrol forecourts were impacted by challenges getting petrol deliveries.
Asked about the matter after the Taosieach did a tour of NBC studios and a meeting with executives, he said:
“I think there hasn’t been the same level of preparation in UK, for Brexit, and the results of that are showing.”
“Brexit is a worry, in terms of the dynamic described,” he said.
The Taoiseach said “everybody, including the UK, need to reflect on how it is working”.

“We owe it to those in the frontline of industry and business, that systems run smoothly,” he said.
Now is a time for “common sense and pragmatism,” said Martin.
‘Strong support’ from US
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, who is in Washington DC,  toldThe Journaltoday that the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has shown “very strong support” for Ireland and its position with Brexit and Northern Ireland.
“Absolutely, very strong confirmation from Speaker Pelosi on her support for the Irish position and her willingness to communicate this to the British government. Not surprisingly she’s following Northern Ireland very closely and it was a good opportunity to outline to her what the solutions the EU is working on might look like,” said Coveney.
Coveney spoke to Pelosi about US/Irish relations, issues affecting Northern Ireland, the ongoing implementation of the Brexit agreement as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.
Also on Capitol Hill, Coveney met with a large number of cross-party Senators and members of Congress including the Friends of Ireland caucus.
Brexit will featured prominently during the minister’s trip in New York this week also, when the minister briefed the European American Chamber of Commerce.
President Joe Bidenwarned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week that the Northern Ireland peace process should be not be jeopardised by issues in dealing with the Northern Ireland protocol.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, the US president stressed the importance of maintaining the Good Friday Agreement.
“I feel very strongly,” he said, when asked about the Northern Ireland protocol.
“I would not like to see – nor would many of my Republican colleagues – a change in the Irish accord,” said Biden.
UK Environment Secretary George Eustice claimed this week that Biden doesn’t understand the “very complicated” situation in Northern Ireland.
When asked about thisMartin told reportersin New York that such an assertion is “wrong”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-reputation-among-unionists-6348868-Apr2024/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he hopes the negative perceptions of him among some unionists will be reassessed in the future.
The outgoing Taoiseach was often portrayed within sections of the unionist community as a divisive figure during the Brexit process.
A hard border on the island of Ireland was ultimately achieved, which led to the EU and UK agreeing trading arrangements that created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
At his final official engagement as Taoiseach at the North-South Ministerial Council, Varadkar was asked about the hostility he provoked among some unionists and loyalists and whether he thought it was fair.
“I would hope perhaps in a few years’ time, with the fullness of time, when things look a bit different, with hindsight, that might be reassessed,” he said.
Varadkar was thefirst serving Irish head of governmentto visit the Orange Heritage Museum in Belfast in 2018.
“You know, certainly Brexit, the decision of the UK to leave the European Union, was very disruptive. And I spent a huge amount of my time as Taoiseach trying to make sure that it didn’t create a hard border between north and south and didn’t adversely affect Ireland’s position in the European Union.

“And that did take a lot of work. Ultimately it required three different agreements to be negotiated with the UK government, all of which were negotiated while I held office as Taoiseach.
Varadkar said he believed the Windsor Framework is going to hold, stating that it is now important to “make things work and that we try to make sure that we have a good and close relationship with Britain into the future and that, as much as possible, whoever holds the office of Taoiseach or whoever serves in the Irish government tries to reach out to all communities in Northern Ireland”.
DUP deputy First Minister Emma Little Pengelly, who also attended the meeting in Armagh, spoke of the past tensions.
“I think the Taoiseach is well aware that relationships between ourselves in the DUP and the Taoiseach, (and) with unionism in general, has been difficult in the past,” she said.
“I’ve no doubt that I have personally criticised the Taoiseach on the record in the past as well.
“But, as I’ve said, I wish the Taoiseach all the best in his steps ahead.
“And, of course, I am a unionist, I’m a very passionate unionist, my interest is in strengthening the United Kingdom.
“But…I want to be in this role, and in any role that I play, a good neighbour. I want there to be good relationships with the Republic of Ireland,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-protocoal-brexit-5802708-Jun2022/,"THERE HAS BEEN a lot of talk recently about the British Government breaking international law in their response to the Brexit shenanigans. This intention has now been formalised, with the British Government’s legislation that overrides the Northern Ireland Protocol debated in the House of Commons this week.
This legislation violates their international obligations and puts the people, businesses and the peace in Northern Ireland in jeopardy. However, what exactly does this mean and how are the British Government putting Northern Ireland at risk?
Most of these Brexit moves come back to two things: the Good Friday Agreement and the EU Single Market. Taking the Good Friday Agreement first, the British Government are co-signatories of the Agreement and they have a responsibility to implement it and maintain peace in Northern Ireland. As such, any move that puts the Agreement at risk is a serious breach of this trust.

Impact on Northern Ireland
As we all know, peace in Northern Ireland was hard-won and is very fragile. Huge steps were taken to ensure that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland so as to not re-stoke violence and the Protocol was designed to avoid this.
As the Protocol protects the Good Friday Agreement by avoiding a hard border in Ireland, and this legislation overrides the Protocol, the Agreement is therefore put at risk.
Simultaneously this legislation puts the EU Single Market at risk as it drops the need for many of the checks on goods entering Northern Ireland. What is being proposed is that there would be ‘green lanes’ for goods staying in Northern Ireland which would require no checks, and ‘red lanes’ for goods entering the EU which would require checks.
That the British Government believes that businesses should be able to choose what checks they apply to their goods is staggering.
The rule of law
This legislation also seeks to remove the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in policing the Protocol, instead employing ‘independent arbitration’ to watch over its implementation.

Just because the British Government claims something to be true does not make it so. Claiming there is a democratic deficit when the European Commission Vice President, Maroš Šefčovič spent months engaging with businesses and the people of Northern Ireland on the Protocol, is insulting. To add insult to injury, the British Government has refused to engage in the EU negotiations for several months now, so this claim has no standing.
What we are now seeing is the UK Government blatantly ignoring the will of the people of Northern Ireland, negating their responsibilities and risking their reputation on the international stage all for the sake of internal party politics. After six years of Brexit shenanigans, this is the most disappointing move yet.

COMMUNITY PROPGANDA IS “rife” around the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Belfast community worker has warned.
Eileen Weir, a veteran community worker at the heart of the loyalist Shankill area of Belfast, said the post-Brexit mechanism “needs (to be) fixed” but emphasised that many are “only hearing the negative”.
Weir was among six women who gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in the UK Parliament.
Unionist parties have expressed their opposition to the Protocol over checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, slamming the situation as a border down the Irish Sea.
Demonstrations have been taking place across Northern Ireland against the Protocol and legal challenges have also been taken.
As part of the committee’s NI Protocol Inquiry, MPs in May heard from the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), that the Protocol could lead to violence.

Weir said of all those she speaks to, none say that the LCC spoke on their behalf, and emphasised there are many different points of view among loyalists.
She spoke of concern that “community propaganda is rife”.
“I’m not saying forget about it, I’m saying fix it but just don’t dwell on the hardship of it, let’s dwell on some of the good parts of it because a lot of businesses are thriving here within Northern Ireland because people can’t get their supplies in from Great Britain.”
A flag dispute erupted on to the streets in 2012.PA ImagesPA Images
Weir said fear in the loyalist community started in 2012 when Belfast City Council voted to fly the Union flag only on statutory days instead of all year round, and an unfounded fear around Irish language legislation for some that their Britishness is being taken away from them.
“We need to be smart … not giving another community the feeling they they’re the winners and the other ones are the losers, we need to come away from that type of politics,” she said.
Kate Clifford, director of the Rural Community Network, said there was a “perfect storm” – coming out of the coronavirus pandemic – with paramilitarism on the rise, the threat of a return to violence, along with patriarchy, poverty, political instability, posturing, parades and propaganda.
“We have political posturing. I think we have an imbalance in Northern Ireland in terms of our political agendas at present and I think there is a lot of posturing about the whole talk of a united Ireland at the moment which is unhelpful in the current circumstances where there is already instability and insecurity,” she said.

Elaine Crory, from the Women’s Resource and Development Centre, added: “People are not saying to us that they oppose the Protocol, what they are saying at worst is that they don’t understand the Protocol.
“We’re not implying in any way these these people are lacking in intelligence … it (Protocol) is being propagandised, people are claiming it is all kinds of things and it is in fact not.
There were violent scenes earlier this year at the Lanark Way peace line gate which were blamed on anger at the Protocol as well as a lack of prosecutions over alleged breaches of social distancing at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey.
Crory said the scenes of unrest were “not organic”.
“It was whipped up and designed and it was largely directed by people we refer to as paramilitaries,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nancy-pelosi-threatens-block-trade-northern-ireland-protocol-5768837-May2022/,"LAST UPDATE|20 May 2022
AN INTERVENTION BY US Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol has been slammed by the DUP leader as “unhelpful”.
Pelosi said the US Congress will not support a free trade agreement with the UK if the Government persists with “deeply concerning” plans to “unilaterally discard” the Protocol.
In a strongly-worded intervention, Pelosi urged the UK and the EU to continue negotiations on the post-Brexit trade arrangements to uphold peace in the region.
The congresswoman said in a statement: “The Good Friday Accords are the bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland and a beacon of hope for the entire world.
“Ensuring there remains no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is absolutely necessary for upholding this landmark agreement, which has transformed Northern Ireland.”
The comments from Pelosi are a reminder of the ongoing interest in Northern Ireland at the highest levels in Washington, amid political instability following the Assembly election.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is currently blocking the re-establishment of Stormont’s power-sharing institutions in protest at the protocol, which has created economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson described Pelosi’s contribution as “entirely unhelpful”.
“I noted that Speaker Pelosi talked about the lack of bipartisan approach or agreement on what the UK government are doing,” he said.

“The problem for Speaker Pelosi is that there is not bipartisan or cross-community support for the protocol in Northern Ireland, it is undermining the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, it is undermining the political institutions that were established under that agreement, it undermines the principle of consent.
“You cannot have powersharing without consensus in Northern Ireland so the bipartisanship or the consensus that is required is not won in the US congress, it’s won in the Northern Ireland Assembly and I would urge Speaker Pelosi to understand that because I think that her contributions are entirely unhelpful, offer no solution, offer no help and merely repeat a mantra that frankly is hopelessly out of date.”
UUP leader Doug Beattie described the comments from Pelosi as “not just deeply regrettable and misinformed … but completely wrong”.
“Nancy Pelosi’s comments will only lead to a hardening of positions rather than easing a pathway to solutions which is what all politicians should be concentrating on,” he said.
“Everybody is blaming the UK Government, of whom I have been critical in the past, but trust is a two-way street and all sides bear responsibility, including the Irish Government and EU.”
The Traditional Unionist Voice party in Northern Ireland was also critical of Ms Pelosi, adding “the interference of foreign figures in what are internal UK matters is unwelcome and inappropriate”
It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom now seeks to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland Protocol, which preserves the important progress and stability forged by the Accords.

It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom now seeks to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland Protocol, which preserves the important progress and stability forged by the Accords. It continues to enjoy strong bipartisan & bicameral support in the United States Congress.
TUV representative Stephen Cooper also said Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who met the Stormont parties in Belfast today, “has no business lecturing Unionists on what they can and cannot do”.
“His belligerent meddling should be met with the contempt it deserves and frankly Unionists should not even be meeting him,” he said.
This week, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced plans to legislate to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal treaty the UK struck with the EU.
“It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom is now seeking to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland Protocol,” Pelosi said.

“Negotiated agreements like the Protocol preserve the important progress and stability forged by the Good Friday Accords, which continue to enjoy strong bipartisan and bicameral support in the United States Congress.
“As I have stated in my conversations with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and members of the House of Commons, if the United Kingdom chooses to undermine the Good Friday Accords, the Congress cannot and will not support a bilateral free trade agreement with the United Kingdom.
“Respectful of the will of the British people and of Brexit, I urge constructive, collaborative and good-faith negotiations to implement an agreement that upholds peace.
“The children of Northern Ireland, who have never known the bloody conflict and do not want to go back, deserve a future free of the violence where all may reach their fulfilment.”
Asked about Pelosi’s comments, a No 10 spokesman said: “We welcome that the US shares our deep commitment to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and has urged the EU to show flexibility.”
He said the US congressional delegation visiting London over concerns about the protocol will meet Truss, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.
Pelosi is not the only senior figure in Washington to express concern about relations between the UK and the EU in recent days.
Derek Chollet, a senior adviser to the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said today that a “big fight” between the UK and the EU was the “last thing” the US wanted.
“It’s particularly important right now where we need to send a message of unity to the world and not undermine all the things that we’ve been so successful in working on together over the last several months and showing unity in Ukraine,” Chollet told the BBC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-uk-government-economic-blackmail-funding-stormont-6228290-Nov2023/,"THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST Party (DUP) has accused the British government of “economic blackmail” after Northern Ireland missed out on funding from a £1 billion (€1.1 billion) scheme due to Stormont’s collapse.
Some 55 projects across the UK will get a share of the Levelling Up fund, which is aimed at regenerating high streets and improving transport links.
But no funding was allocated to Northern Ireland.
Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove’s department said “given the current absence of a working executive and assembly, the Government is not proceeding with this round of the Levelling Up Fund at this time”.
“We will continue to work closely with projects and places in Northern Ireland that were awarded a total of £120 million (€137 million) in the first two rounds of the fund,” they added.
Previously, Northern Ireland projects were awarded £120 million in the first two rounds of the fund.
The move comes as the Stormont Assembly and Executive remain collapsed after more than a year-and-a-half amid DUP protest action over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The DUP and the British government have been in talks since unionists identified issues with the Windsor Framework earlier this year.
The party has blasted an “outrageous act” by the government by snubbing Northern Ireland in the latest round of Levelling Up funding.
But Sinn Féin has blamed the DUP for remaining out of Stormont.

Wilson – “Levelling Up Allocation is Economic Blackmail”https://t.co/MaBIOMTOCQvia@duponline@eastantrimmp
DUP MP Sammy Wilson has claimed the British government is operating “under the cloak of economic blackmail” to “syphon money away from Northern Ireland to shore up Conservative seats in England”.

“Despite being entitled to 3% of the £1 billion, Northern Ireland has not received a single penny from this round of allocations despite there being hundreds of suitable applications in the system,” he said.
“The Government’s rationale for this decision is as spurious as it is outrageous.
“An absence of an executive has no material effect on the allocations, indeed the principal objection in Scotland and Wales to the Levelling Up fund is that it is driven by Westminster rather than the devolved regions.
“The Government should be honest. The real reason for this allocation is to direct more money into the marginal seats in Great Britain where the Conservative Party is struggling.”
Ulster Unionist peer Dennis Rogan also criticised the UK government, and described the decision as an “incredibly low and cruel blow”.
“I am appalled that, once again, the people of Northern Ireland are being used as pawns in a political game as punishment for the continuing absence of an executive and assembly,” he said.
“These two issues are unrelated as the Levelling Up fund is a UK Government initiative administered and resourced from Whitehall, not Stormont.
“There is no excuse for this and local communities in Northern Ireland should not be attacked in this shameful way.”
Sinn Féin MLA Conor Murphy said that the Levelling Up decision was the result of “one party’s reckless boycott of the Executive is disgraceful”.
“The British Secretary of State has already imposed a punitive budget on people here, attacking public sector workers and services. This is yet another cynical attack on ordinary people,” he said.
“It is now time for the two-way negotiation between the British Government and the DUP to end.”
SDLP MP Claire Hanna said the DUP’s “continued boycott” of Stormont gave the UK government “the perfect cover to leave our services and infrastructure to rot”.
“At a time when we are crying out for funding, many community projects will have lost out on the opportunity for money that would have made a real difference to places across the North,” she said
“It’s laughable to hear the DUP talking about economic blackmail when they have been holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom for the past year-and-a-half. No matter what hardship has afflicted people here, from the cost-of-living emergency to the collapse of our health service, the DUP have remained unmoved and put their own political concerns over the needs of people who are struggling.”","8.14am, 21 Nov 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-to-delay-post-brexit-checks-on-goods-from-ireland-5630820-Dec2021/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT is to delay new controls on goods moving from the island of Ireland to Great Britain while negotiations with Brussels on the Northern Ireland Protocol continue.
The checks on incoming goods from the European Union – covering mainly food and agricultural products – are due to come into force on January 1, bringing post-Brexit customs arrangements with the bloc in line with those with the rest of world.
However, Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the existing arrangements would continue on a temporary basis for goods crossing the Irish Sea for as long as the discussions on the protocol are ongoing.
“The Government believes that this pragmatic act of good will can help to maintain space for continued negotiations on the protocol,” Lord Frost said in a written ministerial statement.

“It also ensures that traders in both Ireland and Northern Ireland are not faced with further uncertainty while the protocol arrangements themselves are still under discussion.”
The UK Government is seeking major changes to the protocol – which covers the movement of goods from Great Britain to North Ireland – arguing the checks required are damaging business and fuelling community tensions.

Brexit was a bit like this. Presented with the opportunity to reclaim a long-lost virility, an ageing electorate duly pulled on leather pants and gave two fingers to their kids.
But Brexit has an Instagram versus reality problem. Boris Johnson’s patriotic thirst traps promised a bombastic return to a renewed global Britain, but all we’ve been left with is a rather expensive piece of national admin. Even the most diehard Europhobes like Nigel Farage have labelled it a failure. On each end of the political spectrum, no one is happy with how it’s all turned out.
Trade barriers are choking supply chains while restrictions on European workers are gumming up the labour market. Inflation has been coming down across Europe but the UK’s figures have remained stubbornly high.
Advertisement
Leaving the European Union is the only big idea that Britain has had in almost a decade but it’s proven completely unable to solve the real problems people face. Houses remain unaffordable, the health service is on its back, and the cost of living continues to spiral. Politicians have spent too much time arguing over how best to jilt Brussels and too little time considering how to grow the economy. Everyone is worse off as a result.
The conservatives without Johnson are like a cult without a prophet. Its members find themselves blinking helplessly at Rishi Sunak, wondering exactly what was in the Kool Aid they just knocked back. So far, he’s a lot less convincing than his former boss.
For the rest of us though, there’s something faintly reassuring about his earnest Head Boy persona. Sure, he’s a former investment banker and married to one of the world’s richest women. But while he’s from that world of immense privilege, there is a sense that he is not of that world. Born to two middle-class Indian immigrants, he’s a scholarship boy done good. Though Johnson and his pals viewed the government as an extension of their boarding room mess hall, Sunak gives the impression that he really wants to do well.
It speaks to the low bar set by British politicians recently that a vague sense of sincerity is his most redeeming feature. For while his perceived competence will appeal to some, he’s unlikely to inspire Red Wall voters in the way Johnson’s boorish, class clown persona did.
Through hard work and personal credibility, Sunak got a better deal out of the Europeans than his predecessor did. But he’s gotten almost no credit for this because good statecraft is boring.
You can only leave the EU once. Without anything new to offer people going into the next election, it looks like they’ll just double down on migration panic. It was the secret sauce that helped to carry the Brexit referendum after all. But while Johnson’s Brexit was at least veiled by images of rejuvenated English spirit, Sunak’s pledge to “Stop the boats” is raw xenophobic sloganeering at its most artless.

It remains to be seen how far he’ll be willing to go to keep his promise to curb the numbers crossing the channel. The great irony is that the government minister responsible for some of the harshest rhetoric on immigration, Suella Braverman, is a practising Buddhist. Her unique blend of English nativism and Eastern mysticism could be just the ticket for a party trying to rediscover its message. I can almost see the billboards: “Loving kindness – for the English first”.
Johnson promised them the jape of the century, only to resign midterm and leave everyone else to clean up his mess. In this version of Wild Hogs, the gang has gotten halfway down the superhighway only to realise that they’re out of gas, their pants have torn at the crotch, and their leader has thumbed a taxi home to the missus.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-legal-action-uk-northern-ireland-5381852-Mar2021/,"LAST UPDATE|15 Mar 2021
THE EUROPEAN UNION is formally launching legal action against the UK for unilaterally extending the post-Brexit grace periods on trade in Northern Ireland in an alleged violation of international law.
In an escalation of tensions, the European Commission is taking the first step towards proceedings over the alleged breach of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Officials in Brussels said the government had effectively decided to impose an “open-ended extension” to the light-touch regulatory periods, that were due to end this month.
The grace periods cover areas such as supermarket supplies and parcel deliveries to Northern Ireland from Great Britain and mean checks are not yet fully applied.
“The UK must stop acting unilaterally, and stop violating the rules it has signed up to,” the EU official said.
The official said a “letter of formal notice” was to be sent to Westminster today over the alleged breaches, marking the beginning of the formal infringement process.
It requests that the UK carries out “swift remedial action to restore compliance with the terms of the protocol”.
After speaking this morning, EU Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic was sending a separate “political” letter to Cabinet Office minister Lord Frost, who negotiated the Brexit deal.

The official said that letter calls on the British government to “rectify and refrain from putting into practice” issues announced by the UK over the grace period on 3 March and calls for bilateral discussions in good faith to find a solution to begin by the end of the month.
The EU official said: “We have not received from the UK a road map explaining what it would do in practice in order for the protocol to be applied in full.
“Yet without going through the joint bodies, unilateral measures were announced on 3 March and now the European Union is confronted with an open-ended extension to certain grace periods, at least until 1 October.
“In other words, this is the second violation of international law on the same issue and we think it is an enormous problem because there are real-life issues behind all of this and the stakeholders need stability and predictably.
“The commission will send today to the UK a letter of formal notice for breaches of substantive provisions of EU law concerning the movement of goods.”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the extensions are “very sensible”, with the government denying there has been a breach of the protocol.
The Northern Ireland Protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement was designed by the UK and EU to avoid a hardening of the border on the island of Ireland when the post-Brexit transition period ended on 31 December.
Northern Ireland remained part of the EU’s single market for goods, meaning products arriving from Great Britain face EU import regulations.
The first of the grace periods had been due to expire at the end of March but the UK has pledged to extend them until October in a move widely welcomed by businesses in Belfast.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-mistakes-5959910-Jan2023/,"LAST UPDATE|3 Jan 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said mistakes were made on all sides in the handling of Brexit, but vowed to be “flexible and reasonable” when attempting to solve issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He conceded that the post-Brexit protocol is “too strict” and said he understands unionist concerns that the treaty has made them feel less British.
Varadkar, who became Taoiseach for a second time in December, has become deeply unpopular within some sections of unionism and loyalism who claim he was an instrumental figure in the creation of the contentious protocol.
His name and image have recently appeared in threatening graffiti and posters in loyalist areas of Northern Ireland.
Despite this, he has insisted he is looking forward to travelling to the region early this year.
Asked about the negative perception of him within unionism, the Taoiseach said: “I’m sure we’ve all made mistakes in the handling of Brexit. There was no road map, no manual, it wasn’t something that we expected would happen and we’ve all done our best to deal with it.
“Again, I look forward to travelling to Northern Ireland early in the new year, meeting with all the parties, and reaching out to all parties and all communities in an effort to find a solution.”
He added: “One thing I have said in the past is that, when we designed the protocol, when it was originally negotiated, perhaps it was a little bit too strict.
“And we’ve seen that the protocol has worked without it being fully enforced.
“And that’s why I think there is room for flexibility and room for changes and we’re open to that and up for that, and I know from speaking to (European Commission) President (Ursula) von der Leyen and (EC vice president) Maros Sefcovic, that’s their position too.

“So, we are willing to show flexibility and to make compromises. We do want there to be an agreement.
“And, you know, I have spoken to a lot of people who come from a unionist background in Northern Ireland over the years.
“I do understand how they feel about the protocol. They feel that it diminishes their place in the Union, that it creates barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland that didn’t exist before.
“And I do understand that and I do get that. But that’s also true of Brexit.
Varadkar, who made the comments in an interview with reporters just before Christmas, said that Brexit was imposed on Northern Ireland “without cross-community consent, without the support of the majority of people in Northern Ireland”.
He added that “one of the good things about the European Union” was that it “diminished barriers and diminished borders between north and south and that was a great reassurance to people who come from a nationalist background in particular”.

“So I understand that there are two sides to this story. A lot of people who are unionists feel that the protocol has separated them from Great Britain.
“A lot of people from a nationalist background in Northern Ireland feel that it separated them from the rest of Ireland. So there are two sides to this story.”
Varadkar also said that Brexit is a reality which is not going to be reversed.
“I accept that – I regret it but I accept it – and anything we’ve done since then, whether it was the backstop or the protocol, was an attempt just to deal with that reality and to avoid a hard border on our island, to make sure that human rights in Northern Ireland are upheld and there is no diminution of them, which is really important to me as well, and also that the European Single Market is protected, and they’re my firm red lines.
“The backstop, the protocol, were just mechanisms to achieve those objectives and, so long as we can achieve those objectives, I’ll be as flexible and reasonable as I can be.”

The UK government has welcomed Varadkar’s pledge to be “flexible and reasonable” when it comes to reforming the Protocol.
Downing Street said it had “always felt it was possible to enact the protocol in a way that was flexible”.
Former Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said a “radical political and practical solution” was required to break the deadlock.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s official spokesman said that, even before Mr Varadkar’s comments, discussions had been continuing at an “official level” in a bid to reach a resolution.
The No 10 spokesman, however, said there are “not currently” any firm plans in the diary for Mr Sunak and Mr Varadkar to meet.
Powersharing in Northern Ireland is currently in flux due to a DUP boycott of the Stormont institutions in protest over the protocol.
The region’s largest unionist party has insisted it will not return to devolved government unless radical changes are made to trading arrangements that have created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
The EU and the UK are involved in negotiations to reduce the impact of the protocol. It remains to be seen if any deal struck by London and Brussels will be enough to convince the DUP to lift its block on powersharing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rwanda-policy-uk-appeal-5789696-Jun2022/,"COURT OF APPEAL judges in the UK have rejected a last-ditch legal bid to block the first flight due to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda under a controversial new policy.
The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), which represents more than 80% of Border Force staff, and charities Care4Calais and Detention Action challenged a High Court judge’s refusal to grant an injunction on Friday, which meant the first flight to the east African country could go ahead tomorrow.
Lawyers for the three groups and one person due to be removed asked for the injunction to prevent the 11 people now due on Tuesday’s flight from being taken to Rwanda until the full hearing of whether the policy is lawful next month.
Raza Husain QC argued that the judge who refused to block the flight on Friday, Mr Justice Swift, had wrongly decided the “balance of convenience”.But, following an urgent hearing in London on Monday, three senior judges dismissed the appeal, saying there was no error in the decision of Mr Justice Swift.
Lord Justice Singh, sitting with Lady Justice Simler and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, said Mr Justice Swift had “conducted the balancing exercise properly” and did not err in principle nor in the approach he took.
He added: “He weighed all the factors and reached a conclusion which he was reasonably entitled to reach on the material before him.
“This court cannot therefore interfere with that conclusion.”
The judges refused permission for an appeal to the Supreme Court against their decision.
The Home Office has defended the policy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government had anticipated “a lot of teething problems” with the policy, but said the move is necessary to stop illegal people-smuggling rackets on either side of the Channel.

Rory Dunlop QC, for the department, told the court earlier on Monday: “The flight tomorrow is important.Demonstrators at a removal centre at Gatwick protest against plans to send migrants to Rwanda at the weekendVictoria Jones / PAVictoria Jones / PA / PA“This is a policy which is intended to deter dangerous and unnecessary journeys, journeys from safe third countries by people who do not need to make that journey to be safe, they can claim in France or wherever it is.
“This is a policy that if it works, could save lives as well as disrupting the model of traffickers.
“Even if we are just talking about cancelling a flight tomorrow, there is prejudice to the public interest, to the enactment of decisions that may have that deterrent effect.”
The High Court heard the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has multiple concerns about the system in Rwanda, including discriminatory access to asylum, a lack of legal representation and other “deep-rooted structural problems”.
Dunlop said today: “The Secretary of State has listened and seriously considered the concerns raised by the UNHCR and has deliberately negotiated arrangements to provide assurances in relation to those concerns.”
A second case is being heard in the High Court on Monday afternoon after Asylum Aid, a refugee charity, applied for an urgent interim injunction to stop the Government flying migrants to Rwanda.Home Secretary Priti Patel and Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta signed the migration and economic development partnership in Kigali in AprilFlora Thompson / PAFlora Thompson / PA / PAAhead of both hearings on Monday, Johnson told broadcasters during a visit to a farm in Cornwall: “I always said that it will begin with a lot of teething problems and you will have a lot of legal action against it and they will try and delay it – that’s inevitable.
“But what we’re trying to do is stop the business model of criminal gangs who are preying on people moving them across the Channel in unseaworthy vessels, risking their lives and sometimes costing their lives.”
It came as Rwandan high commissioner Johnston Busingye told The Telegraph that his country will be a “safe haven” for migrants, after The Times and the Daily Mail reported that Prince Charles allegedly said in private that the policy is “appalling”.
Johnson declined to comment on whether Charles was wrong in his comments, adding: “This is about making sure that we break the business model of criminal gangs who are not only risking people’s lives but undermining public confidence in legal migration.”
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman later said Johnson “has nothing but respect and admiration for the Prince of Wales, who’s spoken out on a number of issues, not least the environment”.

Leo Varadkar was speaking as speculation mounts that a deal may be announced in the coming days.
Talks between the UK and EU to fix issues with the post-Brexit trading arrangements have been ongoing for some time.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had been expected to travel to Britain today, and was to meet King Charles at Windsor Castle.
However, UK Government sources confirmed von der Leyen’s trip was called off, promptingcommentaryaround Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s handling of the negotiations.
The DUP has pressed the UK Government to act on unionist concerns around the impact of the protocol on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and impact on the union.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has demanded action on the protocol before his party re-enters devolved government.
Speaking in Galway on Saturday, Varadkar commended the “level of engagement” in recent months.

He said he was cautious about saying anything that might risk the process, but indicated he believes there is a possibility of agreement in the next few days.
“Certainly the deal isn’t done yet,” Varadkar told RTE.
“But I do think we are inching towards conclusion and I really want to thank the UK Government and the European Commission and the Northern Ireland parties for the level of engagement that they’ve done in recent months to get us to this point.
“I would just encourage everyone to go the extra mile to come to an agreement because the benefits are huge.
“They allow us to have the Northern Ireland Assembly back up and running in the north and the Good Friday Agreement working properly again, and also to put relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland and the European Union on a much more positive footing.”
Speculation of an imminent deal increased further when it emerged Tory MPs were being ordered into Parliament on a three-line whip on Monday, meaning they must be in the Commons.
British Cabinet ministers were also reportedly on alert for a possible conference call over the weekend.
The protocol, signed by former British prime minister Boris Johnson in 2020, was designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the European Union’s single market.
But the treaty has incensed unionists due to the trade barriers it has created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.","6.33pm, 25 Feb 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-trade-deal-5316364-Jan2021/,"NIGEL FARAGE’S DECLARATION that the ‘war was over’ within hours of the UK/EU trade deal being reached was one that was seconded by many of the significant figures at Westminster.
Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, previously the Party’s chief cheerleader for a ‘People’s Vote’ repeating Farage’s choice of phrase and insisted that the question of EU membership would no longer be an issue for the Party.
The consensus within the Commons seemed to be for a new post-Brexit UK to emerge and find a new place in world politics.
Yet, whatever the wishful thinking of Brexiters might be, their actions have arguably left the UK in terminal decline as an entity. Divisions in society have been opened up as a result of Brexit and these have continued with the so-called generational ‘culture wars’ that have intensified with the emergence of Black Lives Matter and with the Statue protests in 2020.
However, it is the parts of the Union which Brexit has harmed which are of more significance.
The problem with Scotland
The Scottish elections in May are expected to result in a clear majority for the SNP who will try again to call another referendum on Scottish independence. Polls have suggested there is now a clear mandate for independence in light of Brexit.
Scotland voted to remain in the EU by a 62-38 split and support for independence is beginning to reflecta similar favourable split. It appears that the political sea change in Scotland has been such that it is increasingly difficult to make a case for any change back towards supporting the Union.
Whilst younger voters tended to be more lukewarm towards independenceback in 2014, Brexit has significantly reversed this trend. At the very least, therefore, Scotland will be kept in the Union against their wishes if Johnson refuses another referendum, which appears likely.
Along with Scotland, the situation in the six counties appears to please no-one. Unionists have expressed anger at being sold out by Johnson over the Irish Sea customs border, whilst Sinn Féin and the SDPL have dismissed Brexit as a whole and have argued for the speeding up of the process of a United Ireland as a result.
Yet, it has not just been in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the Union appears fragile.

The largest growing political organisation in Britain last year was Yes Cymru, which campaigns for an Independent Wales. Aiding by the greater autonomy the Welsh government has had during the Covid pandemic, Yes Cymru has focussed on dispelling the long-standing Welsh myth that Wales cannot survive without England.
Recent polls have seen support for Welsh independence reach record numbers and are comparable to levelsScotland had pre-referendum.
In addition, in light of the Labour Party’s capitulation to the SNP in Scotland, the Welsh Labour Party are keen not to dismiss independence in the same way with Mark Drakeford underlining that Wales place in the Unionshould not be seen as a given.
How fragile is the Union?
All political unions depend on legitimacy to function for survival. The Brexit fallout has led to deep divisions that pit full brexiteers against united Irelanders in Northern Ireland, full separatists against those who want to abolish the Senedd and return to direct Westminster rule in Wales.
We then have the majority of Scotland against the popular tabloid press in Fleet Street, who are now arguably levying thesame argumentsthey accused remainers of using against Sturgeon and the SNP.
Within England itself, an increasing amount of those that Farage and Johnson relied upon for Brexit appear tofavourEnglish independence from the EU as opposed to any commitment to the UK, whilst in London support for a separatist city-state, based on a Singapore has even gainedmodest supportpost-Brexit.
As was seen with bodies such as Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union two decades ago, once the Union that binds them becomes strained the whole entity can quickly disintegrate.
As we know from Ireland, the United Kingdom throughout its history has been fraught with injustices and instabilities but post-Brexit these are developing across its entire breadth.
If the United Kingdom does indeed disintegrate in the coming decade or two, the great irony will be that it was those who were so keen to flag the Union Jack as a symbolical weapon against the EU that would have effectively killed it off.
In any case, the structural tensions within the UK that Brexit has brought about will make any form of harmony impossible. A jingoistic 19th-century style divide and rule strategy of the sort thatJohnson and Farage appear to supportwill just serve to widen these divisions.
Post-Brexit, the war for the territory currently known as the ‘UK’ might just be beginning.

https://www.the42.ie/daniel-lambert-interview-5829097-Jul2022/,"FOOTBALLERS MOVING across the water from the League of Ireland for below their value is not an especially new phenomenon.
Perhaps the most famous example is current Ireland captain Seamus Coleman, who joined Everton from Sligo Rovers for £60,000 in 2009.
Toffees fans even have a chant celebrating the fact that they signed the Donegal native for ’60 grand’ and over the years many people, including the footballerhimself, have suggested Irish clubs can do better when comes it to negotiating fairer transfer fees.
There have been signs of progress more recently. Manchester City’s signing of Gavin Bazunu was a record deal for an Irish club according to Shamrock Rovers, surpassing the €500,000 Sunderland paid Cork City for Roy O’Donovan in 2007.
Rovers were also involved in another deal that was reportedly record-breaking at the time, with Liam Scales moving to Celtic for six figures. In addition, earlier this year, Udinese paid over €500,00 up front to St Patrick’s Athletic for James Abankwah in what was understood to be yet another unprecedented fee for an Irish club.
However, it seems these types of big-money deals remain the exception rather than the norm.
Part of the problem is that Irish clubs, for the most part, can only offer short-term deals. According to PFAI chairman Brendan Clarke, 75% of players in the League of Ireland were on a 38-week contract last season.
Hoops boss Stephen Bradley had his say on the matter in January,telling reporters:“We have to be very careful, you can’t demand certain fees if you’re giving part-time contracts, one-year deals of 38 weeks.”
“Then you expect to get half a million for a player — it’s not going to happen. If you want the respect of teams outside of this country then you have to respect your contracts and what you’re giving the players. It’s quite simple. If half the players that leave here were in Scandinavia, would they be worth half a million? Of course, they would, but that is because of the way they run their clubs and the length of the contract.”
One particular issue that has cropped up in recent weeks is players with low release clauses in their contract moving on.
Recently departed Bohemians attacker Promise Omochere was among the individuals in this category who have left in recent weeks.
He joined League One side FleetwoodTown for a five-figure sum, albeit with potentially lucrative add-ons if his career continues on an upward trajectory.

Yet the up-front fee seems paltry regardless and in light of such transfers, Bohemians Chief Operating Officer Daniel Lambert was moved to offer his thoughts in relation to these types of deals, beginning with aninsightful thread on Twitter.
“Players do always want to play at the highest level they can,” Lambert tellsThe42. “And you have to acknowledge that even in League One, Fleetwood Town’s budget is £6 million. That’s close to the budget for the entire League of Ireland.
“And so you have to respect that even though these clubs aren’t household names, as such, the industry over there is much bigger. So in terms of a player moving over, they can get a higher salary and when you look at the top of League One, it’s going to be arguably a better standard of football.
“So a player wanting to move to the UK is to be expected and for them to reach their potential is really important. So that would be the most important point. And thenyou get into a negotiation, and just like any other negotiation, you have what you feel is a fair value, you want other add-ons and you want to protect the interests of the football club, and other clubs are the same. And the buying club, like with any negotiation, will want to pay as little as possible and have the lowest exposure they can have.
“So that’s why I mentioned [the release clauses]. It’s not that they’re massively widespread. But just seeing in this window in particular, that players were moving from lots of clubs, ourselves, Shamrock Rovers, Sligo of the ones we know about where there were release clauses executed, and they don’t need to be there. The players will move anyway. The clubs’ positions are weakened.”
Regardless, there is a strong case to be made that League of Ireland clubs are flourishing in a way they weren’t in the past. That may seem somewhat reactionary in response tothe impressive European successesof Sligo Rovers and St Patrick’s Athletic during the week, but other factors back up this assertion, such as improving attendances, progress on stadium development in a couple of instances as well as a greater number of talented young players coming through and getting sold to teams abroad.

Increasingly, therefore, the Premier Division is being seen as a viable environment for Ireland’s best young players, as indicated by how the league’s age profile has decreaseddramatically in recent seasons.
Of course, there are two key factors behind these trends. The onset of Brexit means Irish players cannot move to British clubs until they turn 18, meaning more talented youngsters are at least initially plying their trade closer to home. Furthermore, the introduction of the national underage leagues and more seamless player pathways have also ostensibly benefitted domestic clubs greatly.

In the past, more players left for England at younger ages from schoolboy clubs such as St Kevin’s Boys or Belvedere, whereas the modern equivalent of these promising talents are joining League of Ireland teams earlier and invariably moving to Britain or further afield at a later age.
“Ultimately, the big picture is that League of Ireland is growing,” says Lambert. “We see attendances are growing, we see the league office of the FAI growing, we see clubs doing better in Europe — we went through and played six games last year. And it’s looking good in terms of others being in a good position.
“So clubs are doing well in Europe, we’re having bigger crowds and having more input from the FAI and more professionalism on that side. And we need to keep growing all areas of the game here to increase the amount of revenue moving through it, so we can have a better experience for players, fans and clubs.
“So this [issue in relation to transfer fees] is just one part of it. But in this part, it’s important. We’ve recently hired a full-time head of the academy, which is a position now that about half the teams in the division have, and I think the rest will soon follow.
“We’re developing underage League of Ireland teams that travel across the country, you’ve got to transport these teams around. We’ve six national league teams in boys and girls — the cost associated with the operation, it’s hundreds of thousands a year and growing.
“So we need to make sure that when players do move, we as a league, not as a club, as all clubs, get fair value, and ensure that Ireland isn’t seen as a place to pick up a bargain. Because those two things don’t marry. And it’s important for lots of reasons.
“Even people who maybe only follow international football, or follow a Premier League team and think of League of Ireland as somehow outside of their sphere, it’s not anymore. With Brexit, our top players who come from this island will play for League of Ireland clubs as they move through their pathways. For us to have better facilities, for all of those players, to ensure that the club are in a healthy financial position to be able to do that and to make sure they get acceptable fees [is vital].”
Of course, in certain quarters, there has been and continues to be a negative perception of the League of Ireland, with one recent example evidenced by the fact that a Scottish media outlet choseto refer to Sligo Rovers as “minnows”following their first-leg defeat of Motherwell.
This attitude perhaps exists among some agents too, which partially explains their insistence on low release clauses and the ostensible determination to get their clients away from the environment as soon as possible.
Impressive recent results in Europe are an indication of the League of Ireland's growth.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence that the league is growing substantially and that the perception of Irish football is changing for the better. So surely, the more Gavin Bazunus it produces, the greater the respect the Premier Division will elicit from outsiders?
“You’re getting more full-time staff at clubs,” Lambert adds. “I was with Bohs 10 years before I worked for the club. And I’ve learned more, in the two years that I’m working full time than during the 10 years before, which is normal. Because, before you’re trying to balance your own job, and you’re filling your spare hours, it’s a bit of a learning curve in terms of knowing the regulations and things like compensation, retention rules, and what you’re due from Uefa in solidarity payments, and that’s a process all clubs are going through.
“But agents aren’t the enemy or a bad thing. They’re part of the game, and they’re there to represent the player. And that’s totally understandable. So it’s not a case of clubs being good, agents are bad.
“But when you think of a release fee being imposed at a much higher level, at a Barcelona or Manchester United level, it’s put in there mainly as a mechanism so that they don’t lose the player, a level where ‘we don’t want you to move, and you’re not going to move’.
“But that’s not why they’ve been put in here [in relation to Irish clubs]. A player who really wants to will move, nobody stands in the player’s way at any club. But when they’re being put in here [in Ireland], I think it’s to undermine value.
“And again, there are lots of steps that we need to take to build up our industry here. And this is a small one. But it’s a really easy fix because the risk is that you have an 18-year-old who’s played 15 first-team games and he’s come through your academy, and he’s shown that he’s a really good player, and you’re renegotiating the contract, the risk is that when the agent is trying to insist on a release fee, your risk is that he goes to another League of Ireland club who will agree to it.”
Yet despite a couple of high-profile instances of late where players leave Irish clubs seemingly for below their value, Lambert says these release clauses are far from commonplace.
“At Bohs now, we’ve got roughly 14 players signed for next year, none of whom have release clauses.

“It’s just that it happened in the last window. And it happened to lots of clubs because they were all publicised. And it just became obvious. So it’s not a big issue. It’s not an issue at all right now at Bohs, because of the players that had them have moved.
“But when you see it with so many clubs, and it’s such an easy fix to say: ‘Look, we need to integrate with clubs and agree, and it’s not a price fix, it’s the opposite.
“We’re not agreeing to them, and if the situation arises again, you can have confidence that when a player [release clause] tries to be introduced with club A, Club B, C, or D won’t [agree to it instead].”
Gavin Bazunu is one of the League of Ireland's most successful exports.Laszlo Geczo / INPHOLaszlo Geczo / INPHO / INPHO
Nonetheless, regardless of a player’s potential or if the club manages to negotiate what they consider to be a fair price, the truly substantial money will inevitably always be made from a sell-on fee, on the player’s next transfer, assuming he continues to progress as expected and builds on the early promise shown.
So for example, in addition to the €500,000 Shamrock Rovers received up front for Bazunu, they were the beneficiaries of a seven-figure windfall once the goalkeeper left Manchester City for Southampton in what amounted to a €14 million deal that could eventually rise to €18.5 million overall.
In addition, when Matt Doherty joined Tottenham from Wolves for a fee in the region of €15 million, the Dubliner’s first club Bohemians reportedly receiveda €1.8 million windfall.
“For a really high potential young player, for instance, Evan Ferguson, or we have a player who will be moving to a Premier League club later this year on his 18th birthday, in those examples where we are moving a high-potential young player to a Premier League club, it’s potential only,” explains Lambert. “A lot of things can happen between the ages of 18 and 20 in terms of development so it’s still a risk. While the fees you get are really good up front, it is really if a player reaches that potential with things like a second contract, a percentage sell-on and other add-ons you can put in if their value goes up considerably, that’s ultimately where the main money would come.”
Matt Doherty (right) pictured during his time at Bohemians.Lorraine O'Sullivan / INPHOLorraine O'Sullivan / INPHO / INPHO
Lambert also believes that the long-term answer to negotiating fairer fees for players going abroad lies in Irish clubs working together and presenting a united front.
“These are good players,” he explains. “They’re not over here to pick up people who aren’t good enough. So if you’re going to pick up good players, I just think that the [foreign] clubs have to respect that fact.
“It’s not surprising. League of Ireland clubs have no history of selling players to the UK. All of the young players [traditonally] were developed by junior clubs and they left at a very young age. You had exceptional cases like Stephen Ward or Matt Doherty who were leaving a little bit later.
“But you wouldn’t have had 10-20 players a year, which we’re having right now. And that’s because players are being developed here and are leaving at a later age. So I think you’re coming from a place where clubs from the UK were used to picking up players from junior clubs at 16.
“Junior clubs did a brilliant job over a long period of time. And now you have a League of Ireland club who have invested more money over a longer period of time.
“And it just needs to be shifted a little bit, so that what we’re getting is more than what we have gotten in the past.
“It’s got to be a key area, as it is in other clubs and other countries. Income from clubs in a lot of countries mainly comes from TV, which we don’t have.
“You’ve got games where the bulk of our revenue comes from, but in other markets, transfer income is a big part. So it’s becoming a bigger part for all of us [in the Irish market], it’s becoming a bigger part for Bohs for sure, and as you can see from other clubs, lots of players are moving. So if it’s a key area of income and to generate revenue, which it will be, everyone’s got to make sure that they’re up to speed and that they’re learning.
“And if Derry City, Dundalk or Pat’s sell a player and get a good fee for the player and the player is looking forward to moving, it’s good for all of us because that proves that we as a group in this league can develop and produce players that can play at the highest level. And we know we can, but it demonstrates that to other clubs, leagues, agents, etc. So it shouldn’t be the case that one club begrudges the transfer fee that another club gets, which would be quite short-term thinking.
“A strong league and strong transfer fees are good for all clubs. There might be a windfall for Bohs today, Pat’s tomorrow, and Sligo next year. It doesn’t matter really who the club is, it’s about us all demonstrating our ability.”","10.01am, 31 Jul 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-secretary-glass-half-full-man-northern-ireland-protocol-negotiations-5946558-Dec2022/,"NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY Chris Heaton-Harris has told MPs he is a “glass half-full man” on negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
His comments came as shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle asked: “It’s good news that the Prime Minister has paused the Protocol Bill. Can the secretary of state confirm that negotiations are on track to deliver an agreement that all communities can support by January 19?”
Heaton-Harris said he has “regular discussions with Northern Ireland political leaders on Northern Ireland matters including the protocol”.
The Northern Ireland Secretary added: “The Government is engaging in constructive dialogue with the European Union to find the solutions to the problems the protocol is causing, and we are also proceeding with the legislation which aims to fix to these problems in the event that we cannot reach a negotiated solution.”
“I am a glass half-full man and I really, truly believe there is landing zone that has been identified by all parties to aim for,” said Heaton-Harris.
“Can I confirm the date? No. Can I give a running commentary? I’m afraid I can’t.”
‘Impasse’
Heaton-Harris’ comments come ahead of face-to-face talks between British foreign secretary James Cleverly and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic.
Both men are due to meet in Brussels tomorrow in an effort to intensify efforts to resolve the logjam over post-Brexit trade and to solve the impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol.

A commission spokesman said it was part of the “ongoing engagement” between the senior politicians on the trading arrangements that have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The ongoing dispute over the protocol is intrinsically linked to the current political instability in Northern Ireland.
The region’s largest unionist party, the DUP, is blocking the functioning of the powersharing institutions at Stormont in protest at the protocol, claiming the arrangements have undermined Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom.
The party has insisted it will not allow the formation of a ministerial executive in Belfast until radical changes to the protocol are delivered.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol it agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.
While it has expressed hope of reaching a negotiated settlement with Brussels, the Government is also progressing contentious legislation at Westminster that would empower ministers to unilaterally scrap the bulk of the arrangements without EU approval.
The latter course of action could prompt retaliatory action from the European Commission.
Both the UK and EU are keen to resolve the dispute before next year’s landmark 25th anniversary of Good Friday Agreement.
Speaking yesterday, Cleverly said the tone of his regular discussions with Sefcovic were “positive” and “there is now an understanding that the concerns that we have raised, and that have been raised particularly by the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, are not confected but real, and that any agreement would need to address them”.","4.37pm, 14 Dec 2022",

British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefocovic were scheduled for face-to-face talks as the two sides try to make progress to resolve the logjam.
A spokesperson for the European Commission said the meeting was part of the “ongoing engagement” between the senior politicians on the contentious trading arrangements that have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which were devised by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal, goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are to be inspected at Northern Ireland ports and can then be moved around the island, rather than being checked between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The UK government and Northern Ireland unionists have since pushed back against the terms that were agreed upon.

Westminster is progressing controversial legislation that would empower ministers to unilaterally scrap the bulk of the arrangements without EU approval.
Cleverly welcomed the “important discussions” in Brussels.
“We are determined to find a solution to the protocol that, above all else, protects the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,” he tweeted.
“Our teams continue to meet and I look forward to speaking again soon.”
In the House of Commons this week, Labour former minister Hilary Benn said: “We… read that the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill is on ice while the negotiations continue. Can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that if an agreement with the EU is reached, and we all hope it will happen, that the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill will be dropped?
Cleverly replied: “The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill exists for a reason. The commitment that I made to Maros Sefcovic and the conversations that I had with him and with others is that we would not either artificially accelerate that process or artificially hinder or retard that process.”
“We have always said that our preferred option is through negotiations. We speak regularly, the tone is positive and I think that there is now an understanding that the concerns that we have raised and have been raised particularly by the unionist community in Northern Ireland are not confected, that they are real and that any agreement would need to address them.”","3.25pm, 15 Dec 2022",

The current assessment is that this situation and its causes will persist into the medium to long term.”13 Jun 20226:30PMEuropean Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has said the EU views the UK Government’s decision to table legislation over-riding elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol with “significant concern”.Speaking at the commission headquarters in Brussels, Mr Sefcovic said the unilateral action by the UK could put the access of Northern Ireland businesses to the EU single market at risk.He said the commission would now look at restarting “infringement proceedings” against the UK which have been on hold since September 2021.13 Jun 20226:16PMLooking at the Bill itself, here are the main proposals as quoted directly from the published legislation:This Act—Provides that certain specified provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol does not have effect in the United KingdomGives Ministers of the Crown powers to provide that other provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol does not have effect in the United Kingdom;Provides that enactments, including the Union with Ireland Act 1800 and the Act of Union (Ireland) 1800, are not to be affected by provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol that does not have effect in the United Kingdom;Gives Ministers of the Crown powers to make new law in connection with the Northern Ireland Protocol (including where provision of the Protocol does not have effect in the United Kingdom).13 Jun 20225:51PMNorthern Ireland Protocol Bill presented in the House of CommonsThe controversial NI Protocol Bill has been presented to the House of Commons this evening.The second reading of the Bill will take place tomorrow.You can read the whole Billhere.13 Jun 20225:43PMDUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said it was right that the UK Government acted on the protocol.He said his party would consider the proposals against seven tests the DUP laid out for judging efforts to remove the “Irish Sea border”.“We will obviously read that Bill with interest,” he said.“I believe that finally we are now seeing the kind of action that is required to begin the process of removing the barriers to trade within the United Kingdom to restoring Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.”Donaldson said the EU’s negotiating mandate was “so limited” it could not agree to the changes that were required to the protocol.“We believe it is right that the UK Government takes this action, the UK Government has a primary responsibility to protect the integrity of the United Kingdom and its internal market, whilst at the same time making reasonable proposals that offer protection to the European Union and their single market,” he said.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the British government is ""right"" to take action on the Northern Ireland Protocol, stating the importance of 'protecting the integrity of the UK and its internal market'.Live:https://t.co/hJor5E8ozX📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602 and Freeview 233pic.twitter.com/1FiivLYz15— Sky News (@SkyNews)June 13, 202213 Jun 20225:29PMSinn Féin’s Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill has said that Boris Johnson’s plan to amend the Northern Ireland Protocol is “reckless and disgraceful”.Speaking to the media at Stormont, O’Neill said: “Today’s action by Boris Johnson in Westminster is absolutely reckless, it is disgraceful, it does nothing to serve the interests of the people here.“It flies in the face of an international agreement which he himself negotiated. It is in clear breach of international law.”She added: “The reality is that the protocol is working.

But also, I think, a very clear warning that if the British government continues to take this legislation through Parliament and successfully turns it into law, well, then I think the EU will be forced to act to protect a member state – Ireland -  from the consequences of a breach of an international treaty, which has significant consequences for Ireland, in terms of our own place in the EU single market.Coveney also said when Europe should be working together in response to Russian aggression, it is instead being “forced, because of UK action” to respond to “what we certainly see as a breach of international law”.“I don’t think there’s any other way to describe this. If you are legislating, to set aside elements of an international treaty, which is international law, well then you’re breaking international law. I presume the British government will have some justification for that. I don’t believe that will be valid, but let’s see what the lawyers say on that.”He said there will be members of the Conservative Party who will think the actionis “abhorrent”.“I, like everybody else, have seen the concern that has been expressed within the Conservative Party at this course of action,” he said.I think it does an awful lot of damage to Britain’s international reputation.Of course, the precedent that is being set here to disapply international law, and let’s not forget international law that the British Government was central to actually writing and agreeing and ratifying, I think is something that is abhorrent to many in the Conservative Party.“My language had been blunt and I think it needs to be. For most of my working life as minister for foreign affairs my job is to be a diplomat, but there are times when I think I need to call things out for what they are.”13 Jun 20224:32PMSinn Féin, SDLP and Alliance jointly write to Boris Johnson to condemn ‘reckless’ Protocol billBoris Johnson’s protocol legislation is an outrageous breach of international law, it does not have the support of people, businesses or political leaders in Northern Ireland.This letter is a significant intervention from a majority of MLAs who are calling out Johnson’s lies.pic.twitter.com/EHry0ItwPA— Colum Eastwood 🇺🇦 (@columeastwood)June 13, 2022Stormont MLAs from Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party havejoined together to write to Boris Johnson expressingtheir opposition to his government’s “reckless” Protocol bill.The letter has been signed by 52 of the 90 MLAs, including all nationalist members of the Assembly and all Alliance Party members, who designate as ‘other’.No unionist MLAs signed the letter.The letter to Johnson states that the signatories “reject in the strongest possible terms your government’s reckless new protocol legislation, which flies in the face of the expressed wishes of not just most businesses, but most people in Northern Ireland”.It continues that “whilst not ideal, the protocol currently represents the only available”.While we share a desire to see the arrangements work as smoothly as possible, the way to achieve this is through engagement with the European Union. It is clear that solutions are available and deliverable – as have already been delivered in the area of medicines – but this must be on the basis of trust and the rule of law rather than law breaking and unilateral abrogation of treaty obligations.In response to the letter DUP MP Sammy Wilson tweeted:“Not one Unionist MLA supports the Northern Ireland Protocol. Power sharing will not be restored until decisive action is taken to remove the Irish Sea Border. There will be no return to the status quo.”13 Jun 20223:04PMLIVE: Taoiseach decries UK action on protocol after Johnson insists it's 'not a big deal'My colleague Christina Finn reports that the Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called out British complaints that the EU is inflexible.‘I think it’s a it’s very regrettable for a country like the United Kingdom to renege on an international treaty, it does represent a new low point because the natural expectation of democratic countries like ourselves, UK and all across Europe is that we honor international agreements that we enter into, and this agreement was ratified by the British Parliament, it was approved by the British Prime Minister, I’ve had this discussion with him.“And in our view, the only way to resolve issues around the operation of the protocol is to have substantive negotiations between the United Kingdom Government and the European Union.“And we do not accept the presentation by the British government and certain ministers to the effect that European Union is inflexible. That is not the case,” he said.REUTERS / Clodagh KilcoyneREUTERS / Clodagh Kilcoyne / Clodagh KilcoyneMartin added that after the Assembly elections, people did anticipate that there will be substantive negotiations.“But the British government is still saying it wants those substantive negotiations with the European Union. And I would say to the British government, enter into those discussions now.He said Europe wants the negotiations and has been flexible, and wants to find a resolution to these issues.“Essentially, announcing the unilateral breaching of an international agreement is pretty serious stuff and can’t be, you know, just sort of put to one side. It’s a very serious issue because it goes to the heart of the issue of trust. And the European Union needs to have a trusted partner to negotiate with,” the Taoiseach concluded.13 Jun 20222:43PMDiplomacy through twitter is continuing. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has just tweeted this – he has also criticised the risks of unilateral action by the British Government.The EU has been proactive and flexible in seeking solutions.

German Foreign MinisterAnnalena Baerbockhas called the UK’s Bill to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol a “breach of trust” that is “not acceptable for the EU”.
“With today’s draft legislation on the NI Protocol, London is unilaterally breaking agreements. And doing so for motives easy to see through,” she said in a tweet.
“This is not acceptable for the #EU. To this breach of trust, we will stand united in our response.
“We as #EU have put concrete proposals for solutions on the table. With a firm view to: Citizens & businesses who benefit from the EU single market every day. And the preservation of the #GoodFridayAgreement.
Peace & prosperity on the island of Ireland are not a pawn.
United States Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenhas said he has spoken to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss about “the need to continue negotiations with the EU to find solutions” over the Northern Ireland Protocol.

So what’s in the Bill presented this evening and what’s the reaction been?
We’ve just published a piece summing it all up:
Goods arriving through the green channel would move free of customs or regulatory red tape while the requirements of the Protocol would continue to apply to red channel produce.
Goods banned under the Protocol, such as certain types of plants and seeds, would be allowed to travel into the North through the green channel, as long as they remained in the region.
Red channel goods shipped to Northern Ireland would still have to apply EU customs codes and, if relevant, undergo single market agri-food checks.
Read the full articlehere.
The UK Government has repeatedly said that what they are doing is legal, something at odds with the EU’s view.
The UK Government has claimed its move is justified under international law because of the “genuinely exceptional situation”.
The legal position argues the move is necessary because the protocol is currently not protecting the commitments to the Good Friday Agreement.
It says: “The Government recognises that necessity can only exceptionally be invoked to lawfully justify non-performance of international obligations.
“This is a genuinely exceptional situation and it is only in the challenging, complex and unique circumstances of Northern Ireland that the Government has, reluctantly, decided to introduce legislative measures which, on entry into force, envisage the non-performance of certain obligations.
“It is the Government’s position that in light of the state of necessity, any such non-performance of its obligations contained in the Withdrawal Agreement and/or the protocol as a result of the planned legislative measures would be justified as a matter of international law.
“This justification lasts as long as the underlying reasons for the state of necessity are present. The current assessment is that this situation and its causes will persist into the medium to long term.”
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has said the EU views the UK Government’s decision to table legislation over-riding elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol with “significant concern”.
Speaking at the commission headquarters in Brussels, Mr Sefcovic said the unilateral action by the UK could put the access of Northern Ireland businesses to the EU single market at risk.
He said the commission would now look at restarting “infringement proceedings” against the UK which have been on hold since September 2021.
Looking at the Bill itself, here are the main proposals as quoted directly from the published legislation:
This Act—
The controversial NI Protocol Bill has been presented to the House of Commons this evening.
The second reading of the Bill will take place tomorrow.
You can read the whole Billhere.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said it was right that the UK Government acted on the protocol.
He said his party would consider the proposals against seven tests the DUP laid out for judging efforts to remove the “Irish Sea border”.
“We will obviously read that Bill with interest,” he said.
“I believe that finally we are now seeing the kind of action that is required to begin the process of removing the barriers to trade within the United Kingdom to restoring Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.”
Donaldson said the EU’s negotiating mandate was “so limited” it could not agree to the changes that were required to the protocol.
“We believe it is right that the UK Government takes this action, the UK Government has a primary responsibility to protect the integrity of the United Kingdom and its internal market, whilst at the same time making reasonable proposals that offer protection to the European Union and their single market,” he said.

Sinn Féin’s Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill has said that Boris Johnson’s plan to amend the Northern Ireland Protocol is “reckless and disgraceful”.
Speaking to the media at Stormont, O’Neill said: “Today’s action by Boris Johnson in Westminster is absolutely reckless, it is disgraceful, it does nothing to serve the interests of the people here.
“It flies in the face of an international agreement which he himself negotiated. It is in clear breach of international law.”
She added: “The reality is that the protocol is working. Clearly, what we want here is certainty and stability.
“We are 40 days out from the election and yet we don’t have an Executive formed because the DUP are blocking the formation of an Executive.
“I don’t think that is acceptable to the public while they are dealing with a cost-of-living crisis.”

Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney speaking outside Government Buildings.PAPA
Foreign Affairs MinisterSimon Coveneyhas said the response to the UK government’s Bill to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol will be “incremental”.
“I think they will certainly make a statement later on today when the legislation is published that will express concern as I have done,” he told reporters outside Government Buildings.
“They will assess the legalities of the legislation and get independent legal advice on that because I think the view will be that this is a breach of international law because it is setting aside parts of an international treaty.”
He said in the last 12 months, the EU has shown “a willingness to compromise, a willingness to show flexibility, to view the implementation of the protocol differently, to respond to concerns being raised in Northern Ireland.”
So I think this would be a combination of diplomacy, a willingness to negotiate. But also, I think, a very clear warning that if the British government continues to take this legislation through Parliament and successfully turns it into law, well, then I think the EU will be forced to act to protect a member state – Ireland -  from the consequences of a breach of an international treaty, which has significant consequences for Ireland, in terms of our own place in the EU single market.
Coveney also said when Europe should be working together in response to Russian aggression, it is instead being “forced, because of UK action” to respond to “what we certainly see as a breach of international law”.
“I don’t think there’s any other way to describe this. If you are legislating, to set aside elements of an international treaty, which is international law, well then you’re breaking international law. I presume the British government will have some justification for that. I don’t believe that will be valid, but let’s see what the lawyers say on that.”
He said there will be members of the Conservative Party who will think the actionis “abhorrent”.
“I, like everybody else, have seen the concern that has been expressed within the Conservative Party at this course of action,” he said.
I think it does an awful lot of damage to Britain’s international reputation.
Of course, the precedent that is being set here to disapply international law, and let’s not forget international law that the British Government was central to actually writing and agreeing and ratifying, I think is something that is abhorrent to many in the Conservative Party.
“My language had been blunt and I think it needs to be. For most of my working life as minister for foreign affairs my job is to be a diplomat, but there are times when I think I need to call things out for what they are.”
Sinn Féin, SDLP and Alliance jointly write to Boris Johnson to condemn ‘reckless’ Protocol bill

Stormont MLAs from Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party havejoined together to write to Boris Johnson expressingtheir opposition to his government’s “reckless” Protocol bill.
The letter has been signed by 52 of the 90 MLAs, including all nationalist members of the Assembly and all Alliance Party members, who designate as ‘other’.
No unionist MLAs signed the letter.
The letter to Johnson states that the signatories “reject in the strongest possible terms your government’s reckless new protocol legislation, which flies in the face of the expressed wishes of not just most businesses, but most people in Northern Ireland”.
It continues that “whilst not ideal, the protocol currently represents the only available”.
While we share a desire to see the arrangements work as smoothly as possible, the way to achieve this is through engagement with the European Union. It is clear that solutions are available and deliverable – as have already been delivered in the area of medicines – but this must be on the basis of trust and the rule of law rather than law breaking and unilateral abrogation of treaty obligations.
In response to the letter DUP MP Sammy Wilson tweeted:
“Not one Unionist MLA supports the Northern Ireland Protocol. Power sharing will not be restored until decisive action is taken to remove the Irish Sea Border. There will be no return to the status quo.”
My colleague Christina Finn reports that the Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called out British complaints that the EU is inflexible.
‘I think it’s a it’s very regrettable for a country like the United Kingdom to renege on an international treaty, it does represent a new low point because the natural expectation of democratic countries like ourselves, UK and all across Europe is that we honor international agreements that we enter into, and this agreement was ratified by the British Parliament, it was approved by the British Prime Minister, I’ve had this discussion with him.
“And in our view, the only way to resolve issues around the operation of the protocol is to have substantive negotiations between the United Kingdom Government and the European Union.
“And we do not accept the presentation by the British government and certain ministers to the effect that European Union is inflexible. That is not the case,” he said.
REUTERS / Clodagh KilcoyneREUTERS / Clodagh Kilcoyne / Clodagh Kilcoyne
Martin added that after the Assembly elections, people did anticipate that there will be substantive negotiations.
“But the British government is still saying it wants those substantive negotiations with the European Union. And I would say to the British government, enter into those discussions now.
He said Europe wants the negotiations and has been flexible, and wants to find a resolution to these issues.
“Essentially, announcing the unilateral breaching of an international agreement is pretty serious stuff and can’t be, you know, just sort of put to one side. It’s a very serious issue because it goes to the heart of the issue of trust. And the European Union needs to have a trusted partner to negotiate with,” the Taoiseach concluded.
Diplomacy through twitter is continuing. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has just tweeted this – he has also criticised the risks of unilateral action by the British Government.

If were unsure whether Boris Johnson could say with a straight face that his government’s plans to unilaterally amend the Northern Ireland Protocol were “not a big deal”, here is the evidence:

Another phonecall, this time between Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne and the UK’s junior minister minister in the Foreign Office James Cleverly.
Following the phonecall, Byrne said that “dialogue is the way forward”.
Working together – and bringing the political parties together – is the proven method of ensuring social and economic progress in Northern Ireland.

In a morning of phonecalls, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said he warned UK Secretary Liz Truss that “unilateral action is damaging to mutual trust and a formula for uncertainty”.

On the less succinct and more wordy end, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has also been expressing its concerns over the Protocol row.
The CBI, which is essentially the UK’s version of Ibec, today accused the UK government for “grandstanding” instead of negotiating with the EU to resolve the dispute.
The CBI’s argument is that the Protocol row is leading to uncertainty and that this is putting off potential investors from investing in UK businesses.
It says that while it believes that Brussels was being “inflexible”, London’s unilateral response was “unhelpful”.
In today’s edition of ourdaily business briefing the Morning Memo, I took at look at how the the UK economy is entering a pretty worrying period.
It was revealed today that the country’s economy shrank for the second successive month, sparking fears of a recession.
TheUK’s Office for National Statisticsput that decline at 0.3% of GDP for April, outpacing the 0.1% fall recorded in March.
The woes for the British economy were put into further focus last week when the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) forecast that Russia would be the only major economy to perform worse than the UK next year.
The OECD’s overall prediction was of anaemic growth across the world for 2023, with the Eurozone at 1.6%, the US at 1.2%, the UK at 0% and Russia at -4.1%.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin is among those who’s been reacting, “pretty serious stuff” is his succinct description of it all.

UK tearing up agreement would cause ‘widespread outrage’ – Eamon Ryan
Transport minister Eamon Ryan has been speaking to journalists today, saying the EU will “work as one” to prevent the Good Friday Agreement from being undermined.
Ryan said the UK legislation will take a long time to be passed by the House of Commons.
PAPA
The Green Party leader said the UK government would provoke “widespread outrage”, in the EU and the United States, if it starts to “tear up international agreements that they’ve signed”.
“I think that [international] pressure is what we have to work on. To make sure, in this long drawn out process that seems to be about to start, that they don’t actually undermine the Good Friday Agreement, undermine our border and our arrangements on this island, and undermine the very good working relationship we have with businesses north and south,” Ryan said.
“I think in the end this will be a political decision. And the politics of proceeding as they are planning will actually be seen to be flawed and mistaken. And they will have to turn and reverse their position,” the transport minister added.
Johnson government on ‘wrong track’ – UK Labour
The leader of the UK Labour Party says the British government is “going down the wrong track” with its efforts to alter the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Keir Starmer said: “I think the answer to this is to accept there are some problems in the way the protocol works but they can be resolved around the negotiating table with statecraft, with guile, with trust.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have those in the current Prime Minister.
“They won’t be resolved with legislation that breaches international law and that, frankly, will impede the negotiations that, in the end, will be needed to settle this,” Starmer said.
Simon Coveney is back on Twitter, this time he’s arguing with the UUP’s protocol spokesman Steve Aiken. The unionist accused Coveney of being part of the “historic low point” in Anglo-Irish relations.
The foreign affairs minister responded by, again, saying that the UK is not engaging with the EU to find a solution to the protocol deadlock.
Steve, you know better than most that I not only want to respond to Unionist concerns re Protocol, but have been actively working with EU Comm for months to shape proposals to do that, while respecting an int treaty. EU is committed to significant compromise but needs a partner.— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney)June 13, 2022

The Northern Ireland Protocol mess is Johnson’s mess - and it is about to cause the UK a lot of economic painhttps://t.co/eMIzUWQ3cL
ITV’s Robert Peston has published a withering take on the actions of the Johnson government and a downbeat analysis of its economic impact on the UK.
“Economic relations with the EU, still the biggest market for our exporters by a country mile, were already bad. They are about to become appallingly bad,” Pestonwrites.
The Times newspaper in the UK is reportingthat British ministers have told the DUP that they must re-establish full power-sharing in Northern Ireland before the bill seeking to override the protocol is brought before parliament.
The paper cites sources that said the UK government needed the unionist party to move as a demonstration, to the EU and the US, that the problems over the protocol can be fixed.
Protocol plans ‘not a big deal’ – Johnson
PAPA
UK prime minister Boris Johnson says his government’s controversial plans to override the protocol are “not a big deal”.
Speaking to broadcasters on a farm in Cornwall, Johnson said: “First of all, the protocol isn’t actually even yet being implemented. And it’s because it’s all been put into cold storage while we try and manage it, were it to be implemented, it would do even more damage diverting trade and that is upsetting the balance of the Belfast Good Friday agreement.
“We’ve got a problem at the moment, which is in Northern Ireland, the Stormont assembly, the government of Northern Ireland, can’t meet because of the effects of the protocol. What it does is it creates unnecessary barriers on trade east-west.
“What we can do is fix that. It’s not a big deal, we can fix it in such a way as to remove those bureaucratic barriers but without putting up barriers on trade moving north-south in the island of Ireland as well.”
Liz Truss referenced “the people of NI” in her tweet.
However,polling has shownthat a narrow majority of people in Northern Ireland believe the protocol is a “good thing”.
Another pollfound that 63% of people in the North agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a “unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities compared to the rest of the UK which if exploited could benefit Northern Ireland”.
Meanwhile, here’s Truss’s tweet about her phone call with Coveney.
The UK Foreign Secretary says the British government “remain open to negotiations with the EU, but we cannot wait to fix the issues facing the people of NI.”

Good morning and welcome to another day of Brexit antics. Céimin Burke reporting here as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is poised to publish legislation to unilaterally alter parts of the UK’s withdrawal deal with the EU.
Simon Coveney held a 12-minute phone call with Truss this morning, at the request of the UK Foreign Office.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs warned his counterpart that unilaterally altering the protocol will breach international law and “deeply damage” relationships.

THE SHOUT FROM the other side of the road was about the frozen footpath and the absence of grit.
And, the gist of the comment directed towards me, was along these lines: “You should be reporting on this.”
All politics is local.
In the North, it is rarely sure-footed, and is often frozen. Footpaths can be far away from the frontline arguments.
For much of 2022, Stormont operated without an Executive.
There is nothing new about that. It is part of an all too familiar pattern.
At another level, it was the year of three British Prime Ministers – Boris Jonson, Liz Truss and, now, Rishi Sunak.
In Dublin, the political furniture has also been rearranged – Leo Varadkar back as Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Simon Coveney, part of the last rescue mission at Stormont alongside then Secretary of State Julian Smith, has moved to Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
That bitterly cold night in January 2020, when he and Smith announced their New Decade, New Approach agreement on Stormont’s hill, ended a three-year freeze; saved politics from its purgatory.
That same old picture
Yet, here we are again, turning a page into a New Year and looking at an old picture. That same old picture.
The brokenness of Stormont, this time part of the post-Brexit fallout, with a sea border for Great Britain to Northern Ireland trading arrangements, that in unionist minds makes this place different from the rest of the United Kingdom.
It’s about the Union.
This is why the DUP has been standing outside the Northern Ireland Executive.
The UK and EU are back in talks.
Depending on their outcome, the focus will come back to Stormont, but no one should believe that the politics of here, its problems, are anywhere near the highest priority. They are not.
Late into 2022, there was talk of another election to the Assembly, but it also slipped and is still skating on our frozen political ground.
Another election, without rules, would change nothing.
Rules such as a date for nominations to the Executive, and consequences if nominations do not happen. No salary. No Stormont.
We can’t continue with pantomime politics and a pretend parliament.

In another waiting room
So, we are waiting for the outcome of those UK/EU talks.
Recently, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stepped into the Northern Ireland conversation and argument when he met party leaders in a hotel outside Belfast on 15 December.
Five of the parties were represented, given short notice of the Sunak visit and his intention to speak with them.
This was not a meeting intended to achieve any breakthrough or thaw. More an introduction, knowing that the bigger decisions are further down the road.
The conversations happened with all of them in the same room. Sunak spoke with them one by one.
“You couldn’t overhear the other conversations,” one of those present commented. “There was lots of chat in the room.”
But we all know the issues – those deepest trenches and frontline battles relating to the sea border, unionist concern about the Union and the constitutional position, and how to achieve working politics through a restored Executive.
Then, the issues that really matter in the here and now. A health service under huge pressure, nurses and other workers on strike, the cost of living crisis and when and how support payments to help with energy costs will be made.
These are the things on which votes depend – how the parties will be judged when that next election happens.
Understanding Northern Ireland
One source, present at the hotel meeting, described Sunak as “friendly, charismatic, chatty” – the Prime Minister just seven years after being elected as an MP.
Understanding Northern Ireland can take 70 years – perhaps longer.
It is once again an unsettled place. Old certainties gone. The euphoria of the political agreement of ’98 a distant memory.
In a few months’ time, how will its 25th anniversary be marked? Will there be working politics by then?
Who knows?
Can there be political stability in the North with that other question – Union or Unity – unanswered?
How long will it take before that question is asked in a border poll?
Why did Sunak step into this maze of uncertainty at this time?
A play for time
He was obviously persuaded that it was worthwhile, needed – but persuaded by whom?
A couple of months ago, we were expecting NI Secretary of State Chris Heaton- Harris to announce a date for an Assembly election; then, there was an embarrassing, muddled, late decision to play for time.
The suggestion was that Sunak had stepped in.
Related ReadsAnnouncement of no December Stormont election is 'Christmas miracle'Still no clarity on an election date in Northern Ireland, what's going on?Brian Rowan: Can the parties of Northern Ireland truly make it work this time?
That election would have been back into the mess. There would have been no point in that. Thus, the delay.
Then, the visit. It looks like the pace and play in relation to Northern Ireland is being determined in London and linked to those UK/EU talks.
Some time, but not wasted time
London no longer has the energy or enthusiasm or time that former British PM Tony Blair had for here.
The peace process is an old trophy.
The outstanding challenge is how to break the mould of conflict politics. End that war.
Think of Sunak’s priorities right now – Ukraine, energy supply and security, the UK economy, trade and how to survive the next UK General Election.
All of these things sit well above Stormont.
If the UK/EU negotiations arrive at a deal, then, the question will be asked of the DUP.
Stormont, or not?
Sunak will give some time to here, but not wasted time.
There comes the point of decision, when the tail is no longer allowed to wag the dog.
One chance
There is an important point articulated by a source: “Once the deal [UK/EU] is done, there won’t be another go at it.”
If Sunak can convince the Conservative Party of the worth of any deal, then, that will be it.
At some point, he may have to tell our political leaders that this is the way it works – as good as it gets.
The biggest players in this negotiation are not in Belfast. This will happen or not happen at another level.
Politics on a high wire.

https://www.thejournal.ie/aldi-to-lift-limits-of-veg-in-uk-6016746-Mar2023/,"ALDIS STORES IN the UK will remove all customer limits on buying fresh produce as supply issues which led to widespread shortages begin to ease.
The supermarket joins Lidl and Asda in lifting restrictions.
Aldi said in a statement today: “From Monday (March 13), Aldi will remove all purchasing restrictions on fresh produce – including limits on tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.”
Lidl will also lift all restrictions on fruit and veg by Monday.
Asda said it has removed limits of three items per customer on cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries, leaving restrictions of three on tomatoes and peppers.

The supermarket said availability overall has improved as expected and supplies of tomatoes and peppers are expected to be back to normal within a couple of weeks.
Shoppers started seeing shortages of tomatoes on around 20 February, with retailers saying a combination of bad weather and related transport problems in north Africa and Europe were causing significant supply problems.
The shortages spread to other products, leaving shelves bare of fresh produce items including cucumbers, peppers and lettuce.
Tesco, Aldi and Lidl limited purchases of peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers to three items per person, while Morrisons set a limit of two per customer on tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers.
Production problems in Morocco began in January with unusually cold night temperatures affecting tomato ripening.
Growers and suppliers in Morocco then had to contend with heavy rain, flooding and cancelled ferries – all of which affected the volume of produce reaching Britain.
Supplies from Britain’s other major winter source, Spain, were also badly affected by weather.
MCE Logistics, a company which processes forms for EU-sourced produce entering the UK,told the BBCthat it takes around 10-20 minutes per lorry to fill out the Brexit-related importation paperwork.
This can take longer if lorries are transporting mixed loads of vegetables, while produce importer told the BBC that”Brexit paperwork” was to blame for the shortages.","5.32pm, 11 Mar 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-collapsing-stormont-ni-protocol-5388111-Mar2021/,"A senior Democratic Unionist has rejected a suggestion his party is considering collapsing powersharing in Northern Ireland in protest at Brexit’s Irish Sea trading border.
Stormont Education Minister Peter Weir was responding to weekend comments from David Campbell, chairman of the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), an umbrella group representing loyalist paramilitary groups.
Unionists and loyalists are demanding the removal of arrangements that govern trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK post-Brexit.
The arrangements, contained within the Northern Ireland Protocol, require a range of new regulatory and customs checks and processes on goods moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.
In an interview with the Sunday Independent, Campbell claimed First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster had told the LCC that collapsing the Executive was within her party’s “thinking”, but only after all other avenues to ditch the protocol had been exhausted.

Weir said the issue was not raised at the meeting between the LCC and the DUP leadership last month.
“I think we’re somewhat bemused by the comments and I think we’re seeking David to clarify the situation, whether he’s misinterpreted,” Weir told BBC Radio Ulster.
“But you know the reality is in terms of the meeting that was held between the DUP and David’s group, we didn’t raise the issue of bringing down the Assembly, it wasn’t discussed, it’s not within our thinking, and I think that would be counter-productive.
“I think what we are looking to see across the board, across unionism as a whole, is constructive cooperation on an entirely sort of peaceful constitutional manner to see what actions can be taken against the protocol, and that’s where the focus of our activities is.
“We’re not and we haven’t suggested bringing down the Assembly or the Executive nor indeed was it discussed at the meeting.”
The Protocol was agreed by the EU and UK during the withdrawal negotiations in an effort to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
It achieves that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, with regulatory checks and inspections now required on agri-food produce moving into the region from the rest of the UK.
Related ReadsArlene Foster says UK 'damaging' itself with NI Protocol to appease EU
The Protocol also requires Northern Ireland to apply EU customs rules at its ports, requiring a range of customs red tape and declarations on goods arriving from Great Britain.
The new arrangements have caused some disruption to trade since the start of the year as firms have struggled with new processes and administration.
Unionists and loyalists are vehemently opposed to the protocol, claiming it undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market.
Amid heightening tensions in Northern Ireland, earlier this month the UK government moved to unilaterally delay full implementation of the Protocol, by extending some grace periods that currently limit the level of checks and declarations required.
In response, the EU launched legal action against the government, accusing it of breaching the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/referendum-on-a-united-ireland-5334045-Jan2021/,"JUST OVER HALF of people in Northern Ireland want a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years, according to a new opinion poll.
The Sunday Times commissioned polls in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales to gauge people’s views on thefuture of the United Kingdom.
In Northern Ireland, 47% of people surveyed want to remain in the UK, while 42% of people are in favour of a united Ireland and 11% are undecided.
When asked if they supported a border poll being held in the next five years, 51% said yes and 44% said no.
Among people under the age of 45, supporters of Irish reunification lead by 47% to 46%.
More people in Northern Ireland also think there will be a united Ireland within 10 years, by a margin of 48% to 44%.
Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster today said a border poll on a united Ireland would be “absolutely reckless”.
The DUP leader also said it is “very disappointing” to see some nationalist parties across the UK talk about constitutional politics during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Speaking on Sky News this morning, Foster said: “We all know how divisive a border poll would be. For us in Northern Ireland, what we have to do is all come together to fight against Covid and not be distracted by what would be absolutely reckless at this time.”
However, she said she is not against having a conversation about a poll.
“It is not that I’m dead against it,” she said.
“I can argue for the United Kingdom every day of the week because the arguments are rational, logical and they will win through.
“Nobody is suggesting, not even this poll is suggesting, that we would lose if there was a border poll. But it would be incredibly divisive.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/joe-biden-boris-johnson-northern-ireland-5465927-Jun2021/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Jun 2021
US PRESIDENT JOE Biden urged Boris Johnson to ensure the Northern Ireland peace process is protected in his bitter row with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements, the White House has disclosed.
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden – who has spoken of his pride in his Irish roots – had held a “candid discussion” with the Prime Minister about the issue during the course of the G7 summit in Cornwall.
Answering questions from American reporters, Sullivan said the president had expressed his views with “deep sincerity” but declined to go into detail, suggesting Biden may have delivered his message with some feeling.
“All I’m going to say: they did discuss this issue. They had a candid discussion of it in private,” Sullivan said.
“The president naturally, and with deep sincerity, encouraged the Prime Minister to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the progress made under it.
“The specifics beyond that, I’m not going to get into.”
Sullivan would not be drawn on whether the president had linked the issue to a free trade deal with the UK and did not specify when the conversation took place.
The two leaders held a bilateral meeting on Thursday before the main summit began and afterwards Johnson played down any differences between them on the issue.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday said that a further grace period for the Northern Ireland Protocol would be “very problematic”.
Speaking on Sky News, Martin said: “I think the UK Government are under no illusions about where the EU is coming from in relation to the Protocol.
“But the European Union is willing and very engaged in endeavoring in trying to find the solutions to the issues that have been raised in respect of the Northern Ireland Protocol. And, in my view, the channels do exist to get this resolved.”
‘Offensive’
The disclosure came as the gathering ended with a furious diplomatic spat after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused French President Emmanuel Macron and other senior EU figures of talking about Northern Ireland “as if it was some kind of different country to the UK”.
He described such attitudes as “offensive” and called on the EU to show “respect” as such comments caused deep concern within Northern Ireland.
The DUP’s new leader Edwin Poots sent a copy of the Good Friday Agreement to Macronafter he made the remarks.
In a statement released yesterday, Poots said: “Emmanuel Macron’s suggestion that Northern Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom is offensive and demands a statement from the French administration which recognises Northern Ireland’s constitutional status.”
He suggested that Macron’s comments expose “ignorance” within the European Union.
“It’s five years since the referendum. Northern Ireland has been centre stage for most of that time yet the most powerful man in one of the most powerful EU countries still doesn’t realise that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. It’s incredible,” he said.
Related ReadsG7 countries pledge to provide one billion Covid-19 vaccinationsTaoiseach warns UK extension of protocol grace period would be ‘problematic’
Poots again called for the Northern Ireland Protocol to be removed.
At his closing news conference, Macron strongly denied that he had ever questioned British sovereignty but insisted the UK must honour the commitments which Johnson signed up to in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
“On this topic, everyone should return to reason, and my wish is we succeed, collectively, to put in motion what we all decided upon together several months ago,” he said.
“We should do it in all calm and with mutual respect, and I think that polemics every morning are not helpful.”
The continuing row over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the agreement – intended to protect the peace process by ensuring there is no return to a hard border with the Republic – overshadowed much of the summit.
Johnson repeated his warning that he could unilaterally delay the latest checks on chilled meats moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – due to come into force at the end of the month – unless there was a resolution to the dispute.
The EU has previously said that its patience is wearing “very, very thin” and has threatened to launch a trade war unless the UK abides by its treaty obligations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-bid-recall-stormont-ahead-public-sector-strikes-6271087-Jan2024/,"A BID IS under way to have the Stormont Assembly recalled next week.
Sinn Féin is attempting to bring the recall on Wednesday – the daybefore trade unions are planning one of the largest public sector strikes Northern Ireland has seenin recent history.
Thursday is also the deadline for Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris to call fresh Assembly elections if devolved government in Northern Ireland has not been restored.
The Assembly has been effectively collapsed for almost two years. The DUP is refusing to participate until unionist concerns around post-Brexit trading arrangements are addressed.
Sinn Féin’s Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill said her party has initiated an Assembly recall to restore the Executive and “urgently deliver a fair pay deal for public sector workers”.
The recall motion will require the backing of 30 MLAs to succeed.
It urges that the Assembly meets urgently to elect a Speaker and Deputy Speakers, appoint ministers and back a motion which endorses fair pay settlements for public sector workers.

It also calls for the DUP to “respect the democratic outcome of the May 2022 Assembly election” in which Sinn Fein made history by becoming the first nationalist or republican party to top the Stormont poll and entitling it to nominate the first nationalist or republican First Minister.
Finally it emphasises the “pressing need to urgently reinstate the Executive to tackle the unprecedented challenges confronting citizens and our public services, particularly the immediate matter of public sector pay”.
The DUP has insisted it will not end its blockade until it secures legislative assurances from the Government on Northern Ireland’s trading position within the UK.
Heaton-Harris has said his talks with the DUP over the Windsor Framework have concluded, although leader Jeffrey Donaldson has insisted engagement is continuing.
Heaton-Harris has invited the main Stormont parties to take part in bilateral talks at Hillsborough Castle on Monday about the Stormont stalemate.
O’Neill also pressed the DUP today to make a decision on re-entering the Assembly.
“It is decision time for the DUP,” she said.
“There can be no more delays or excuses. Our public sector workers play a pivotal role right across our society, working in our hospitals, schools, on trains and buses, and within the civil service.
“The DUP cannot continue to leave workers and families in the lurch any longer.”
Earlier DUP MP Gavin Robinson insisted there is no legal basis for joint authority rule in Northern Ireland if devolved government is not restored.
Robinson was reacting after Conservative MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee Robert Buckland said any alternative to the DUP agreeing a deal to restore the Stormont Executive would likely mean the “involvement of the Irish government”.

During an appearance on the BBC’s The View programme, Buckland said that a return to direct rule for Northern Ireland would mean “triggering certain aspects of the Good Friday Agreement” and “involvement of the Irish government, ultimately”.
When asked if “old-style direct rule of the past” was off the table, he responded: “I think so.”
Robinson responded: “Sir Robert Buckland seems to be confused. It’s not often he is wrong, but on this he is.
“The Republic of Ireland has no legal basis for governing Northern Ireland. Such a step would be a further breach of the Belfast and successor agreements.”
He added: “It is the arrangements flowing from the Northern Ireland Protocol alone that are stopping the formation of an Executive.
“We are focused on getting this right and restoring the balance. We will not be distracted by Sir Robert’s confused viewpoint.
“Rather than issue hollow threats about some version of joint authority, Sir Robert and his colleagues would be better to focus on restoring Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.
“Replacing the protocol with arrangements that unionists, as well as nationalists, can support will provide a solid foundation for the restoration of devolution on a cross-community basis.”
Previous talks between Heaton-Harris and the main Stormont parties over a £3.3 billion (€3.8 billion) financial package to accompany the return of devolution broke up at Hillsborough Castle in December without any agreement to restore the Assembly and Executive.
The package would include money to make an outstanding pay award to public sector workers.
With their pay demands still unmet, unions are planning a major strike across Northern Ireland on 18 January.
Buckland denied that the UK Government was using the strikes in Northern Ireland as a means to pressure the DUP into a deal.
He said: “I think on one level it’s maybe a cynical view about how the UK government would view the valued contribution that public service workers make in Northern Ireland.
“The reality is this facing all of us – all of us as elected politicians have responsibilities to face up to.
“Sometimes we have to make decisions that we don’t particularly like, we don’t live in a perfect world.
“The DUP are part of this imperfect world. There isn’t a perfect solution for them.
“But there is a solution and a solution that can deliver for their constituents, many of whom are public sector workers, in a way that I think would redound to their credit.
“That’s why I think now is the time for leadership, for courage if you like – an overused word sometimes, but one that might apply in this case – to allow the Executive to be formed as quickly as possible.”","7.56pm, 12 Jan 2024",

The EU said a “very intense period of discussions” has begun but suggested they may not include the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
Stripping the ECJ from the Brexit agreement has emerged as a key demand from the Government as it seeks to ease trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain.
But the EU’s proposals to slash red tape on Irish Sea trade fell short of the demand from Brexit minister David Frost, who is taking part in meetings in Brussels.

European Commission spokeswoman Arianna Podesta insisted the package proposed by the EU last week is extensive and that talks would not go much further than it.
Asked whether talks will include the ECJ this week, Podesta told reporters in Brussels: “We are following up on the package that we have proposed on 13 October – it is a far-reaching package.”
Frost is meeting with Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president who has been acting as the EU’s post-Brexit negotiator.
Sefcovic welcomed that “both sides have agreed to engage intensively and constructively at both expert and political level”, according to a statement from the commission.
“The EU seeks to focus on the areas that matter most to Northern Irish people and businesses, and where we can find common ground,” it added.
“Swift joint solutions would bring the stability, certainty and predictability that Northern Ireland deserves, ultimately protecting the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions.”

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has welcomed comments made by Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, who has said he is happy to ‘eat humble pie’ in a bid to improve the broken relationship between Britain and Ireland.
Steve Baker, previously a strident Brexit supporter, said he is “convinced” that a deal can be reached on the Northern Ireland Protocol if negotiations are made in a “spirit of goodwill”.
It comes after the former member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs apologised over his “ferocious” stance on negotiations with the EU.
He told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham yesterday that relations with Ireland were not “where they should be”, and added that ministers needed to act with “humility” to restore relationships with the Republic and the EU.
The Taoiseach today told reporters he welcomed Baker’s comments.
“I think they were honest and very, very helpful and I look forward to continuing engagement with Minister Baker and indeed others in the British government,” he said.
Martin said he had good engagement with new Cabinet members in the British government when he met them at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. He also met with British Prime Minister Liz Truss.
“We both articulated a collective sense of the longterm desirability of very good relationships obviously between Britain and Ireland and also between the United Kingdom and the European Union,” he said.

Speaking onRTE’sMorning Ireland programme this morning, Steve Baker said he was sorry that relations between the UK and Ireland have been “soured” by the Brexit process.
“I’m very convinced that, if we get into a negotiation, without pre-conditions, and together in a spirit of goodwill, we can de-escalate this problem and we can get a deal which works for everyone, respecting everyone’s legitimate interests, north-south and east-west,” he said.
“And that really is why, if I have to eat a bit of humble pie in order to restore broken relationships to get that done, well, I’m happy to eat a bit of humble pie.”

Baker, who assists Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, told the conference:  said his motivation for his apology was to try to get a “deal that works” on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“If we’re going to be constructive here and get a deal that works for everyone, we’ve got to de-escalate these tensions. So that was my motivation,” he said.
“I sincerely want to be on the right side of all parties involved in the Good Friday Agreement so that we can make progress, get a deal and get on with the really serious issues that we face in Northern Ireland.”
He added: “I’m sorry that relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland have been soured by the Brexit process.
“And I recognise that as the leader of the sort of 28, if I can put it in those terms, who rejected Theresa May’s deal three times, that caused enormous amounts of anxiety, and I recognise also that businesses in Northern Ireland faced a lot of costs through this process of uncertainty.
“And those are things I want to see put right.
“We can put those right in the deal.”
The comments were welcomed by Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne.
Deputy Byrne said: “There is an opportunity now to find agreed solutions around Protocol implementation.
“It’s important we now move into real engagement between EU and UK teams, to arrive at solutions.”
The conciliatory tone from ministers came after new UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly held his first call with Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice president.
Sefcovic described the call as a “good conversation”, and said negotiating teams are due to meet soon amid a row over post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/customs-revenue-systems-issues-5348987-Feb2021/,"REVENUE HAS APOLOGISED for any inconvenience caused by “intermittent performances” with its import system.
Revenue officials processed 1.8 million customs declarations in January 2021 – more than they did in the whole of last year.
But customs IT systems have struggled to cope with the increased volume of declarations, resulting from post-Brexit red-tape, with officials admitting it has caused “major difficulties” for businesses.
Tom Talbot, head of Revenue operations at Dublin Port, said they are interacting with their software providers and businesses to find solutions.
He told a press conference today: “Revenue has processed over 1.8 million customs declarations of different types in January, from the first of January to the first of February.
“These relate to import declarations in relation to freight vehicle movements, postal parcels, export declarations and safety and security declarations.
“So that’s 1.8 million for the month of January. By way of comparison, we processed about 1.6 million declarations in the whole of 2020.
“It gives that sense of scale, one month in, of the numbers that we’re dealing with.”
He added: “However, we very much acknowledge that there have been intermittent performances with our import system.
“We are very conscious of the impact that that has on trade and business moving goods, and we apologise for the inconvenience caused.”
The volume of increased declarations had been anticipated by Revenue.
It is anticipated that 20 million declarations or more will need to be processed this year.
But Talbot said the issues arise when a high number of declarations are uploaded to the system at the one time.

He said: “That’s what the system is built for, that’s what we expect. What we are finding, though, is that at peak processing times, that the system has degradations.
“So there are performance issues at peak processing times. If someone is putting in one, 10, 20, 100 declarations, the system works away.
“It’s the large filers, where large numbers of documents are being uploaded in one go.
“Where the system is taking 20,000 in one go, one press of a button, that’s where we’re finding occasional degradation of the system.
“That’s where we are. We’ve identified the issue, we’ve identified the problem. When you compare 1.8 million with where we were a year ago…
“That’s not to say it’s not an issue for us. We understand that it’s causing major difficulties for some companies, and trade and business. That’s why we’re working with them individually.
“That’s why we’re working very effectively now with our software provider, to find solutions.
“Between our software provider and the individual companies, that’s how we’re tackling this, that’s where we’re looking for solutions. These solutions will come and will come quite quickly.”
He said that one issue identified is the growth in businesses that ship large volumes of small consignments, typical of small, online retailers.
“That business model has increased significantly with the move to online shopping, since the start of the pandemic” he added.
Meanwhile, a new requirement for hauliers entering France to produce a negative Covid-19 test has not caused any major disruptions, officials said.
Eddie Burke, a Department of Transport official, said four drivers had been turned away from Rosslare on the first weekend after the new rules came into force.
But since then, there have been no drivers turned away.
“From what we’ve seen, it seems to be working very, very well. That’s thanks in a large part to the hauliers themselves, who have had to deal with a lot between Brexit and between Covid.
“They seem to have adapted to the system. The services are there, and the feedback we’re getting is overwhelmingly positive.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/catholic-uptick-in-ni-census-most-important-finding-says-jon-tonge-despite-surge-in-non-religious-grouping-5873313-Sep2022/,"IN A HISTORICAL context, Catholics outnumbering Protestants is the “most important” finding in the latestNorthern Ireland Census, which was released this morning.
That’s according to Jon Tonge, who is a British and Irish politics professor at the University of Liverpool.
He notes that the “history of Northern Ireland was the creation of a Protestant State for a Protestant people,” but that this has now “evaporated”.
However, Boyd Sleator, who is the co-ordinator for the Northern Ireland Humanists, argues that the “dominant narrative” of the 2021 census ought to be rise of the non-religious in the North.
The non-religious grouping (17.4%) is now second only to the Catholic population (42.3%), outnumbering all Protestant denominations.
‘Symbolic’
Tonge says Catholics outnumbering protestants is the ‘most symbolic’ figure in the census.
When combining current religion with religion of upbringing, 45.7% of the population is ‘Catholic’, while 43.5% are ‘Protestant’.
“Six counties were carved out of Ulster because Protestant unionists at the time didn’t want to risk an insecure 56 to 44% Protestant to Catholic majority within the new state.
“Only six out of nine counties were included deliberately to create a more secure, three to one Protestant to Catholic majority.
“We’ve gone from that, to a two to one Protestant majority, to Catholics now out-numbering Protestants. The sectarian headcount that made up Northern Ireland has now gone,” said Tonge.
Polish is the second most prevalent languages other than English in Northern Ireland and Poland is a predominately Catholic country.
Tonge says there has not been enough research on how Polish people would vote in a constitutional referendum.
He added that there has been a ‘Protestant brain drain’, with “Protestants leaving Northern Ireland, going to universities on this side of the water, and not returning to Northern Ireland”.
While Tonge expects the gap between the Catholic and Protestant population to increase further, he adds that the number of those identifying as having ‘no religion’ will also continue to grow.
However, he added that the there is “still a political basis for Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom” because opinion polls suggest that there’s still a majority that favours Northern Ireland being part of the UK.
“So today is important in symbolic terms, but in terms of changing the constitutional status in Northern Ireland, it’s only a baby step along that road,” opined Tonge.
However, Sinn Féin MP John Finucane said “today’s census results are another clear indication that historic change is happening”.
“There is no doubt change is under way and irreversible,” said the North Belfast MP.
“But we must prepare for it. The Irish government should establish a citizens’ assembly to plan for the possibility of a unity referendum.
“That planning and dialogue and engagement needs to happen now, and it must include people from all backgrounds and communities.”
And while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged that this “seminal moment… should not be downplayed or diminished”, DUP MLA Philip Brett warned the census results should not be interpreted as a “mini-referendum” on the constitutional future.
“To draw political conclusions based on the number of Protestants and Catholics is simplistic and lazy”, said Brett.
‘Ominous’
While Tonge notes the “symbolism” of the census showing Catholics outnumbering Protestants for the first time in the region’s 100-year history, he says the figure of “greatest significance in some ways is the decline in those identifying as British”.
“The British identity is in decline and the voting for unionist parties is in decline. It is pretty ominous for unionism,” said Tonge.
“But there’s still plenty of agnostics or atheists out there who still need persuading of the merits of a United Ireland to get nationalists and Republicans over the line in terms of what they want.”
The numbers of those identifying as having no religion is at 17.4%, a marked increase on the 10.1% in the 2011 census.
Boyd Sleator, co-ordinator of Northern Ireland Humanists, says there’s been a “real terms growth of 81% in the non-religious grouping, the biggest growth in Northern Ireland”.
He suggested that the growth in the Catholic population, which he describes as “very tiny”, is due to immigration from countries like Poland.
Education
Sleator said the schooling system should now reflect the fact that the non-religious grouping is now the second largest in Northern Ireland.

“We have a completely Christian ethos schooling system in Northern Ireland, even the integrated schools have to abide by this legislation,” said Sleator.
He added: “This has now gone through the courts, and it’s been shown that it’s in breach of human rights, so we’re waiting for a final order to come on what should  happen there.”
However, Sleator says he is in favour of some type of religious education within schools, but perhaps under a different heading.
He said he is “100% in favour” of a “broad and plural curriculum, which covers major world beliefs, and those who hold other philosophical worldviews”.
“Some schools do it well, others do not. We don’t really see any inclusion of other world religions or philosophical beliefs until GCSE (Junior Cert).
“So at the minute, it’s not plural, it’s not broad, it’s not inclusive. It’s basically a Christian curriculum.
“A lot of teachers of Religious Education in Northern Ireland come from a Christian faith background, and feel that it’s part of their service and their duty as a Christian person.
“Whereas in England and Wales, you actually see a lot of people from non-religious backgrounds teaching Religious Education.”
Sleator says he is calling for an education system which is “secular in its true sense”.
He describes this as “the inclusion of everybody and no one belief or faith or philosophical worldview getting a privileged position”.
“We’re not turning around and saying, ‘we want non-religious schools, we want you out of our schooling system.’ We’re saying let’s educate us all altogether.”
Sleator argued that this growth in the non-religious grouping should be the “dominant narrative and the biggest talking point”.
“The thing which really shows something different and unusual for a place which has been generally very conservative is this huge growth in non-religious people; one in six people in Northern Ireland are non-religious, that should be the talking point.”
However, Jon Tonge argues that it “cannot be forgotten that it was a religious headcount that set up Northern Ireland, which is why today, in symbolic terms, is seismic”.
Brexit
While the number of people holding British passports in Northern Ireland has dropped slightly from 1.07 million to 1 million, there have been a significant increase in Irish passport holders.
This number of people jointly or solely holding an Irish passport has jumped by 238,500 in the past decade to hit 614,300.
“Even Ian Paisley Jr talked about getting an Irish passport just after Brexit,” Tonge noted.
In a now deleted tweet, Paisley Jr wrote: “My advice is if you are entitled to a second passport, then take one.”
However, Tongue says many people from Protestant and British backgrounds now hold an Irish passport out of mere convenience.
“If you want to avoid the non-EU queues in airports, it’s quite handy to have an Irish passport to breeze through.
“So it’s more-so pragmatic and I don’t read too much into the details of Irish passports.”
But Tonge added: “Once upon a time it would have been anathema to have an Irish passport amongst the unionist population, but now it’s fairly routine”.
‘Northern Irish only’
While there’s been a sizeable decrease in the numbers of people identifying as ‘British only’, now standing at 31.9%, Tonge notes that there hasn’t been a significant rise in the Northern Irish grouping.
This grouping has been described in the census as “broadly stable”, decreasing slightly since the last census to 376,400 people, or 19.8% of the population.
“It’s sort of developed this narrative that people are identifying as this nice, cosy hybrid label ‘Northern Irish’. It’s not true,” said Tonge.
“The Northern Irish label means different things to different people. They tend to be the so called ‘soft unionist’ or ‘soft Irish’.”
“They would be more likely to vote UUP, Alliance or SDLP compared to those with a British identification who will tend to vote DUP.”
He says these ‘Northern Irish only’ cohort will be pivotal in a potential border poll.
“Northern Irish centre-ground voters, they’re the people who will be pivotal in a border poll. We know how unionists or nationalists are going to vote on border poll day.
“What we don’t know is how the ‘neithers’ will vote, and a lot of those ‘neithers’ are those who identify as no religion. A lot of those ‘neithers’ are those who identify as Northern Irish, so they are a really important grouping.
“You can’t just add them on to either those who favour constitutional status quo, or those in favour of a United Ireland. A lot of them are genuine ‘don’t knows’.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/frost-brexit-eu-mistrust-northern-ireland-protocol-5540678-Sep2021/,"THE UK’S BREXIT minister David Frost has said Britain will not sweep away the Northern Ireland Protocol as he warned conflict over the deal risks creating “cold mistrust” with the European Union.
The negotiator of the post-Brexit agreement renewed calls today for Brussels to accept a “substantial and significant change” to the deal that he negotiated.
Northern Ireland is effectively kept in the EU’s single market for goods by the protocol, which prevents a hard border with Ireland but has created trade barriers with Britain.
Unionists have pressured for the abolition of the protocol, but Brussels has repeatedly rejected the UK Government’s plea to negotiate it.

Speaking at the British-Irish Association conference in Oxford, Frost said: “The stakes are high. The arguments can be bitter.
“And I worry this process is capable of generating a sort of cold mistrust between us and the EU which could spread across the relationship.
“It’s holding back the potential for a new era of cooperation between like-minded states in a world which needs us to work together effectively.”
The Conservative politician reiterated the UK’s position that the “threshold” for triggering Article 16 to effectively tear up parts of protocol has been met.
But he added: “Some would like us to sweep all the existing arrangements away. That is not our position.
“It is obvious there will always need to be a dedicated UK-EU treaty relationship covering Northern Ireland. It is a question of finding the right balance.”","6.01pm, 4 Sep 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-panel-to-decide-on-protocol-6011902-Mar2023/,"DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has formed an eight-person group to gauge opinion on the Windsor Framework and report back to him by the end of March.
The agreement, which was published one week ago today, seeks to resolve issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol and will result in the DUP’s return to power-sharing in Stormont if they give their approval.
Donaldson’s group is composed of former DUP leaders and Stormont first ministers Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster, DUP MP Carla Lockhart, DUP House of Lords member Peter Weir, businessman Ross Reed, lawyer John McBurney and DUP MLAs Brian Kingston and Deborah Erskine.
The DUP leader said the group is comprised of individuals with “political, legal and business experience” and its findings are set to inform the party’s decision around the framework.
“But we also want to hear from others as well, key stakeholders across the communities in Northern Ireland, to hear what their views and concerns are, and we will collate all of that information, and that will feed into our ongoing engagement with the Government to ensure that we get clarification on those matters that are less clear and that we are also able to influence what happens next in terms of legislation,” he said.
“I want to be in a position within the current month to come to a view on behalf of the DUP and we will do that collectively as a party.”

Donaldson also said that  having Stormont working again for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month is not a deadline he is working to.
“That is not a factor in my thinking, I am not in fact working to any deadline, I’m saying that what we want to complete our process is analysing and assessment of the framework, get the professional advice that we’ve sought, consult with people, key stakeholders, and then come to a view as a party,” he said.

At Stormont after a plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement,  Ahern said it is “reasonable” for people to seek legal and working clarifications on the agreement.
“I think it is reasonable in a document that is so lengthy and so many legal backgrounds that people will have clarifications, particularly both legal clarifications and working mechanisms,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-ni-protocol-not-sustainable-5455065-Jun2021/,"THE UK’S BREXIT minister David Frost has said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol is not sustainable for long in the form it is currently operating.
Frost also called on the EU to show more “common sense” when dealing with the problems arising from the protocol.
He was in Northern Ireland to meet business and community representatives to discuss the challenges they are facing following the departure from the EU.
A new raft of checks on goods at the ports of Belfast and Larne under the terms of the protocol have sparked anger among unionists who feel Northern Ireland is being separated from the rest of the UK.
Talks are continuing between the EU and the UK government to solve some of the issues, but many unionists have called for it to be scrapped.
Frost said: “It is clear from the conversations we have had with businesses here today that the way the protocol is operating is presenting various challenges. I’ve heard from business groups how some suppliers in GB are beginning to stop sending products into Northern Ireland.

“The protocol relies on cross-community support but this situation does risk undermining that. Our number one priority as the UK Government is protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, north-south and east-west, and that is the top priority of the protocol itself.
“We hope the Commission share that view, although if so they aren’t always as clear about it as they could be.”
Frost added: “The major issue that worries us now is the EU continues to want to treat the regulatory boundary in the Irish Sea as if it were like any other external border, despite the obligations of the protocol to facilitate trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to avoid controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland to the most extent possible.
“We are committed to working through the issues with the EU, to find a way forward and have been doing so intensively for the last few months. We have proposed a range of solutions to the existing problems but progress is limited. We do think the EU needs to show more common sense and pragmatism.
“It is hard to see the protocol as currently operating could be sustainable for long and we continue to consider all other options.”
Meanwhile, DUP leader Edwin Poots’ allegations that the European Union is causing harm to Northern Ireland in the wake of Brexit lacks “adherence to reality”, according to the EU’s ambassador to the UK.
Joao Vale de Almeida dismissed Poots’ claims that the arrangements are having a “devastating impact” and are causing “demonstrable harm to every individual in Northern Ireland”.
The diplomat argued that “there is no alternative” to the NI Protocol, after the DUP leader called for it to be suspended.

Vale de Almeida told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “First of all I don’t think those statements have adherence to reality. The EU is politically, financially and emotionally, I would say, committed to peace and prosperity for everybody in Northern Ireland.
“The protocol is not the problem, Brexit created the problem in Northern Ireland.
“The protocol is a joint endeavour of the UK and the European Union, it is British law, European law, international law, there is no alternative to the protocol.
“Even those that criticise the protocol do not present an alternative which is compatible with the terms of Brexit so the protocol is the solution, we need to implement it and we want to implement it with pragmatism.”

Thomas Byrne, Minister for European Affairs and Fianna Fáil TD for Meath East, said he does not believe the door on resetting talks on Brexit has closed.
He said it is “difficult to know” if Truss or her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak will have a different approach to dealing with issues like the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Polls have so far indicated that Truss is leading the race ahead of Sunak.
Byrne toldNewstalk’s’On The Record’ show that he hopes Truss will be her “own person” when it comes to Brexit issues.
He said: “At the end of the day, the British still have legal obligations, they still have to do what they said they would do.
“It’s no doubt it is in their economic interest and that I think that is becoming clearer all the time. They don’t want a trade war with the EU.
“We certainly don’t want a trade war with Britain.
“But, at the end of the day, they will have to decide not to ratchet things up.”

He also said Truss has previously shown a “pragmatic and open-minded side”.
He added: “I actually don’t think the door for reset is closed.
“Prime ministers, when they take office, naturally take on their own vision of where the job lands.
“I don’t think you can predict what any prime minister will do. I’m not sure that as she gets into the job of prime minister that she will be as unpredictable as Boris Johnson was, because literally you wouldn’t know what would happen week to week.
“I suspect she will set a pattern. And I’d be hopeful that, overall, that pattern will be good, because what’s the Tories are doing at the moment is not winning them electoral success, despite the fact that it appeals to a certain base.
“But it doesn’t appeal to the broad mass of the British public. I think that they will look at this and say, ‘right, where do we have to change tack?’
“I think they need to look at Northern Ireland. They need to look at how the protocol is benefiting Northern Ireland, need to look at how the instability in Northern Ireland which is caused by British government prevarication and how that affects not just Northern Ireland, which it does, but it also affects the image of the British government.
“I think British governments and political parties have done well politically by championing peace because most people like peace, and people will vote for that.
“I think we can ever look at this and I hope that she will.”
Last week, Truss told a Belfast hustings that she would not accept any compromises on a renegotiated Northern Ireland Protocol as prime minister if it meant key UK demands were not met.
“I will not accept anything that does not deliver on the key issues I talked about,” she added.","6.30pm, 21 Aug 2022",

Before Christmas,The Journal/The Good Information Projectreportedthat a shift had taken place in the Irish State’s view of the UK: instead of focusing on relations with Westminster, direct links are being built up with Wales, Scotland, and the north of England.
At meeting in Dublin between Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool mayor Steve Rotheram, the three politicians agreed to further develop the partnership between Ireland and the cities.
The meeting was part of a joint mission to Ireland led by the two mayors, involving business delegations and civic leaders, which is backed by the UK Department of International Trade.

Coveney said: “The development of our partnership with the north of England is a key part of Ireland’s strategy for strengthening relations with Great Britain post-Brexit.
“Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram worked with me on the opening of our Consulate General for the north of England last year and this week’s mission is another important step forward.”
Rotheram said: “Andy and I arrived here with the ambition to lay the foundations to ensure that the latest chapter in our long shared history is a prosperous one. All the conversations we have had so far this week indicate that this feeling is very much mutual.
“The north west has enjoyed a long, successful trading partnership with Ireland.
“There is still so much potential to unlock and we want Ireland to be near the front of that queue.”
Burnham said: “Minister Coveney shares our determination to deepen collaboration and cooperation between our places and this agreement will help us to take that next step forward.”

Maros Sefcovic said the European Union was not “here for political point scoring” after the bloc launched fresh legal action against the UK in retaliation over the Prime Minister’s just laid Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will effectively rip up key parts of the deal signed by Mr Johnson and the EU in 2019.
Sefcovic told Sky News: “I cannot resist the impression that the tabling of the Bill is politically driven, but it’s not our role to comment on internal politics in the UK and therefore our doors for the negotiations will always be open.
“We are here for the results, not political point scoring… We are in a fixing business, but I am afraid to say what was tabled on Monday is very much nixing.
“It is very much ripping up the protocol and I don’t think that is good for anyone.”
In the deal, both sides agreed to put checks on goods, plant and animal products crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The UK has insisted that its unilateral approach is the only option left to resolve the issues “baked in” to the protocol if the EU maintains its refusal to fundamentally rewrite the terms of the deal.

The European Commission vice-president said Brexit difficulties were bleeding into other areas of co-operation.
While he praised “remarkable” EU-UK co-operation on Ukraine and other global challenges, he said it was a “pity that we have to spend so much time” discussing Brexit issues “when we need to build and consolidate this western unity”.
Sefcovic added: “What is indeed very damaging for our relationship is this constant breaching of the international law, and that’s something what we’ve been not used to from the UK.”
The dispute could ultimately lead to a trade war, with tariffs or even the suspension of the entire Brexit deal between the UK and European Union.
Sefcovic declined to rule out a trade war, saying: “We have to keep all options on the table.”
But he emphasised the EU’s preference to find a negotiated resolution to the problems caused by the protocol, lamenting the “radio silence from London since February”.
He added: “We would very much appreciate… more of a political will to work on these issues jointly.”
Asked if the issue can be resolved, he said he would “hope for the best, be prepared for the worst”.

Jeffrey Donaldson told delegates at the DUP conference in Belfast that changes must be secured to the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol, either through renewed talks with the EU or by unilateral action at Westminster.
The DUP is blocking the functioning of the powersharing institutions in Belfast as part of its protest against arrangements that have created barriers on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.PAPAPolitical opponents have heavily criticised the DUP boycott, insisting it is hampering efforts to support families struggling amid the cost-of-living crisis.
The DUP says the economic border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is exacerbating the inflation crisis and underlines the need for action.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by way of a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation that would empower ministers to scrap the arrangements without the approval of Brussels.
There are concerns the latter approach – the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill – could spark a trade war with the EU.
However, relations between the UK and EU appear to have improved since Liz Truss became Prime Minister and both London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for striking a deal through a fresh round of negotiations.

Donaldson told the DUP conference he did not mind whether changes were secured by way of negotiation or unilateral action at Westminster.“The issue of which route is travelled – whether the talks with the EU are successful or whether the Protocol Bill at Westminster becomes law – is not actually the dominant question,” he said. “For us what is important is the destination reached.
“So let me be clear – either the Prime Minister delivers the provisions of the Protocol Bill by legislation or by negotiation and ensures that our place in the United Kingdom is restored or there will be no basis to re-enter Stormont.
“On this issue it is not words but actions we need to see, and we will judge any outcome on the basis of actions not words.”
Donaldson said the issues with the protocol would not simply be resolved by reducing the number of checks on trade, as he insisted the “underlying problem” was the fact Northern Ireland is subject to a set of laws imposed by the EU without local politicians having any influence or say on how those laws operate.
“As Great Britain has secured its freedom to de-regulate or move in a different direction of travel on aid or taxation, Northern Ireland is going to constantly face new barriers because we are tied to a different set of laws,” he said.
“That is simply not sustainable and is incompatible with devolution, which requires the support of unionists as well as nationalists if it is to function.
“For the benefit of those watching in London and Brussels, let me restate our clear commitment.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney has said the “sabre-rattling and grandstanding in Westminster” is unhelpful as the EU and UK engage in talks about the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Speaking toSophy Ridge on Sky Newstoday, Coveney said there would be a “consequence” if the UK walked away from its protocol commitments, but he insisted the EU did not want to issue threats about potential trade wars.
Commenting on the prospect of the UK introducing domestic laws to override the protocol, Coveney warned the British Government against “legislating unilaterally for the concerns of one community in Northern Ireland”.
During the interview Coveney said people in Ireland are frustrated by recent developments.
“I’ve been in these discussions for more than five years now. I have been in negotiations with, I think, four or five different Brexit ministers on behalf of the British Government.
“Let me tell you Ireland is also frustrated. We are dealing with the consequences now of a decision by the British people on our own country that has cost us hundreds of millions of euros, that is risking peace process and its institutions on the island of Ireland.”
Coveney said he understand “the frustrations in the Unionist community” in relation to the protocol.
“I’ve spoken to many Unionists who wants to see pragmatism and real flexibility so that trade within the United Kingdom – in other words, trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland – is not disrupted in any way that is not absolutely necessary.
“And we can get there to a landing zone if we work in partnership. But you know, sabre-rattling and grandstanding in Westminster, ratcheting up tension, is not the way to do it.”
Coveney said he has offered to meet British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to discuss the issue in a bid to make progress.
“This is a problem we need to solve together. The last thing Ireland wants, the last thing the EU needs, is tension with a country the size and the influence of the United Kingdom.”

Coveney also said there is “an impression often across the United Kingdom, that Northern Ireland is deeply unhappy with the protocol, and that a majority of people want it changed”.
“What they want though is pragmatism and flexibility in terms of how it’s implemented. That’s what the EU wants to offer. That’s what Dublin wants to help facilitate. And I hope that’s what the British Government will work with us on in the weeks ahead,” he stated.
Johnson to visit Stormont
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will tomorrow urge Northern Ireland’s politicians to get power-sharing back up and running as the Government seeks to resolve the deadlock with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
British Prime Minister Boris JohnsonPA ImagesPA Images
Johnson will travel to Belfast on Monday for crisis talks after the DUP blocked the election of a Speaker at the Stormont Assembly, preventing it from sitting, due to their concerns about the protocol.
Government sources said Johnson will use a series of private meetings to deliver a “tough message” that any “fix” to the protocol must involve the parties coming together to form an Executive and Assembly.
He is expected to say that while the UK Government will “play its part to ensure political stability”, politicians must “get back to work” so they can deliver on “bread and butter issues” for the voters.
Ahead of his visit, however, Sinn Féin – which is now the biggest party in the Assembly following the elections on 5 May – accused the Johnson of being “in cahoots” with DUP and supporting its “blocking tactics”.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonaldyesterday said: “It is very dangerous, it’s reckless, it’s a game of brinkmanship, very cynically carried out by a Tory government in London that has no care for the island of Ireland, north or south.”
DUP
The DUP is bitterly opposed to the protocol as it requires checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, in order to keep the border with Republic open in line with the Good Friday Agreement.
UK ministers have repeatedly said they will act unilaterally if an agreement cannot be found to reduce the impact of the checks, which have been blamed for hitting businesses and fuelling community tensions.

Before travelling to Northern Ireland, Johnson is today attending the funeral in Abu Dhabi of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
In his talks the party leaders, Johnson is expected to say that while the UK Government “will always keep the door open to genuine dialogue”, there will be “a necessity to act” to protect the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) if there is no change in the EU position.
He will insist the Government has never suggested scrapping the protocol and will acknowledge there will always have to be a treaty governing the UK’s relationship with the EU in respect of Northern Ireland in order to prevent the return of a hard border with the Republic.
However he will say the “delicate balance” of the GFA has been upset, eroding the historic economic bonds linking Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, leaving the unionist community feeling that its aspirations and identity were under threat.
‘Going nowhere’
But speaking on Saturday following a meeting of Sinn Fein’s ruling council in Dublin, McDonald said the UK Government had consistently failed to act in “good faith”.
“Let’s just be clear that the protocol is going nowhere. The protocol is a necessary outworking of Brexit for which the Tory party and the DUP campaigned,” she said.
“The British Government cannot use Ireland as a pawn, we won’t be the collateral damage in the Brexit negotiations.
“It is very clear that the Tory Government in London is in cahoots with the DUP to stall and to hold back progress, to frustrate the will of the people as expressed in the election and that, to anybody who calls themselves a democrat, is clearly unacceptable and clearly shameful.”

Ahern appeared on the podcast, hosted by for Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis, along with journalists Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall, to give his thoughts on the ‘Windsor Framework,’ the post-Brexit deal between the UK and EU to address outstanding issues related to trade involving Northern Ireland.
During his remarks, Ahern noted that the DUP could yet present obstacles to the passing of the Windsor Framework through the Houses of Parliament.
“I’ve no doubt, because I’ve been dealing with unionist negotiators for many years, they will come back with points of clarification, they will come back with points where they want to see what some of the out-workings of some of these issues have been.”
Ahern said we were likely now in for a period of the DUP seeking explanations and clarifications on points within the framework. “There’s no harm in that as long as it doesn’t become a lengthy process,” he said.
Asked whether he thought Boris Johnson would have been able to secure the same deal that incumbent Prime Minister Sunak has agreed with the EU, Ahern said: “I don’t. I think the position that Rishi Sunak took over the past few months has been entirely different to what was going on in the previous few years.”

“There was a sense in the European Union… that the Irish issue was being used to get concessions in other areas. Sunak took a different track, he got into meaningful and substantive discussions early on,” Ahern added.
On the subject of whether or not Brexit has made a unified Ireland more likely, Ahern said: “The reunification issue is straightforward. There will be no constitutional change to the status of Northern Ireland until the people of Northern Ireland vote for that change.”
Ahern has made a spate of media appearances in the last few weeks, launching his own podcast on Newstalk and appearing at a discussion event in the Mansion House to discuss the Good Friday Agreement.
His re-emergence into public life follows his official rejoining of the Fianna Fáil party, and has given rise to speculation that Ahern is considering running for president in 2025.
Ahern is set to receive an honorary doctorate from Dublin City University at a ceremony tomorrow morning, alongside founder of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition Professor Monica McWilliams.
DCU will confer a Doctor of Philosophy (Honoris Causa) on the former Taoiseach for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process. Similar degrees have previously been awarded to other prominent figures from the peace process, including Seamus Mallon, David Trimble, US Senator George Mitchell, and former US President Bill Clinton.
McWilliams, as founder of the NIWC, was a signatory of the Good Friday Agreement. After serving as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in Stormont, McWilliams went on to a role as Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for two terms.

https://www.thejournal.ie/crime-groups-using-irish-common-travel-area-to-bypass-brexit-border-checks-5428752-May2021/,"IRISH AND BRITISH police forces have begun to work together to target the illegal trade in fake documents as Ireland is being used as a backdoor into post-Brexit Britain.
The Journalhas learned that organised crime groups from Georgia and Albania are running a major people-smuggling operation through Ireland for people who desperately want to get into the UK.
Security sources have said that the crime gangs are providing forged Italian and Slovakian identity documentsand, at times, fake British passports to exploit the common travel zone between Ireland and Britain.
This means that people from Albania and Georgia, predominantly, who want to get into the UK but are not able to do so legally, are paying crime groups from that country up to £5,000 to travel first to Ireland on forged identity papers and then, via the common travel area, into the UK.
Britain’s Minister for Immigration Compliance and Justice, Chris Philips, said that UK authorities are set to draft legislation to combat the problem.
The Common Travel Area agreement between both countries was established in 1922 and reaffirmed in 2019.
“This has a Brexit side to it. The free travel across EU borders into UK has been halted so essentially the crime groups are exploiting the Irish/UK common travel area which is in existence since the 1920s,” said a source with knowledge of the situation.
People are being stopped at points of entry such as airports and ports by gardaí and Department of Justice staff, the source said.
Security forces believe that the main motivation for the migrants is economic but it is also allowing some criminal elements scope to move around unchecked.
“Once the fake documents are picked up there are two options: they are refused leave to land and they are immediately returned to the airport they originated from, or they claim asylum and the documents are sent to the Irish documents section for investigation.
“If they are sent back to their country of origin the documents are returned to that country’s authorities in the possession of the captain of the flight and the investigation takes place there. Gardaí then notify the authorities on the other side.

“The aim of all this activity for these people is to get into the UK. That is their biggest aim and border enforcement in Ireland find that it is mostly people from Albania and Georgia. The gang involved in giving the documents will give them pointers on how to get through.
“There is a lot of evidence that the ploy is for them to claim asylum when they are caught and then they disappear by skipping across the border into Northern Ireland,” the source said.
“The people who are coming in would be fairly desperate and they want to get to the UK because they see that as the promised land for them.
“The gangs are charging anything from £500 to £5000,” a source added.
Sources have said that one key failing in the system is the Interpol FIND scanner, which is used to scan passports at entry gates in airports and ports, can only detects documents that have been reported lost or stolen.
“This is a huge issue – it doesn’t detect potential forgeries, that has to be done by the officer at the desk and some of these documents would be very good fakes.
“The new Schengen system, which allows gardaí to communicate and access Europe-wide information, may be able to deal with finding forgeries but law enforcement like this is only as good as the tools they are given.
The recent joint garda and British border enforcement operation where there were arrests in Leeds, Dublin and Wicklowis driven by British authorities who are trying to crack down on this illegal movement post-Brexit, a source explained.
In Aprilthree men were arrestedunder anti-organised crime legislation in raids by Garda National Immigration Bureau detectives on six properties in Dublin and Wicklow. There were simultaneous raids in the UK and it is understood it was initiated by UK intelligence.
British authorities toldThe Journalthat the operation on 28 April was intelligence-led and that they have charged two people in Leeds with possession of fake documents and entering the country via Ireland.
Chris Philip, the British Minister for Immigration Compliance and Justice, said that UK authorities are bringing in new laws to combat the problem.
“We are determined to go after the callous people who facilitate illegal entry into the UK. We continue to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those who carry out these illegal acts are put before the courts and face justice.
“As part of the New Plan for Immigration announced by the Home Secretary recently we proposed increased sentences in the UK for the facilitation of illegal entry to act as a further deterrent to these criminals,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/windsor-framework-westminster-vote-6015023-Mar2023/,"WESTMINSTER MPS ARE set to vote on the Brexit deal on trading arrangements for Northern Ireland by the end of the month, a minister has suggested.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the vote in Parliament would likely be within the next two to three weeks.
Heaton-Harris was commenting as he visited businesses in the region to promote the Windsor Framework struck by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the EU.
The framework will reduce the volume of paperwork required for the movement of goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland that was created by the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.
It also introduces a mechanism – the so-called Stormont brake – that enables a minority of Stormont MLAs to formally flag concerns about the imposition of new EU laws in Northern Ireland in a move that could ultimately lead to the UK Government vetoing their introduction.
The DUP, which collapsed powersharing in Northern Ireland in protest at the protocol, has yet to decide whether to back the Windsor Framework and return to devolution.
Sunak has promised that MPs would get a say on the deal he sealed with Brussels and Mr Heaton-Harris said that moment should come by the end of the month.
On a visit to a garden centre on the outskirts of Belfast, he told reporters: “There’s some European processes that also are happening. So, the European Parliament have its say on this, I believe, next week, and then I think there’s one more stage in the European political sphere for it to go through, so that’ll be in the next two or three weeks.
“We will be having a vote in Parliament on a similar timetable.”
Heaton-Harris said further detail would be provided in the coming weeks on how the Stormont brake would work. He said that technical talks on the mechanism had been held with the Stormont political parties.
“What I think we’re going to do is actually publish a statutory instrument in the next couple of weeks that will demonstrate what we say it’s going to do, it will do,” he said.
“So, the mechanism by which it can be triggered, and when it is triggered, what that means for the Government.
“What we think it means, and what is shown in legislation, is that when the brake is pulled – because a piece of EU law, that may be amending something, a new piece of legislation that would affect the 3% of EU law that remains applicable in Northern Ireland – well, if it’s pulled, then it is disapplied immediately on the brake being pulled.
“It goes to the joint committee where the UK Government will be bound to veto based on the conditions that you’ve seen in the papers we’ve published, but we’re trying to make sure that people can see it in black and white, so they understand exactly what it is.”
Pressed on whether the Government was bound to veto a law if the brake was pulled, he added: “So the criteria really have to be fulfilled at the Assembly level, and yeah, we make an assessment, but in the piece of secondary legislation that we’ll be bringing forward, the Government will be bound, yeah,” he said.

Earlier this week, the DUP established a consultation panel to inform its deliberations on the new deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Former DUP leaders and first ministers Peter Robinson and Baroness Arlene Foster are among those on the eight-member panel announced by current leader Jeffrey Donaldson.
Donaldson has made it clear that the DUP will take its time to consider the framework before deciding whether to back it and lift its current blockade of devolution at Stormont.
The panel will report to him by the end of March – a timeline broadly in line with the suggested vote in Parliament.
Heaton-Harris said he was “hopeful” that the DUP panel would see that the framework could “alleviate a huge amount of issues”.
“I’m hopeful that the panel will see what we’ve done for what it is, which is alleviate a huge amount of the issues that were being caused by the protocol,” he said.
“We are giving people – you’ve heard the Prime Minister say only last week – we are giving people plenty of time and space to look at these.
“We’re not bouncing people into anything at all. We want people to examine what we’ve put forward so people know exactly what they’re getting.”
During his visit to the Hillmount Garden Centre in the Castlereagh Hills outside Belfast, the Secretary of State was pressed on some of the intricacies of the framework.
He insisted that all plants and trees, including species like dogwood and cherry trees, would be able to be ordered from Great Britain to Northern Ireland without issue.
“It’s going to be straightforward,” he said.
“If a plant is grown in GB, whether it’s got soil attached to it … it would have to have a GB plant passport, but that’s plants that are grown in my constituency in Northamptonshire, in the middle of England, moving to Leicestershire would have a plant passport. It costs about 12 quid per type of plant, not per seed batch.
“That’s it. It can come across. So, yeah, there is no more to it, no less to it, than that. And that’s why we need to explain it better.”
He conceded there was a need to provide more explanation about the broader deal, saying current scepticism around it was understandable.
“We’ve got to explain it more. We are talking to businesses or politicians, we’re talking to anybody, trying to explain as best we can what the processes will be,” he said.
“It’s one of the reasons why we have published everything, and we’re publishing everything as quick as we can, and giving people time to prepare, time and space to look at it.
“I think people are sceptical and I can quite understand why – that politicians standing up say one thing, but it’s not deliberate, I’m quite sure that what the Prime Minister has described, what I’ve described, is actually what it is.”","8.10pm, 9 Mar 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/protocol-agreement-christmas-unrealistic-coveney-5617600-Dec2021/,"THE MINISTER FOR Foreign Affairs has said reaching an agreement on the Northern Ireland Protocol before Christmas is “unrealistic”.
Simon Coveney was speaking in London ahead of meetings with Brexit minister Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.
He suggested an agreement could be found in some areas, such as the flow of medicines into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

“I don’t think there’ll be a full deal on all issues related to the protocol before Christmas. I think that would be unrealistic at this stage,” he told RTE News.
“But I think some things can be agreed this side of Christmas, hopefully, as I say, giving certainty to people in Northern Ireland in terms of the supply of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.”
Talks aimed at resolving the impasse over the protocol are continuing.
The post-Brexit trading arrangements have helped to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, but have created regulatory barriers in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Coveney called on the EU and the UK to step up efforts to find a solution.

He said: “While that progress is possible, it’s important to encourage both sides to try to find landing zones and compromise positions on important issues, in particular on the guarantee of supply of medicines into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which is something that I know both teams have been trying to resolve in recent weeks, and hopefully we can make progress on soon.
“Certainly the EU is very anxious to move that issue on, and they believe that they have a solution that hopefully can work for the British side as well.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeffrey-donaldson-dup-northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-5547458-Sep2021/,"DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has said he fears unrest on the streets of Northern Ireland over the Brexit protocol.
Donaldson was speaking after warning his party’s ministers will resign from the Stormont Executive if changes to the protocol are not delivered by November.
Earlier this year, there was significant disorder with loyalist anger at the protocol forming a border in the Irish Sea blamed.
Donaldson said he fears a return to that.
“The protocol is creating significant political instability,” he told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast.
“Earlier in the year we had people back out on the streets again.
“There was civil unrest, there was violence on the streets.
“I don’t want that to happen, I want Northern Ireland to be peaceful, prosperous, stable but I’m worried that if this protocol continues and people become more fearful about the future, then again we will see people back out on the streets, and that is not good because it has the potential for further unrest.
“We need the peace process to deliver for Northern Ireland, to deliver prosperity for everyone in Northern Ireland and right now this protocol is getting in the way of that.”
He added: “Right now the future of the union is threatened by this protocol and I hope the UK government will do the right thing and honour the commitments they have already given to resolve these issues.”
If politics fails and if we don’t find the solutions then I fear that there will be others who may decide to step into the gap

Donaldson aid he has been urging all summer against violence on the streets.
“I have been saying to the boys on the streets is ‘please don’t be on the streets’, and you will note that all summer Northern Ireland has been peaceful,” he said.
“That didn’t happen by coincidence, that happened because people like me, my political colleagues and community leaders worked hard and persuaded people that politics is the way to resolve these issues, not street protests.
“But I’m simply saying that if politics fails and if we don’t find the solutions then I fear that there will be others who may decide to step into the gap.
“I don’t want that to happen so I am committed to finding political solutions and I want to do that quite quickly.”
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
It achieves that by moving many of the checks and processes required on goods to the Irish Sea.
Under the arrangements, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods and continues to apply EU customs rules.
Unionists in Northern Ireland have been vehemently opposed to its terms which see additional checks on goods arriving to the region from the rest of the UK.
Donaldson has said the Government committed to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market in the New Decade, New Approach agreement which restored Stormont after a three-year suspension.
“All I am asking the Government to do is to is honour New Decade, New Approach, honour that agreement, honour the basis upon which devolution was restored, do the right thing and protect our place within the UK because that is what the people of Northern Ireland actually want,” he said.
He also contended the basis of devolution will be “undermined” unless New Decade New Approach is honoured.
“I am not afraid to go to the country, I’m not afraid to go to the people and say, ‘this is what I believe and I’m asking you to support the stance that we are taking’, and that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in a democracy,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donaldson-stormont-5544566-Sep2021/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2021
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said Europe wants to find a “solution” on the Northern Ireland Protocol disupte after the DUP leader said the party would collapse Stormont unless it is resolved.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson threatened earlier today that his party will bring down the Stormont institutions “within weeks”, forcing an election if issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol are not addressed.
This afternoon, Martin said that Europe is in “solution mode” and wants to work hard within the existing arrangement to make the protocol work for the people of Northern Ireland”,
Speaking to reporters at the Fianna Fáil think-in in Co Cavan, Martin said that “from our perspective, the issue now is can we make this work”.
“What’s clear is all parties would like to see streamlining and more flexible operation of the protocol and that’s what we’re going to work on,” the Taoiseach said.
“It’s no secret that I’m passionately committed to maintaining the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and their full operation in all aspects north and south,” he said.
Martin said the DUP’s assertion that it will collapse the Executive if changes aren’t delivered has “created new challenges”.
“I met with the [European Commission] vice-president Maros Sefcovic last evening, we had a very good comprehensive discussion,” the Fianna Fail leader said.
Jeffrey Donaldson
In a speech in Belfast earlier today, Donaldson said the political, economic, and constitutional difficulties created by the protocol threaten prosperity in Northern Ireland and the quality of its status within the United Kingdom.
He said the constitutional guarantee which has underpinned political progress in Northern Ireland has been “fundamentally undermined by the protocol”.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland. It achieves that by moving many of the checks and processes required on goods to the Irish Sea.
Under the arrangements, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods and continues to apply EU customs rules.
“Within weeks it will become clear if there is a basis for the Assembly and Executive to continue in this current mandate, and I want that to happen,” Donaldson said.

“But, equally, we will also need to consider whether there is a need for an Assembly election to refresh our mandate if action is not taken to address and resolve the issues related to the protocol and its impact, its damaging impact on Northern Ireland each and every day.”

Donaldson today also announced his party’s immediate withdrawal from north/south political structures established under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
These institutions include the North–South Ministerial Council (NSMC) and the North–South Implementation Bodies.
While Donaldson said the DUP was withdrawing from north/south political bodies he said his party would seek to ensure continued cross-border co-operation on health issues.
Ahead of any move to pull ministers out of the coalition administration, Donaldson said his party was first seeking to challenge the legality of checks on Britain to Northern Ireland trade introduced under the protocol and establish whether their implementation requires the approval of the Stormont Executive.
Donaldson said ministers would also seek to use their votes at the Stormont Executive to block the implementation of any additional checks at Northern Ireland ports when ongoing grace periods end.
He said the DUP would also oppose the passage of regulations at Stormont required to reflect any changes to EU law applying in Northern Ireland.
“It has been said before, but it will be the policy of the DUP to seek to frustrate and prevent such alignment. We cannot and will not accept a situation where we are required to endorse and implement EU laws, whilst having no say in how those laws are formulated,” he said.
“The Northern Ireland protocol requires certain aspects of EU law to apply in Northern Ireland but this can only happen if they are incorporated into Northern Ireland law.
“Over time a failure to incorporate such law will mean that Northern Ireland will increasingly diverge from EU law and would ultimately undermine the operation of the EU Single Market.”
Europe
European Commission vice-president Maros  has called on politicians to “dial down the rhetoric” over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The vice-president is in Northern Ireland for a two-day visit in which he will meet with business leaders and politicians to discuss issues with the implementation of the protocol, which has created trading barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Sefcovic, who is due to meet Donaldson this afternoon, said his “message will be ‘let’s work on the concrete problems’.”
“Let’s focus on the issues which are the most important for the people of Northern Ireland, let’s be constructive, let’s dial down the political rhetoric, let’s bring calm and focus on what is our task to accomplish,” he said.

“I came here to listen, to learn what are the concrete problems that the people of Northern Ireland are facing with the implementation of the protocol.
“But I am also here to talk about opportunities the protocol is bringing, especially to the economy and of course the people of Northern Ireland, and I am starting with the business representatives.”
Responding to the DUP leader’s comments, Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the government takes unionist concerns in relation to the protocol seriously.
Coveney said the Taoiseach and Tánaiste met with Jeffrey Donaldson to discuss these issues in detail in the last two weeks.
“However, no positive agenda is served by blocking practical north/south cooperation or by the breakdown of the other institutions of the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.
Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the withdrawal of DUP ministers from north-south political bodies would also be a clear breach of the ministerial code at Stormont.
“The position set out by Jeffrey Donaldson and the DUP today is a reckless, irresponsible and short-sighted election stunt,” she said.
“They are threatening the stability of the political institutions when we are in the midst of the Covid pandemic, when the Tories are putting families and workers under pressure with more cuts, and when there is big work to do on the issues that matter to people’s everyday lives – on hospital waiting lists, on schools, on housing and on jobs, and on rebuilding our economy.”
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood has said that the threat to devolution and the North-South institutions serves no community in Northern Ireland.
“People across Northern Ireland are sick of being held to ransom by political parties that put their own narrow self-interest above the interests of our communities and I do not believe that devolution could sustain another self-inflicted wound like this. Whether it’s the DUP or Sinn Féin, this behaviour has risked fatally damaging public confidence in politicians and the political process,” he said.
Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said his party will “provide pragmatic solutions and engagement while the DUP will provide threats leading to instability and further harming our people here in Northern Ireland”.
“I certainly won’t be asking my party to withdraw from the Executive when we are still dealing with a Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences on a health service which is facing challenges on an unprecedented scale. We simply cannot afford to have the Stormont institutions collapse and the people, not least those hundreds of thousands on waiting lists, won’t thank us for it.”

THE GOOD INFORMATION Project is looking at the progress of Brexit, posing the question – a year into Ireland’s post-Brexit relationship with Britain,what can we expect in 2022?

We picked this topic this month after all of the discussion on whether or not Boris Johnson’s government was going to triggerArticle 16.
It’s beginning to look increasingly likely that after five years of debating what Brexit should look like in practice, these regular public disagreements between the EU and the UK are just how things will always be from now on.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-dublin-port-cargo-5584225-Oct2021/,"BREXIT HAS BEEN cited as the main reason for a drop-off in the volume of cargo moving through Dublin Port through the first nine months of the year.
Although the number of containers and trailers travelling through the port was down just 0.5% in the period, overall cargo volumes — measured in gross tonnes — fell by 3.3% in the nine months to the end of September compared with the same period last year.
A 5.4% decline was observed in the third quarter of the year alone.
The drop is mainly due to a steep 21% decline in trade with ports in Great Britain in the first nine months of the year, according to the Dublin Port Company in a statement.
Trade with European ports, meanwhile, has increased by 36% this year as businesses increasingly look to bypass the UK landbridge to Europe by trading with the continent directly.
The switch means that trade with Great Britain now accounts for just over half of the units moving through Dublin Port. Before Brexit, that figure was closer to two-thirds.
“After nine months, the impact of Brexit on the profile of Dublin Port’s trade has become clear,” said Dublin Port Company chief executive Eamonn O’Reilly in a statement.
Advertisement
“The movement of Irish trade to EU markets and away from the UK has also had the effect of reducing the number of trailers that move through Dublin Port which are driver-accompanied.”
It means that “nearly 60,000 loads which would have been driver-accompanied before Brexit were shipped as unaccompanied trailers”, which is “bad news from a port capacity perspective” he said.
Meanwhile, the difference in “trade patterns” between the European Union and the United Kingdom is “creating capacity pinch points” in parts of the port, O’Reilly added.
“We currently have two shipping lines looking to commence services in Dublin which cannot be accommodated,” he said.
“To remove these capacity pinch points, we need to continue our capital investment programme to increase port capacity in the short-term.”
This, O’Reilly said, will include moving the four remaining empty freight container depots in the port to the new Dublin Inland Port, which is due to open next month.
The inland port — located 14km away from Dublin Port itself — is one of three major infrastructural projects the company is undertaking as part of its 2040 ‘Masterplan’.
The aim of the plan is to double the existing port’s capacity to 77 million tonnes.
O’Reilly said, “Looking to the longer-term, we are progressing with the 3FM Project — the third and final Masterplan project required to bring Dublin Port to its ultimate capacity by 2040 — and will shortly commence public consultation before we start into detailed design and environmental impact analysis.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-concerned-for-tourist-ni-visa-scheme-6025232-Mar2023/,"A NEW UK visa waiver scheme will create problems for tourism on the island of Ireland, the Taoiseach has warned.
Leo Varadkar raised concerns about the implications of the new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) on the tourist trade.
The scheme, which is similar to the visa waiver system used in the US, will see short-term non-visa visitors to the UK applying for an ETA and providing biometric data.
Irish citizens will not need an ETA to travel to Northern Ireland as they already have guaranteed free movement under the terms of the Common Travel Area.
The scheme as originally set out would have meant non-Irish EU citizens and other international passport holders, including those living permanently south of the border, would have had to apply for the visa waiver.
Varadkar said the ETA creates an unwelcome problem for the tourism industry on the island of Ireland
Earlier this month, the UK Government updated its plans and confirmed non-Irish citizens living legally in the state will not need a waiver.
But it appears tourists will not be offered such an exemption, meaning foreign visitors arriving in the Republic of Ireland are set to need an ETA to travel across the border into Northern Ireland.

The visa waiver system will be introduced on a phased basis from the end of the year.
Varadkar voiced concerns as he answered questions in the Dáil today.
“We are in touch with the UK authorities about the ETA, the new electronic transit authorisation,” he said.
“Irish citizens, UK citizens and people permanently resident in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland will be exempt from that but I think it could cause problems for tourists, particularly tourists who don’t need a visa to come here, so tourists from other parts of the European Union who might come to Dublin or Cork or some part of this jurisdiction who would then need to get the electronic authorisation to travel north.”
“It’s not going to be a hard thing to do but it’s an additional barrier and not something that’s welcome.
“Certainly when I was tourism minister working with my counterpart at the time, Arlene Foster, we would have really sold the idea that people can visit Ireland and can visit any part of Ireland and why not take a day trip from Dublin to the Causeway Coast or why not fly into Belfast and travel south.
“That’s going to be more complicated now and we’ll have to explain to potential tourists coming to the island of Ireland that there’s this new complication.
“And it’s just an additional complication that I think we could do without unfortunately.
“So we’ll continue to work on the British government on that issue and see if we can get further changes.”","8.01pm, 21 Mar 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-trade-full-implementation-hysterical-5376600-Mar2021/,"ARLENE FOSTER HAS branded the European Commission’s reaction to the UK move to delay full implementation of new Irish trading arrangements as “hysterical”.
The UK government last week unilaterally extended grace periods limiting bureaucracy linked to the Northern Ireland Protocol until October. They had been due to expire at the end of March.
The UK also temporarily lifted the protocol’s ban on plants potted in soil in Great Britain from entering Northern Ireland.
The European Commission is preparing to take legal action against the UK government, accusing it of breaching the terms of the protocol, which governs trade to Northern Ireland post-Brexit.
Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster expressed confidence the government would defend any legal action brought by the commission.
“As I understand it from the Secretary of State [Brandon Lewis] last week, the Attorney General has indicated that the small moves that were made by the United Kingdom Government are legal and therefore any legal action that will be taken I’m sure will be fought,” she said.

“I hope that doesn’t end up being the case. I think there has been a bit of a hysterical reaction actually to some very small moves.
“You know the position of my party. We believe that we need to see the protocol replaced because it’s the architecture of the protocol which is causing all of these difficulties.”
Foster said she did not detect a willingness from the Commission to engage with the UK government to resolve issues related to the protocol.
“I don’t see any evidence of any negotiations ongoing at this present moment in time. I see a lot of megaphone diplomacy actually,” she said.
“It would be really good if there were some listening ears for a change, in relation to the damage that is happening here in Northern Ireland, from the European Union, and there was a real and tangible engagement in relation to the problems that we have.”
Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill called for an end to political wrangling over the protocol.
O’Neill said the issues needed to be resolved through the joint UK/EU committee that has responsibility for the implementation of the post-Brexit Irish Sea trading arrangements.
“What needs to happen here is that we need to see clarity for the business community, we don’t need to see more wrangling. We need the joint committee to meet, we need an agreed way forward,” she said.

“That’s in the best interest of people here.”
The ministers were asked about the ongoing discord over the protocol on a visit to a vaccination centre on the outskirts of Belfast.
The protocol is a post-Brexit arrangement designed to keep the Irish border open by ensuring Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU’s trading rules.
It achieves that by keeping Northern Ireland aligned to various EU rules, requiring checks on goods arriving into the region from Great Britain.
The DUP has vowed to overthrow it over fears it damages the integrity of the UK internal market and NI’s place in it.
Last week the UK government unilaterally extended grace periods that currently limit regulatory checks on imports of agri-food retail goods and customs declarations on Great Britain parcels sent to the region.
It also moved to lift a prohibition on imports of GB soil to Northern Ireland.

THE EU AND the UK have struck a deal to revise the Northern Ireland Protocol arrangement, possibly ending one of Brexit’s most vexing puzzles.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen appeared together in Windsor this afternoon to copper-fasten the agreement.
Von der Leyen then met with Britain’s King Charles. This meeting, approved by Downing Street, has raised the ire of some Tories and unionists.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said that “significant progress” has been made in the new Northern Ireland Protocol deal, but said that “there remain key issues of concern”. The DUP has, to date, been boycotting Stormont over the Protocol.
27 Feb 20238:01PMThat’s all from us on the liveblog this evening. Thanks for sticking with our coverage throughout the day.If you’re just catching up on the news of the day now, this will be of use:Here’s what we know about the Windsor Framework so far27 Feb 20238:00PMTaoiseach Leo Varadkar this evening said the Windsor Framework was reached today as trust had been built upon and Europe made concessions.You can catch up on his comments and the reaction from other politicians here.27 Feb 20237:50PMBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaking in the House of CommonsAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoResponding to Donaldson in the Commons, Sunak has said he believes the agreement secures Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.He referenced concerns some in the unionist community had with the protocol, and said: “I believe very strongly that the Windsor Framework does resolve those issues.“But I appreciate that the right honourable gentleman and his party and other unionist communities will want to take the time to consider the detail.“And I respect that, and we will give them the time and the space to consider that, and stand ready to answer any questions and provide any clarifications.”He added: “I believe that this agreement … does ensure the free flow of trade within our United Kingdom internal market, including unfettered access for Northern Ireland producers to the rest of the United Kingdom. I do believe it secures Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.”Sunak said: “It ensures and safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland.”27 Feb 20237:46PMJeffrey Donaldson has sought an assurance in the Commons that the application of EU law would not put barriers in the way of trading with the rest of the UK.“Ultimately, my party will now assess all these proposed outcomes and arrangements against our seven tests,” he said, adding “and whether it respects and restores Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom.”27 Feb 20237:39PMDonaldson told the Commons: “Our judgment and principal position in opposing the protocol in Parliament and at Stormont, I believe has been vindicated.He said: “Undoubtedly it is now recognised that the protocol does not work. And when others said there could be no renegotiation and no change, it was our determination that has proven what can be achieved.”He added: “In broad terms, it is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas, whilst also recognising that there remain key issues of concern.“There can be no disguising the fact, for example, that in some sectors of our economy in Northern Ireland EU law remains applicable in our part of the United Kingdom.”He said his party would want to “study the detail” of what has been published as well as examining “the legal text, the political declaration and the Government’s command paper”.He added: “Where necessary we stand ready to engage with the Government in order to seek further clarification, reworking or change as required.”27 Feb 20237:20PMDUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson addressing the House of Commons this eveningScreengrab / Sky NewsScreengrab / Sky News / Sky NewsAddressing the House of Commons, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson says his party’s opposition to the protocol has been vindicated.“It is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas while also recognising there remain key issues of concern.”Donaldson says the DUP will analyse the deal to determine whether it meets the party’s seven tests.27 Feb 20237:06PMParliament Buildings, Stormont, BelfastAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoDowning Street said it would not be helpful to speculate on the restoration of Stormont, after the agreement of the Windsor Framework.“I don’t think it would be helpful for us to start speculating on the restoration of the executive at this point. I think that first and foremost that is a question for them,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.“There is now an important choice for all parties in Northern Ireland, given we feel this creates the right conditions, but obviously it is a question for them.”Downing Street said not all elements of the deal require Stormont to be sitting to be implemented.27 Feb 20237:01PM“I have been clear for some time that if the Prime Minister were to get agreement with the EU and if that agreement is in the interests of this country and Northern Ireland, then Labour would support it,” Starmer says.“And we will stick to our word. We will not snipe. We will not seek to play political games.”Labour will support the deal if it is put to a vote, Starmer confirms.“The protocol will never be perfect. It is a compromise.“But I have always been clear that, if implemented correctly, it is an arrangement that can work in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.“And that now it has been agreed, we all have an obligation to make it work.”27 Feb 20236:58PMScreengrab / Sky NewsScreengrab / Sky News / Sky NewsLabour leader Keir Starmer is now addressing the House of Commons.27 Feb 20236:57PMThe ban on British sausages entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain has been scrapped thanks to the Windsor Framework, Sunak told MPs in the Commons.He said if the Northern Ireland Protocol was implemented in full, “we would see supermarket lorries needing hundreds of certificates for every individual item, every single document checked, supermarket staples like sausages banned altogether”.“More delays, more cost, less choice. So today’s agreement fixes all this with a new, permanent legally binding approach to food.”The Prime Minister later added: “Under the protocol, retail food products made to UK standards could not be sold in Northern Ireland. Today’s agreement completely changes that. This means the ban on British products like sausages entering Northern Ireland has now been scrapped.“If it’s available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, then it will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland.”27 Feb 20236:56PMSpontaneous laughter erupts in the Commons as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pays tribute to his predecessors for ""laying the foundation for today's agreement"" between the UK and the EU.Politics live:https://t.co/WUnquWvHqf📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTubepic.twitter.com/dpgoHY0eHR— Sky News (@SkyNews)February 27, 2023Sunak faced down laughter in the Commons as he opened his speech by paying tribute to his predecessors.Rishi Sunak told MPs: “I pay tribute to our European friends for recognising the need for change, particularly President (Ursula) von der Leyen, my predecessors for laying the groundwork for today’s agreement…”The British Prime Minister was then interrupted by laughter from the opposition benches, as one Labour MP could be heard shouting: “Where’s Boris?”Sunak continued: “And my friends the foreign and Northern Ireland secretaries for their perseverance in finally persuading the EU to do what it spent years refusing to do, to rewrite the treaty and replace it with a radical, legally binding new framework.”27 Feb 20236:55PMSunak told the Commons that the Windsor Framework “permanently removes the border in the Irish Sea”.“The commitment to establish the green lane is achieved by a legally binding amendment to the text of the treaty itself. This is fundamental, far-reaching change and it permanently removes the border in the Irish Sea,” Sunak said.Laying out some of the detail in the deal on border checks, Sunak said: “The only checks will be those required to stop smugglers and criminals and our new green lane will be open to a broad, comprehensive range of businesses across the United Kingdom.“I am pleased to say we have also permanently protected tariff-free movement of all types of steel into Northern Ireland, and for goods going the other way from Northern Ireland to Great Britain we have scrapped export declarations, delivering finally completely unfettered trade.”27 Feb 20236:54PMRishi Sunak addressing the House of CommonsScreengrab / Sky NewsScreengrab / Sky News / Sky NewsBack to Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons.“After weeks of negotiations, today we have made a decisive breakthrough. The Windsor Framework delivers free-flowing trade within the whole UK,” Sunak told MPs.“It protects Northern Ireland’s place in our Union and it safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland. By achieving all this it preserves the delicate balance inherent in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“It does what many said could not be done, removing thousands of pages of EU laws, and making permanent legally binding changes to the protocol treaty itself. That is the breakthrough we have made, those are the changes we will deliver and now is the time to move forward as one United Kingdom.”Sunak was cheered by his own backbenchers on entering the chamber, with some waving order papers.27 Feb 20236:46PMWhen asked what was difference about Sunak’s handling of negotiations compared to his predecessors, Varadkar said that “a lot of trust” has been build up betwen Ursula von der Leyen and the British Prime Minister.He added “the fact that things were done very quietly behind the scenes and negotiations were kept confidential” made a difference.27 Feb 20236:41PMTaoiseach Leo Varadkar says he appreciates that some people will need time to give careful consideration to the Windsor framework.“I hope that when they do, they’ll be able to give it their full support and that it will lead to an early restoration of the assembly and executive.”27 Feb 20236:40PMTaoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government buildings this eveningSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ieSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie“I firmly believe that the people in Northern Ireland don’t want to return to the divisions of the past. They want to make progress together. They want a shared future,” the Taoiseach says.“Like people everywhere, they want political institutions to sort out the issues that matter most in their daily lives. The state of the health service, cost of living crisis, housing and the economy.”27 Feb 20236:39PMVaradkar says the deal, if implemented, will bring “stability and certainty to a situation that has been in flux” since the UK voted to leave the EU.27 Feb 20236:38PMVaradkar says there is “no doubt that Brexit has been disruptive to the lives of people on these islands, especially so in Northern Ireland”.“While the protocol exists to minimise that disruption, to prevent a hard border between North and South and to ensure free movement and free trade between North and South, its operation has resulted in some problems for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. And it has made trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, more complicated there needs to be,” he says.“Today’s agreement provides solutions, solutions that are … workable and durable.”27 Feb 20236:36PMTaoiseach Leo Varadkar entering the courtyard of Government buildings this eveningSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ieSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie“Today’s announcement is a positive outcome in negotiations on the protocol between the European Union and the United Kingdom and it is most welcome,” Varadkar says.“It is a result of long and long protracted process to find joint solutions. And I pay tribute to both teams who’ve worked very hard in good faith to bring us to this point,” he says.27 Feb 20236:35PMTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is speaking outside Government Buildings now.We’ll provide updates on this first and then return to the developments in the House of Commons.27 Feb 20236:32PMRishi Sunak has begun addressing the House of Commons.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressing the House of Commons this eveningScreengrab / Sky NewsScreengrab / Sky News / Sky News27 Feb 20236:29PMBritish Prime Minister Rishi SunakAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoRishi Sunak told his Cabinet in a virtual meeting that he believes “with his head and his heart” that the Windsor Framework is a “good deal for everyone in Northern Ireland”.The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Prime Minister said the Government had achieved something very special with the Windsor Framework.“He said they had secured what many said was impossible, making legally binding changes to the protocol treaty itself.“The Prime Minister concluded Cabinet by saying the protocol had been causing significant problems for communities and businesses and that he passionately believed with his head and his heart that the new agreement was a good deal for everyone in Northern Ireland.”27 Feb 20236:27PMFormer First Minister of Northern Ireland Ian Paisley has accused Sunak of overpromising and underdelivering with the Windsor Framework, Sky News is reporting.Paisley has reportedly said the deal “doesn’t go far enough”, adding he is unhappy about the role of the European Court of Justice in Northern Irish law.27 Feb 20236:24PM“Today is about preserving the delicate balance of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and charting a new way forward for the people of Northern Ireland,” Sunak has tweeted.Agreement signed.Today is about preserving the delicate balance of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and charting a new way forward for the people of Northern Ireland.— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak)February 27, 202327 Feb 20236:09PMBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to address the House of Commons at around 6.30pm.27 Feb 20236:00PMSome further reaction from DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson on the deal – he says there are still some areas of concern that have to be looked at.Responding to the new Windsor Framework, leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP says there are still some issues of concern that still need to be looked at.https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTubepic.twitter.com/SQF7ln0sDG— Sky News (@SkyNews)February 27, 202327 Feb 20235:34PMFile photo - Alliance leader Naomi LongAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoAlliance leader Naomi Long has said she would like to examine the details of the deal.“We’ve been very clear from the beginning what our expectations would be, we would want to still maintain dual market access, that’s important for businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said.“We also want to see a reduction in the amount of bureaucracy that the protocol creates, particularly for those who are importing goods from GB into Northern Ireland.“We’re also looking for stability because businesses are telling us very clearly that what they want are stable outcomes.“If we have that stability and clarity, and we maintain dual market access but with a reduction in bureaucracy, then I think that that’s a good deal.”27 Feb 20235:26PMFor those who are just catching up on the news, let’s take another quick look at the main points in the new deal…Green lane / Red laneAnything destined for Northern Ireland will travel there as part of a “green lane”, with significantly fewer checks. Anything that could cross the border and enter the EU’s single market will travel through a separate red lane.Sunak said that the changes to the protocol will scale back the number of certificates required for traders moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with customs paperwork removed too for people sending parcels or buying goods online.He indicated changes to the movement of food too, claiming that anything made to UK rules will now be clear to be “sent to and sold” in NI. That will include sausages, one of the foodstuffs hit by protocol changes and which grabbed the attention of politicians in Belfast and Westminster alike.VATThe legal text of the protocol has also been amended on VAT. Under current arrangements, EU VAT and excise rules for goods generally apply in Northern Ireland.Sunak said that would now change, with the legal text of the protocol amended to allow the UK Government to “make critical VAT and excise changes for the whole of the UK”.MedicineThere will be a “landmark” settlement on medicines. Drugs approved for use by the UK’s medicines regulator will be automatically available in all pharmacies and hospitals in the North.Stormont brakeThere will now be a “Stormont brake”.This allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to flag concerns about changes to EU rules that would have a “significant and lasting” effect.He said that if pulled, the UK Government will have a “veto”.27 Feb 20235:15PMThe meeting between King Charles III and Ursula von der Leyen has raised some eyebrows about the monarch’s intrusion into politics.British royal commentator Peter Hunt said of the meeting between the British King and von der Leyen: “This is a very serious error of judgment by King Charles and his advisers.”The former BBC royal correspondent tweeted: “He’s abandoned his unifying role and entered the political fray, in a foolish bid to be seen as statesmanlike.“History won’t be kind. Someone’s head will roll.”This is a very serious error of judgement by King Charles and his advisors.He’s abandoned his unifying role and entered the political fray, in a foolish bid to be seen as statesmanlike.History won’t be kind.

That veto can only be challenged through independent arbitration mechanisms, not the ECJ – removing the ultimate authority of the ECJ in areas in which it would affect day-to-day lives.“The result is that EU laws will apply only where strictly necessary to provide privileged access to the whole of the EU market under a new legal framework of democratic consent and control. And we will underpin this new framework through amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to provide constitutional and democratic guarantees for the people of Northern Ireland.”27 Feb 20234:52PMSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said that her party will meet tonight to discuss the deal.Welcome news that negotiations have concluded.

But I would say that genuinely the European Union has listened to the concerns that have been articulated consistently by the DUP, the UUP and others and others in Northern Ireland in respect to the operation of the Protocol.And I do believe that the key issues that have been identified had been responded to in a substantial way that would be my assessment of it. But obviously, to be fair to all concerned, we have to wait to full publication of agreements and so on and on the specific items.27 Feb 20231:06PMBack in Dublin it’s unclear exactly if and when we’re likely to have a statement or press conference by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.Much of it will depend on how the day plays out across the water but it certainly won’t be before this evening.27 Feb 20231:04PMWe’re now getting a sense of the plan for the day.Rishi Sunak has arrived in Fairmont Hotel in Windsor Park, Berkshire, for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who has not yet arrived.After that meeting, von der Leyen is expected to meet with King Charles III and Sunak will then make a statement in the House of Commons at6.30pm.At present there are no plans for House of Commons vote.There’s Suank arriving to Windsor in the last while.PAPA27 Feb 202312:51PMSome more on the brewing controversy among British unionism about King Charles’ planned meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Former DUP leader and first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster has labelled the plan as “crass”.I cannot quite believe that No10 would ask HM the King to become involved in the finalising of a deal as controversial as this one.

He is meeting with the president of the EU today.Asked why the final Protocol talks were taking place in Windsor, the spokesman said:“There are a number of occasions when these sorts of talks have been held in significant occasions, this is no different.”Sky News Senior Ireland Correspondent David Blevins has pointed out that the royal intervention isn’t exactly “unprecedented” as the late Queen Elizabeth II did release a statement in 1998 welcoming the Good Friday Agreement.DUP leader at the time, the late Dr. Ian Paisley, was not happy about that intervention either.The King’s participation not exactly “unprecedented”.

There are indications that they will not be but Jeffrey Donaldson and his party may wait a number of days to show their hand.There are local elections due in Northern Ireland in May and the DUP may fear that a continued boycott may not play well with voters.Indeed, the decision is a huge one for the future of unionism in the medium term, as Alex Kane, political commentator and former director of communications of the UUP points out.If Sunak does get a deal through and the DUP refuse to accept it (and we might not get final confirmation for some time) it raises huge problems for what unionism does next.

That’s all from us on the liveblog this evening. Thanks for sticking with our coverage throughout the day.
If you’re just catching up on the news of the day now, this will be of use:
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this evening said the Windsor Framework was reached today as trust had been built upon and Europe made concessions.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaking in the House of CommonsAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
Responding to Donaldson in the Commons, Sunak has said he believes the agreement secures Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.
He referenced concerns some in the unionist community had with the protocol, and said: “I believe very strongly that the Windsor Framework does resolve those issues.
“But I appreciate that the right honourable gentleman and his party and other unionist communities will want to take the time to consider the detail.
“And I respect that, and we will give them the time and the space to consider that, and stand ready to answer any questions and provide any clarifications.”
He added: “I believe that this agreement … does ensure the free flow of trade within our United Kingdom internal market, including unfettered access for Northern Ireland producers to the rest of the United Kingdom. I do believe it secures Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.”
Sunak said: “It ensures and safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland.”
Jeffrey Donaldson has sought an assurance in the Commons that the application of EU law would not put barriers in the way of trading with the rest of the UK.
“Ultimately, my party will now assess all these proposed outcomes and arrangements against our seven tests,” he said, adding “and whether it respects and restores Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom.”
Donaldson told the Commons: “Our judgment and principal position in opposing the protocol in Parliament and at Stormont, I believe has been vindicated.
He said: “Undoubtedly it is now recognised that the protocol does not work. And when others said there could be no renegotiation and no change, it was our determination that has proven what can be achieved.”
He added: “In broad terms, it is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas, whilst also recognising that there remain key issues of concern.
“There can be no disguising the fact, for example, that in some sectors of our economy in Northern Ireland EU law remains applicable in our part of the United Kingdom.”
He said his party would want to “study the detail” of what has been published as well as examining “the legal text, the political declaration and the Government’s command paper”.
He added: “Where necessary we stand ready to engage with the Government in order to seek further clarification, reworking or change as required.”

Addressing the House of Commons, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson says his party’s opposition to the protocol has been vindicated.
“It is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas while also recognising there remain key issues of concern.”
Donaldson says the DUP will analyse the deal to determine whether it meets the party’s seven tests.

Downing Street said it would not be helpful to speculate on the restoration of Stormont, after the agreement of the Windsor Framework.
“I don’t think it would be helpful for us to start speculating on the restoration of the executive at this point. I think that first and foremost that is a question for them,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.
“There is now an important choice for all parties in Northern Ireland, given we feel this creates the right conditions, but obviously it is a question for them.”
Downing Street said not all elements of the deal require Stormont to be sitting to be implemented.
“I have been clear for some time that if the Prime Minister were to get agreement with the EU and if that agreement is in the interests of this country and Northern Ireland, then Labour would support it,” Starmer says.
“And we will stick to our word. We will not snipe. We will not seek to play political games.”
Labour will support the deal if it is put to a vote, Starmer confirms.
“The protocol will never be perfect. It is a compromise.
“But I have always been clear that, if implemented correctly, it is an arrangement that can work in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.
“And that now it has been agreed, we all have an obligation to make it work.”

Labour leader Keir Starmer is now addressing the House of Commons.
The ban on British sausages entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain has been scrapped thanks to the Windsor Framework, Sunak told MPs in the Commons.
He said if the Northern Ireland Protocol was implemented in full, “we would see supermarket lorries needing hundreds of certificates for every individual item, every single document checked, supermarket staples like sausages banned altogether”.
“More delays, more cost, less choice. So today’s agreement fixes all this with a new, permanent legally binding approach to food.”
The Prime Minister later added: “Under the protocol, retail food products made to UK standards could not be sold in Northern Ireland. Today’s agreement completely changes that. This means the ban on British products like sausages entering Northern Ireland has now been scrapped.
“If it’s available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, then it will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland.”

Sunak faced down laughter in the Commons as he opened his speech by paying tribute to his predecessors.
Rishi Sunak told MPs: “I pay tribute to our European friends for recognising the need for change, particularly President (Ursula) von der Leyen, my predecessors for laying the groundwork for today’s agreement…”
The British Prime Minister was then interrupted by laughter from the opposition benches, as one Labour MP could be heard shouting: “Where’s Boris?”
Sunak continued: “And my friends the foreign and Northern Ireland secretaries for their perseverance in finally persuading the EU to do what it spent years refusing to do, to rewrite the treaty and replace it with a radical, legally binding new framework.”
Sunak told the Commons that the Windsor Framework “permanently removes the border in the Irish Sea”.
“The commitment to establish the green lane is achieved by a legally binding amendment to the text of the treaty itself. This is fundamental, far-reaching change and it permanently removes the border in the Irish Sea,” Sunak said.
Laying out some of the detail in the deal on border checks, Sunak said: “The only checks will be those required to stop smugglers and criminals and our new green lane will be open to a broad, comprehensive range of businesses across the United Kingdom.
“I am pleased to say we have also permanently protected tariff-free movement of all types of steel into Northern Ireland, and for goods going the other way from Northern Ireland to Great Britain we have scrapped export declarations, delivering finally completely unfettered trade.”

Back to Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons.
“After weeks of negotiations, today we have made a decisive breakthrough. The Windsor Framework delivers free-flowing trade within the whole UK,” Sunak told MPs.
“It protects Northern Ireland’s place in our Union and it safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland. By achieving all this it preserves the delicate balance inherent in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.
“It does what many said could not be done, removing thousands of pages of EU laws, and making permanent legally binding changes to the protocol treaty itself. That is the breakthrough we have made, those are the changes we will deliver and now is the time to move forward as one United Kingdom.”
Sunak was cheered by his own backbenchers on entering the chamber, with some waving order papers.
When asked what was difference about Sunak’s handling of negotiations compared to his predecessors, Varadkar said that “a lot of trust” has been build up betwen Ursula von der Leyen and the British Prime Minister.
He added “the fact that things were done very quietly behind the scenes and negotiations were kept confidential” made a difference.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he appreciates that some people will need time to give careful consideration to the Windsor framework.
“I hope that when they do, they’ll be able to give it their full support and that it will lead to an early restoration of the assembly and executive.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government buildings this eveningSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ieSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“I firmly believe that the people in Northern Ireland don’t want to return to the divisions of the past. They want to make progress together. They want a shared future,” the Taoiseach says.
“Like people everywhere, they want political institutions to sort out the issues that matter most in their daily lives. The state of the health service, cost of living crisis, housing and the economy.”
Varadkar says the deal, if implemented, will bring “stability and certainty to a situation that has been in flux” since the UK voted to leave the EU.
Varadkar says there is “no doubt that Brexit has been disruptive to the lives of people on these islands, especially so in Northern Ireland”.
“While the protocol exists to minimise that disruption, to prevent a hard border between North and South and to ensure free movement and free trade between North and South, its operation has resulted in some problems for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. And it has made trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, more complicated there needs to be,” he says.
“Today’s agreement provides solutions, solutions that are … workable and durable.”

“Today’s announcement is a positive outcome in negotiations on the protocol between the European Union and the United Kingdom and it is most welcome,” Varadkar says.
“It is a result of long and long protracted process to find joint solutions. And I pay tribute to both teams who’ve worked very hard in good faith to bring us to this point,” he says.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is speaking outside Government Buildings now.
We’ll provide updates on this first and then return to the developments in the House of Commons.
Rishi Sunak has begun addressing the House of Commons.

Rishi Sunak told his Cabinet in a virtual meeting that he believes “with his head and his heart” that the Windsor Framework is a “good deal for everyone in Northern Ireland”.
The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Prime Minister said the Government had achieved something very special with the Windsor Framework.
“He said they had secured what many said was impossible, making legally binding changes to the protocol treaty itself.
“The Prime Minister concluded Cabinet by saying the protocol had been causing significant problems for communities and businesses and that he passionately believed with his head and his heart that the new agreement was a good deal for everyone in Northern Ireland.”
Former First Minister of Northern Ireland Ian Paisley has accused Sunak of overpromising and underdelivering with the Windsor Framework, Sky News is reporting.
Paisley has reportedly said the deal “doesn’t go far enough”, adding he is unhappy about the role of the European Court of Justice in Northern Irish law.
“Today is about preserving the delicate balance of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and charting a new way forward for the people of Northern Ireland,” Sunak has tweeted.

Alliance leader Naomi Long has said she would like to examine the details of the deal.
“We’ve been very clear from the beginning what our expectations would be, we would want to still maintain dual market access, that’s important for businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said.
“We also want to see a reduction in the amount of bureaucracy that the protocol creates, particularly for those who are importing goods from GB into Northern Ireland.
“We’re also looking for stability because businesses are telling us very clearly that what they want are stable outcomes.
“If we have that stability and clarity, and we maintain dual market access but with a reduction in bureaucracy, then I think that that’s a good deal.”
For those who are just catching up on the news, let’s take another quick look at the main points in the new deal…
Green lane / Red lane
Anything destined for Northern Ireland will travel there as part of a “green lane”, with significantly fewer checks. Anything that could cross the border and enter the EU’s single market will travel through a separate red lane.
Sunak said that the changes to the protocol will scale back the number of certificates required for traders moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with customs paperwork removed too for people sending parcels or buying goods online.
He indicated changes to the movement of food too, claiming that anything made to UK rules will now be clear to be “sent to and sold” in NI. That will include sausages, one of the foodstuffs hit by protocol changes and which grabbed the attention of politicians in Belfast and Westminster alike.
VAT
The legal text of the protocol has also been amended on VAT. Under current arrangements, EU VAT and excise rules for goods generally apply in Northern Ireland.
Sunak said that would now change, with the legal text of the protocol amended to allow the UK Government to “make critical VAT and excise changes for the whole of the UK”.
Medicine
There will be a “landmark” settlement on medicines. Drugs approved for use by the UK’s medicines regulator will be automatically available in all pharmacies and hospitals in the North.
Stormont brake
There will now be a “Stormont brake”.
This allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to flag concerns about changes to EU rules that would have a “significant and lasting” effect.
He said that if pulled, the UK Government will have a “veto”.
The meeting between King Charles III and Ursula von der Leyen has raised some eyebrows about the monarch’s intrusion into politics.
British royal commentator Peter Hunt said of the meeting between the British King and von der Leyen: “This is a very serious error of judgment by King Charles and his advisers.”
The former BBC royal correspondent tweeted: “He’s abandoned his unifying role and entered the political fray, in a foolish bid to be seen as statesmanlike.
“History won’t be kind. Someone’s head will roll.”

DUP reaction
In a statement issued this afternoon, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said that “significant progress” has been made in the new Northern Ireland Protocol deal, but said that “there remain key issues of concern”.

Donaldson said:
“We welcome the publication of the outcome of the [UK] Government’s negotiations with the EU which ends a period of speculation and spin, often from those who know little about Northern Ireland.
“In broad terms it is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas whilst also recognising there remain key issues of concern. There can be no disguising the fact that in some sectors of our economy EU law remains applicable in Northern Ireland.
“The DUP will want to study the detail of what has been published today as well as examining the detail of any and all underpinning legal texts. Where necessary we stand ready to engage with the Government in order to seek further clarification, re-working or change as required.
“Ultimately the party will now assess all these proposed outcomes and arrangements against our seven tests, outlined in our 2022 Assembly Election Manifesto, to determine whether what has been published meet our tests and whether it respects and restores Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom.”

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has welcomed “the positive outcome” of the EU-UK negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“It is the result of a long and difficult process to find joint solutions,” he tweeted.
“I pay tribute to both teams who have worked hard and in good faith to bring us to this point. I also want to recognise the Northern Irish parties for their constructive engagement.”

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is urging political leaders to approach the terms of the deal in good faith and with a determination to restore the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland.

In a statement this afternoon, he said:
“My appeal to political leaders is to approach this moment in good faith and with a common determination to restore our Assembly and Executive. People have been badly let down with no government for far too long. It is time to abandon the politics of division and deadlock.
“To those intent on intervening in this process to bolster their own political position I would say this – do not attempt to wreck this deal, to demolish the hope of a resolution that serves the people of Northern Ireland. Do not let fragile egos inflict further damage to our fragile settlement.
“The SDLP will approach this deal in good faith determined to get to work.”

Rishi Sunak has scrapped Boris Johnson’s controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and the EU has dropped its legal actions launched against the UK.
The UK Government’s command paper on the new post-Brexit deal says the previous concerns have now been addressed.
“The Government will therefore not be proceeding with the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill,” it reads.
“In turn, the EU will not proceed with the seven separate legal actions it has launched against the United Kingdom – on issues from parcels to pets – reflecting the shared desire for a positive bilateral relationship now and into the future.”
Windsor Framework
Gov.co.ukGov.co.uk
According to the Windsor Framework command paper, just published on the UK Government website, the so-called Stormont brake “will apply to new or amended EU goods rules that would have a significant impact on the day-to-day lives of businesses and citizens”.
The brake will work along the same lines as the cross-community mechanisms already in place in Stormont.
The document says: “Once pulled, that Brake will give the UK Government the sovereign power to veto the new EU rule from ever applying in Northern Ireland. That veto can only be challenged through independent arbitration mechanisms, not the ECJ – removing the ultimate authority of the ECJ in areas in which it would affect day-to-day lives.
“The result is that EU laws will apply only where strictly necessary to provide privileged access to the whole of the EU market under a new legal framework of democratic consent and control. And we will underpin this new framework through amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to provide constitutional and democratic guarantees for the people of Northern Ireland.”
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said that her party will meet tonight to discuss the deal.
Welcome news that negotiations have concluded. We will meet tonight to assess the deal. Protection of the GFA, no hardening of the border and access to the EU market are key elements of any deal.

Speaking to reporters at Stormont this afternoon, Sinn Féin’s vice president Michelle O’Neill said she “welcomes the fact that a deal has been done”.
She said that as the details of the agreement are “coming hot off the press”, the party is still working their way through it and will have more to say later.
“We’ve always said that it was possible to have a deal. We’ve always said that with pragmatism solutions could be found. So the fact that both sides have arrived at that point today, and this represents the end of the negotiation, I think is something that will be well received,” O’Neill said.
The Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Simon Hoare, has praised the “grown politics” involved in striking the new protocol deal.

Minister of State for European Affairs Peter Burke has welcomed today’s agreement.
“I believe we now have a real opportunity for us all to move into a new and more positive phase of EU-UK relations, and to face into global challenges as partners.”
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Michéal Martin has welcomed the deal struck on the Protocol.
He said it is a “genuine response” to unionist concerns.
“This new agreement, the Windsor Framework, is the result of genuine engagement, and of the EU and UK working together and listening to the concerns raised by elected representatives, citizens and business in Northern Ireland,” he said.
“From the outset, we have always said that the only sustainable outcome is one based on jointly agreed solutions.
“I heard first-hand the concerns of many unionists. I believe they will see in this a genuine response to their genuine concerns.
“This new framework will, for example, ensure that the same food will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK. Medicines will also be available to people in Northern Ireland at the same time and under the same conditions as the rest of the UK.”

European Court of Justice
Von der Leyen explained at the press conference that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the “sole and ultimate arbiter of EU law” and will have the “final say” on single market decisions.
“Indeed, the European Court of Justice is the sole and ultimate arbiter of EU law – that’s natural because it’s prescribed by the EU order. So the ECJ will have the final say in EU law and single market decisions.”

However, von der Leyen said that through the new framework each side has “worked hard” to add the new Stormont brake.
She added that it remains an emergency mechanism that hopefully will not need to be used.
Von der Leyen said the EU is fully committed to safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“Extensive consultations” with the UK and Northern Ireland will regulate the system, she said.
Here’s a snap of Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the press conference at Windsor Guildhall.

So, now that the press conference has wrapped up, let’s take a quick look atthethree key elementsof the Windsor Framework:
Sunak told the conference that he recognises that “parties and communities across Northern Ireland will want to take the time to consider the detail of what we’re announcing today. And we should give them the time and the space to do that. And I fully respect that”.
Sunak confirmed that the UK Parliament will have a vote on the deal “at the appropriate time”.
“I think it’s important we give everyone the time and the space they need to consider the detail of the framework.”
The press conference has now ended.
Sunak also announced that the new agreement involves a new “Stormont Brake”.
This allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to veto the application of new EU laws.
“This will establish a clear process through which the democratically elected can pull an emergency brake for changes to EU goods rules that would have significant and lasting effects on everyday lives,” he told the press conference.

Von der Leyen told the press conference: “For this to work, we have agreed on strong safeguards like IT access, labels and enforcement procedures that will protect the integrity of the European Union’s single market.”
She said that the new Windsor Framework “respects and protects our respective markets and our respective legitimate interests”.
The EU chief spoke about of the “very hard-earned peace gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement” as she condemned the recent shooting of a PSNI officer in Northern Ireland.
“The new Windsor Framework is here to benefit people in Northern Ireland and support all communities celebrating peace on the island of Ireland. And this is why I believe we can now open a new chapter in our partnership. Stronger EU-UK relationship, standing as close partners, shoulder to shoulder now and in the future,” she said.
Sunak explains the new green lane aspect of the ‘Windsor Framework’:
2/ Goods staying in the UK will use a new Green Lane with a separate Red Lane for goods moving to the EU.In the Green Lane, burdensome customs bureaucracy will be scrapped.People sending parcels to friends and family or buying products online, will have no customs paperwork.— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak)February 27, 2023
2/ Goods staying in the UK will use a new Green Lane with a separate Red Lane for goods moving to the EU.In the Green Lane, burdensome customs bureaucracy will be scrapped.People sending parcels to friends and family or buying products online, will have no customs paperwork.
“I believe the Windsor Framework marks a turning point for the people of Northern Ireland,” Sunak told the press conference.
“It fixes the practical problems they face, it preserves the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.
“Now of course parties will want to consider the agreement in detail, a process that will need time and care.
“Today’s agreement is written in the language of laws and treaties. But really, it’s about much more than that.
“It’s about stability in Northern Ireland. It’s about real people and real businesses. It’s about showing that our Union that has lasted for centuries can and will endure. And it’s about breaking down the barriers between us, setting aside the arguments that for too long have divided us.”

Sunak also said the deal represents a “landmark settlement” on medicines.
He said the agreement would make “drugs approved for use by the UK medicines regulator automatically available” in Northern Ireland pharmacies.
Sunak said the new agreement protects “Northern Ireland’s place within the union” and allows VAT and excise changes to be applied across the whole of the UK.
“We’ve amended the legal text of the of the protocol to ensure we can make critical VAT and excise changes for the whole of the UK, for example alcohol duty, meaning our reforms to cut the cost of a pint in a pub will now apply in Northern Ireland.”
Von der Leyen says the new Windor Framework will allow a “new chapter” to begin.
She says the deal will “provide long lasting solutions” for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.
During his speech, Sunak explained that goods destined from Northern Ireland will travel through a “green lane”, removing the need for “hundreds of certificates”.
“Today’s agreement delivers the smooth flow of trade within the United Kingdom,” Sunak said.
“Goods destined for Northern Ireland will travel through a new green lane with a separate red lane for goods at risk of moving on to the EU.
“Food retailers like supermarkets, restaurants and wholesalers will no longer need hundreds of certificates for every lorry and we will end the situation where food made to UK rules could not be sent to and sold in Northern Ireland. This means that if food is available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, then it will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland.”

Sunak says the agreement marks a “new chapter” in the UK’s relationship with the European Union.
He says the deal will preserve the “delicate balance” in the Good Friday Agreement that protects the “aspirations and identity” of all people in the North.
He also says it will “end the uncertainty” for the Northern Irish people.
Sunak says the legal text of the protocol has been changed to ensure that restrictions on British products like trees, plants and seeds will be lifted to make them available again in Northern Ireland.
Travel requirements on pets have been removed.
“Today’s agreement delivers smooth-flowing trade within the whole United Kingdom, protects Northern Ireland’s place in our union and safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland,” Sunak says.
Sunak said the deal is a “decisive breakthrough”.

Sunak has announced what he calls ‘the New Windsor framework’.
“I am standing here today because I believe we have found ways to end the uncertainty, and challenge for the people of Northern Ireland.”
Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have begun their press conference.
Sunak and von der Leyen have now left the Fairmont Hotel in Windsor Park where they were meeting and the deal was done.
The meeting lasted just under an hour and 45 minutes.
The British Prime Minister left first followed minutes later by the European Commission president.
We don’t know exactly when UK MPs will vote on this new deal but it is almost certain to pass when it does.
The Conservatives have a majority of about 70 in the House of Commons but Labour has already indicated that it will back any agreement, meaning that the deal is likely to sail through.
The number to look at will be how many Conservatives actually vote against the deal, with some hardline Brexiteers likely to be unhappy with the agreement’s provisions to allow EU trade rules having effect in Northern Ireland.
The number being suggested is that about 30 Tory MPs vote against the deal, if the number is less than that Sunak is likely to come out of the vote looking stronger.

There they are now, the two leaders who are due to speak publicly in the next 30 minutes.
Rishi Sunak, is he the Prime Minister to finally ‘Get Brexit Done’?
Such proclamations are likely to annoy Boris Johnson and some of the more hardline Brexiteers.
Press Association also confirming the deal:
Rishi Sunak has signed a breakthrough deal with the European Union over post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland and will now seek to win the backing of unionists and Tory Eurosceptics.
The Prime Minister and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen finalised the long-awaited agreement to ease the trading issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol during a summit at Windsor on Monday, sources from both sides told the PA news agency.
“An agreement has been reached. The deal is done,” a senior Downing Street source said.
Sources have told Sky News and the BBC that a deal has been reached.
Jeffrey Donaldson has criticised a newspaper report by the Irish News which indicated that the DUP had accepted the deal.
Donaldson tweeted a screenshot from the newspaper which said that the DUP will “explain it’s rationale for their acceptance of the deal”.
The DUP leader said: “We’ll take our time to consider the detail and measure a deal against our seven tests. PS – A busy day and no dinner planned either”.

Nothing on the record here from the DUP, but the Irish News is reporting from unnamed sources that the DUP is “expected to accept NI Protocol deal”.
We’ll see how that plays out but just so you know the latest…

While we may not know if the Irish government makes an official statement later, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has been speaking to RTÉ’s News at One.
He wouldn’t go so far as to say a deal has been done but said that von der Leyen’s presence in the UK is “very clear manifestation of very significant and substantial progress”.
Back in 2021, the DUP setout “seven tests” that needed to be metbefore they would consider dropping their objection to the Protocol.
Asked whether he felt these tests had been met, An Tánaiste said:
Well, first of all, I respect that this is a matter that the DUP would have to consider within its party. But I would say that genuinely the European Union has listened to the concerns that have been articulated consistently by the DUP, the UUP and others and others in Northern Ireland in respect to the operation of the Protocol.
And I do believe that the key issues that have been identified had been responded to in a substantial way that would be my assessment of it. But obviously, to be fair to all concerned, we have to wait to full publication of agreements and so on and on the specific items.
Back in Dublin it’s unclear exactly if and when we’re likely to have a statement or press conference by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.
Much of it will depend on how the day plays out across the water but it certainly won’t be before this evening.
We’re now getting a sense of the plan for the day.
Rishi Sunak has arrived in Fairmont Hotel in Windsor Park, Berkshire, for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who has not yet arrived.
After that meeting, von der Leyen is expected to meet with King Charles III and Sunak will then make a statement in the House of Commons at6.30pm.
At present there are no plans for House of Commons vote.
There’s Suank arriving to Windsor in the last while.

Some more on the brewing controversy among British unionism about King Charles’ planned meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Former DUP leader and first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster has labelled the plan as “crass”.
I cannot quite believe that No10 would ask HM the King to become involved in the finalising of a deal as controversial as this one. It’s crass and will go down very badly in NI.We must remember this is not the King’s decision but the Government who it appears are tone deaf.— Arlene Foster DBE PC #ProudofNI.

Jacob Rees-Mogg has said it is “constitutionally unwise” for the Charles to meet von der Leyen.
“It is surprising that the King will meet Ursula von der Leyen today as it antagonises the people the Prime Minister needs to conciliate,” the Tory Brexiteer said.
“It is also constitutionally unwise to involve the King in a matter of immediate political controversy.”
An interesting one here.
Steve Baker, a former member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs has given his thoughts on the deal after leaving Downing Street.
“The Prime Minister is on the cusp of securing a really fantastic deal for everyone involved,” he told reporters.
Baker is now a minister in the Northern Ireland Office and made headlines last year when he issued an apology for his past “ferocious” stances on negotiations with the EU.
Unsurprisingly, the decision by King Charles to meet EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, and Downing Street’s advice that he do so, has prompted controversy.
Jacob Rees-Mogg has already been out suggesting that it’s a bad idea but a spokesperson for PM Rishi Sunak has defended the decision.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Sunak believes “fundamentally” that the decision was one for Buckingham Palace.
“He firmly believes it’s for the King to make those decisions,” the official said.
It’s not uncommon for His Majesty to accept invitations to meet certain leaders, he has met President Duda and President Zelensky recently. He is meeting with the president of the EU today.
Asked why the final Protocol talks were taking place in Windsor, the spokesman said:
“There are a number of occasions when these sorts of talks have been held in significant occasions, this is no different.”
Sky News Senior Ireland Correspondent David Blevins has pointed out that the royal intervention isn’t exactly “unprecedented” as the late Queen Elizabeth II did release a statement in 1998 welcoming the Good Friday Agreement.
DUP leader at the time, the late Dr. Ian Paisley, was not happy about that intervention either.

We’re expecting greater details of the proposed deal later today but we have a good idea about what’s likely to be in it already.
My colleague Jane Moore has brought togethersome of the main points so far.
The JournalThe Journal
Sunak has quote-tweeted von der Leyen’s Eurostar tweet, I’ll spare you the St. Pancras image again but this is what theBritish PM has to say:
I’m looking forward to meeting @vonderleyen in Windsor today for further talks on the shared, practical solutions to the range of complex challenges around the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Just to be clear on what any deal between the UK and the EU means.
It means the current Protocol arrangements will change, regardless of what the DUP thinks about it.
The DUP only come into it because the party is currently boycotting participation of the Northern Ireland Assembly in protest at how the Protocol currently operates.
It will be up to the party to decide if the changes are enough to lift their boycott. There are indications that they will not be but Jeffrey Donaldson and his party may wait a number of days to show their hand.
There are local elections due in Northern Ireland in May and the DUP may fear that a continued boycott may not play well with voters.
Indeed, the decision is a huge one for the future of unionism in the medium term, as Alex Kane, political commentator and former director of communications of the UUP points out.
If Sunak does get a deal through and the DUP refuse to accept it (and we might not get final confirmation for some time) it raises huge problems for what unionism does next. I’m not persuaded either Sunak or the EU would open negotiations again.— Alex.Kane (@AlexKane221b)February 27, 2023

Buckingham Palace has indeed confirmed the meeting between King Charles III von der Leyen, although given the sensitivities around the politics of it all there is no mention of anything Brexit-related.
A spokesperson said:
The King is pleased to meet any world leader if they are visiting Britain and it is the Government’s advice that he should do so.

The head of state and president will sit down to tea late on Monday afternoon during their meeting where a range of topics are expected to be discussed including climate change and the situation in Ukraine.
And here we have it, von der Leyen is on British soil.
In the past 10 minutes she’s tweeted a picture of her stepping onto the platform of London St Pancras after getting the Eurostar.

Speak of the devil, as it were.
CONFIRMED: Von der Leyen will meet with King Charles III in Windsor Castle this afternoon.
That development is being reported by PA and Sky News. There’s a statement on the way from Buckingham Palace apparently. We’ll get you that statement when we have it.
And as if to emphasise that today is a big day, the all-important meeting between Sunak and von der Leyen will take place in Windsor, not Downing Street.
There were suggestions on Friday that von der Leyen might even have a meeting with King Charles III if she flew over on Saturday, suggestions that raised some eyebrows about the monarch’s intrusion into politics.
So just to give you a sense about how the choreography about how things will go:
And just in case you thought we were over-hyping von der Leyen’s arrival toBlighty, three UK papers today use the ‘seal the deal’ terminology while others mention it in different ways.

Good morning! Rónán Duffy here for the latest season finale of Brexit.
The issues are pretty much the same but the characters are slighthy different.
Rishi Sunak is the fifth British PM since the UK voted to leave rhe EU all of six-and-a-half years ago but he’s not looking to be the man to end all the post-divorce bikcering.
Will it be enough for the Brexit fundmentalists in his party? That remains to be seen but it’s likely that he has enough votes to drown them out anyway.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-executive-and-violence-5403500-Apr2021/,"THOSE FLAMES IN Belfast on Wednesday night caught the attention of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson – that burning bus that was part of an ugly street play that stretched towards one of the city’s so-called peace lines.
On Twitter, Johnson wrote:
I am deeply concerned by the scenes of violence in Northern Ireland, especially attacks on PSNI who are protecting the public and businesses, attacks on a bus driver and the assault of a journalist. The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson)April 7, 2021
I am deeply concerned by the scenes of violence in Northern Ireland, especially attacks on PSNI who are protecting the public and businesses, attacks on a bus driver and the assault of a journalist. The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.
It is like a rewind button has been pressed into the past and those conflict years.
Johnson has shown little interest in Northern Ireland; a place too complicated for his attention span.
He made a flying visit to Stormont in January 2020 to steal a slice of the success when then-Secretary of State Julian Smith and Tanaiste Simon Coveney put their New Decade, New Approach agreement on the table and dared the Northern Ireland parties to reject it.
A weakened Executive
There had been no government for three years. Forty-eight hours after the Smith-Coveney initiative, a new Northern Executive was formed. What was Smith’s reward? To be sacked by Johnson in a Cabinet reshuffle weeks later.
But what has unnerved the loyalist community?

Think of their involvement in the peace process – including the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire delivered with a statement that the Union is safe.
That was in the then of 1994. 2021 is very different.
That Union, no longer as safe.
This is what has been smouldering in the meeting places and conversations that happen in the loyalist community. That loyalist leadership is due to meet again today.
The politics of this place is again in a mess – the pandemic the thread on which the Stormont Executive now hangs.
Brexit, Covid and policing
In this mood, other grievances emerge, including the allegation of two-tier policing.
Loyalists point to the funeral of the senior IRA figure Bobby Storey in Belfast last summer when guidelines and restrictions were ignored. One rule for them – different rules for everyone else.
Unionist leaders have demanded that Chief Constable Simon Byrne resign. The political mess has made its way into policing.
Young people again being sent to frontlines with bricks and petrol bombs in their hands. And the conflict generation watches a replay of the past madness.
2021 was meant to be a celebration of the Northern Ireland centenary. It is not what it looks like. The page turns so far are into that mood of yesteryear.

Johnson is right that dialogue will be needed. But he is not trusted. In the here and now, he is seen as part of the problem.
They were waiting for what they knew was coming, what they could see at a distance from this negotiation, that to get his deal Johnson would throw Northern Ireland under the bus.
The hope of that 2020 Smith-Coveney initiative has also gone, forgotten in the latest angry exchanges and arguments.
There is another problem, that loyalism is no longer that combined leadership of the 1990s. It is a fractured community in which there are many competing interests. Recently it again withdrew its support for the Good Friday Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-legal-challenge-northern-ireland-protocol-5361395-Feb2021/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster and senior party MPs are launching legal action challenging the Northern Ireland Protocol.
They will be joining other unionists from across the UK in judicial review proceedings unless alternative post-Brexit trade arrangements are put in place which secure their consent.
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, the party’s Westminster leader Jeffrey Donaldson and chief whip Sammy Wilson are backing Foster’s action in response to disruption of business through Irish Sea ports.
A separate group of DUP members has also engaged senior legal counsel to prepare for a series of challenges to the protocol.
The protocol was agreed by the European Union and UK to overcome one of the main sticking points in the Brexit withdrawal talks.
Northern Ireland remains in the single market for goods and applying EU customs rules at its ports.
The protocol moved the regulatory and customs border to the Irish Sea, with a series of checks, certifications, inspections and declarations now required on some goods being shipped into the North.
Foster said that “fundamental to the Act of Union is unfettered trade throughout the UK”.
“At the core of the Belfast Agreement was the principle of consent, yet the Northern Ireland Protocol has driven a coach and horses through both the Act of Union and the Belfast Agreement,” she said.
The move comes amid ongoing unionist and loyalist anger at new regulatory and customs processes required to bring goods into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
Nationalists and the Irish Government are committed to solving problems with the protocol keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market but insist nothing must threaten the free-flow of commerce on the island of Ireland.

Nationalist SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said: “The DUP’s legal action against the Ireland Protocol is ill-judged and will only further entrench the febrile political environment as well as creating further uncertainty for people and businesses.
“There will be few with sympathy for the argument that the protocol, which prevents a hard border in Ireland and guarantees dual market access for local businesses, breaches the Good Friday Agreement.”
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has urged the DUP to dial down the rhetoric and put politics aside.
Foster said: “Neither the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Northern Ireland Executive nor the people of Northern Ireland consented to the protocol being put in place or the flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland being impeded by checks.
“They certainly did not consent to the arrangements for those checks being determined by a power over which we have no democratic say.”
They are joining the legal challenge by peer Baroness Kate Hoey, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister and former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib.
Allister said: “Whereas the protocol is doing immense damage to commerce and thus our economy, it is its pernicious constitutional damage which concerns us above all.
“Extended ‘grace periods’, derogations and easements will do nothing to ameliorate the protocol’s fundamental assault on our constitutional position.”
The separate DUP group has sought the legal opinion of constitutional law experts ahead of several potential High Court challenges in Belfast and London against the Government over the post-Brexit Irish Sea trading arrangements.
A party source involved in the initiative told the PA news agency that preparatory work on a “series of very significant legal challenges” is at an “advanced stage”.
“No stone will be left unturned in the pursuit of justice for the people of the Union,” the source said.
Unionists have argued that the protocol undermines the Act of Union and the Northern Ireland Act, which gives legislative effect to the 1998 Good Friday/Belfast Agreement which established devolved powersharing.
The DUP leadership has rolled out a five-point plan in recent weeks aimed at frustrating the operation of the protocol.
That campaign includes a boycott of North-South ministerial engagement on issues related to the contentious trading arrangements.
The party also initiated an online petition to secure a parliamentary debate on the protocol – the debate is due to take place at Westminster on Monday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-brexit-protocol-sydney-nash-5790112-Jun2022/,"FOR MANY IN the UK government, and the wider ranks of the Conservative Party, the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland represents an uncomfortable reminder that their Brexit is not done.
These Brexit absolutists believe the decision to leave the EU was about “taking back control”. They want to free the UK from the perceived constraints of EU regulations (even those that the UK itself passionately advocated for), believing this will unleash a supposedly subdued buccaneering spirit that, given free rein, will propel the UK to reconquer the globe through international trade.
Yet the Protocol requires the continuing application of some (not all) EU rules in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, Brexiters believe the Protocol leaves the backdoor open to EU rules, for example those on state aid, still being applied in Great Britain. For these absolutists, this is unacceptable, and the only solution in their minds is to scrap the Protocol.
Last autumn, it appeared as though the Brexit absolutists were well on the way to getting what they wanted. The UK government was poised to trigger Article 16 of the Protocol, and I, for one, was convinced they there would follow-through on their threat –I wrote as much for this website. However, the UK government blinked, apparently prompted by a Chancellor who was rightly concerned about the serious consequences for the UK economy of starting a completely avoidable trade war with the EU.
Since then, the Protocol has largely receded into the background in Great Britain, if not, for obvious reasons, Northern Ireland, and the political wheel has turned. David Frost, who had emerged as the most vocal cheerleader for an absolutists’ Brexit, reduced himself to the position of a newspaper columnist, agitating from the sidelines rather than at the heart of government. Liz Truss became Brexit negotiator, and after a brief flirtation with resetting relations with the European Commission, fell back on a familiar pattern of complaining about EU intransigence. Meanwhile, scandal after scandal hit Number 10, occupying the government’s time, the media’s political coverage, and the inboxes of Conservative MPs, which filled with angry correspondence from constituents.
It is the fall-out from these scandals that now frames what will happen next on the Protocol.

While he appears unwilling to admit it himself, Boris Johnson’s premiership is over. Consequently, the only game in town in Westminster is the increasingly regular contest to become the next Conservative Party leader and, by default, the UK’s next Prime Minister.
Candidates are preparing themselves – teams are being recruited, websites built, donors courted, and backroom deals struck. Every decision by candidates and their supporters is now being made through the prism of this coming contest, including those on Northern Ireland and the Protocol. The result will be more performative politics as leadership hopefuls try to convince Conservative Party members that they deserve to be the next Prime Minister.
This is not to say that there will be no moments of apparent substance.The publication of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill was one of these.Through this, the UK government plan to grant themselves extraordinary powers to unilaterally disapply large swathes of the agreement they signed with the EU a mere two and a half years ago. However, if the rumours are to be believed that there was an argument in Cabinet about which Minister got to present this Bill to Parliament, that was no doubt because of what being the front person to this piece of hard-Brexit legislation would signal to the Conservative base in advance of a leadership election, rather than anything to do with the Bill’s content which the vast majority of Conservative Party members (and many MPs) will never set eyes upon.
Furthermore, while Johnson remains a lame duck, the UK government cannot govern. Even before what the pro-Johnson Daily Telegraph described as his “hollow” victory in last week’s vote of confidence, this government’s record on delivery was woeful. The chances of it successfully progressing a Bill as controversial as this while competing factions try to extract a pound of flesh from a fatally wounded Prime Minister, and simultaneously seek the promise of political riches from those eager to replace him, is minimal.
What happens with this Bill in the coming months will ultimately depend on the ebb and flow of the Conservative Party leadership contest. During this, the Brexit absolutists and the few remaining pragmatists will jostle for position, but they will all take a hardline on the Protocol – the absolutists because they believe that this is the only way to get what they want, and the pragmatists for fear of being branded remainers. Meanwhile, Johnson, still in denial, will do what he has always done; pick fights with the EU to grab the headlines in a desperate attempt to cling onto power.
We should be prepared for a lot more noise, but few changes of substance. The current UK government has neither the desire nor the competence to do what is necessary to address the concerns of the people of Northern Ireland. The publication of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill demonstrates that this government would rather the UK be viewed as rogue by its allies, than roll-up its sleeves and do the hard graft of grinding thought the detail and negotiating, and the delicate work of building trust with the EU. The absolutists argue that the EU only budges when it is threatened, when in fact it will only move when it trusts its negotiating partner.
The views of this UK government are well and truly set. The EU’s opinion of it is equally firm. Consequently, we are stuck, and will remain so until the politics in London changes and allows for an honest debate about the difficult trade-offs that are an inevitable consequence of leaving the EU. Perhaps a change in Conservative Party leader will prompt this, but I would not bet the house on it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/oireachtas-irish-border-letter-5723082-Mar2022/,"THE OIREACHTAS COMMITTEE on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has written to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis over new proposals that will make cross-border travel more difficult for non-EU citizens.
Under the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including the North.
That law passed through the Commons last week and is expected to come into force in 2025.
Committee Cathaoirleach and Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd said he nad his colleagues have serious concerns about the law.

“Earlier this week British MPs voted down an amendment which sought to remove the visa requirement. If enacted, the rules would see a visa waiver requirement for non-Irish citizens going between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”
“The Committee has written to the British Secretary of State Brandon Lewis asking him to engage with our Members on this issue of deep concern, not least given its impact upon the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.”
O’Dowd said the new rules would have a negative impact on communities, particularly along the Border, but also on those workers, students and tourists who travel across the Border every single day.
“Mr Lewis has stated that the system will not lead to checks along the Border and that the Common Travel Area will not be affected. However, if this Bill is enacted, it would have a significant impact on people who live in Ireland but do not have Irish or British citizenship.
“This decision is contrary to the approach that the British and Irish Governments have supported to protect free movement on the island of Ireland and is divorced from the reality of life for the thousands of people who live and work in the Border region,” O’Dowd added.

NEW UK PRIME Minister Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden “agreed on the importance of protecting” peace in Northern Ireland, in a phone call today hours after Truss became Britain’s new leader.
Truss told Biden that she also looked forward to “working closely” with Washington “as leaders of free democracies to tackle shared challenges,” a Downing Street spokeswoman said.
They include “the extreme economic problems unleashed by (Russian President) Putin’s war,” she added in a readout of their call.
“The Prime Minister and president discussed a range of domestic issues and agreed on the importance of protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,” the Downing Street spokesperson said.

It comes amid reported concerns in the United States over Truss, after her one-year tenure as foreign secretary saw post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland increase and strain the UK’s ties with Brussels, Dublin and Washington.
In that previous role, Truss spearheaded legislation in Britain’s parliament that would unilaterally override parts of a UK-EU trade pact for Northern Ireland, which the bloc and Irish government vehemently oppose.
Biden, who is fiercely proud of his Irish roots, has been critical of the Brexit policy pursued by Britain under former prime minister Boris Johnson, and was seen to share a lukewarm relationship with the former British leader.
Biden had warned ahead of his 2020 election that if Brexit damaged the 1998 Good Friday Agreement he would not consent to a UK-US trade deal.
A trade agreement between London and Washington is currently seen as a distant prospect.

After a Stormont minister ordered a halt to agri-food checks at Northern Ireland ports on incoming British goods – what can we expect next in the latest Brexit twist?
Stormont minister and DUP MLA Edwin Poots has tonight told officials in his Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) to stop checks required under the terms of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
This has been criticised as a stunt by Sinn Féin, grandstanding by Alliance, and welcomed by the TUV.
The Irish Government has said that it’s a serious decision that would breach international law, while the British Government has said it won’t get involved.
Here are the answers to some of the key questions about the move – due to kick in in just over an hours’ time.
Why has Poots ordered a halt to these checks?
The DUP's Edwin Poots.PAPA
Edwin Poots is claiming he needs the approval of Stormont Executive ministers to continue the checks.
Under Stormont’s powersharing rules, decisions deemed “significant or controversial” need the endorsement of the wider administration to proceed.
That is to ensure that big policy moves have cross-community backing and guards against ministerial solo-runs.
Issues that cut across the responsibilities of multiple departments should also be brought to the Executive under the terms of the ministerial code.
Poots brought a paper to the Executive last week seeking that authority on that basis.
He did so in the knowledge that, if the matter was elevated to the wider Executive, the DUP could at that point exercise a veto to block approval for the checks, on the basis that they are not supported by the unionist community.
Realising that was Poots’ likely intent, Sinn Féin used its own veto to prevent the issue from even getting on the agenda in the first place.
Poots is now arguing that, in the absence of wider Executive backing, he does not have the legal authority to continue the post-Brexit checks.
He said he has sought and received  the opinion of senior counsel on the issue – which has been questioned by Sinn Féin.
It’s worth remembering that the Northern Ireland Assembly is due to vote on whether to retain the post-Brexit Protocol arrangements in 2024, under the consent mechanism of the Brexit deal.
Does the halt relate to all Protocol checks?
No, Agriculture Minister Poots is only responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks. These relate to food and plant safety checks on agri-foods.
The customs elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol are not within Daera’s remit and are not affected by the announcement.
So even if these checks are halted at midnight, there will still be other checks taking place on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland under the Protocol.
Why now?
An obvious question is why is Poots, a vociferous critic of the Protocol, only taking this action now – over a year after the checks started.
His critics within the unionist family insist he should have acted long ago, indeed well before the Protocol became operational in January 2021.
Poots came close to taking action then and threatened to halt work on checking facilities but he ultimately stepped back from that position upon the receipt of legal advice.
The UK Government’s Environment Secretary George Eustice also wrote to Poots then, to remind him that he was obliged to conduct the SPS checks as part of the UK’s international obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement.
There’s always a local politics angle
It’s worth noting that at the weekend, Poots was not selected by the DUP as a candidate for the South Down area, ahead of Stormont Assembly elections to be held in May. Poots had indicated he wanted to leave his Lagan Valley constituency and stand in South Down – today he blamed DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson, his successor as DUP leader, for his failed attempt.
The party nominated Diane Forsythe as its candidate for South Down instead.

In a statement tonight, the DUP MP Sammy Wilsonsaidthat it was “disappointing that Edwin had not accepted this decision”, and that “any Executive challenge would not result in Edwin replacing Diane as the candidate in South Down”.
Poots gave an interview on the BBC’s Good Morning Ulsterearlier todayin which he said “Edwin Poots hasn’t gone away” and that his political demise had not happened yet.
Poots has contended that he is taking action now because the legal position has only recently been clarified by a series of recent court rulings that examined issues around Executive authority and decision making.
What has triggered this chain of events?
Late last year, a group called Unionist Voice Policy Studies issued legal proceedings against Poots, warning that it would launch a judicial review against the minister if he did not seek the approval of the wider Executive for continuing the checks.
Poots conceded the case without even going to court and said he would bring a paper to the Executive seeking approval by the end of January.
You can guess what Sinn Féin thinks about this
This stunt is an attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic, and international law. DUP fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at. Health, Jobs, Housing, Cost of living crisis is where the rest of us are focused— Michelle O’Neill (@moneillsf)February 2, 2022
This stunt is an attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic, and international law. DUP fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at. Health, Jobs, Housing, Cost of living crisis is where the rest of us are focused
The DUP’s partners in the NI Executive have branded Poots’ recent actions as an electoral stunt, motivated by poor opinion poll showings.
The party argues that the Executive already took a decision in 2020 that Poots’ department would assume legal responsibility for carrying out the checks.
It is understood that contention is based largely on a minute from a meeting of the powersharing administration on 21 May 2020.
At that time Arlene Foster was DUP First Minister alongside Michelle O’Neill as Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister.
The PA news agency understands that Executive minute reads: “The First Minister advised that;
“It was agreed that the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs would take the lead on this issue with the support of a cross Departmental group; and that officials would confirm to Whitehall that the necessary work would be taken forward with Defra, Cabinet Office and the NIO to move this forward.”
People are tired of this grandstanding and instability.Edwin received clear legal advice in March 2020 when he first tried this stunt.

Does the civil service have to stop the checks now?
Senior civil servants are in a difficult position.
The DUP insists civil servants are obliged to follow ministerial directions. Sinn Féin and other parties claim civil servants have a primary obligation to abide by the law, so would be unable to follow any unlawful direction.
What about the UK Government’s position?

Parliament is sovereign, so any decision taken by Poots, or the Executive, could in theory be overridden by the British Government.
If Protocol checks were to stop, it would put the British Government at odds with its obligations under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.
In such circumstances, the British Government could use its authority to direct that the checks resume.
However, that could place it in an uncomfortable position politically, given Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is currently involved in intensive negotiations with Brussels in a bid to significantly reduce the number of checks required under the Protocol.
The Government has recently signalled that it might not intervene – with Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis telling ITV News tonight that it was a matter for the Executive, but that they would be looking at the advice that Poots had received.
In its most recent statement on the issue, the British Government said: “We have been clear the operation of checks is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive in the first instance.
“We are determined to negotiate a solution and move forward.
“The UK Government is in intensive talks with the EU and our clear priority is to protect the peace process and the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions.”
Supporters of Poots highlight that the Good Friday Agreement is also an international treaty and the Government is equally obliged to uphold its terms. They claim continuing with checks without the cross-community support of the Executive would impinge on that 1998 treaty.
The Irish Government and EU have argued that’s the Brexit deal that Boris Johnson signed up to in late 200, and that without the Protocol, checks would go up between the six and 26 counties in Ireland, which would also infringe on the Good Friday Agreement.

Under the programme €2m a year will be provided to allow students in Northern Ireland to access third level internships and semesters abroad across Europe.
As part of the programme, 20% of the funding will be allocated for internships in the Republic of Ireland, with many internships taking place in key locations including the Financial Services sector in the IFSC in Dublin.
Commenting on the news, Harris said: “This is an investment. It is an investment in relationships between institutions North and South. It is an investment in our island’s next generation, and I think it’s a really practical, sensible way of continuing to cooperate post-Brexit.”

As a result of Brexit, UK students lost access to the EU’s Erasmus+ programme from 2021.
In its place, the UK has set up its own study abroad scheme, named after mathematician Alan Turing.
Under the UK scheme, students can receive funding to study worldwide, with different amounts offered depending on where a student chooses to go.

Baker is now a minister in the Northern Ireland Officeand made headlines last yearwhen he issued an apology for his past “ferocious” stances on negotiations with the EU.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight last night, Baker was visibly emotional as he urged his colleagues to back the Windsor Framework, saying it was time to “be sensible and grown up and do the right thing by 1.9 million people”.
He described his work in the ERG and the lockdown-sceptic COVID Recovery Group as “holding these tigers by the tail”, saying they caused him emotional distress.
“Seven years of this cost me my mental health. The beard, the jewellery, this is about my recovery,” Baker said, pointing at his appearance.
“But make no mistake, holding these tigers by the tail, Brexit, the COVID Recovery Group, the Net Zero scrutiny group. The tax stuff we did with Conservative Way Forward, it took its toll. We’re all only human. And the way I’ve led rebellions no one should have to and this is an important moment for me personally, because I can authentically say he’s done it.”

Baker went on to say that one of the “worst mistakes he’s ever made” was to embrace the description of a “Brexit hardman” that was given to him.
“I stupidly invited a journalist to put it to me on air, thinking it was funny, but it was just a mistake at the end of a long, exhausting day and unfortunately, it was catnip to the press. I made the mistake once, it Agot repeated and repeated. It cost me 2,000 votes in Wycombe and it’s still, as you’re showing now, it’s still a stone in my shoe.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-uk-vaccine-podcast-5390525-Mar2021/,"THE ROLLING OUT of vaccines across the world hasn’t been without its complications.
Here in Ireland, we’ve been watching as other countries’ rollouts moved much faster than ours (to date,10% of the population have had their first dose of a vaccine).
Meanwhile, the UK had rolled out vaccination before us. But in recent weeks, the UK and the EU have reached loggerheads over the vaccine issue. While 10m doses of vaccines were exported to the UK from the EU, the UK hasn’t exported any doses to the EU since January.
Earlier today, it reached the point where the European Union was reported to be about to present new rules that could cut exports to Britain and other countries, in order to curb vaccine supply shortages in the EU.
Though the UK doesn’t have an export ban in place itself, it did sign an agreement with AstraZeneca that means it will get doses produced in Oxford and Staffordshire first.
But by this evening, a joint EU and UKstatement was issuedthat stated that the third wave of Covid-19 “makes cooperation between the EU and UK even more important”.
They said they were now discussing “what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on Covid-19″.

DUP leader Edwin Poots claimed the region is being used as a “plaything” by Europe, with more checks on goods from Britain at ports per week than take place in Rotterdam once grace periods end.
He accused the EU of doing “demonstrable harm to every individual in Northern Ireland”, adding it is having a “devastating impact”.
Mr Poots said the UK Government has the grounds to trigger Article 16 to put the brakes on the Protocol due to “economic and societal damage”, warning about future difficulties in receiving food and medicines.
“We have violence on our streets in Northern Ireland, which hasn’t been the case for years, and that’s on the back of this Protocol,” he said.
Also appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Sefcovic said they searched for four years for the “best solution to the very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland”.
He said for the EU and the UK it was “very clear” that was the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He also urged a focus on policies and politics that unite than divide and to look at the Protocol as an “opportunity” for Northern Ireland.
Mr Sefcovic said he wants to meet the Northern Ireland Executive parties before the next Joint Committee, which is expected to take place in the middle of June.

“I would like to hear from Mr Poots himself but also from other leaders of the political parties who form the Northern Ireland Executive and discuss with them what we can do better,” he said.
Mr Poots also said while the European Commission over the years “put their heart and soul into winning peace in Northern Ireland”, they currently “don’t seem to care for the peace process … that really needs to change, that attitude needs to change”.
“This is the European Union seeking to punish the United Kingdom. As a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything for the European Union,” he said.
“I can assure you Northern Ireland should be nobody’s plaything, we are citizens of the United Kingdom, we were citizens of the European Union and we deserve to be treated with the same respect as everyone else.”
Mr Sefcovic mooted a Switzerland-type agreement on a temporary basis which would “get rid of 80% of checks”.
“I think it would be the right thing to do, it would calm down the situation,” he said.
He reiterated his opposition to a hard border on the island of Ireland and called for more co-operation between the EU and the UK.
However, Mr Poots responded by saying he wanted to see a permanent solution.
“The permanent solution is to take the barriers away between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and provide security in terms of the single market that goods that are entering the European Union from Great Britain have the appropriate checks,” he said.
“I believe we can eradicate virtually all of the risks to the single market by having checks on the goods that are going to the European Union based in Northern Ireland.
“That deals with the single market issue and it still allows all of the food and all of the medicines that are travelling to Northern Ireland from Great Britain without huge costs, £25 million per year, being added to the public purse.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rosslare-europort-brexit-changes-5609289-Nov2021/,"SATURDAY, 13 NOVEMBER was a record day at Rosslare Europort, says Glenn Carr.
Over the course of the day, almost 1,000 units of freight travelled through the ferry hub, according to the port’s general manager, making it one of the busiest days in the history of the Wexford port.
This level of activity is something that Carr and his team have had to get used to in 2021.
So far this year, the volume of cargo travelling through the Wexford port has ballooned by 55%, according to Carr. Because of an increase in direct trade with Europe, continental freight volumes  — which have skyrocketed by 378%, Carr says — are driving the overall numbers.
Once upon a time not long ago, Stena Line’s Fishguard and Irish Ferries’ Pembroke services, both in Wales, accounted for most of Rosslare’s business.
“Our only services to the continent, going back over 18 months ago, would have been primarily Stena Line’s three services a week to the port of Cherbourg in France,” Carr explains.
But there are now 30 weekly services operating to and from Rosslare and the continent, compared to just three or so pre-Brexit.
Overall, there are now 44 direct routes from ports in Ireland to continental Europe — up from around a dozen last year.
Rosslare Europort on 13 November
What’s being captured by these numbers is a major shift in the rhythms of Irish trade, brought about by Brexit.
“Typically, prior to Brexit, you were probably looking at about 120,000 freight units a year going into the port every year and in or around close to a million passengers pre-pandemic,” Carr toldThe Journallast week.
But in 2021, Irish importers are bringing in fewer goods from the United Kingdom than they were a year ago. At the same time, indigenous companies are exporting and importing more directly to and from the continent, fueling demand for direct sailings.
As a result, Rosslare — Ireland’s closest sea trading hub to the continent geographically — is now the main Irish port for roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) traffic serving Europe, Carr says. And having fixed its gaze firmly on Europe in recent years, the Iarnród Éireann-operated hub’s importance within the national port network looks set to grow even more over the coming months and years.
Further shocks
Carr took the reins at the port a little over three years when the question of what sort of Brexit, hard or soft, we would end up with was largely unanswered.
At the time, Rosslare had essentially just two customers — Stena Line and Irish Ferries.
While they were “very good customers to us”, Carr says,  Rosslare was massively dependant on their business.
This became abundantly clear when Irish Ferries pulled its Rosslare to France services in 2018, choosing to operate from Dublin Port instead.

Even without the threat of Brexit, it became obvious that the port would have to grow to protect itself from further shocks.
“We undertook a strategic review of the port and we identified a number of core areas that could be developed. One of those was the business role, the actual business itself,” Carr says.
He recalls, “We asked ourselves, ‘What are the fundamental strengths of Rosslare Port?’
The port’s response was to “get out into the market”, Carr says, and aggressively promote Rosslare as an alternative ‘RoRo’ port to Dublin.
‘Roll-on/roll-off’ or RoRo refers to a type of cargo shipping service where trucks or trailers are loaded directly onto the ferry with the cargo they’re transporting, taking the journey along with the goods.
They’re considered quicker and cheaper than ‘Load-on/Load-off’ (LoLo) services — when the truck pulls up to the board and unloads the cargo, which is then loaded onto a container and put on the vessel.
‘RoPax’ services, then, are ones that facilitate roll-on/roll-off cargo transport and also passengers travelling aboard the ferries.
As a RoPax port, Rosslare saw the passenger side of its businesses devastated by travel restrictions at the outset of the pandemic in March and April 2020. But around the same time, something else was beginning as businesses began to wake up to the potential for Brexit-related disruption.
“I definitely got a sense from around March, April last year, exporters and importers were beginning to look at alternative suppliers,” Carr says.
Glenn Carr, Rosslare Europort's general manager
The UK landbridge — which usually refers to a route linking Dublin, Holyhead, and Cherbourg or Le Havre in Northern France — was once considered the cheapest, quickest way to get goods into Ireland from Europe or move them in the opposite direction.
But with Brexit, at that stage, looming over the horizon and with it the prospect of customs checks, additional costs and lengthy queues in Great Britain, alternative arrangements for trading with Europe were quickly becoming very appealing.
Then everything started to change for Rosslare Europort.
Traffic congestion
“In the March before Brexit, Brittany Ferries made a move to come to Rosslare. So that was the first thing,” Carr says.
“Brittany were operating to Spain from Cork but the service wasn’t doing very well and the haulage industry was telling them that they needed to operate from Rosslare.”
Traffic congestion at Dublin and Cork ports in 2019 and the fear that it would only get worse as a result of Brexit had created demand from hauliers for new services from Rosslare, Carr explains.
He says, “We’re just over 90 minutes from greater Dublin. There were times where hauliers were telling me they were 90 minutes in traffic trying to get into Dublin Port.
“So I believed that there was demand — in Dublin and Cork — from hauliers, given their geographical location, who would prefer to come to Rosslare. We proved that then when Brittany Ferries came to Rosslare.”
After that, things began to snowball.
Related ReadsBrexit is fuelling a boom in cross-border trade. But why? And what does it mean for the island?
Around the same time, Danish shipping company DFDS approached Rosslare about a new direct route from the port to Dunkirk in France. That service got up and running shortly after Britain’s formal withdrawal from the EU in January 2021.
Ships lining up ahead of Brexit Day last January
Earlier this month, Brittany Ferries announced a new sailing from Rosslare to Le Havre in Northern France. The port’s existing customers have also increased capacity on direct European routes.
All of this is being driven by demand from Irish businesses and hauliers.
Part of it is companies wanting to avoid the landbridge, Carr says.
‘There’s definitely been more engagement from both importers and exporters about direct sailings,” says Carr.
But the other factor is Irish businesses finding new customers and new suppliers in Europe as an alternative to Britain.
“In particular industries, we’re definitely seeing where traditionally a lot of goods were sourced in the UK or exported to the UK, there’s been a switch to Europe,” he says.
“We definitely see it in the port in terms of the mix of goods that are there now — ingredients, food, dairy, pharmaceuticals.”
In the year so far, Carr says overall freight volumes travelling to and from the UK through Rosslare are down 55% compared with the same period last year. Earlier this month, Dublin Port said its overall UK trade volumes were down 21% while Central Statistics Offices figures published last week revealed overall Irish imports from Great Britain are also down 21%.
He expects these trends to continue in 2022. Asked what his biggest Brexit-related concern is for the coming year, Carr claims he doesn’t have any major ones.
“We would like to see our UK traffic return to a more appropriate level than what it is at the moment,” he says.
“We’ll be working with our shipping lines on what we can do as a port to help them get more trade going. But I don’t have concerns about next year. I have great excitement about further opportunities.”
At some stage next year, the UK is set to finally implement long-delayed checks on goods coming into Great Britain from the EU.
“We’ll see if that happens,” Carr says, and depending on how that happens, and the degree of what happens, we could see even further substantial demand for additional direct services.”
“We’d like to think, however, that we will find a sensible solution that will ensure we ultimately will always trade with the UK.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-vet-deal-with-uk-to-get-around-brexit-checks-5365216-Feb2021/,"THE EU HAS said that it is willing to consider an agreement with the UK on checks and standards required for plants and animals, and products related to them in an attempt to make post-Brexit checks run more smoothly in Northern Ireland.
This could ease issues with the trade of seed potatoes and potted plants from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, as well as issues with pets travelling from GB to NI.
In an interview withRTÉ News, vice president of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič said that he had raised the suggestion with British Cabinet minister Michael Gove yesterday evening.
The EU and the UK were engaged in discussions yesterday over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.

An agreement from the two sides to agree on sanitary and phytosanitary standards could solve many of the problems that Northern Ireland has faced in trying to trade post-Brexit.
In the first days of post-Brexit checks, products on M&S shelves in Northern Ireland were reduced due to the new system of checks that were needed.
Other problems were raised too: soil couldn’t be imported from Great Britain without significant hassle, meaning plants and even tractors that had mud on their wheels were stopped from being sent across.
The UK has faced similar issues in trying to import items from the EU:such as a beekeeperwho can no longer import baby bees from Italy due to new Brexit bans.
A ‘grace period’ was implemented to waive certain checks required for agrifoods going from GB to NI, as required under the Brexit trade deal between the EU and UK.
The UK has asked the European Commission that this three-month grace period be extended until January 2023, along with extending grace periods in other areas.

As it stands, here is the plan for more Brexit checks that the UK still need to introduce:
Although a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement would solve a good number of issues Northern Ireland trade has faced post-Brexit, it would not solve them all. It’s possible that businesses and markets will have to adjust to solve them completely.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has suggested previously that he is in favour of a veterinary deal with the UK to solve some of these issues.

The funding will be used for projects such as repairing and enhancing slipways, piers and pontoons.
The scheme is proposed for funding under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, a once-off emergency EU fund to support regions and communities who have experienced adverse economic, social, territorial or environmental effects as a result of the UK leaving the EU.
McConalogue announced the scheme, which aims to rejuvenate local authority public piers and harbours throughout coastal communities, earlier this year.

In a press statement today, he said: “It is fantastic that we received so many great applications in this first call for projects and it is truly heartening to see such eagerness to help support our coastal communities transition to living in a post-Brexit economy.
“This is the largest ever funding announcement of its kind for local authority marine infrastructure and I am confident that it will future-proof our piers and harbours right around our coast.”
The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is administering the scheme. Local authorities are responsible for governance and delivery of their own projects.
Projects to be funded by the scheme include €2 million worth of repairs on protective barriers on the east pier in Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin, structural repairs in Sligo harbour and repairs to the sea wall and slipway at Dungarvan harbour in Co. Waterford.
A further call for projects will issue later this year to allocate the remaining funding under the scheme.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-deal-northern-ireland-5914484-Nov2022/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney has said that a deal between the EU and the UK over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements is “doable” by the end of the year.
It comes after the European Commission vice president said a deal could happen within weeks with the right “political will”.
Negotiations between London and Brussels aimed at securing changes to the protocol are continuing with both sides talking up the prospect of a deal.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin today, Coveney said: “We need to get this issue behind us in terms of the Protocol in a way that respects an international treaty that’s been signed.
“I think it’s doable by the end of the year.”
The UK government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation – the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill – which would empower ministers to scrap parts of the arrangements brokered as part of the Brexit divorce deal without the approval of Brussels.
The European Commission has warned that such unilateral action at Westminster would be in breach of international law and could prompt retaliatory action.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin is set to meet his UK counterpart Rishi Sunak at the British-Irish Council in Blackpool on Thursday, where it is hoped that relations will further improve.
Coveney said the summit would give the UK the opportunity to provide “some clarity” on its approach to elections in Northern Ireland.
Sunakmet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the COP27 summit yesterday, which she dubbed a “good first meeting” following talks about the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol.
Striking a conciliatory tone, the two leaders “agreed on the importance of working together to agree a resolution”, according to Downing Street.

“On the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Prime Minister reiterated the need to find solutions to the very real problems it had created on the ground in Northern Ireland,” Downing Street said.
Following the meeting, the commission’s vice president Maros Sefcovic told Westminster that he did not believe the EU and the UK were “worlds apart” on the protocol, as he warned that unilateral action by the Government would have “serious” consequences.
“This is the area where we do not seek any political victory. We just want to solve the problem,” he said.
Discussing EU proposals to reduce checks, he said: “Is it too much to do this? Can we not find pragmatic, technical solutions to make this thing work?
“I believe it could be done, if there is political will, I’m sure that we can sort it out really within a couple of weeks because really both sides of our negotiating teams we know these topics from all angles.”
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to give a statement in the House of Commons tomorrow on plans for an Assembly Election.
Heaton-Harris has already ruled out an election in Northern Ireland before Christmas, but has yet to set a date for when it will take place. It is thought that he may push back an election deadline in the region to give more time for a deal on post-Brexit trade to be struck.
According to a statement from Downing Street, the restoration of powersharing in Stormont was at the top of the agenda at a cabinet meeting chaired by Sunak today.
“The Northern Ireland Secretary said he had carried out extensive engagement with Executive party leaders, civic society and business leaders, as well as people in Northern Ireland in recent days,” Downing Street said.
“He noted that he has carefully considered an informed approach in line with those discussions.
“Cabinet agreed that the UK Government’s absolute priority for the people of Northern Ireland was the restoration of a stable, effective and accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland as well as protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which had been the bedrock of progress.”
“The Northern Ireland Secretary resolved to update the House of Commons on the best means to achieve that tomorrow in the House.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-dup-northern-ireland-protocol-5343429-Feb2021/,"LAST UPDATE|3 Feb 2021
UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said that his government is considering invoking Article 16 of the Protocol to unilaterally stop Brexit related checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
“[We will] do everything we need to do, whether legislatively or indeed by invoking Article 16 of the Protocol, to ensure that there is no barrier down the Irish Sea,” he told the House of Commons today.
Johnson was responding to comments from DUP MP Ian Paisley during PMQs, who said unionists were made to feel like foreigners in their own country.
“Tea and sympathy will not cut the mustard. So what is the Prime Minister actually going to do when you realise that the EU will do nothing to help Northern Ireland? … Prime Minister, be the unionist we need you to be.”
Responding, Johnson said:
“The honourable gentleman’s business constituents, some of whom I know very well and admire very much, can continue to do business unfettered between Northern Ireland and the rest of this country.”
His comments could possibly put the UK government at odds with the Irish government’s staunch defence of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney earlier said calls to get rid of the Northern Ireland Protocol are “completely unrealistic” and “that is not going to happen”.
The protocol is at the centre of an argument between Ireland, Northern Ireland, the UK and the European Union following last week’s EU intervention on Article 16.
On Friday the EUhad signalled its intentionto trigger Article 16 of the protocol, a safeguard clause, to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.
The European Commission later rowed back on those plans, but the move has caused tension, particularly with the Northern Ireland Executive.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Irelandtoday, Coveney said Ireland, the UK and the EU “have a legal obligation in an international treaty to implement the protocol, and I think it’s also important to say that the protocol isn’t primarily the problem here.”
“The problem is caused by Brexit, and the kind of Brexit that the British government pursued and insisted on, because there were alternatives that would have been much easier to implement, the EU wanted to share a customs union and single market with the UK, that would have meant no barriers to trade.
Advertisement
“Some people are trying to rewrite history here … the protocol itself is about solving problems that are caused by Brexit, trying to protect an all-island economy, prevent border infrastructure on the island, or tense political relationships on the island.”
However Coveney did concede “there are elements in terms of implementation that are causing real problems”.
“I think what what senior politicians need to do now is look at ways in which pragmatism can be applied to the implementation of the protocol in the context of flexibility and grace periods where appropriate, but it has to be done within the context of the protocol itself, because … we all have a legal obligation now in international law to implement the protocol and ensure that the protections that it provides are in place.”
Coveney said the EU’s actions on Friday have made the situation “a lot worse”.
“And while that decision was reversed, of course, and wouldn’t have happened at all if there had been consultation, it certainly has triggered a political response in Northern Ireland which makes implementation of the protocol even more difficult.
“When you have a significant minority of politicians in Northern Ireland now actively saying that they will not cooperate with the protocol then that poses real difficulties.
“Added to that you have totally unacceptable threats to people working in Larne and Belfast ports – I think the PSNI has provided clarification that this isn’t a wider loyalist paramilitary issue – but it certainly is still intimidating for for workers there. And that’s something that needs to be condemned.”
‘Lecturing everyone’
Also speaking to Morning Ireland, the DUP’s Nigel Dodds said that there is a “recognition across the board to the damage that’s been done as a result of the EU’s moves”.
He said that the European Union had spent time “lecturing everyone” on the importance of Northern Ireland, but had decided to “set that aside at the first opportunity”.
Dodds said that it was welcome to hear the likes of Coveney and ministers in Westminster acknowledging problems with the protocol.
“I welcome the change of tone,” he said.
“There aren’t just teething problems. These are significant difficulties. It’s incumbent on the UK government to protect the internal market of Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK.”
In a statement released today, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the DUP’s “destabilising approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol is deeply regrettable”.
“I think it is highly regrettable that the First Minister has chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity.

“We should be very clear – the DUP, under Arlene Foster’s leadership, campaigned for Brexit. They said no to Theresa May’s softer Brexit proposal.
“They said no to alignment with the EU Single Market and Customs Union across these islands. They said no to every attempt to prevent the emergence of a new border in Ireland or in the Irish Sea.
“Their every political machination over the last five years has led us to this point. If there is an architect of the challenges that we face today, it is the First Minister and her party,” Eastwood said.
Physical inspections on goods entering the region from Great Britain, which are required under the protocol, have been suspended amid threats and intimidation of staff.
Police have insisted there is no evidence that loyalist paramilitaries are involved in the sinister campaign, instead blaming disgruntled individuals and small groups.
Yesterday, in another sign of heightened tensions in the region, a large group of masked men were seen walking around an area of east Belfast where the Ulster Volunteer Force exerts influence on the community.
Graffiti warning off inspectors has appeared close to ports in recent weeks. Police have stepped up patrols at the ports following the spate of intimidatory incidents.
The protocol is a mechanism agreed by the UK and EU as part of the withdrawal talks to ensure a free-flowing Irish border.
It achieves that by moving regulatory and customs processes to the Irish Sea, focusing on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The inspections and added bureaucracy are required because, under the protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods and also applies EU customs rules at its ports.
Unionists and loyalists are deeply unhappy with the new arrangements, which came into force on 31 December, believing the protocol has created a barrier between the region and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the Union.
Yesterday, the DUP announced a series of political moves aimed at undermining the protocol.
Its strategy includes opposing any protocol-related legislation at the Stormont Assembly and refusing to participate in any exchanges with the Irish government related to the operation of the protocol.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-rejoin-protest-march-5900522-Oct2022/,"THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS have marched through central London calling for the UK to rejoin the EU.
The National Rejoin March saw large crowds of people walk from through the city. Marchers from across the UK travelled for hours to attend.
Parliament Square Garden, the last stop on the march for the rally, saw a sea of blue and yellow as supporters waved EU flags and carried placards.
Some signs said: “Brexit was never going to work”, “For lower bills #rejoin the EU” and “We voted romaine”.

Nikki Ajibade, a 60-year-old teacher from Warwickshire, was at the march with her sister.
She said: “We feel very strongly that the situation we’re in now, you can trace it back directly to 2016 referendum, which was supposedly an advisory referendum.
“It wasn’t a supermajority result, 52 and 48 is not something that you can just completely upturn and upend the whole country. Look six years on where we are. So we feel very strongly that we need to get a sensible government in place, general election now, because this lot are squabbling like rats in a sack.”
When asked about Boris Johnson potentially throwing his hat in the ring to become prime minister again, Ms Ajibade said: “If they’re thinking that Boris Johnson is the answer, they haven’t understood the question.
“It’s an insult to the nation. It is an actual insult to the British people to even mention his name as a possible candidate.

The crowd booed as a large digital screen overlooking Parliament Square Garden showed pictures of Leave-voting figures such as Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and Nigel Farage.
Oliver Jackson, a 26-year-old warehouse worker from Dorset, said that it was important for politicians to listen to those who wanted to rejoin the EU.
He said: “We need to get our voice heard. And especially during all this chaos, we can’t let this be left out. Honestly, the best way to get the UK back on track is to rejoin, at the very least, the single market and then the EU.
“Brexit has been the slow death that has been bleeding the UK dry for years.”

“It allows you to come and go as you will and it enriches lives. It makes people better.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-row-ambassador-5876237-Sep2022/,"IRELAND’S AMBASSADOR TO the UK has stressed the need to find a negotiated solution to the problems surrounding Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements.
Martin Fraser said he was an optimist about the chances of resolving the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol but the situation was currently in the “words phase” and had to move to the “actions phase”.
The UK government is legislating to effectively tear up parts of the agreement, which sets out how goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are treated.
Fraser, speaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, said the protocol was the only way to resolve the problems caused by Brexit.
The agreement, signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson’s government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.

Devolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.
Fraser acknowledged there were “legitimate concerns” but said: “How do we solve it? We solve it by negotiating through the issues that are there.
“From our point of view, from the European Union, we solve it by implementing the protocol that was agreed with the British government, which the British government signed and fought an election, passed through Parliament.
“We think it’s the best and only solution. But of course we recognise that people have legitimate issues and we do definitely recognise that the Unionist community in Northern Ireland has legitimate concerns which we have to try and address.
“But we address them by negotiating.”
Asked if he was optimistic about the situation, he said: “I think we have to solve this problem, I think we can, I think we should.”
He added: “I couldn’t have worked on Northern Ireland politics for the best part of 20 years without being optimistic and I think we should all be optimistic.”","7.30am, 26 Sep 2022",

The DUP representative was also questioned over his party’s boycott of North-South Ministerial Council meetings during Executive Office questions in the Stormont Assembly today.
The exchanges came as “intensified talks” were ongoing between the EU and UK to try and find a solution to the protocol issues.
Maros Sefcovic said today that the EU will consider all of the tools at its disposal if the UK government triggers Article 16.
The European Commission vice-president said if the UK government suspends the Northern Ireland Protocol, it will have “serious consequences” for the region and Brussels’ relationship with the UK.
Addressing Irish politicians, the Commissioner said he worries about the rhetoric and action of the UK government around the implementation of the agreement, particularly the divisive protocol.
Sefcovic said there was a “change in tone” in the latest round of talks with Brexit Minister David Frost.
He told the special select committee that the EU is is fully committed to protecting Good Friday Agreement.
“However, I have to say that I worry about the rhetoric and action of the UK as regards the implementation of the agreement and in particular the protocol,” Sefcovic added.
Paul Givan said the NI Protocol has “upset the delicate balance that the Belfast Agreement created”.
He urged David Frost and the EU to “intensify the process this week as we need to see a resolution to the issues”.
TUV MLA Jim Allister challenged Givan in the Assembly on his party “continuing to implement this union dismantling protocol”.

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) was to construct new customs posts at ports to implement the additional checks required under the protocol.
Former agriculture minister Gordon Lyons ordered a halt to the work earlier this year.
A High Court challenge to the ministerial decision is ongoing.
Givan responded to Allister, insisting that the current agriculture minister Edwin Poots “is not implementing the protocol”.
“Indeed, if he had… we would have been facing a much worse situation,” he told MLAs.
“It’s [as] a result of the DUP minister holding the department that we haven’t had the protocol being implemented.
He added: “It is the Democratic Unionist Party which pursuing a policy to try and eradicate the borders that have been created down the Irish Sea and he should seek to join with us to encourage his fellow unionists in terms of the strategy that we are taking forward.”
Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd challenged Givan on his party’s non-attendance at North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings, putting to him “on what planet would it be acceptable for a minister to refuse to carry out their lawful duties under the ministerial code other than the DUP planet”.
“When will you act lawfully and send the message out to those people on the streets who are acting unlawfully in the hijacking and burnings of buses and other activities, and ensure that you are living up to your obligations, your legal obligations, under the ministerial code,” he said.
A legal challenge taken by a Belfast businessman to the DUP position on NSMC meetings is currently ongoing.
Givan responded to O’Dowd saying in 2008 Sinn Féin boycotted Executive meetings, and “pulled down” the powersharing government in 2017.
“When it comes to thwarting the activities of the institutions created by the Belfast Agreement, it is Sinn Féin that have been the masters of that,” he said.

In fact, the whole process of the UK leaving the European Union has been tortuously slow, with years of debates in the House of Commons, intense talks on technicalities and numerous 11th-hour deals. Of course, it hasn’t even been finished yet – and it’s not clear that the British economy has even benefitted from the exit.
The UK isn’t the only country that isn’t a fan of being an EU member – there are still prominent anti-EU figures across member states. But has that been dampened down by all that Brexit drama, or has Brexit shown Eurosceptics that it can be done – even if it is a bit messy?

https://www.thejournal.ie/less-landbridge-mroe-action-how-irish-trade-changes-5356884-Mar2021/,"The Port of Dover.PAPA
IRISH HAULIERS HAVE welcomed the dozens of new ferry routes that go directly from Ireland to the European continent, but have warned that the easing of Covid restrictions and potential extreme weather events mean that the landbridge needs to be kept as a “fallback”.
The UK landbridge – usually a route from Dublin, to Holyhead, and across the Channel to northern France – has been an convenient, fast and cheap link to the continent.
Since Brexit, that reliability has become unstable – requiring further checks and costs, and risking long delays. But despite adapting to a new way of trading and transporting, it doesn’t appear as though Ireland is completely free from reliance on its UK connections.
Around half of Ireland’s exports to countries other than the UK, and almost 150,000 trucks, travelled over the UK landbridge each year before Brexit. That rate of traffic has now been halved, and is being diverted around the UK on ferries going directly to the EU.
The number of Irish trucks using the UK landbridge fell to 50% in January, after new Brexit checks were introduced covering animal and plant safety standards, customs checks and costs, and regulatory standards.
Meanwhile, traffic flows through Rosslare Port increased by 45%, as 12 sailings a week from all Irish ports to the continent increased to six a day. The routes that circumvent the UK to the European continent are called ‘direct’ routes, and traditionally have taken more time and cost more to use.
Fianna Fáil MEP and EU Trade Committee member Barry Andrews said that direct sailings to the continent had increased from 12 per week to 42 per week, or six a day.
This has happened without much State intervention, and is largely businesses adapting to more reliable routes post-Brexit – despite the new options being slower and more costly than the landbridge.
Irish Embassy ParisIrish Embassy Paris
The extra time it takes to make these journeys is significant: a report compiled for the Department of Transport said that if travelling by the landbridge took less than 20 hours before Brexit, it took up to 40 hours for a truck to make the same journey by ferry (called ‘roll-on, roll-off’ or RoRo).
If you load the cargo onto a ferry directly, without a truck, it could take up to 60 hours (‘load-on, load-off’ or LoLo), the Irish Maritime Development Office found (IMDO).

When faced with a choice between a business taking a chance on a faster route that could end up being delayed for hours, or a slower route that will be guaranteed to arrive on time, businesses have – so far – been choosing certainty.
At an event to discuss the implications Brexit has for Ireland and the Netherlands, Barry Andrews said that there were also increased costs to using the landbridge now.

In response to a question fromTheJournal.ie, Andrews said that further delays and “further problems” at the landbridge are due from 1 April.
Irish exporters of food and agri products into Great Britain will need to pre-notify their delivery through UK systems, and supply new export health certificates. These changes will also be required of exporters moving goods across the UK landbridge.
“So I think we’re going to have more interruptions before we get to a smoother outcome.”
Today, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney urged Irish exporters to prepare for the extra import checks the UK will introduce on food and other agricultural products.
“I know businesses are still trying to come to terms with earlier Brexit changes and Covid impacts, but it is vital that exporters fully understand these new UK import requirements and ensure everyone in their supply chain, including the importer and logistics providers are clear on their roles and responsibilities and can meet them.”
Although hauliers have described the post-Brexit ferry routes as “revolutionary” and the routes on offer as “varied”, and while accepting that the landbridge route has “changed forever”, they acknowledge that they can’t ignore the landbridge.
Officials at the weekly Dublin Port briefings have said that businesses and hauliers in Ireland do expect to go back to transporting goods via the landbridge if and when operations there settle down and adjust to all the new checks taking place – but some things need to change before that happens.
What’s on board
Pharma goods and agri-food products are among the freight that used to be sent via the landbridge that is now being sent by ferry routes to the European continent.
The products still being transported through the landbridge are live fish, and anything with a very short shelf life.
At the beginning of the year, there was some suggestion that there was a shortage of items on supermarket shelves in Ireland because of Brexit.
Anecdotal reports of less fresh food or meat on shelves were shared.

But Irish officials had denied that there were problems with fresh food, and that deliveries were arriving into the country, despite any minor problems faced.
There had been stockpiling done by some supermarkets, but this was mostly non-perishable goods – as the weeks move on, they will soon need orders of those products again.
President of the Road Haulage Association Eugene Drennan toldTheJournal.iethat products being sent from Great Britain need a health cert, so any animal or plant-based products are having problems being sent into Ireland.
He said that some goods require up to seven separate documents, which he called “ludicrous”, “cumbersome” and “tough going”.

Not all plain sailing
Before a Brexit deal was struck, routes were being announced that circumvented the UK landbridge, mostly linked to the next nearest countries to Ireland – France and Spain.
New routes include those from Cork to Zebruggee; from Dublin to Santander, via Liverpool; from Waterford Port to Rotterdam and Liverpool; from Dublin to Leixões in Portugal, via Liverpool; from Rosslare to Cherbourg and Cork to Roscoff.
Since Brexit came into force on 1 January 2021, other routes have also been announced by Stena Line, Irish Ferries, and Brittany Ferries, including:
Hugh Bruton, General Manager of Brittany Ferries Ireland, said last month that Irish traders were now looking for direct links to western France – as opposed to north France where most ferry companies service.
But hauliers have said that some of these extra ferry services are allowed to happen because of Covid-19 travel restrictions – there are no passengers to transport, so freight can be prioritised by using bigger ships for freight routes.
In response to this, a spokesperson for Stena Line said that they are offering short-term services because of Post-Brexit changes in trade flows, but still have “the same or more” capacity as before the pandemic and Brexit, and the same landbridge and direct routes still exist.
“When travel volumes return, we will have to adapt to that, in a safe way, and combine freight, cars, drivers and travel passengers (RoPax) as we have done for almost 60 years.”
A spokesperson for Brittany Ferries said something similar: “The new services had nothing to do with the current situation restrictions regarding passenger travel. They came about entirely as a response to a demand for freight capacity direct to the continent which we were happy to be in a position to satisfy.”
Irish Ferries declined to comment.
It’s also been highlighted that direct routes to the continent are longer and possibly more expensive route to transport goods: the landbridge can be 5 or 6 hours shorter, and businesses have to pay “around €500 per truckload” to send it via direct routes.
Stormy weather may also be a factor – on days where sailings are delayed because of choppy seas on the open seas, trucks may be diverted towards the landbridge which involves shorter crossings to the continent.
This means that most hauliers and officials are expecting to “fallback” to the UK landbridge at some point.
Between a possible lifting of Covid-19 restrictions this summer that may see a rise in passengers looking to travel by ferry; the UK introducing new checks and documents needed by Irish exporters from 1 April; and the threat of bad weather, we’ve not yet cleared all problems with exporting and importing goods post-Brexit yet.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-to-vote-against-rishi-sunaks-brexit-deal-for-northern-ireland-6025440-Mar2023/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Mar 2023
THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted emphatically to back regulations underpinning PM Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal but there were a number of high-profile Tory rebels.
Today’s vote to implement the ‘Stormont brake’ section of the Windsor Framework was passed by 515 to 29, a majority of 486.
Former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss were among those who had signalled they would vote against the deal, with the DUP’s 8 MPs also opposed.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson had confirmed his party would not support the deal, adding this afternoon that it did feel enough progress had been made to return to government in Stormont.
Despite the hardline opposition, the vast majority of Conservative MPs supported the vote and, with the Labour party also doing so, there was never any risk of it being defeated.
In a statement earlier, Johnson said: “The proposed arrangements would mean either that Northern Ireland remained captured by the EU legal order – and was increasingly divergent from the rest of the UK – or they would mean that the whole of the UK was unable properly to diverge and take advantage of Brexit.”
Johnson had been giving evidence to the Commons committee investigating his statements over Partygate when the Commons bell rang to vote on the deal.
A source close to Truss said that she does not believe the Windsor pact does not “satisfactorily resolve the issues thrown up by” the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Other Tories who spoke out against the deal include former home secretary Priti Patel and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith.
The SDLP has confirmed that it would support the framework, though it waspreviously on the fence.

“The party has raised serious concerns about elements of the deal and the impact it may have on the investment prospectus provided by unique access to the EU single market and the UK internal market,” it said in a statement today.
“The SDLP has decided, however, that the balance of the deal which creates a clear path toward the restoration of devolution should be supported in the interests of people, communities and businesses in Northern Ireland.”

A UK Government source said this is “the best deal for Northern Ireland which ensures the smooth flow of internal UK trade, safeguards NI’s place in the Union and addresses the democratic deficit”.
“In negotiations the PM secured significant concessions, with this deal going well beyond what had been on the table before. It goes much further than the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and fixes the problems with the old protocol.
“Without the Windsor Framework, the legal default in domestic and international law is automatic alignment to EU standards and rules with no say in Northern Ireland.”
DUP
While the DUP is not in a position to block the Stormont brake, their opposition suggests that an early return to power-sharing at Stormont is highly unlikely.
Donaldson effectively confirmed this afternoon that they party would not be ending its boycott of Stormont, tweeting:
“I have consistently indicated that fundamental problems remain, notwithstanding progress made.”

The UK is now requiring that advance notification and customs declarations must be made for agri-food products travelling into Britain from EU countries, including Ireland.
Trade with Northern Ireland is not impacted by the changes.
In some cases, businesses will also need an Export Health Certificate for agri-food products depending on the risk category they fall under.

Physical checks at UK Border Posts are expected to commence later this year, tentatively from 31 October 2024.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin said this week that officials have been in touch with exporters and Ireland is “well prepared” for the changes, but urged businesses tomake sure they are readyfor the new requirements.
The UK is largest single destination for Irish food, drink and horticulture exports. It makes up nearly half of Irish beef exports, worth around €1.3 billion, while dairy exports to the UK were worth €1.1 billion in 2023.
The UK’s Home Secretary James Cleverly said that there would be “no interruption” to food in supermarkets as a result of the change – a concern for citizens given previous disruption to food supply chains caused by Brexit.
“We’re going to make sure that these sensible, responsible checks are done in a way that makes no interruption to the supply of food to the shelves, so people don’t need to worry about that,” Cleverly said.
“We of course want to make sure that we maintain good quality food available on the shelves and we’ve always been able to do that and we will continue doing that now.”

“WOLF HALL” AUTHOR Hilary Mantel says she plans to take up Irish citizenship, “to become a European again” after Brexit.
Mantel, the first British writer to win the Booker Prize twice, also attacked Prime Minister Boris Johnson as being unfit for office, in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica published today.
“I hope to loop back into my family story and become an Irish citizen,” said the celebrated author, who has Irish Catholic roots through her grandparents.
“Our projected move has been held back by Covid, but much as I love where I live now, in the West Country (in England), by the sea, I feel the need to be packing my bags, and to become a European again.”
Arguing Johnson “should not be in public life”, Mantel said she felt “ashamed, of course, to be living in the nation that elected this government”, and would prefer to live in a republic.
She also attacked the Brexiteer politicians who took Britain out of the European Union as “callow opportunists, insincere and devious, and often ridiculous”.

Mantel, 69, grew up in northern England, and told La Repubblica that she had always felt more of a “provincial” and “European” writer, “rather than an English writer”.
“My parents were both born in England, but the generation that shaped me was the one before that, and I was conscious of belonging to an Irish family,” she observed.
Mantel’s “Wolf Hall” trilogy, chronicling the doomed life of Tudor minister Thomas Cromwell, was a publishing sensation. The concluding novel, “The Mirror & The Light”, came out in March 2020.
She was one of many cultural figures who spoke out against Brexit before Britain voted in 2016 to quit the European Union, a decision that finally took full effect at the start of this year.
EU member Ireland allows individuals with Irish parents or grandparents to claim citizenship, and there has been a boom in applications from Britain since 2016.
Driven by his animosity to Brexit, spy author John le Carre became an Irish citizen shortly before he died last December, according to his son.

Speaking about the current impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Martin questioned whether there was “a will” within the UK government to resolve it.
The UK government has threatened to unilaterally change some elements of the Protocol agreed between the UK and EU, with Martin saying this was “not how democracies and countries of like mind normally behave”.
Martin added that he believes the UK government hasn’t given negotiations “a chance” and he suggested there may be “different agendas at play”.
“We’re concerned as to whether there are different agendas at play, or whether the UK government really wants to settle this because I don’t see the landing zone for the UK government, or they’re not clear what would resolve this.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-hauliers-checks-5365878-Feb2021/,"IRISH HAULIERS HAVE said that French custom officials are treating trucks that have used the UK landbridge as if they’re British, and not from a fellow EU member state.
The president of the Irish Road Haulage Association Eugene Drennan said that Irish hauliers are being “treated like they’re coming from England” by officials at French ports.
“To the French, we’re only a block off of England,” Drennan toldTheJournal.ie.
Around 150,000 trucks a year cross the UK landbridge – a route usually from Dublin, to Holyhead, and across the Channel to northern France – as it’s quicker and cheaper to use than going directly to the European continent by ferry.
But since 1 January this year, when the UK left the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market, additional customs documents, costs, and other paperwork are needed for goods coming from Great Britain, while Ireland’s membership of the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union mean that those bureaucratic barriers are lifted.
But representatives of Irish hauliers have suggested that they are being held up at French ports for longer than they should because officials view them, or their goods, as being British.
Aidan Flynn of the Freight Transport Association has also said that goods coming from Ireland are “effectively viewed as British goods”.
Flynn said that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture is using “simplifications” of trade rules and requirements – such as using the simpler NCTS transit system instead of using the EU’s more complex TRACES system – when the French are not.

Ireland is not requiring pre-notification 24 hours before transit for EU goods using the landbridge, for example, where the French are requiring this.
In response to these claims raised by hauliers, the Department of Agriculture said:
“Ireland has undertaken substantial engagement at political and official level across the EU to ensure that EU goods moving under transit across the UK landbridge are not subject to unnecessary checks and controls. This engagement is ongoing.”
“Revenue and DAFM (Department of Agriculture), along with DFA (the Department of Foreign Affairs) and our Embassy network are in ongoing contact with their EU and UK counterparts on a range of trade and customs matters, including the functioning of the landbridge.
“We are committed to ensuring the UK landbridge remains a viable route to market for EU traders. Although some limited issues since 1 January have been identified, we are engaging proactively to address any issues that may arise, and overall the landbridge procedure is operating as expected.”
The French Embassy in Dublin was contacted for comment.

Since new post-Brexit checks have been introduced on 1 January, hauliers have been calling for a simplification of the checks required.
Drennan said that some goods coming into Ireland from Great Britain require up to seven separate documents, which he called “ludicrous”, “cumbersome” and “tough going”.
Flynn said a “simplification of rules is badly needed”, particularly in relation to safety and security requirements, which were brought in in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, and are not necessary for a former EU member.
Related ReadsIncomplete haulier paperwork still causing headaches and delays at Irish ports, Cabinet told
These requirements have been waived for goods going to the UK, but not for goods arriving in Ireland.
Flynn said that there are other problems with using the landbridge post-Brexit:
“In the past, you might have 20 pallets on a lorry, and dropped off two or three pallets in the UK and picked up others on the way to the Channel. That activity isn’t open now, you have to ‘transit under seal’.
“If you’re leaving Ireland, and when you arrive into France, if that seal is broken by dropping off pallets in the UK, now you’ve a whole new export declaration… That was a real benefit to the landbridge that you could have efficient delivery and collection.”
Flynn says that now, “a lot of trucks are coming back empty, and that’s not sustainable.”
Another problem for hauliers has been the system that logs customs declarations, which is a new requirement for exports to Britain. If a small number of declarations are logged at once, the system works, but if 20,000 are logged simultaneously, the system crashes.
Flynn says that this has a “disproportionate impact” on deliveries, and doesn’t inspire confidence in the system.
Revenue said that it has processed over 1.8 million customs declarations from 1 January to 1 February – compared to 1.6 million during the whole of 2020.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeffrey-donaldson-dup-stormont-northern-ireland-6184780-Oct2023/,"DUP LEADER JEFFREY Donaldson has insisted he will not bow to “pressure, threats or blackmail” in response to a letter which said that his party’s return to Stormont could lead to mass loyalist street protests.
Donaldson said “anyone who thinks that they can exert influence on policy or intimidate our party by making such threats is sadly mistaken”.
It follows a letter sent by loyalist activist Jamie Bryson to unionist leaders on behalf of Unionist Voice Policy Studies.
In the letter, Bryson argues against the DUP returning to Stormont following the implementation of key elements of the Windsor Framework.
The DUP has been blocking power-sharing for more than a year in protest at the internal UK trade barriers created by Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
The party says the framework deal struck by the EU and the UK to reform the Protocol does not sufficiently address its concerns and has made clear it will not accept a return to devolution until the Government provides further assurances, by way of legislation, over Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market.
Talks between the DUP and the Government have been ongoing over the summer.
One of the main parts of the framework – the green/red lane system for the movement of goods –became operational at Northern Ireland ports on Sunday.
In his letter, Bryson stated: “The unionist base, according to all polls, stands firmly behind unionism’s principled stand – (Northern Ireland) Protocol or power-sharing, never both.
“A surrendering on these issues by returning to Stormont would – in our analysis – ignite significant instability, and without any doubt precipitate a return to mass street protests.
“It would, in our view, also be the case that a significant swathe of grassroots unionism/loyalism would actively electorally campaign against any unionist who had opted for the role to collaborator and implementer in the subjugation and suspension of the union.”

In his strongly worded response, seen by the PA news agency, Donaldson said his party is the “main voice of unionism in our sovereign Parliament”.
He added: “We believe in devolution and are working to ensure that the local institutions are restored on the basis that they are able to command the support of unionists as well as nationalists on a sustainable long-term basis.
“With the unanimous support of our party officers the Democratic Unionist Party has spelt out its position in relation to the unacceptable nature of the Northern Ireland Protocol and we have taken resolute political action to bring the EU back to the negotiating table. Many said that was unachievable.
“The Windsor Framework represents progress in relation to certain aspects of trade within the United Kingdom and its internal market, but there is more work to do.
“We remain engaged in discussions with His Majesty’s Government about the further wide-ranging changes required to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom.”
The DUP leader added: “In the end, having already listened to what others have to say, the Democratic Unionist Party will carefully consider any final Government response to the issues we have articulated and will take its own counsel and decisions based upon what we believe to be in the best interests of Northern Ireland, and its people, whether they agree with us or not or vote for us.
“We will not bow to pressure, threats or blackmail, regardless of what source it comes from.
“Anyone who thinks that they can exert influence on policy or intimidate our party by making such threats is sadly mistaken and misunderstands who we are or where we have come from.
“The Democratic Unionist Party’s overriding objective is to make Northern Ireland work, to be prosperous and to thrive as a valued part of the United Kingdom.
“In addition to our opposition to the Protocol, building prosperity and stability are key to securing the union in a Northern Ireland that is changing and where unionism must broaden its appeal if the union is to be protected for the longer term.
“Legislation alone will not protect the union if we lose the battle for the hearts and minds of the people of Northern Ireland.
“Under the principle of consent, it is their votes that will ultimately determine our future as part of the United Kingdom.”","7.00pm, 2 Oct 2023",

TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said the EU would have “no option” but to respond to the UK triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Varadkar said today that Ireland is making “contingency plans” should this happen and that officials were “dusting off” plans that were previously made ahead of fears of a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking onRTÉ’s News at One, Varadkar said triggering Article 16 effectively suspends the Protocol and “undoes” Brexit, forcing more trade negotiations.
“I really hope that Britain doesn’t go down this road,” he said.
“Prime Minister Johnson always spoke about wanting Brexit done. Brexit is kind of done, but this potentially undoes it and I don’t think it’d be good for us or for Great Britain and I don’t see how it’s good for Northern Ireland.”
He added: “Bear in mind the Protocol is broadly supported by people in business and most political parties in Northern Ireland.”
Politicians in Northern Ireland earlier held a virtual meeting with UK Brexit Minister David Frost amid ongoing speculation that the UK government is preparing to unilaterally suspend the Protocol governing Irish Sea trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Varadkar said he thinks there would be an EU response to such an action and that “there would have to be”, he added that Irish officials are examining what would happen in such circumstances:
The operation of the Protocol has led to increased North-South trade in Ireland, but Varadkar acknowledged that there has been “some disruption to trade from Britain into Northern Ireland”.
Unionist politicians have called for the Protocol to be scrapped and it has been cited as among the reasons for disorder in loyalist areas of Northern Ireland.

Two buses have been hijacked and burned out in loyalist areas in Northern Ireland this month in incidents linked to protocol opposition.
Police were also attacked in clashes at a community interface in west Belfast involving youths from the nationalist Springfield Road and loyalist Shankill Road/Lanark Way on two nights last week.

Speaking today after that meeting with Frost, Stormont’s Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that threats and “incendiary language” from the UK government were contributing to street unrest.
O’Neill said there was a need for London, and her DUP partners in government, to “dial down the rhetoric” over the post-Brexit trade arrangements.
She said Frost did not confirm to her that the government would definitely suspend the protocol by triggering Article 16 of the mechanism.
However, she linked the UK government’s repeated threats to trigger a suspension as a factor in heightening tensions that have seen the outbreaks of disorder in Northern Ireland.
“I’ve made it very clear to him that it’s time to dial down the rhetoric, that the wider community here want solutions, they want to make the protocol work, they want us to iron out the issues that need to be resolved but they certainly don’t want to see the spill out of the language, the incendiary language actually from the British Government and the DUP, that’s now spilling out on to our streets and we now see street disorder – none of us want that,” said O’Neill.
“So we need to do everything in our power to stop it. So I’ve asked them to dial it down, I have warned them against the language they’re using, I have also asked them to remove the threat to trigger Article 16 because that’s not what the majority of parties here want, what the wider business community want.
“What we need to find is solutions and stability, certainly not another period of instability, uncertainty, and all that that brings with it.”
Asked if Frost had confirmed that the government would trigger Article 16, O’Neill said: “I think it’s unfortunate that they continue to repeat their mantra that Article 16 conditions have been met.
Related ReadsEU warns of 'serious consequences' if UK decides to trigger Article 16Is the Protocol bad or good for firms in Northern Ireland? It's both, they say
“It’s my assessment from the conversation today – however, I caveat everything I say with the fact that this is David Frost, the man that negotiated the protocol and who’s now trying to renegotiate the protocol – but his statement today was clearly in the line of that talks are going to continue, that they want to find solutions and that they don’t want to trigger Article 16.
“However, again, I caveat that with the fact that this is the man that actually negotiated in the first place.”
Meanwhile, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has confirmed that he has sought a security assessment from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) about comments by unionist politicians about the support for institutions in the North.
Yesterday the Progressive Unionist Party, which is politically aligned to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force,said there was no basis for unionists to retain supportfor the Good Friday agreement, which established the power-sharing institutions at Stormont.
Speaking at the annual Association of Garda Sergeants & Inspectors conference today, Harris confirmed that he spoke with PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne about the matter yesterday.
“We have sought an analysis then from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and indeed the security service in respect of just what the ramifications are of yesterday’s statement,” he said.
““Regrettably, we have seen violent incidents where buses have been destroyed in Northern Ireland.
“It is against that backdrop that we have asked for their assessment on what they think is going to happen next.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-protocol-maros-sefcovic-5567673-Oct2021/,"LAST UPDATE|7 Oct 2021
AN EU MOVE to develop new proposals on the operation of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol is a welcome breakthrough, the leader of the DUP has said.
Jeffrey Donaldson was reacting after the European Commission vice president, Maros Sefcovic, announced that the bloc would table “very far-reaching” proposals within the next fortnight.
Sefcovic said he hoped those would form the basis of intensive discussions throughout the rest of October and November as the UK and EU try to resolve their differences over the trading arrangements that have created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
“We were told weeks ago that the EU were not in a position where they were ever going to reopen negotiations, so I think we’ve breached the first wall and I think that is the result of unionists standing together and saying, ‘look, we cannot support this protocol, we cannot support an Irish Sea border’,” Donaldson said.
“I think that the pressure we have brought to bear and the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks have focused minds both in London and in Brussels, and I’m pleased that we’ve made this level of progress.

“We still have a long way to go, I don’t pretend otherwise, but I think at least now we’ve broken through. We’ve opened up the protocol and there is a beginning of a negotiation. We’ll see what emerges from that.”
Donaldson has threatened to pull his ministers out of Stormont – a move that would collapse powersharing in Northern Ireland – if major changes to the protocol are not secured in the coming weeks.
He said he had been assured by British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the UK’s Brexit negotiator, David Frost, that if the EU does not “step up to the mark” with significant reforms, then the Government will move unilaterally to “restore Northern Ireland’s position within the UK internal market”.
“The EU will bring forward their proposals, I’ve no doubt that those proposals will fall short of what the UK need and certainly what we need, and there will then follow a period of what Lord Frost called ‘intensive negotiations’,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.
The DUP leader added: “I’ve certainly seen a change in the tone and language being used by the EU, which is welcome.”
Asked whether his call for a renegotiation was at odds with the EU insistence that it was not renegotiating the protocol, rather offering mitigations and flexibilities, Donaldson said: “The EU can call it what they will, they can present it in whatever way they wish, but, in the end, the wall has been breached, we’ve opened up the protocol.”
He said he hoped talks between the UK and EU would be “meaningful”.

Donaldson said “practical measures” could be found that would differentiate between goods whose end destination was Northern Ireland and those at risk of crossing the Irish border into the EU single market – with Irish Sea checks only required on the latter.
He said he would support “proportionate” processes that would enable the EU to protect its single market.
The DUP leader also said the standoff over whether the European Court of Justice should be allowed to arbitrate on trade disputes related to the protocol rules was an “important issue” and said he believed the UK would push for a more “independent” arbitration mechanism.
Donaldson added: “I hope that the EU will step up and recognise that Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market needs to be respected, but if they don’t, then I expect that the UK Government will take the necessary steps to do that and ensure that our place within the UK internal market is restored.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-frost-ill-will-brexit-northern-ireland-5374192-Mar2021/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S chief Brexit negotiator David Frost has called on Brussels to “shake off any remaining ill will” towards the UK for leaving the bloc as arrangements governing trade to Northern Ireland continue to prove contentious.
The European Commission has said it will launch legal action against Whitehall after the UK announced it was extending a series of “grace periods” designed to ease trade between Northern Ireland – which remains in the EU single market for goods – and Great Britain while permanent arrangements are decided.
Cabinet Office Minister David Frost said on Wednesday that London’s move should allow time for constructive discussions with counterparts in Brussels.
But the intervention provoked a furious response in Brussels, with the EU accusing the UK of going back on its treaty obligations in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Frost said the move was lawful and designed to protect the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland.
“With Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, our agenda is one of an outward-looking country, confident we can work with others towards common goals,” he said.
The Northern Ireland protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement was designed by the EU and UK to avoid a hardening of the border on the island of Ireland.
It means keeping Northern Ireland aligned to various EU rules, requiring checks on goods arriving into the region from Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the chief British negotiator in Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007 said Frost had chosen to “poke a stick in the eye” of the bloc by taking unilateral action on the grace periods.
Jonathan Powell, who was also Tony Blair’s chief of staff, said the move was a reprise of Frost’s “disastrous tactical manoeuvre during the negotiations last year of breaking international law by unilaterally abrogating the protocol in the Internal Market Bill, which later had to be humiliatingly withdrawn”.

Writing in The Sunday Times, he said: “The only safe option is to find a way to make the protocol work better, which means trying to rebuild trust with the Irish and with the commission rather than attacking them.”
DUP leader Arlene Foster, meanwhile, has criticised Brussels for taking a “very belligerent approach” to the difficulties caused by the protocol post-Brexit.
Foster also said “something had to give” and the UK had to take action and extend a grace period.
In the US, the White House has again stressed the support of new President Joe Biden for the Good Friday Agreement, which the protocol is intended to protect.
Prior to last year’s election, Biden – who is famously proud of his Irish roots – warned the agreement must not become a casualty of Brexit.

The British Foreign Secretary, who assumed responsibility for the negotiations following David Frost’s resignation, is hosting the European Commission vice-president at her Chevening country retreat in Kent for talks today and tomorrow.
Ahead of the meeting, she said the EU must show a “pragmatic approach” to the issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which effectively creates a trade barrier in the Irish Sea for goods crossing from Britain in order to prevent a hard border in Ireland.
Sefcovic insisted the EU is committed to “stability” and “predictability” in Northern Ireland and said the talks offer the opportunity to build on progress made last month on the issue of medicines.

Truss said: “There is a deal to be done that protects peace in Northern Ireland, defends our Union, and maintains the integrity of the United Kingdom and EU. But it will require a pragmatic approach from the EU.”
“I will be putting forward practical, reasonable solutions starting from these fundamental principles, with a view to agreeing a plan for intensive negotiations,” she said.

She said the EU has “a clear responsibility to help fix the myriad problems” caused by the protocol and to protect the Good Friday Agreement.
“As fellow believers in liberty and democracy, we should be capable of reaching an agreement that delivers for Northern Ireland and allows us to unleash the full potential of our relationship”.
Trusspreviously saidthat she is willing to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, which would suspend parts of the treaty designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland, if the negotiations fail.
Downing Street said the UK still believes the conditions for triggering Article 16 have been reached, but the Government is still focused on trying to resolve the issues through talks.
The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We need to fix the problems in the protocol in order to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the peace process.
“The Foreign Secretary will be putting forward practical and reasonable solutions with a view to agreeing a plan for intensive negotiations.
“We very much believe there is a deal to be done but the EU must show pragmatism.
“It remains our strong preference to reach a negotiated solution, which is what you can see we are seeking to achieve today.”
Sefcovic tweeted: “In Dec, we delivered on medicines. Now we have an opportunity to do so on other issues, building on the EU’s far-reaching proposals. My objective: stability, predictability in NI.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-protocol-bertie-ahern-5796374-Jun2022/,"FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has said there is a real danger that Ireland could become semi-detached from the EU single market if the UK Protocol Bill becomes law.
He said that if the British Government pushes ahead with legislation to scrap the bulk of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Ireland may have to face checks on its goods entering the EU single market.
Ahern said that while it would be the last resort, the scenario is a “step or two nearer” following the publication of the legislation.
Last week, the UK Government tabled a Bill at Westminster that would empower ministers to override much of the contentious post-Brexit trading regime it agreed with the EU in the withdrawal talks.
Asked if there is a danger that Ireland could become semi-detached from the single market, Ahern said: “Yes.”
Speaking to the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), Ahern said: “If this was to continue on down the slippery slope and the legislation is passed, the EU will say that they have to see the single market implemented and if there is no land border then it has to be in ports.
“I shudder to think – and we saw what the delays were in the harbours and other ports two years ago when there were limited checks,” he said.
“You can imagine the difficulty that would create for Irish traders.
“They have to continue with the line that there’s a sea wall around the single market, then there’s a real difficulty because if we want to stay in the single market, then you have to go with checks.
“I think that’s the last resort and it’s something we don’t want to see but I’m afraid after last week’s position it is a step or two nearer.”
Ahern also that said that unilateral action is “deeply unhelpful” in building relationships and trust between the UK and the EU.
Advertisement
“A partnership that is central to the implementation of the Protocol, and not just within this country but with the European Union, which was set out in the agreement,” he added.
“The UK’s international reputation as a trustworthy partner is also an issue.
“In Northern Ireland, Brexit continues to exacerbate political tensions within the Executive and last September north-south co-operation ceased, which effectively means there has been no co-operation on the Good Friday Agreement since last summer.”
He told the IIEA that it is clear many in Northern Ireland, particularly in the business community, want the Protocol to work well and see the benefits of it.
But the DUP has blocked the establishment of a new ministerial executive following last month’s Assembly election in protest at the Protocol, which has created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
The party has made clear that tabling the legislation is not enough to convince it to return to the executive, saying it needs to see tangible delivery on removing the so-called Irish Sea border.
But Ahern said that businesses in Northern Ireland view the Protocol as a help to them.
“The Protocol presents real opportunities for Northern Ireland due to access to the single market,” he added.
He was also critical of the relationship between officials in the Republic and in Great Britain.
“It has all been extraordinarily negative. My understanding is that at official level, at parliamentary level, at ministerial level, and at heads of state level, that relationships are poor, and this is very disappointing,” Ahern added.
“I think we are in a position now where the atmosphere is toxic.
“I do think in all negotiations it is possible to find solutions, I never believe things are impossible. But it takes two sides to negotiate.”
He described Boris Johnson as a “clever man”, but claimed the Prime Minister has no “great interest” in negotiating with the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/adriaan-palm-dutch-ambassador-richard-piso-nato-brexit-neutrality-ireland-5956773-Jan2023/,"THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR to Ireland believes there has been a marked change in how Ireland is debating the issue of neutrality.
RecentlyThe Journalmet with Ambassador Adriaan Palm and his country’s military attaché Lieutenant Colonel Richard Piso to discuss Ireland and the Netherlands’ military connections.
In a wide-ranging interview, the Dutch diplomats spoke about the changing security environment, their views on Irish neutrality and how Brexit has opened greater relationships between European partners who previously looked to the UK for alliances.
There was also discussion about the Netherlands’ hopes that Ireland would purchase its military hardware, including advanced primary radar system, as part of the investment in the Irish Defence Forces and national security.
Experienced diplomats
The Dutch embassy is located in leafy Dublin 4 on the Merrion Road – in an art deco building a short distance from St Vincent’s Hospital.
Palm is the current ambassador, taking up his post in 2019. He is one of the Netherlands’ most experienced diplomats, having served in Ukraine and Moscow. He has also worked on European affairs and Dutch diplomatic relations with Asia. He speaks six languages, including Russian.
Piso is the point of contact for all defence liaisons between Ireland and the Netherlands and is based in London. He has served in the Dutch military as an artillery officer.
While the European security environment and the Russian invasion of Ukraine were front and centre for much of the discussion, we began with Brexit and how the unintended consequence of the move now means that the Dutch are looking more to Ireland in terms of trade and the broader European project.
“What happened is that when Brexit took place we in the Netherlands, but I think also the people in Ireland, started to look beyond the UK. Because for a lot of things within the EU, the Netherlands and the UK were on the same wavelength – [such as] an open economy, strong relations with the US,” he said.
“I think all countries in the EU started to look much more at each other and [to] work together – more than before, and see that we are all on the same wavelength,” he said.
Rather than Brexit being a fractious outcome for Europe, Palm believes it has led t0 a more united grouping.
“We realised that we need an EU that is strong to represent us in the world. So from that perspective, the Netherlands did not only look east towards Germany, but [also] west to Ireland,” he added.
War in the East
As war has been a confronting possibility on the Eastern borders of Europe, Palm said the western countries of Ireland and Netherlands are not immune from the impact of Russian aggression.
He believes that while Brexit established an economic and social alliance between European countries, the combination with Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has also driven countries to look to military alliances.
Palm and Piso repeatedly spoke of the importance of closer security bonds, such as alliances with other nations and working together with those countries and agencies, throughout the interview.
Dutch Ambassador Adriaan Palm.Dutch Embassy IrelandDutch Embassy Ireland
The Dutch, like other nations, are increasing defence spending to meet the new environment, Palm said. The complexity of Irish neutrality was not lost on the diplomats, and Palm believes there is a need for a definition of what neutrality means to Ireland.
He said that “the issue of neutrality is something that lies at the heart of people” and that there is not a desire in Europe to change Ireland’s “identity”. But he said the Netherlands has accepted it needs to fund defense adequately.
“If they look at it this way, that’s fine. We, Netherlands, are building up our defense for defensive purposes, not to go to war,” he added.
From an Irish perspective, that looks set to be on the agenda of Government this year – with a citizens assembly mooted on defence and new legislation to deal with issues such as deploying of Irish troops abroad.
PESCO
Palm said that Ireland’s signing up tothe Permanent Structured Co-operation (PESCO) element of the EU’s Global Strategywas a major step forward in European co-operation.
Ireland has been involved in one Greek-led maritime surveillance PESCO mission, and was an observer on a further nine missions. The Dáil recently voted in favour of the Defence Forces’ full involvement in four projects relating to cyber threats, disaster relief capability, Special Operations Forces medical training and systems for mine countermeasures.
However, PESCO involvement has been strongly criticised by Sinn Féin in Dáil committees and raised questions over a more intense relationship with European armed forces.
Much of the debate in the Dáil centres around Article 42(7) of the Treaty of the European Union, which exempts Ireland from potential participation in an EU army.
This was brought in by the European Union following the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum by the Irish people. It was seen as an undertaking key to the Irish population accepting the treaty in the second vote in the early 2000s.
Palm believes that one key consideration for the Irish Government when it comes to joining with other European Union countries in closer military ties is the financial side of things – if you go it alone, it will be expensive.

“Well, [going it alone is] an option, but something tells me it’s an expensive option; but that’s the choice that you have ultimately – partnership is cheaper.”
Piso, the Military Attaché, said that there are jurisdictions which are also neutral, such as Switzerland, that have close co-operation with other nations, citing their sharing of radar information for air defence.
“This is one of the hot potatoes in Ireland. They don’t want to have foreign soldiers here, to be stationed or to be trained here. We’ve seen the history and that may be very understandable,” Piso said of Pesco.
Palm shares that view, and said he has studied the history around Ireland’s neutrality policy, but suggested that the historic reasons for neutrality are now in a different threat environment.
He said that he believes that the origins of modern Irish neutrality date to World War Two, and the fact the decision was made just 20 years after the War of Independence.
“We have to respect that,” he said.
Palm said that there is a lot of respect for Ireland’s leading non-proliferation work and UN peacekeeping missions, but stressed that the environment has changed.
Key message
Piso believes that thestrategic action planfrom the Irish Defence Forces and Department of Defence was a key message as to Ireland’s intention to grow and modernise its Defence Forces.
Palm said that he has noticed, since arriving in Ireland, that there is now a very involved and detailed discussion on defence topics which didn’t exist when he first came here.
He particularly noted the discussions around removing the Triple Lock mechanism. This is the procedure of dispatching Irish troops abroad, which requires a UN mandate, Government agreement and Dáil vote to dispatch troops.
Palm explained that he has seen a shift by all political parties, some of which have moved away from an absolutist approach to neutrality.
Recently three Dutch warshipsarrived into Cork Harbouron an apparent courtesy visit. The visit included the Karel Doorman, a multi-role vessel similar to one recently proposed for the Irish Naval Service. It was built by a Dutch ship-building firm.
Two other Dutch warships, the HNLMS Groningen and HNLMS Zeven Provincien also visited.
Palm said the visit was for rest and recuperation of crew rather than for any other reason, but an Irish delegation from the Air Corps, Naval Service and Department of Defence visited the Karel Doorman in Cobh.

When it came to the sale of military equipment by Dutch companies, Palm said it was not a concerted campaign by the Dutch embassy in Dublin, but that he would entertain approaches from interested Irish State agencies.
The ambassador said that he and his team were very conscious of the importance of the Irish tendering process, but that he would be willing to set up links with Dutch companies.
One key consideration for Irish military planners is the purchase of primary radar. Piso said that the Dutch had the best radar in the world, which gave “multi-mission” coverage for air, sea and ground operations.
Piso said that the Dutch industry “would not hesitate” to provide such a service if approached by Ireland.
Cable security
Both Palm and Piso spoke at length in regard to the security of pipelines and undersea cables, but said that no approach has been made by Ireland to get help in protecting the infrastructure.
Concerns have been expressed across Europe about the safety of such pipelines following the sabotage of gas pipelines near Denmark. Meanwhile, there have also been concerns about the safety of Irish undersea cables.
Piso said that such an approach from Ireland to other countries for assistance to secure the pipelines would be made through EU mechanisms; that has not happened and he has not seen it in any EU reports. Palm said that the key consideration in this issue is a threat assessment and whether the infrastructure is in danger or not.
He said individual threat assessments, both from NATO and from EU perspectives, give differing views on the risk to the cables.
The ambassador believes that Ireland is “militarily safe” geographically because of its positioning between the US and the UK.
But Piso warns of a “four-dimensional battlespace” in which cyber and other threats combine to threaten countries – he repeatedly stressed as a result the importance of a holistic perspective on defence, as seen in the HSE cyber attack.
Palm believes that the key to understanding how Ireland responds to the changing defence environment is through understanding the risk. Piso explained how the threat is measured: “Risk is measured in the possibility of it happening but also in the impact of if it were to happen.”
“Military and security planners will examine it on that basis, and while the probability of it happening could be low the damage it can cause is also measured. And if the impact would be high then it is classed as a high risk,” he said.
The Dutch team at the embassy in Dublin are slow to talk about specific military relationships between their country and Ireland.
However, clearly there is a desire for greater links, and in the light of Brexit and the war in Ukraine, Ireland has established a new like-minded partner in Europe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nicola-sturgeon-5339021-Jan2021/,"SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER Nicola Sturgeon has said that a united Ireland has been been made “more likely” by Brexit and hinted at her own view of reunification.;
The leader of Scottish National Party made the comments as part of a series of ticketed online interviews being held thisweek by the Irish Times.
Sturgeon was speaking to journalist Fintan O’Toole and said that she has previously speculated about whether a United Ireland would happen before an independent Scotland.
A poll released over the weekend showed thatover half of people in Norther Ireland supported the holding of a referendumon Irish unity in the next five years.
In the same poll, 47% of people surveyed want to remain in the UK, while 42% of people are in favour of a united Ireland and 11% are undecided.
Half of people in Scotland also want an independence referendum, but a majority would support it if a vote was held.

When asked about the her view of a united Ireland, Sturgeon said:
“It is entirely a matter for the people in Ireland… I suspect Brexit probably makes that more likely than it was before.”
Sturgeon did not give her view on whether she’d support Irish unity but said “you can guess my general predilection around it”.

Following the poll at the weekend it was announced that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would be visiting Scotland, with many speculating that it was part of efforts to firm up support for the union.
The visit took place yesterday but Sturgeon had questioned whether it was necessary during the pandemic, saying that politicians have a “duty to lead by example” as the public live under strict restrictions.
During the interview, Sturgeon also described dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic as being the “most stressful” period of her life.

Sturgeon also addressed the inquiry that’s underway by the Scottish parliament into the Scottish Government’s handling of complaints made against her SNP predecessor Alex Salmond.
Earlier this year Salmond was acquittedin court acquitted of 13 sexual offences.
The Court of Session in Edinburgh subsequently ruled the Scottish Government’s handling of complaints against the former first minister to be “unlawful” resulting in a £512,250 payout to Salmond.
Speaking about Salmond’s impact on politics, Sturgeon said:
“It’s incredibly difficult for personal, political reasons and I’m not going to go into all that’s subject to inquiry.”
“Whatever has happened over the past couple of years and whatever happens in the future, the changed relationship between him and I, nobody can take away the massive influence he was on my life.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/protocol-pawn-northern-ireland-5673409-Feb2022/,"AS IF BREXIT and international trading arrangements weren’t complicated enough, the heat of an upcoming Northern Ireland election – where a massive demographic shift is expected to flip the unionist-nationalist dynamic - has added a whole new dimension.
Practical Brexit matters have always been muddied by the political climate in Westminster – but the intricacies of politics in Northern Ireland added another layer of confusion.
“Because of the elections, the Protocol will remain a live issue here,”one expert told us in December. “The DUP in particular sees the majority of its supporters as anti-Protocol, so they will continue to bang that drum next year, which is rational for that party to do.”
The last time we sent out a Brexit newsletter, it was over the resignation of Edwin Poots as DUP leader after just 21 days in power – there were concerns over how that would affect the talks over the Protocol then, and Minister Simon Coveney said it was the last thing Northern Ireland needed.
Just over six months later and we’re back again, writing about another DUP resignation, and more exasperation about how it does little to serve the people of Northern Ireland.
Paul Givan’s resignation as First Minister of Northern Ireland came just a day after Edwin Poots ordered all Brexit checks on agri-goods going from GB to NI to be stopped, giving a spurious argument why he could no longer stand over them.
There is always a local politics angle, and this row is no different. It’s worth noting that at the weekend, Poots was not selected by the DUP as a candidate for the South Down area. Poots had indicated he wanted to leave his Lagan Valley constituency and stand in South Down – before the political drama unfolded on Wednesday night, he blamed Jeffrey Donaldson, his successor as DUP leader, for his failed attempt to become an election candidate in the area.
The party nominated Diane Forsythe as its candidate for South Down instead.

In a statement, the DUP MP Sammy Wilsonsaidthat it was “disappointing that Edwin had not accepted this decision”, and that “any Executive challenge would not result in Edwin replacing Diane as the candidate in South Down”.
Poots then gave an interview on the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster in which he said “Edwin Poots hasn’t gone away” and that his political demise “had not happened yet”.
Givan was also hand-selected for the First Minister role by Poots.
Poots has contended that he is taking action now because the legal position has only recently been clarified by recent court rulings that examined issues around Executive authority (a Belfast High Court orrder has since quashed Poots’ order to civil servants to stop Protocol checks at Northern Ireland ports.)
The UK Government is not impressed

One of the most fascinating responses to Givan stepping down as First Minister was from the UK Government.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewissaid in a statementthat Givan’s decision is “extremely disappointing”, and has urged the DUP to“reinstate their First Minister immediately”– like a parent scolding a bold child.
Despite Lewis saying previously that the British Government would not intervene after Poots ordered all agri-checks at Northern Ireland ports to stop, Lewis changed his tune the following day to say that the UK Government is “fully committed to fixing the problems”, and “will continue intensive talks with the EU in order to resolve these”.
But it’s hard not to see this row as something that was let fester by the British Government –after months of using the Protocol as a political pawn.

Sammy Wilson said this morning that there had been “huge benefits” to Brexit, which aren’t being experienced by Northern Ireland because of the Protocol.
“Brexit has been good for the UK in terms of trade deals… in terms of the fastest growing economy, and the lowest unemployment in Europe”.
But Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney gave an interesting insight into where talks were at, when he said this morning that the decision was especially frustrating because it was coming in the lead up to a solution to be announced at the end of this month.
“What’s frustrating about this… is it’s been very clear to everybody for a number of weeks now that Maroš Šefčovič and Liz Truss were effectively settingthe end of February as a key moment in timeto actually agree a number of compromises that could take some of the heat out of the debate around the implementation of the Protocol, by reducing the checks burden significantly in terms of customs, in terms of SPS, and by making it clear that goods that are staying in Northern Ireland would be treated differently to goods that would potentially be coming across the border into the south.”
This has already been refuted by Donaldson,who claimed that Boris Johnson told him there’s only a “20% to 30% chance”of new deal for Northern Ireland in next few weeks.
But he also added that Donaldson has been threatening to pull his support for a while, and it won’t stop progress between the EU and the UK.
“They have been saying for some time that if they didn’t get what they wanted in relation to the Protocol that they would do this… It doesn’t change things much actually.”
That leaves the devolved government in the North as the most affected in this row.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-5374884-Mar2021/,"THE RECENT UNILATERAL British decision on the Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol was, without any doubt, a further breach of the spirit of a binding international agreement.
Whether it was also a breach of international law will only be formally determined when thelegal proceedingsbeing taken by the European Commission reach their conclusion.
However, many reasonable people may already take the view that the main lesson the Johnson Government learned from its similar stunt last autumn is not to announce publicly in the House of Commons that it intends to break the law.
The EU, reflecting its own unqualified attachment to the rule of law, is challenging by legal means what it considers to be a serious breach of the law.
Different approaches
This is the right approach but will necessarily take some time. Therefore, it may be more practical to focus for now on the breach of the spirit of the Protocol which is immediate and unquestionable.
To recognise the disturbing breach of that spirit, one need only glance at the sensible shared work that the British and European negotiators, Michael Gove and Maroš Šefčovič, had been taking forward to implement the Protocol.
Advertisement
On 11 February they issued a joint statement committing both sides to intensify their work on the Protocol in order to address all outstanding issues and find workable solutions.
Following a further meeting on 24 February, they took note of the progress being made and “acknowledged the importance of joint action to make the Protocol work for the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland”.
This breach of the spirit of the Protocol, and inevitably of trust, has six inevitable and predictable consequences.
First, it makes the work of the various UK/EU joint committees, relating both to Northern Ireland and other issues, more difficult to take forward. It is hard to play marbles with someone who threatens at every moment to pick up his marbles and go home. If someone’s word is not consistently their bond, the value of that word is diminished.
If the EU had similarly breached the spirit of the shared work on implementing the Protocol, the British response would have been nothing like as measured as that of the calm and admirable Šefčovič. Despite the provocation, the EU will continue to try to keep the work as close to on track as possible.
More delays
Second, the date for ratification of the overall EU/UK Brexit trade deal is now in doubt. Even though that deal reflects the UK’s disappointing level of ambition for the future relationship, it remains far better for both sides than “no deal”.
Third, there are many areas, beyond the Brexit trade deal itself, in which the future EU/UK relationship still needs to be thrashed out and in relation to which mutual trust is essential.
For example, the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has criticised the EU for its reluctance to grant “equivalence” to UK financial services, even describing the EU approach as of “dubious legality”. It is surely clear that Bailey’s first port of call in pursuing his not unreasonable objectives should be Downing Street rather than the Berlaymont.

The Irish Government and, I believe, the vast majority of people across the British administration will continue to work sincerely to nurture Irish/British relations in the post-Brexit world. But many, on both sides of the Irish Sea, will also recognise that Frost’s impulsive swagger is an impediment.
Needless to say, the ultimate responsibility for his behaviour lies at a higher level.
Special relationship
Fifth, with utter predictability, the move has drawn the Biden administration back into the debate. The UK has said that its recent action is strictly temporary. If it turns out not to be, or if it drags on indefinitely, or if it is followed by further challenges to the Protocol, the US Government will weigh in.
Finally, the EU shares the UK’s aim of responding to concerns in Northern Ireland about the implementation of Protocol, by applying the maximum degree of flexibility compatible with its effective implementation.
However, any hint that implementation is entirely in British hands, or that timelines are infinitely flexible, will not encourage the necessary acceptance by critics in Northern Ireland that the Protocol is a balanced, irreversible, legally-binding international commitment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-talks-5409497-Apr2021/,"BRITISH BREXIT MINISTER David Frost and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic will meet tomorrow as efforts continue to resolve issues around Northern Ireland’s trading arrangements.
Frost will travel to Brussels after talks between the two sides have so far failed to resolve significant differences over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the special arrangements designed to prevent a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.
The meeting was confirmed by the European Commission, which said the pair will “take stock of ongoing technical work” on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The minister and Sefcovic will also “provide a political steer for both teams on outstanding issues”, commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said.
Loyalists and unionists are vehemently opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has created new economic barriers between the region and the rest of the UK.
The arrangements, agreed by the UK and European Union as a way to keep the land border on the island of Ireland free-flowing, have been cited as one of the key causal factors behind the violence.
A UK government spokesman said: “This meeting is part of our ongoing engagement with the EU to work through the outstanding issues with the protocol, in order to restore confidence on the ground, reflect the needs of communities and respect all dimensions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.

“The discussions so far have been constructive but there are still significant differences that need to be resolved.
“Both the UK and EU are continuing to engage with business, civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland to understand the issues they are facing.”

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney is in London today for a series of talks with Frost, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as well as senior Labour politicians.
Discussions today and tomorrow are expected to include the situation in Northern Ireland and EU-UK relations.
The European Parliament’s foreign affairs and trade committees will vote on the Brexit deal this week, but no date has yet been set for a full plenary vote to ratify the agreement.
The Trade and Cooperation Agreement, reached by Boris Johnson with Brussels on Christmas Eve, has been in place provisionally since the start of the year.
The UK agreed to extend the provisional application until the end of April, but a date has still not been set for MEPs to approve it as they remain concerned about the implementation of the earlier Withdrawal Agreement – the Brexit divorce deal which includes the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Downing Street said it had agreed the April extension and expected the EU “to complete their processes to this timeline”.

Under the deal, Northern Ireland remained part of the EU’s single market for goods, meaning products arriving from Great Britain face EU import regulations.
The UK unilaterally extended grace periods covering areas of the economy supermarket supplies and parcel deliveries to Northern Ireland from Great Britain, meaning post-Brexit checks are not yet fully applied.
The first of the grace periods had been due to expire at the end of March, but the UK extended them until October in a move which has triggered a legal row with the EU.
The UK has sought extra time to respond to the legal challenge.
Johnson’s official spokesman said: “It’s in line with precedent that typically allows for around two months to respond to proceedings of this kind.
“We have agreed with the EU that we will respond to the letter of formal notice by mid-May.
“We have always been clear that the measures we’ve taken are lawful and part of the progressive and good faith implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-anglo-irish-relations-2-5622486-Dec2021/,"AFTER FOUR YEARS of predictions, prognostications and recriminations over Brexit, the rubber finally hit the road in 2020 when Britain formally left the European Union on New Year’s Day.
And with a little under a year of data and experience now at our disposal, we’re starting to be able to make some concrete observations about the new arrangements and how they’re shaping Ireland’s relationships — North and south — with both Britain and continental Europe.
Over the past six weeks atThe Journal, as part of The Good Information Project, we’ve taken a detailed look at different Brexit from a few different angles — diplomacy, trade and politics among others.
Here’s a quick rundown of the work we did:
The goal, firstly, was to trace the outline of what we’ve gleaned from the first year of Brexit and, secondly, to get a sense of what we can expect in the second year.
Our decision to look at Brexit over the course of this, the final Good Information Project cycle of 2021, was largely influenced by the ongoing diplomatic row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
With the twin threats of Article 16 and a potential tit-for-tat trade war between the EU and the UK hitting the headlines in November, it seemed a perfect time to take stock of how Ireland’s external relationships had changed over the course of the year.
The immediacy of that threat has dissipated in recent weeks for a number of reasons.
Crucially, as Gráinne Ní Aodha wrote recently, there now seems to be a greater understanding by the UK that as a legal tool, the use ofArticle 16 is rather limited.
If the UK government was to trigger it, it would only be able to suspend some parts of the NI Protocol temporarily, and in very limited circumstances. Doing so would not get rid of the Protocol or solve any of the problems associated with it.
But while the hands of the doomsday clock have moved slightly away from midnight, the debate over the Protocol isn’t going anywhere for the moment.
Why? For one, the row has already proved a useful distraction for the Tories, embroiled as they were ina scandal about lobbying at the beginning of November.
Happily, for Johnson and company, it was around then that certain elements of the British press began clamouring for Article 16 to be triggered by mid-November, Gráinne Ní Aodha wrote. But by the end of the month, junior Tory ministers were pouring cold water on the notion that this would happen before Christmas.

While the EU and its diplomats are keen to move on from the row and draw a line under Brexit altogether, it doesn’t look like an agreement will be reached this side of Christmas.
It’s a good example of how Brexit hasn’t quite been put to bed and why we should continue to expect flare-ups in 2022. It also shows why Ireland needs to maintain strong relations with Britain.
Key allies
Of course, it’s worth noting that Britain was once one of Ireland’s key allies in Europe.
While both countries were diametrically opposed on some issues — chiefly, the Common Agriculture Policy — Ireland and the UK had “common ground”, for exampleon the issue of European military integration, asThe Journal’sRónán Duffy highlighted.
“Ireland was keen to maintain its neutrality, with the UK suspicious of anything that might undermine its commitment to Nato,” he wrote.
The other side of this, as Fianna Fáil MEP for Dublin Barry Andrews pointed out in his contribution toThe Journal’sBrexit cycle, is that Ireland isn’t exactly central to the agenda of British politics.
He wrote: “The orthodox view for years was that, for UK Prime Ministers, there was nothing to be gained in getting involved in Ireland.”
Although that stance was challenged by the likes of John Major and Tony Blair from the 1990s onwards, the reality is that British-Irish relations have deteriorated over the past decade, particularly as Brexit has come into play.
Commercial relationships are also deteriorating, according to the trade statistics. In the year to the end of September, the value of Irish imports from Great Britain fell by 32% over the same period last year.
Commercial ties
At the same time, cross-border trade has boomed in 2021 and so haveIrish ports like Rosslare.
Brexit has totally upended the established rhythms of Irish trade on both sides of the border.
It has forced businesses in Northern Ireland — which effectively remains in the EU’s Single Market under the Protocol — to source from and sell more to southern businesses in a bid to circumvent the red tape associated with importing from Great Britain.
At the same time, many UK businesses are increasingly unwilling to negotiate the new customs landscape.
Related ReadsWielding a gun with no ammunition: The UK, the EU and the battle over the Northern Ireland ProtocolOpen thread: Has Brexit changed how you think of Britain?
“There’s a whole cohort of Great British businesses going, ‘Do you know what? We can’t be arsed,’” Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI,toldThe Journalrecently.
Brexit has also driven businesses in the Republic of Ireland towards Europe.
“I definitely got a sense from around March, April last year, exporters and importers were beginning to look at alternative suppliers,” Glenn Carr, chief executive of Rosslare Europort, toldThe Journal.
Irish businesses dealing with European customers or suppliers are increasingly looking to avoid the UK land bridge — routes connecting Ireland and Europe via British ports like Holyhead — altogether.
This is driving demand for direct sailings, a phenomenon that is helping to transform Rosslare from a regional hub to a port of “national significance”, Carr says. Overall, there are now 44 direct routes from ports in Ireland to continental Europe — up from just a dozen last year.
Consequently, the volume of freight moving through Rosslare either to or from Europe has increased by a staggering 378% in the past year.
The six million Euro question is whether these changes are permanent are just an immediate reaction to the upheaval. And that leads to even more questions.
Will Brexit continue to strengthen ties within the all-island economy or drive a further wedge between Dublin and Belfast around issues like professional qualification recognition, which is not guaranteed under the terms of the Protocol?
Can we expect fresh tension between Dublin and Brussels on the one side and London on the other depending on the prevailing political winds blowing through Westminster?
Will Johnson’s government even reach an agreement with the EU over the Protocol?
All of these questions will have to be answered in 2022. So while this cycle of The Good Information Project is concluding,The Journal’scoverage of Brexit is not.

https://www.thejournal.ie/an-post-delays-post-uk-royal-mail-5965169-Jan2023/,"AN POST HAS said it is currently experiencing delays in delivering mail due to the busy Christmas period and the impact of Royal Mail strikes in the UK.
It comes after a number of people took to social media in recent days to report that they were experiencing delays in receiving items ordered before Christmas.
One person wrote that they had purchased something from the UK that had shipped on 30 December, but it had yet to be delivered.
Another person wrote that they had ordered something from the UK on 7 December, which had yet to arrive.
Postal workers at Royal Mail held strikes across November and December due to a long-running dispute over pay and working conditions. Delays have been reported across the UK due to their impact.
Parcel firm Evri today apologised to UK customers who are continuing to wait for delayed Christmas deliveries, saying that staff shortages, Royal Mail strikes and bad weather had contributed to the problems.
Speaking toThe Journal, head of communications at An Post Anna McHugh said there are “big problems” with post coming from and leaving the UK due to recent strike action.
“They’ve had ongoing industry relations problems there, so there’s huge delays, both in their delivery of mail across Britain and their despatch of international parcels in particular,” McHugh said.
“Our operations team has seen many Royal Mail parcels arriving out of sequence as well, so stuff that was posted later in December is arriving sooner than stuff that was posted weeks ago.”
McHugh said there is also an annual “unusual phenomenon” where An Post receives a batch of late Christmas cards and letters from Royal Mail, all of which are ‘underpaid’.
This happens due to British stamps being put on mail being sent to Ireland, which don’t actually cover the postage cost.
“People in the UK stick a British first class or second class stamp on cards for Ireland – it happens every year – and that doesn’t cover postage to Ireland. They’re supposed to use international stamps for Ireland,” she said.
“Royal Mail kind of gather them all up, fill up a container and eventually send them on to us. They don’t often land until the end of January.”
McHugh said she hopes that the balance of outstanding UK parcels will arrive in the next week or so.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme, managing director of An Post Commercial Garrett Bridgeman said that Royal Mail’s failure to invest in its network has resulted in its service deteriorating to “a very low level”.
Advertisement
“Failing to invest in their network and their services has resulted in significant deterioration of service for customers in the UK, lots of industrial disputes, and this has resulted in their service really falling and deteriorating to a very low level,” he said.
Bridgeman said An Post is with working Royal Mail to ensure that post still coming from the UK is delivered, adding that as soon as product lands into Ireland, it will be delivered within 24 hours.
People have also reported delays in receiving international parcels on social media, with one user writing that a parcel ordered from China had been sorted in a Dublin parcel hub on 29 December, but still had not been delivered.
McHugh said An Post is not aware of “any massive issues” with delays, but that new EU customs regulations have been causing delays recently.
These regulations state that electronic customs data and documentation for all items coming into Ireland from non-EU countries – including Britain – must be provided by the sender, along with necessary customs duty, excise duty and VAT.
If they are not provided, Irish Revenue rules dictate that they must be returned to sender.
“There’s no underestimating the impact of the new EU customs regulations. They’re really significant, and there’s no doubt that Irish revenue has taken a very stringent approach to their implementation,” McHugh said.
“The bigger online retailers have systems in place. It’s where you’re dealing with personal gifts coming maybe from family or friends or those small SMEs who just aren’t aware of it, haven’t been informed and are falling outside of the new regulations, and a whole level of Brexit denial in Britain as well.
“It isn’t well known, a lot of people are not aware, so you’re relying really on people here who have been affected to let their friends and family know to get these things in order. It’s very difficult, and not at all customer friendly.”
She said other issues such as weather and ongoing pandemic issues in sending countries could also have an impact on items being delayed.
“People forget that there are still waves of Covid doing the rounds that impact, locally, in bigger countries that can result in slowdowns, staff issues. And of course, weather at this time of year, particularly from places like the States and Canada, but that wouldn’t be out of the ordinary this time of year.”
McHugh said An Post have also been impacted by a higher level of sick absence recently, but that it wasn’t having “too bad an impact on deliveries”.
“In some areas we have had to restrict deliveries for standard mail to alternate days, but generally if someone has a cold for example, they are only off work for a couple of days,” she said.
“Obviously Covid, flu or more serious viruses will require longer absence, but staff all work together to get daily deliveries done as best they can. Thankfully the weather has been generally good also – snow and ice are what we dread at this time of year.”
She said the busier Christmas period usually results in post being slower, which is now followed almost immediately by online sales across the majority of retailers.
“There used to be a bit of a gap and things would be quiet for January, but that doesn’t happen because the sales starts on Christmas Day and a lot of people actually wait for them to buy their Christmas presents and things.
“Then you’re straight into it, all the sales are on now, and then you’re starting already in spring, summer. So it kind of never stops anymore.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-on-the-northern-ireland-brexit-trade-row-5343616-Feb2021/,"THERE ARE PROBLEMS with post-Brexit trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, no doubt.
Those problems have been highlighted this week when the UK government admitted that the issues weren’t simply “teething problems”, as it had said previously. Attention was also drawn to the Protocol when Northern Ireland and the European Commission told staff they temporarily didn’t have to carry out checks, amid possible threats to staff.
Despite a grace-period that the UK government introduced, which would mean that supermarkets don’t have to have health certificates for all agri-food products being sent from GB to NI, trade is still disrupted.
In the House of Commons yesterday, senior Cabinet minister Michael Gove acknowledged for the first time that the problems were not “teething issues”, but in fact quite significant logistical obstacles.
These practical Brexit problems, and any possible solutions, have been muddied by the history of Northern Ireland politics: whether checks happen at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports, or along a land border on the island of Ireland, is a deeply sensitive political issue.
But Brexit was voted for by the British public on 23 June 2016. Both a divorce deal and a trade agreement were struck between the EU and the UK, then ratified in the two relevant parliaments, and so have a legal and democratic basis for being implemented.
What is the Protocol again?

The Northern Irish Protocol was a part of the Withdrawal Agreement that aimed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.
The backstop was to be one way of avoiding a hard border, but was flatly rejected by MPs in three votes over Theresa May’s Brexit deal – including the DUP.Put simply, the backstop meant the North (or the whole of the UK) would remain in the EU’s Custom Union to avoid checks.
Despite the Irish Government’s insistence that the backstop had to remain as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, another version of the Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed.
This version, which is now being put into practice, would mean that a regulatory and customs border would be placed along the Irish Sea, instead of on the island of Ireland.
This has left Northern Ireland in the EU’s Single Market (free movement of goods and people) while Great Britain has left it.
Northern Ireland and GB have both left the Customs Union, but customs checks on goods are carried out at NI ports and airports, instead of along the Irish border. If goods travel from GB through NI to Ireland, tariffs paid at the Irish Sea border won’t be rebated; if they stay in Northern Ireland, they will be reimbursed.

What checks are in place now?

New Brexit-related checks are being carried out at ports in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, instead of erecting new infrastructure along the jurisdictional border on the island of Ireland.
Goods can continue to move freely on the island of Ireland. Goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain are largely unaffected, but trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland faces a number of bureaucratic barriers.
These include animal and plant safety checks (called SPS or sanitary and phytosanitary checks), customs declarations for commercial goods, and physical inspections for some freight deliveries.
The physical checks are what were called off after possible threats to staff at Belfast Port and Larne Port this week. All other elements of the Protocol are continuing.
Are all the new Brexit checks in place now?

No.
The health certs needed for the SPS checks are not required by supermarket hauliers for the next three months to help businesses adjust – but Michael Gove has formally requested that this be extended until 2023.
There is also a three-month grace period that means the majority of parcels sent to Northern Ireland from GB do not need customs declarations. This will end on 1 April.
Producers of sausages and other chilled meats – which are on a list of products that are banned from entering the Single Market from outside the EU – have also been granted a six-month grace period to allow imports from GB to NI until June.
Some of those problems

There has been a myriad of problems with trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. To name a few:
‘Green or orange’ issues
At the centre of this very complicated logistical and bureaucratic headache is a very sensitive political situation in Northern Ireland.
Responding to how the Irish Protocol has become an issue yet again, SDLP MLA Colin McGrath told a Seanad Committeeyesterdaythat cultural and political sensitivities are being entangled with trade and logistical problems in carrying out Brexit checks in Northern Ireland.

Speaking on RTÉ Radio this morning, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney defended the Protocol by saying Brexit was the real problem, but also conceded “there are elements in terms of implementation that are causing real problems”.
“I think what what senior politicians need to do now is look at ways in which pragmatism can be applied to the implementation of the Protocol in the context of flexibility and grace periods where appropriate, but it has to be done within the context of the protocol itself.”
‘Free us from the Protocol’
The DUP, on the other side, is calling for the Protocol to be abandoned completely. The partyreleased a statementlast night to ask for all checks in the Protocol to be called off. Here is the party’s five-point plan:
The inference from this plan is to have checks carried out on the Irish border, rather than the Irish Sea border. The DUP has called on Article 16 of the Protocol to be invoked in order to do this.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in the House of Commonstodaythat he would consider taking this action in order to solve those problems.
“We will do everything we need to do, legislatively or by invoking Article 16 of the protocol, to ensure there is no barrier down the Irish Sea.”
Though this would solve the disruption to GB-NI trade, it would cause huge problems on the island of Ireland, as it would almost certainly mean checks along the Irish border.
UK government calls for transition periods
UK GovernmentUK Government
In a letter sent by Michael Gove to the European Commission, he asked for the extension of the grace period (which is basically a transition period) for supermarkets and for customs checks on parcel deliveries until 1 January 2023, and to include more businesses in that cohort.
He also asked for a “permanent solution” to the chilled and processed meats ban, and some arrangements to solve issues around medicines, and pet travel.
“I must make clear that the UK Government seeks urgent resolution of these problems in the context of our obligations to seek commonly acceptable solutions,” he wrotein a letter published today.
“If it is not possible to agree a way forward in the way we propose, then the UK will consider using all instruments at its disposal.”

UK PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak is under fire after a meeting between King Charles and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen was cancelled
Von der Leyen is no longer expected to travel to the UK to meet Sunak for further in-person talks about the Northern Ireland Protocol, UK Government sources have confirmed.
According to Sky News, the commission leader was also scheduled to meet King Charles at Windsor Castle while in the UK tomorrow.
The Prime Minister’s political judgement has been criticised for involving Britain’s head of state, who traditionally does not get involved in politics in any way.
There were talks about calling a potential protocol pact the “Windsor Agreement” after a meeting with the king, the broadcaster said.
Sunak’s critics said the scheduled meeting brought into question his handling of the protocol negotiations.
Conservative Eurosceptic and former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Times of London the planned meeting with the King was “on the borderline of constitutional propriety”.
Sammy Wilson, a DUP MP, said any Windsor rendezvous with the EU leader would have been “a cynical use” of the King’s position and seen in Unionist circles as the sovereign endorsing the deal.
He branded the Prime Minister “naive” and accused him of “dragging the King into a hugely controversial political issue”.
Kate Hoey, a Northern Irish Brexit supporter and former Labour MP, said any such meeting would have been “outrageous”.
UK Government sources said that, while Von der Leyen’s trip was no longer going ahead, it would not have been improper for the King, as head of state, to meet a visiting European leader.
“It would be wrong to suggest the King would be involved in anything remotely political,” a Government source told the PA news agency.
Buckingham Palace said it would not be commenting.

No 10 said talks between Sunak and von der Leyen would occur within the coming days, without being more exact on timings.
White smoke appeared to be on the horizon over a protocol fix after a Downing Street source said a phone call between the Sunak and von der Leyen had been “positive” and there had been “good progress” made.
No 10 sources also confirmed that Sunak had “constructive engagement” this week with supermarket bosses and parcel operators about the protocol and the reforms he is striving to make.
They were developments that were interpreted as another step towards announcing a deal which is designed to reduce the customs headaches being encountered by retailers trading between Northern Ireland and Britain.
Speculation of an imminent deal increased further when it emerged Tory MPs were being ordered into Parliament on a three-line whip on Monday, meaning they must be in the Commons.
Cabinet ministers were also reportedly on alert for a possible conference call over the weekend.
Unusually, Downing Street declined to set out Sunak’s plans for the weekend, only saying that he was working in No 10.
The protocol, signed by former British prime minister Boris Johnson in 2020, was designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the European Union’s single market.
But the treaty has incensed unionists due to the trade barriers it has created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
Sunak had reportedly been keen to announce a deal this week but No 10 today said that “intensive negotiations” with Brussels were still under way.
Any announcement of a deal is expected to set up a possible clash with Conservative Brexit hardliners.
Sunak has promised that the House of Commons will be able to “express its view” over any deal, which he hopes will get the DUP to restore powersharing in the North.
But he would come under intense pressure if he does not give MPs an explicit vote, amid fears there could be a rebellion.
Since entering No 10 in October, Sunak has backed away from reforms on contentious issues such as planning rules when confronted with a potential backbench revolt.

The gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh marks Sunak’s first outing on the world stage, with the one-on-one with the EU chief kicking off a packed day of diplomacy.
The bilateral meeting came amid ongoing tensions with the bloc over the post-Brexit trading treaty.
“On the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Prime Minister reiterated the need to find solutions to the very real problems it had created on the ground in Northern Ireland,” Downing Street said.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation – the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill – which would empower ministers to scrap parts of the arrangements brokered as part of the Brexit divorce deal without the approval of Brussels.
The European Commission has warned that such unilateral action at Westminster would be in breach of international law and could prompt retaliatory action.

UK officials described as “constructive” the first round of talks in Brussels this week, which came after the EU proposed new measures earlier this month.
It is understood that while there was common ground in some areas, there were still substantial gaps on what were seen as fundamental issues mainly surrounding governance.
Sources close to the negotiations said “real progress” must be made soon and a process of “endless negotiation” must be avoided. But reports over Christmas crackers being delayed by the protocol was “yet another practical example” of the disruption caused by the agreement.
A team from the European Commission is set to travel to London on Tuesday for several days of intensive discussions.
Brexit minister David Frost and EU Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic are then due to meet in person in Westminster for talks at the end of the week.

The two leaders will take stock and assess progress so far.
A UK Government source said: “The talks this week were constructive and we’ve heard some things from the EU that we can work with – but the reality is that we are still far apart on the big issues, especially governance.
“There’s been plenty of speculation about governance this week but our position remains unchanged: the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in resolving disputes between the UK and EU must end.
“Whether we’re able to establish that momentum soon will help us determine if we can bridge the gap or if we need to use Article 16 to safeguard the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement”.
The protocol, which was agreed by the EU and UK to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland, has created a series of economic barriers on the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Measures proposed by the EU would see an 80% reduction in checks envisaged for retail agri-food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
The proposed changes also remove the prospect of certain British produce, including Cumberland sausages, being banned from export to the region.
The EU plan to ease the resultant trade friction also includes a 50% reduction in customs paperwork required.

And more products and companies would be exempt from customs tariffs as a result of expanding trusted trader arrangements and a concept that differentiates between goods destined for Northern Ireland and those “at risk” of onward transportation into the Republic.
The EU has also offered to legislate to ensure no disruption to the supply line of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
However, the measures contained in four separate papers published by the bloc do not offer any concession on a key UK Government demand, the removal of the oversight role for the ECJ.
Frost has made clear the removal of the court’s oversight function in policing the protocol is a red line for the Government if a compromise deal is to be struck.
Under the terms of the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and EU as part of the 2020 Withdrawal Agreement, the ECJ would be the final arbitrator in any future trade dispute between the two parties on the operation of the protocol.
The UK now wants to remove that provision and replace it with an independent arbitration process.
The European Commission has insisted it will not move on the ECJ issue.

European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic told German news website Der Spiegel that problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol – a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit – meant the UK “broke international law” in trying to get round the arrangement.
But he said he is still confident that a compromise can be found between the two sides, although he admitted it will not be easy.
Sefcovic told Der Spiegel he is “pragmatic” about Foreign Secretary Liz Truss taking on responsibility for post-Brexit negotiations with the EU, after Brexit minister Lord Frost resigned earlier this month.
But he warned that if Truss was to trigger Article 16, a move that would effectively unilaterally suspend the treaty agreed between the UK and the EU, it would throw into jeopardy “the foundation of the entire deal” reached between the two sides.

EU CHIEF URSULA von der Leyen has briefed the Taoiseach about the state of negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol ahead of talks with Rishi Sunak.
EU and UK leaders are meeting today in a bid to resolve the Northern Ireland Protocol, despite reservations among Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers.
There is mounting speculation that the EU and UK could unveil a deal aimed at breaking the impasse over the contentious post-Brexit trading arrangements early next week.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke this morning to von der Leyen, who briefed him on the state-of-play ahead of her meeting with Sunak.
A Government spokesperson said that Varadkar expressed his “strong wish” to see a positive outcome that provides a new foundation for relationships and that he hoped for an agreement that “can pave the way for restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement”.
Varadkar and von der Leyen agreed to stay in contact over the coming days as the matter progresses.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the fringes of the Munich Security Conference today to try to get an agreement over the line.
Ahead of his trip to Germany, Sunak stressed that “there’s more work to do” as he vowed to continue “intensely” negotiating with the EU.
“We have not got a deal yet,” he told reporters in Downing Street.
“That’s why both the Foreign Secretary and I, but also the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, will continue talking to the European Union to try and find solutions to protect Northern Ireland’s place in our internal market and the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, resolve the practical issues and address the democratic deficit.”

The term “democratic deficit” is used by unionists to describe the application of EU rules in the region without local politicians having an influence on them.
Sunak said he had “positive conversations” with the five main Stormont parties in Belfast yesterday, although DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson has reportedly said the current proposal “falls short of what would be acceptable” to the party.
The UK and the EU have been engaged in substantive negotiations over the workings of the protocol, which was included in the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure the free movement of goods between the Republic and Northern Ireland after Brexit.
Unionists claim it has weakened Northern Ireland’s place within the UK and the DUP has used its Stormont veto to collapse the powersharing institutions in protest at the arrangements.
Senior figures within the DUP and the European Research Group of the Tory party want any deal to remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Northern Ireland as well as deal with trading.
While it is understood the EU and the UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to end the application of EU law in the region.
The EU says a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in the region.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is “quietly confident” that an agreement between the UK and the EU could be reached soon.
“A lot of progress is being made, we are not there yet but certainly a lot off trust has been built up between the European Commission and Ireland and the British government,” Varadkar told reporters in Limerick yesterday.
“I do believe the prospect is there of having an agreement possibly within a week – it’s not finalised we haven’t all seen the final text yet, but we are getting there,” he said.
“But most importantly, it opens the prospect of getting the Assembly and Executive up and running in Northern Ireland so that people have a government functioning in Northern Ireland and have the Good Friday Agreement working again.”","8.21am, 18 Feb 2023",18 Feb 2023

BREXIT MINISTER DAVID Frost is to submit a new Northern Ireland Protocol to the European Commission today,he told a conference in Lisbon.
Frost took issue with the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the current Protocol, and asked that the “poison be drawn” from the debate.
In a speech to the diplomatic community in Lisbon today, Frost warned that the Protocol cannot survive without fundamental reform to governance arrangements, and that it was drawn up “in extreme haste at a time of great uncertainty”.
When asked about the differences between the UK’s proposal and the Protocol, Frost said the UK wanted an arrangement “where goods can move around the United Kingdom fairly freely, that EU goods can move freely around Northern Ireland, and that the governance over these rules should be “normal” – meaning without ECJ oversight.
Frost said that when the UK Government signed up to the Protocol, it “knew some aspects of the Protocol were problematic,” and “didn’t support them but we agreed with them as it was the right thing to do for the country overall”.
Earlier in his speech, Frost said that they would also “fully” consider the EU’s proposal for changes to improve the current Protocol, which are to be published tomorrow.
Frost said that “actually we’re not” obsessed with Brexit, and that the UK view the EU as an organisation “that doesn’t always want us to succeed”.
“If there is a trust problem, as we’re constantly told there is, it’s not the responsibility of only one party,” he said.
Before Frost delivered his address, leaks of what the address would include, published in the Daily Telegraph, prompted the Irish Government of accusing the UK of creating a “red line” barrier to resolving the dispute over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Reacting to Frosts comments earlier, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said that the most recent demands from the UK Government “are very hard to accept”.
“The role of the ECJ is to adjudicate on European laws and European standards. I don’t see how that could be handed to a British court or other courts.”
SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole said: “The European Union is poised to make proposals which we hope will contribute to repairing relationships across these islands and managing the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and Britain under the Protocol.
“It is a fact that Lord Frost negotiated the protocol, agreed to its terms and backed Boris Johnson’s campaign to sell it during the last general election. To suggest now that he did not support it is an industrious piece of dissembling.”

Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Frost was setting demands he knew the EU could not move on and questioned whether the UK really wanted to agree a way forward.
Frost’s speech comes a day before the EU is due to produce its plans to resolve issues with the Protocol, which has led to the creation of economic barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain.
The protocol is intended to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic stays open while protecting the single market, which Northern Ireland remains a part of.
However the need for checks on goods crossing to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK has led to growing tensions both within Northern Ireland and between London and Brussels.
The EU plan is likely to include a proposal that chilled meats can continue crossing the Irish Sea after the end of current grace periods, in a move to alleviate the so-called sausage wars.

Ahead of his speech, Downing Street said the UK had signed up to the Protocol “good faith” but the way it was being operated by the EU could not continue.
“It was formed in the spirit of compromise in challenging circumstances,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.
“Since then we have seen how the EU is inclined to operate the governance arrangements, issuing infraction proceedings against the UK at the first sign of disagreement.
“These arrangements aren’t sustainable. We need to find a new way of resolving issues that arise between us using mechanisms normal in other international treaties.
“It is unheard of for bilateral agreements being policed by the courts of one of the parties.”
Coveney questioned why the UK had signed up to an agreement which made the the ECJ the final arbiter of the protocol when it was now such an “absolute red line” for them.
“This is being seen across the European Union as the same pattern over and over again – the EU tries to solve problems, the UK dismisses the solutions before they’re even published and asks for more,” he said.

ARLENE FOSTER HAS insisted the decision of her party colleague to stop work on building permanent Irish Sea trade checks can only be overturned by a court.
Foster rejected the suggestion that DUP Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons could be overruled by the wider Stormont Executive on the issue.
Lyons sparked controversy on Friday night when he announced he had ordered officials to halt work on planned permanent facilities to carry out inspections on GB goods required under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
His decision, taken as part of the wider DUP strategy to undermine the protocol, did not impact ongoing checks that are being carried out at temporary facilities at Northern Ireland ports.
Foster disputed that contention yesterday when asked about the issue at a Stormont press conference.
“Gordon has taken the decision based on evidence and law that he has looked at and the decision still stands until it is overturned by a court,” she said.
“I know that others take contrary views in relation to that, but that has been the position when other decisions have been taken by ministers in the past which have had to be taken to court and given the determination there.
“The decision still stands until it is overruled by a court.”
Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill offered a very different interpretation.
O’Neill said Lyons’s announcement was ineffective because it did not have the endorsement of the wider Executive.
She insisted he required Executive approval and said he had made no formal proposal to fellow ministers.
“The Executive’s position remains that it’s our duty to implement the protocol. It’s clear that any move to change that position would require an Executive decision,” she said.

Rival politicians have accused Lyons of stunt politics and have insisted he does not have the authority to act unilaterally on issues considered significant or controversial.
Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance parties have made clear such decisions can only be taken by the Executive as a whole.
“The agriculture minister has yet to bring a proposal to the Executive to change the status quo. And if he does so then clearly we will engage in that.
“But as things stand, the protocol’s here to stay. That’s been rehearsed now repeatedly by the British Government and the EU side and what we need to get on with now is actually providing stability and certainty to our local businesses, to be looking at how the protocol can be made simpler where it can, where we can achieve flexibilities where we can, and that’s where all efforts should be.”

O’Neill added: “I am yet to understand if anything has happened apart from an instruction being given by a minister. I don’t believe that any action has changed in terms of the current workings of what’s happening at the ports.”
Early yesterday there were robust exchanges on the issue during an Executive meeting.
Northern Ireland is continuing to follow the EU’s trade rules to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
That has disrupted some trade from Great Britain since Brussels requires extra checks on the Irish Sea to ensure compliance with Europe’s single-market standards.
Permanent checking facilities are due to be built at Belfast, Larne, Warrenpoint and Foyle ports.
Physical construction has not begun at any of the sites, with work still in the design and preparatory phases.
The DUP and other unionist parties in Northern Ireland are pushing for the protocol to be ditched, claiming it has driven an economic wedge between the region and Great Britain which undermines the union.
Lyons was pressed on the issue during Assembly question time on Tuesday.
“A lot of people want to put their heads in the sand,” he said. “We do face fundamental questions, we have fundamental concerns and challenges.”
He listed a series of problems with the protocol, including:
– Red tape and additional bureaucracy.
– Reduction in consumer choice.
– Problems facing hauliers transporting goods from Great Britain.
– Creation of barriers within the UK’s internal market.
– Businesses in Great Britain feeling they are not able to trade because of extra costs.
– Restrictions on livestock movements.
– Problems bringing guide dogs across the Irish Sea.
– Challenges transporting machinery.
Lyons added: “It is so, so important that we get an alternative to the protocol.
“No amount of tinkering with it is going to make it work. It needs to go.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/government-coveney-uk-border-pass-proposal-5719368-Mar2022/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS appealed to the UK for “special treatment” for the island of Ireland, citing serious concerns about a planned requirement for foreigners to have an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) pass when crossing the border.
Yesterday, MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject a House of Lords amendment that sought to ditch the requirement for foreigners to have an ETA pass when making a local journey to Northern Ireland from the Republic.
The plan has proved controversial, even as the UK Government has insisted it will not mean checks at the border.
The border proved a major sticking point in Brexit negotiations amid concerns the seamless nature of movement between the two jurisdictions could be effected by the UK exit from the EU.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney raised the issue during a meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis in Dublin today, as part of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
Coveney said he made his concerns clear during the meeting but acknowledged the plan would not mean checks.
“The concern we have is that for many, many years now the British and Irish governments have worked together to ensure free movement in the island of Ireland, north and south, is protected,” Coveney said.
He said he held out hope that Irish concerns might still be heeded, adding: “I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet.”
Coveney said the relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland was a unique one.
He added: “I suppose not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatments to try to protect that relationship.”

Lewis defended the move and played down the concerns that have been raised about the proposal. He stressed there would be no checks at the border.
Lewis said: “The ETA is a system that countries around the world have been bringing into place over the last decade or so. We’ve seen the EU bringing a variation of an ETA and the idea is very simple, very clean, simple, fast system for people to be able to use.”
He said it would not have an impact on the Common Travel Area.
Lewis added: “We’re keen to ensure this one works for businesses as well in the way that it has done in other countries around the world.”
Coveney spoke at length about his worries about the scheme following his discussion with Lewis, which he described as “good”.
“The essence of our issue here is that for many years now, since a peace process was agreed, the creation of normality on this island between North and South in terms of relationships, business travels, study, work, and so on has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people.
“And we think that’s worth protecting.
“Even though I accept that what the British Government are designing here is a streamlined system based on international best practice and so on in terms of how people cross borders, and so forth.
“But Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland, in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements and so on.”
In a joint communique issued after the meeting, both sides said they noted “with regret, the developments at Stormont since it last met in December”.
“The UK and Irish governments reaffirmed their commitment to the full functioning of all of the political institutions established by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, including the North South Ministerial Council, and the importance of respecting the agreement in all of its strands.
“The conference noted the importance of addressing the outstanding issues in the context of the Northern Ireland Protocol which is currently subject to continuing engagement between the EU and the UK.
“The Irish Government and the UK Government provided an update on their respective commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement, which restored the institutions in January 2020.”","7.52pm, 23 Mar 2022",
https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-deal-northern-ireland-protocol-february-5654969-Jan2022/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney has said he wants to see an agreement on the Protocol reached by the end of February.
Coveney said he does not want to see the the Northern Ireland Assembly election in May become dominated by the “polarising” issue.
It comes after UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held her first meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic since taking over Brexit negotiations following the resignation of David Frost.
Speaking today, Coveney said the meeting marked a “reset” in the relationship between the EU and UK teams, which is now “in a better place than we’ve seen for a while”.
He said: “From my conversations with both sides, I think that process will be a very serious one.
“I think in people’s minds, really, we would like to have, if possible, these issues resolved by the end of February, so that the elections in Northern Ireland can move ahead without being dominated by the Protocol issues, right the way to polling day.
“Elections in the North are often polarising enough affairs without having the added complexity and tension around the Protocol and its implementation.
“So I think everybody is conscious of their responsibility in terms of trying to bring some stability and certainty to Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit, and the Northern Ireland Protocol.”
Truss said there is a “deal to be done” following her meeting with Sefcovic.
However she refused to rule out the possibility the UK could invoke Article 16 – suspending part of the arrangements in the Protocol – if they could not agree a way forward.
Coveney insisted the Protocol is here to stay, and that he did not expect the UK to remove the threat of Article 16 until a deal is agreed.
He told RTÉ Radio One: “The Protocol is there. It’s part of an international treaty, it’s part of international law.

“And so the focus really on the EU side is how do we implement this Protocol in a way that is pragmatic and flexible, and takes on board the genuine concerns that have been raised in Northern Ireland?
“I think if both sides work on that basis, there is a landing zone that can be agreed over the next six or eight weeks.
“As an Irish government perspective, we’ll be working to try to assist that process.”
Coveney said he did not expect the UK Government to follow through on its threat to trigger Article 16.
He added: “I don’t expect that the UK side will take something like the use of Article 16 off the table, until there’s an agreement. That’s just the nature of negotiations
“But I have to say, I think the consequences of the triggering of Article 16, in a way that sets aside large elements of the Protocol would be hugely damaging to the relationships that we’re now trying to build to solve these issues through negotiation and good politics.”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s future looks uncertain, amid controversy over alleged lockdown-breaking parties at No 10 Downing Street.
But Coveney said those issues could not distract from the task of resolving the dispute around the Protocol.
“Who knows what will happen in in British politics in the weeks ahead,” he said.
“But my focus and the focus of our staff is on solving problems that have been around for too long.
“And to allow Northern Ireland to move on with certainty from this ongoing debate around the implementation of the Protocol that has caused such, you know, polarised opinion and tension in Northern Ireland.
“I think that’s why Liz Truss is there. I think it’s a good thing that the Brexit issues and the Protocol issues are back in the Foreign Office in London, rather than in a separate unit, led by Lord Frost.
“There are big issues at the moment that Britain and the EU should be working together on and I think Liz Truss sees that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-freight-trade-ireland-5341048-Feb2021/,"TRADE BETWEEN IRELAND and the UK took a hit in January as the Brexit transition period ended compared to the same month last year.
The volume of trade on routes between Ireland and Britain fell to only half of trade in January 2020, according to a post-Brexit operational update from the government.
However, trade is gradually increasing each week, with 1,334 freight vehicles from Britain arriving in Ireland on 28 and 29 January, compared to 61 in the first two days of the month.
17,500 freight vehicles in total came to Ireland from Britain over 390 ferries during January, with similar numbers – 16,900 – travelling to Britain from Ireland.
The government said there is “no one issue contributing to the lower volumes”.

“Rather, the combination of a number of factors including Brexit stockpiling, Covid-19 restrictions, new Brexit checks and controls and the emergence of new direct services with additional capacity on European routes,” the government said.
“Government departments and state agencies recognise that the new trading arrangements with Great Britain represent the biggest change for trade and business in almost 50 years,” it said.
“The challenge the new checks due to Brexit create for traders is fully acknowledged – and there is ongoing intensive engagement between government departments and agencies and stakeholder groups, sectoral representative bodies, businesses and individuals to assist them through the new processes,” it said.
Revenue’s 24/7 Customs helpline answered 7,230 calls between 1 and 27 January.
Overall, freight volumes on European routes have increased by 100% between January 2020 and January 2021.
Between Ireland and France, weekly sailings to Northern France have increased from 12 in January 2020 to 36 this year.
The UK officially left the EU single market at the end of 2020 when the one-year Brexit transition period ended.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-ireland-can-learn-about-how-post-brexit-migration-5560938-Oct2021/,"THE SHORTAGE OF truck drivers in the UK was caused by a confluence of issues, with additional bureaucracy and a hostility to non-British workers caused by Brexit at its core.
The British government had chosen to pursue the policy of limiting migration to satisfy those who voted for Brexit – sometimes above other policy issues, such as safeguarding financial services jobs in London or making travelling to Europe easier.
This is despitepolling that indicatescontrol of laws and regulations was the most important aspect for Leave voters, with striking new trade deals the second greatest priority. These were prioritised above immigration by 67% to 33% and 59% to 41% respectively.
The shortage of drivers has been one of the most visible impacts of Brexit, affecting supply ahead of the busiest shopping period of the year. It has also shone a light on how Briain has treated migrant workers since the 2016 vote.
Professor Federico Fabbrini, Director of the DCU Brexit Institute, says that the Covid-19 pandemic hid some of the effects of the UK withdrawal from the EU. “But as we move out of the health emergency, the real costs of leaving the EU are starting to emerge in a way which is easy for all to see,” he toldThe Journal.
He says that organisations have been warning of the exodus of EU citizens from the UK workforce across sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, healthcare and higher education.
Membership of the EU brings with it the benefit of the so-called ‘four freedoms’: freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital.
In order to limit the movement of people and curb migration, as was pledged by some politicians ahead of the 2016 EU referendum vote, the movement of the other three were also greatly limited – in the form of additional costs, checks, paperwork or complete bans.
EU truck drivers are now asked for additional documentation when travelling to the UK, for both outward and inward travel. Whereas before EU drivers delivering goods to the UK could carry out up to three internal deliveries while there for up to seven days under ‘cabotage’ rules, post-Brexit this has been limited to two deliveries within three days.
This has made the UK less attractive to migrant workers; the UK government’s offer of a three-month visa to EU HGV drivers is not attractive enough to uproot people.
“It’s just insolence to think that migrants are like a tap which you can open and close when needed,” Glasgow-based HGV driver Tomasz Orynskitold the BBC.

When a British reporter asked Olaf Scholz, who could succeed Angela Merkel as Chancellor, whether Germany would help alleviate the UK’s driver shortage, laughter ensued, before Scholz said that this was Brexit in operation.
“The free movement of labour is part of the European Union,” he said.
“We worked very hard to convince the British not to leave the union. They decided [differently] and I hope they will manage the problems coming from that.”

Netherlands-based trade unionist Edwin Atema put it in much stronger termson BBC Radio 4last week: “The EU workers we speak to will not go to the UK for a short-term visa to help the UK out of the shit they created themselves.”
Independent TD Verona Murphy, who is the former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, toldThe Journalthat while “mistruths” were shared during the Brexit referendum campaign, “I don’t think anyone thought about this”.
“Whether it was a reality or a prospect, they didn’t care. It was politics versus reality.
Back in Great Britain, the views are not any more sympathetic. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakefordtold his parliamentthat the British Government’s offer of a three-month visa was “exploitative”:
“It’s hard to imagine a government that has made a more derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation. Of course we are short of HGV drivers, because your government took us out of the European Union where we were previously supplied [with] drivers.

“The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back and work in this country for a matter of weeks, only to be told by the UK government that they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have any use for them… The arrogance of it is breathtaking, but it simply isn’t going to work.”
Points-based immigration
In February last year, off the back of the Brexit trade deal agreed before Christmas, the UK Home Secretary Priti Patel announced the UK’s post-Brexit “points-based” immigration system, which would determine who could live and work in the UK.
The changes were designed to cut the number of low-skilled migrants entering Britain, and to make it easier for higher-skilled workers to get UK visas. Representatives ofmany industries- including the care sector, farmers, bakers, food processors, and the Confederation of British Industry – warned that this could bring about huge changes.
Apart from Irish citizens, who are exempt, anyone outside of the UK who wanted to work in the UK would need to request permission in advance, and earn a number of points.
To work in the UK,you’d need 70 points: the three ‘mandatory’ skills you need are: a job offer by an “approved sponsor”, which isworth 20 points; the job offer being at a required skill level (A-Level or its equivalent), worth 20 points; and to speak English, worth 10 points.
A job in a “shortage occupation”, as designated by the Migration Advisory Committee, is worth 20 points.
This more hostile system, coupled with pandemic-prompted lockdowns that limited economic activity, has made the UK a less attractive place for migrants to want to work.
It could get worse
In addition to the shortage of truck drivers, there are problems brewing in other sectors.
The chief executive officer of Next warned of supply-chain problems in the run-up to Christmas if the UK doesn’t relax some post-Brexit immigration rules and allow more migrant workers into the country.
There is also some suggestion that the UK may be short of bankers, according to a joint report from lobby group TheCityUK, EY, and the City of London Corporation, due to it being harder and more expensive post-Brexit to hire staff from abroad.
Representatives of the pig industryhave also warnedthere could be a shortage of butchers which could impact food supplies over Christmas.
What lesson can be learned
Verona Murphy says the solution to the driver shortage is to offer better pay and work conditions than other countries in order to have a “competitive edge”, and to open road haulage work permits and visas to more migrant workers outside of the EU.
“America is short of drivers too, and if we don’t do something soon, we will fall behind.”
Murphy also says that the EU’s Mobility Package, which she calls the ‘CAP of road haulage’, has requirements that drivers need to adhere to that could be improved.
The head of Oxfam’s EU Office, Evelien van Roemburg said that the problems the UK is now facing will hopefully be a “wake-up call” for EU member states on migration.
“You see in a lot of member states that migrants are being scapegoated for many other domestic issues.
“In the Netherlands, there was a discussion in Parliament about the new financial year and the budget of the government, and the far-right party, which is pretty big in the Netherlands, had calculated how much migrants are contributing to emissions. So they found a way to blame the climate crisis on migrants, which is completely ridiculous but it’s a way to not talk about the actual issues – to not talk about what [politicians have] done, or what has the government done, to address all these other issues.
“It’s a way to avoid responsibility. And that’s something that needs to be dealt with.”
Professor Fabbrini said that the issue faced by the UK was “predictable”, and had been predicted by experts ahead of a deal being struck.
“The Brexit vote was largely about curbing migration, so the UK made the choice to bring an end to free movement. And the problems now are becoming obvious for all to see.”","8.00pm, 4 Oct 2021",
https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-uk-northern-ireland-protocol-5804707-Jun2022/,"LEO VARADKAR HAS said that relations have never been as bad with UK government ministers.
The Tánaiste said he believes the UK is “not being even handed” when it comes to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
UK MPs voted earlier this week to give the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill a second reading. The legislation is designed to override parts of the post-Brexit deal to allay concerns over its impact on the UK.
It comes after the DUP said it will not nominate ministers to allow a new Stormont Executive to be formed until the UK takes actions on its concerns around the protocol.
However the move by the UK has been branded as illegal and a clear breach of international law.

Varadkar said the UK’s bid to unilaterally change the protocol was a “strategic mistake”.
He told BBC Northern Ireland’s The View programme that the EU would “not be threatened” by the UK’s approach to the ongoing stand-off.
“The British government had given commitments in the past that it would be even handed in its approach to Northern Ireland,” he said.
“I don’t think that’s the case when it comes to this government, they’re siding with one of the three blocs of opinion that now exist in Northern Ireland.
“And I think that’s a strategic mistake for people who want to preserve the union – to continue to impose things that a clear majority of people don’t want means more people will turn away from the union.
Varadkar also said that in his political lifetime, he had “never seen relations as bad” with UK ministers.
“We have a British government that doesn’t want to work hand in glove with the Irish government, it’s not even handed, it’s a government that wants to continue to have rows with the EU even though they’ve left,” he said.

“I think trust needs to be restored, the best way they can do that is by de-escalating this.
“Even if you have difficulties trusting someone, you still have to try to come to an agreement. If we can’t with this government, then a future government.”
Varadkar also said the people of Northern Ireland are not being listened to, referring to a letter against the bill signed by members of Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.
“The thing that does bother me the most actually is that the people of Northern Ireland aren’t being listened to by their sovereign government in Westminster,” he said.
“A letter was written, 52 MLAs out of 90 signed it. It’s almost as if British ministers didn’t read it or didn’t care, and they set out very clearly that they did not want the protocol revoked and they did not accept this argument that the protocol undermined the Good Friday Agreement.
“Fifty-two out of 90s MLAs, and the British Government treats the views of majority of the elected representatives of Northern Ireland as irrelevant, and that’s a fundamental problem.”

THE WINDOW OF opportunity for the UK Government and European Union to make changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol before the DUP collapse Stormont is closing, the region’s First Minister has warned.
Last week, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson threatened to withdraw his ministers and bring down the power-sharing institutions if his demands over the protocol were not met.
Answering questions at Stormont, his party colleague Paul Givan said there was no consensus for the protocol in Northern Ireland and said it had caused economic and political damage.
The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
Unionists in Northern Ireland have been vehemently opposed to its terms, which see additional checks on goods arriving to the region from the rest of the UK.
At the first ministerial question time at Stormont following the summer break, First Minister Mr Givan was questioned on his party’s commitment to implement fully the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which allowed the power-sharing institutions to return after a three year suspension.
He said: “Within NDNA there is a commitment by the UK Government that when it comes to the internal market, Northern Ireland will be an integral part to it.
“The Northern Ireland Protocol, however, has caused damage economically, damage to our wider society, it has created political tension and therefore that has to be addressed.
“The Belfast Agreement is very clear on where the delicate balance was struck between unionists, nationalists and others and whenever one aspect of that is damaged it causes harm across all others.
“The east/west relationship has been harmed by the Northern Ireland Protocol and that has an impact when it comes to north/south.
“I want to see these issues resolved, I want to see these institutions working because I believe that we are best placed to represent the people who elect us in terms of how we run a country, that we can do that better than other jurisdictions.”
He added: “But we have to address the fundamental problems which have now occurred as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol and I hope that the UK Government and the European Union seize the window of opportunity that exists; but that window of opportunity is closing.”

Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson delivers a key note speech on the Northern Ireland Protocol to senior party members last week.
Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan said that the DUP was “totally responsible” for the Northern Ireland Protocol, because the party backed Brexit.
Givan responded: “When it comes to the issue of where did it all go wrong in respect of Brexit, it has been the outworking and implementation of that by the UK Government.
“We were very clear that Northern Ireland should be treated just as the rest of the United Kingdom.
“There was no approval of anybody in Northern Ireland for the changes which flowed from the Northern Ireland Protocol.
“It is vital when you are going to make these sorts of changes that it is done in a way which has consensus.
“The protocol doesn’t.”
He added: “In our meetings with Maros Sefcovic (European Commission vice president) I made it clear that I want both communities and our whole community to have the best of both worlds, where you have access to the European single market and you have access to Great Britain’s market in an unfettered manner.
“We don’t have that.”
SDLP MLA Colin McGrath said the threat to bring down Stormont was “reckless” in the middle of a pandemic.
He added: “What message do you have for the businesses, for the communities, for the people out there, if the message from your party leader is that this place can be brought down and decisions won’t be able to be taken?”
Givan said: “Our party is very clear, we want this Executive to continue work, we want this Assembly to continue to operate and to take the type of decisions that we are taking.
“But the basis on which we restored these institutions is in New Decade, New Approach and it was commitments made by the UK Government that Northern Ireland would have unfettered access on an east/west dimension and that the internal market of the UK would be restored.
“The fundamentals on which the Executive is formed have to be right and that is why there is a window of opportunity for both the UK Government and the European Union to make sure that the changes which need to be made, are made.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-government-renegotiate-brexit-6172588-Sep2023/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Sep 2023
TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has responded to Keir Starmer’s pledge to reopen the UK’s Brexit deal by saying that although it would be a move welcomed by Ireland, doing so would be “easier said than done”.
Speaking to reporters today in New York, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said: “It’s a very interesting statement and policy position that’s been articulated by the British Labour Party.”
In an interview with the Financial Times, Keir Starmer said that hewould be seeking a rewritten Brexit deal if Labour win the next UK election.
The frontrunner to become the next UK prime minister said he “owes it to his children” to rebuild relations with the EU.
“Ireland’s position is that we welcome the closest ties possible between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Because the United Kingdom is a very, very important market in the first instance, economically for Ireland,” the Tánaiste said in response toThe Journal’s question.
Martin said the Irish government would support moves to make the existing trade agreement between the UK and the EU more simple.
“We would be very pleased about that but it’s easier said than done,” he said.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar toldThe Journalthat he too welcomed the comments made by Starmer, adding that Ireland would “very much so like to see a close relationship between the UK and the EU”.
“But there’s one thing that there can’t be in there can never be is cherry picking,” Varadkar said.
“No matter who’s the prime minister in Britain – whether labour or conservative – you can’t just opt into the parts of the European Union that you like, there would have to be give and take and I think they’ll have to think that through before they come to the European Union…”
Asked byThe Journalif Varadkar would find it frustrating for agreements to be scrapped, he said if a change saw a similar agreement to the 2018Backstop agreementstruck between Northern Ireland, the Republic and the UK, he believes, it would be a good thing for all stakeholders.
Britain’s Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) with the EU, negotiated by former prime minister Boris Johnson, is due for review in 2025 – it is a this point that Starmer said he would renegotiate the arrangement if he became UK prime minister.
Martin said such a scenario would be “only good news for Europe, good news for the United Kingdom and good news for Ireland.”
Other Irish ministers have welcomed the suggestion of a closer trading relationship between the UK and EU but warned that speculation on reopening trade deals is not helpful.

Ireland’s Minister for Finance Michael McGrath was asked byThe Journaltoday to respond to Starmer’s comments about rewriting the Brexit negotiations.
He said that for now such a renegotiation is “in the realm of speculation” but welcomed the suggestion of a closer trading relationship in the future.
However he said for now, Ireland is focused on ensuring the existing agreement is fully implemented.
“The progress that we have made has been hard fought. And for now, I think the priority has to be to bed in the changes that have been agreed,” McGrath said.
“So I think we will be forgiven for saying that our focus for now is on ensuring that the agreement that we have is fully implemented, and that it operates smoothly and efficiently.
“We welcome of course, anything that can result in a better relationship, a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union but that’s beyond another election and beyond the implementation of the current agreement,” McGrath said.
Meanwhile, Irish Minister for European Affairs Peter Burketold the Business Postthat a material renegotiation of the post-Brexit trading deal will not be on the table if Starmer gets into power.
His comments come after Neale Richmond, the Fine Gael Minister of State at the Department of Enterprisecautiously welcomedStarmer’s comments yesterday.
However, Richmond also warned that “tortuous negotiations” and “difficult relations” meant that speculation on reopening trade deals was not helpful.
Elsewhere today, Starmer was in Paris, meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.
He described his meeting with Macron today as “constructive and positive” amid expert warnings his vision for a closer partnership with the EU would likely face challenges if he wins power.
“We had a very constructive and positive meeting, which as you can imagine covered a wide range of issues,” he said.
Starmer has reiterated his decision to rule out rejoining the customs union, the single market or the EU itself, and as a result it is unclear what the EU’s response would be to a renegotiation of the trade deal.
Starmer’s meeting with Macron comes as the UK in a Changing Europe (UKICE) research group publishes a new report that finds using the existing TCA to reduce trade barriers will be “very challenging”.
UKICE says the onus will be on Britain to give the EU an incentive to shift its position, given the bloc is “relatively happy” with the existing partnership.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-windsor-framework-economic-benefits-poll-6037296-Apr2023/,"ALMOST 70% OF voters in Northern Ireland think the Windsor Framework could bring economic benefits to the region, an opinion poll carried out on behalf of Queen’s University in Belfast has suggested.
The polling also indicates that two thirds of people believe that the Northern Ireland executive should be re-established following the deal between the EU and the UK.
The framework was unveiled in February as a means of adapting the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol to deal with trade disruption between the region and the rest of the UK.
The deal has been formally signed off by the UK Government and the EU.
However, the DUP has expressed concerns about the framework and has shown no sign of returning to power-sharing at Stormont.
The polling, carried out by LucidTalk on behalf of researchers at Queen’s, indicates that 69% think that the framework could bring economic benefits for the region, and 66% think the executive at Stormont should return.
Some 48% of respondents who identified as a “strongly unionist” do not see potential economic benefits from the framework.
Seven in 10 of those who identify as “slightly unionist” see potential benefits, as do around nine out of 10 nationalists and others.

The poll suggested that 72% of women and 60% of men wanted to see the powersharing institutions return.
The report was compiled by Professor David Phinnemore, Professor Katy Hayward, and Dr Lisa Claire Whitten and is the eighth in a series of opinion panel polls conducted for Queen’s researchers as part of a three-year project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).
Polling was conducted from 18-21 March, three weeks after the UK government and the European Commission announced the deal. The results of the polling are from a weighted sample of 1,201 respondents.
The poll also indicated that 23% of respondents will only vote for candidates in the next Assembly election who are favour of scrapping the protocol and/or the Windsor Framework.
It suggested that 25% would have preferred the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill to the Windsor Framework and 43% of respondents agree that the Stormont brake provides an appropriate means for MLAs to influence changes to EU law.
Just over a third of respondents (35%) think that the Windsor Framework poses a threat to Northern Ireland’s position in the UK.
Professor Phinnemore said: “With the Windsor Framework, more voters in Northern Ireland have become accepting or supportive of the protocol.
“A clear majority believe genuine efforts have been made to address concerns raised and see potential economic benefits.”
Professor Hayward, from the School of Social Sciences, Education and Social Work at Queen’s, commented: “The new UK-EU deal has provoked no discernible movement from those who previously wanted the protocol scrapped altogether.”","8.29am, 5 Apr 2023",
https://www.thejournal.ie/scottish-independence-referendum-united-kingdom-5798560-Jun2022/,"A FUTURE SCOTTISH independence vote should include all four UK nations – Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the British House of Lords has heard.
The Bishop of Blackburn, Rt Rev Julian Henderson, suggested a referendum on the union, such as a Scottish independence referendum, could include all four nations as peers debated the stresses upon the union of the United Kingdom.
Several peers also expressed concerns that stresses on the Union are becoming worse.
The debate comes after Scotland’s SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon began laying out the case for a second Scottish independence referendum, with suggestions such a vote could come as early as next year.
Making his valedictory speech, the Bishop told the House of Lords: “I do wonder if a referendum is pressed for whether so major a decision with consequences for the whole union should be decided by only one part and not take into account the view of the whole. But I know that is controversial.”
Elsewhere in the debate, a number of peers expressed concerns that strains on the Union are growing.
Former Commons clerk and crossbench peer Lord Lisvane said in the time since he secured a previous debate in 2019 where the effects of Brexit were discussed, he said: “More than three years later, those uncertainties remain, and in some respects have become more threatening.”

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Wallace of Saltaire said: “The stresses upon the union are clearly growing.”
“The stresses and strains … are, if anything, getting worse,” Labour peer Viscount Stansgate added.
‘Stresses and strains’
Conservative former Lords leader Lord Strathclyde said: “We have nearly had 25 years of devolution. Enough time for us to get used to it, enough time for it to bed down with our constitutional arrangements, and yet … we haven’t.
“The stresses and strains are only too visible, too complicated, and it is clearly going to take considerably more time for them to work down into a workable proposition.”
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Bruce of Bennachie told the upper chamber the SNP were “undermining and trashing devolution and United Kingdom cooperation”, adding: “They claim they have a mandate for independence, but it’s not the case. When the question was asked, independence was rejected, and opinion appears to be settled at about the same level.”
Earlier in the debate, independent crossbencher Viscount Waverley spoke about the importance of reflecting on why the devolved nations voted to remain within the European Union.
He said: “Brexit was an assertion made up mostly by the English and for the most part, this Government is considered to be an English one. And only occasionally a British one.
“In understanding that it was the English community living in Wales that tilted that country to leave the European Union, should we be reflecting on why the devolved nations voted therefore to remain within the European Union?”

He added: “What is it about one state of a union that does not apply to the other?
“And taken as a whole, there is no example of a federal state anywhere where one of the components of the federation is so large.”
Communities minister Lord Greenhalgh said the UK Government is “absolutely committed” to devolution across the UK, and said Scottish people wanted both its governments to be “placing their full focus on the issues that really matter” rather than discussing a second independence vote.
The debate comes after a cross-party group of peers considered the future of the UK and how it could be kept together in future.
The Lords Constitution Committee took evidence from Communities Secretary Michael Gove, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, and the Labour First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, among others.
In its report, the committee stressed that there is “no room for complacency” about the future of the UK, and that there are “clear and achievable” means to make it fit for the 21st century.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-protocol-eu-legislation-5794446-Jun2022/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Jun 2022
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has warned it would be a “very serious situation” if the UK Government enacted legislation to scrap the bulk of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
An Taoiseach said the legislation will cause “economic vandalism” on Northern Ireland.
Martin also said the European Union wants to avoid a trade war, saying the issues around the protocol can be resolved through negotiation.
It comes shortly after the UK tabled legislation to giveministers powers to override elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was jointly agreed by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to keep the Irish land border free-flowing.
“If this Bill is enacted, I think we’re into a very serious situation. But of course, no-one in Northern Ireland and no-one in the island of Ireland wants Northern Ireland to lose access to the EU market,” Martin told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme,
“I think that’s one consistent thread. I think if if we have a complete unilateral reneging on an international agreement, that the United Kingdom Government itself signed up to, then of course we’re in a very serious situation.
“But we want to avoid that, nobody wants a trade war in any shape or form.
“That would position Northern Ireland well in terms of inward investment.”
In the deal, both sides agreed to put checks on goods, plant and animal products crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The UK has insisted its unilateral approach is the only option left to resolve the issues within the protocol if the EU refuses to fundamentally rewrite the terms of the deal.
However, Martin said the legislation to undermine almost all aspects of the protocol is not acceptable.
“It represents unilateralism of the worst kind in terms of honouring and adhering to international agreements that governments adhere to and sign up to and ratify in their parliaments,” Martin added.
EU legislation to retaliate
Meanwhile, the EU has drafted legislation that aims to strengthen the bloc’s hand in taking action against the UK over possible breaches of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and EU-UK trade deal due to the Protocol legislation.
Fine Gael MEP for Ireland South Seán Kelly has been appointed lead author in finalising the draft legislation, which looks at the measures contained in the post-Brexit trade deal on what retaliatory action can be taken if one side does not adhere to its obligations.

“So basically, we will put on the table the steps that will be taken if they continue down this path, and giving the opportunity to the Commission on how to do it,” he told the PA news agency.
“They will see that there’s no messing here, we’re not bluffing, that once you cross the rubicon, there are consequences.”
Kelly said the UK under Boris Johnson has become “an unreliable diplomatic partner”, and that the EU needs the appropriate tools to protect itself.
“The UK is not coming to the table and they’re playing games for political reasons.
“I would hope and I almost believe that the UK would pull back from the brink.”
He said that negotiations about red and green lanes would follow if the UK did pull back from tabling legislation that seeks to change the Northern Ireland Protocol.
When asked whether the EU expected this unilateral response from the UK after years of fraught Brexit negotiations, Kelly said: “You were kind of… but you were thinking that it was a bit too extreme for a responsible government to break its own word.”
“‘Take back control’ was a wonderful phrase that meant nothing,” Kelly added.
The draft regulation establishes rules and procedures to govern the EU rights under both Brexit agreements, which if triggered if may result in the suspension of certain obligations under the agreement concerned.
“If there are breaches to the agreed trading conditions, with this regulation the Commission will have the power to impose restrictions on trade, investment or other activities falling within the scope of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.”
“The bill in the House of Commons has to go through two or three hearings and they could take ages, so we’ll be finalised in plenty of time if the doomsday scenario transpires, and they’ll know where we stand.”
The European Council and European Parliament would then have to approve the actions that are to be taken.
Kelly said that this would prevent a further “gaffe” when the European Commission controversially suggested in early 2021 that Article 16 of the Protocol could be triggered in response to a row with the UK about Covid-19 vaccine supplies.
“So that won’t happen on this occasion, everything will be above board, according to the treaties,” he said.
When the draft legislation is finalised in the coming weeks, the European Parliament’s report on the new regulation will be presented for vote at committee before progressing to a full plenary vote.","10.25am, 19 Jun 2022",19 Jun 2022
https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-ireland-listening-to-those-with-concern-over-northern-ireland-protocol-5476959-Jun2021/,"IRELAND IS LISTENING to those who have real concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, and “making the case strongly at an EU level for flexibility and pragmatism”, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said.
Simon Coveney said he hopes that progress will be made in the “sausage war” trade dispute between the UK and the EU in the next week.
But he added there would also have to be “an adherence to what was agreed”.
The UK has applied for an extension to a grace period allowing chilled meats to continue being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland after the end of this month, when the current arrangements are due to expire.
Coveney said: “I hope this week that we will see progress between both sides on the request from the British Government side for a modest extension to the grace period for chilled meats.
“I hope we’ll be able to see progress on sensitive issues like guaranteeing supplies into Northern Ireland, and also on pets and I hope we can, in the coming weeks and months, also explore positive opportunities around common standards around food production, management and safety.
“This was a good discussion.”

Coveney was speaking after a meeting of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference in Dublin Castle today, following speculation of a truce in the “sausage war” dispute.
He met with Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.
Minister for Justice Heather Humphreys and Northern Ireland Minister of State Robin Walker were also in attendance.
Coveney said it was the first such meeting since 2019, describing it as a “really important” structure that allows the UK and Irish governments to “work together on issues of mutual interest and concern”, adding they are committing to holding it several times a year going forward.
Lewis said he was hopeful that the EU was being “flexible” in its approach to the trade dispute with the UK Government over chilled meats.
He said: “Obviously we have not had a formal response yet from the EU, so we need to wait to see that formal response. Some technical conversations are ongoing around that.
“Obviously I’m hopeful that they are being flexible and looking at a pragmatic way forward, that would be a good indication.

“We’ll have to see what the detail is when it comes forward and then we can hopefully move forward positively.”
Coveney also said that the Irish Government and the EU were listening to the “anxiety” from some in Northern Ireland around the Protocol and were trying to respond in a “pragmatic and sensible way”.
He added that the Irish Government had been advocating for more ambition around sanitary and phytosanitary standards, food standards, veterinary standards and a common approach to that from the UK and the EU “which could reduce significantly the number of checks required in airports and airports in Northern Ireland on product coming from GB”.
“I’d like to give a message to people in Northern Ireland that despite the frustration that we’ve heard we are trying to work through the issues where there are solutions,” he said.
“But those solutions require partnership between the British government and the EU together.”
He added: “Hopefully, this week and into next week, if we can get agreement on the chilled meats issue, at least for the temporary extension of that grace period that can be a catalyst for improved relationships and the building up of trust and allow negotiating teams to try to solve some of these other issues over the summer months, because they need to be solved.”
The two governments agreed a process to move forward with legacy issues in Northern Ireland.
Coveney described the decision as the “most substantive decision of the day”.
He acknowledged concern among some that the Stormont House Agreement structures on dealing with the past are “not as comprehensive as needed”.
He said: “The two governments have agreed to move a process forward together in partnership to reach out to families of victims, to political parties in Northern Ireland and other stakeholders to talk about the way forward on legacy in a way that is open minded, does not have any predetermined outcome.”
He said the starting point of those discussions is Stormont House but “we’re going to look at how we can develop that in the weeks ahead”.
“This isn’t something that we’re talking about managing for months and months and months, we’re going to move this ahead quickly in partnership, led by the two governments.”
Lewis described the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past as a “hugely complex and sensitive issue”.
He said: “The people of Northern Ireland and beyond went through some tragic circumstances and situations and some abhorrent experiences through the period of the Troubles.
“We’ve got to work together to do everything we can to help Northern Ireland move forward and find a way to move on in dealing with issues around legacy.
“The principles of Stormont House are the principles we want to build on and develop but over the last seven years there are lessons to learn around what we can do and how we can do that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ni-protocol-dup-sinn-fein-5574038-Oct2021/,"THE EU PROPOSALS to address practical difficulties around the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol have been broadly welcomed this evening as political and business leaders look to the next stage of negotiations.
However, the leader of the DUP described the plans as a “welcome acknowledgement that the NI protocol has not worked”.
Jeffery Donaldson described the proposals as the EU’s “starting point” but on first inspection, they would appear to “fall far short of the fundamental change needed”.
Theproposals cover agri-food checks, customs, movement of medicines and enhancing stakeholder engagement, but do not offer any concession on a key UK Government demand, the removal of the oversight role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The measures are to bring about an 80% reduction in checks envisaged for retail agri-food products arriving in the region from Great Britain.
Announcing the proposals this evening, EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said he hoped the UK Government would reciprocate the EU’s efforts.
He said: “I really hope that we share the same goal of peace, stability and prosperity on the island of Ireland and I hope that we also share the same goal that the businesses and people of Northern Ireland would benefit enormously from the dual market access.”
Sefcovic said the role of the ECJ was mentioned to him only once during all of his discussions and interactions with people in Northern Ireland over post-Brexit arrangements.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said her party has tabled a recall of the Assembly to “reiterate its support” for the protocol.
She emphasised it is backed by the “majority of political parties and the majority of MLAs” in the Stormont Assembly, adding the recall will allow MLAs to demonstrate their support for it.
‘not a wasted opportunity’
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he trusts that the proposals will now be the subject of “serious engagement with the British Government and form the basis of a jointly agreed solution to those challenges”.
“The Commission, acting in good faith, has today invited the UK Government to work with it on these proposals, which it has said are a basis for discussion. I believe that the UK Government should accept that invitation and will engage in the same spirit,” he said.
Likewise welcoming the proposals, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said they are a major effort by the EU to address concerns raised around the protocol, and follow months of hard work and careful listening across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland.
“The Commission’s package respects the fine balance at the heart of the Protocol: protecting the Good Friday agreement, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland while at the same time protecting EU consumers and the integrity of the EU’s single market,” Coveney said in a statement this evening.

He said that now was the time for the UK Government to “engage constructively on the practical solutions being put forward by the Commission to the issues that matter most to the people of Northern Ireland”.
Donaldson said his party will now take time to study the detail and urged that future discussions are “not a wasted opportunity”.
“The forthcoming negotiations between the UK Government and the European Union present an opportunity to replace the protocol with new arrangements that deal with the present foundational weaknesses, namely that we have a trade border within the United Kingdom flowing from the reality that Northern Ireland follows different laws for goods than the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.
“It is vital this new round of negotiations does not become another missed opportunity to make fundamental change and to replace the protocol. Short-term fixes will not solve the problems that have beset the United Kingdom internal market.
“These proposals clearly fall a long way short of being the basis of a sustainable solution and are presented within the framework of a protocol that has failed. The proposals in the Government command paper, in our view, are the best direction of travel to start creating sustainable arrangements for Northern Ireland.
“We have a window of opportunity to get this right. The prize for doing so will be great for both sides but most of all for the people of Northern Ireland who can break free from the protocol infecting day-to-day decisions.”
Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill challenged the DUP and UK Government to work with the EU on what she described as “far-reaching” proposals.
“I think that demonstrates both in word and deed that the EU side are living up to their commitments that they made to both business and civic leaders as well as political leaders,” she said.
“It’s a good mark of progress, however, it’s up to others now as to whether or not they engage with this process.
“I hope that we can find solutions and that we can find certainty that the business community here desperately are looking for.
Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald the British government now need to engage with the process of finding solutions.
“It is time for the British government to put an end to the bluster and to engage with the process of trying to find solutions to the practical issues that need to be addressed.”
O’Neill was asked by reporters at Stormont whether the proposals from the EU represent a victory for the DUP.
“Brexit is the problem and the protocol is a solution, the protocol remains today, we have always said there needed to be flexibility inbuilt into that protocol to make it work, that was what Maros Sefcovic committed to when he met business and civic leaders here back in September and he’s true to his word today, he has delivered upon what he listened to and I think that’s crucially important,” she said.
“So I think now is the time for clarity, time for certainty. That’s what the business community here want. It’s been far too long with so much uncertainty.”
Aodhán Connolly, Director Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said there are “some wonderful things” in the EU’s proposal but “there are a lot of things that are going to need some extra detail”.
“The devils in the detail and solutions are only a solution if it’s agreed by both sides so we’re not there yet,” he told RTÉ Radio.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the EU proposals represent a fair accommodation and has urged political leaders to embrace them: “The proposals presented by the European Commission today are significant, they go further than many expected and clearly demonstrate that European leaders are stretching themselves in the interests of people and businesses in Northern Ireland.
“I would encourage political leaders, and particularly the leaders of unionism, to reflect on the very serious efforts made by the European Commission to ease the challenges with trade flows between Northern Ireland and Britain as well as addressing their concerns about democratic deficits,” he said.
Alliance MP Stephen Farry urged that the opportunity presented in the proposals is not squandered.
“We welcome these proposals and look forward to engaging on the details. We hope they can form the basis for agreement between the UK and EU to address the practical issues around the protocol in a pragmatic way,” he said.
“It would be an act of supreme folly to squander this chance to move on and indeed to impose even more delusional red lines.”
Meanwhile TUV leader Jim Allister rejected the EU proposals contending it “still assets sovereignty over Northern Ireland”.
“The EU’s latest proposals do nothing to counter the all important constitutional dislocation.
“They retain us in a foreign single market for goods, under a foreign customs code and VAT regime, ruled by foreign laws and adjudicated upon by a foreign court.
“None of that would change under the EU’s proposals.
“Thus, they have not addressed the critical issue,” he said.
“GB would continue to be decreed a ‘third country’ vis-a-vis Northern Ireland’s trade.
“That can never be acceptable, because it defies the constitutional integrity of our nation.
“Sovereignty is the crunch issue.
“These proposals utterly fail the sovereignty test.”
