https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-border-poll-3136932-Dec2016/,"While I would love to see Irish reunification I don’t think that the time is right for a border poll. Once Brexit is triggered and the UK leaves the EU lets leave the Unionist community reap what they have sown. They overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU but they hadn’t thought the whole thing through. A huge amount of the PUL community gets it’s main income through subsides from the EU in the form of agri-grants and those are going to dry up along with all of the other EU grants for the Peace Process. Give it a few years for those to disappear and they will rethink their position.
At the same time people in the rest of the “mainland” and especially England will realise as to how much the Irish cost them each year. When I say Irish I say it because no matter how much Unionists insist that they are “British” they are actually perceived as “Irish” by the rest of the UK. They are after all not part of “mainland” UK. Why should someone in Kent or Essex pay for lunatic Paddy who likes to march up and down streets pissing off their neighbours and rioting all of the time?
It might take a while but sooner or later the rest of the UK will get tired of the Irish Question and find a way to cut NI loose. The EU will fall over itself to pour money in to this “new” country as a means to try to get a good PR vibe for “closer integration” i.e EU federalisation . the one thing that we would need is a political party that is on the side of Ireland and the Irish people whether it is an established party or a new one. It certainly wouldn’t be FG seeing as Flanagan reckons that we are on “Team EU” when it comes to Brexit rather than having Irish interests to the fore. Enda is happy that Merkel decides that Ireland is not a special case when it comes to Brexit even though as Enda declared a few years back that Ireland had to “take one for the team” in relation to austerity.
Do we really think that these Fine Gael clowns are interested in Ireland’s reunification when they are more interested in sucking up to their EU masters?","Dec 17th 2016, 7:48 AM"

You clearly don’t understand the reality of what a peace and reconciliation commission is and how it works do you? The whole basis of such a commission would be that ALL sides are treated equally and if one side were granted and amnesty from prosecution then that would extended to everyone else involved as well. That is why under the GFA both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries were released from prison as long as their organizations had signed up to the GFA.
That is the reality of the situation but if you are looking for revisionist rewriting of history you just have to look at the former leader of Fine Gael John Brutons assessment of 1916 and Republicanism.

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-border-poll-3136932-Dec2016/,"A United Ireland should be a compromise between what those in the South & the North have now and what is a reasonable solution so that Unionists & the Orange Order in the North and Right Wing Catholics in the South can
co-exist and prosper.
May I suggest the following:
The division of Ireland (North & South) into 4 strong provincial State-like governments with a Central Secular Government whose powers are limited to Defence, Garda, Foreign Affairs, and National infrastructure etc with contentious issues such as education, welfare , health and local council matters left to the Provincial Governments.
Given that NI has some degree of political/economic autonomy already, the shift to a 4 provence All Ireland Government would not be a seismic shift politically or economically for them and a minor concession for Southerners. Let’s face it,
the 26 county Republic has not been a roaring success so far. Just ask any emigrant!
We can then get rid of Co Councils and replace them with community consultative committees with rotating honorary
reps.
Provincial Governments ought to have the powers to collect property taxes, stamp duties & levy garbage/environmental
charges (not water charges), the redistributing of VAT to the Provinces on a per capita basis and the balance of Central Government funds redistributed via a fair formula. We are already being dictated to by Brussels so why should have
this size of national Government who have to go cap in hand to the EC to have the budget passed.
This would give an opportunity to tailor government programs to better suit local needs and to get religion out of at least
Central Government Politics. At present the delivery of education & welfare is far too impersonal where the one shoe fits all is obviously not working.
The diaspora would dearly love to see a united Ireland where we all could, whether at home or abroad, call ourselves Irish and consign the “What Part” bit to history.","Dec 17th 2016, 10:55 PM"

So much of the debate on Scotland’s economy fails to recognise the reasons for the apparent ‘deficit’, namely creative accounting (e.g. VAT appropriation), pejorative policy spanning decades and the vested interest of perhaps the ultimate manifestation of ‘the state’ in keeping the status quo.
The levers of UK economic control rest in London and as a resident of the affluent Home Counties I see where their effects are most apparent. All other areas of the UK – not just Scotland – suffer under this yoke. The money spent on a single London mega-infrastructure project (of which there are many) dwarves the funding for entire UK regions for years at a time.
However, instead of the debate being about balancing the country (empty ‘Northern Powerhouse’ rhetoric aside), the London Government is happy to watch regions play-off against one another. The ‘whinging Jocks’ with their grievances and their ‘grasping mitts held out for magnanimous handouts from a benevolent England’ trope has been well and truly set in the mind of many, even across the Irish Sea it would seem, where I would have thought detachment and history would have allowed a more cynical eye to fall across the scene.
Were Ireland still under Westminster rule it would be in exactly the same economic situation as Scotland is now, perhaps worse (see NI). Yet I doubt many would choose to return to a position of dependence.
Regardless of tired and, yes, pointless old economic flashpoints from 2014, the focus should very much be on two things:
1) The majority of the economic arguments against independence, spurious as some of them were, have been utterly dismantled in the light of Brexit. Think currency devaluation, leaving the Single Market etc. For many who advocated staying in the union because of potential economic downsides, watching Westminster rush headlong towards throwing the UK economy under a bus in the name of leaving the EU should be like a nuclear bomb going off, but it somehow isn’t because reasons, big red, white and blue reasons draped in closeted xenophobia. Bad for the goose is good for the gander?
But mainly:
2) The ultimate driver for independence is not some economic utopia just around the corner, but the very real and increasingly obvious democratic deficit in the UK. Self-determination is the overriding case for independence and the unfolding disaster of the parliamentary Brexit process only underlines how badly this is required.","Feb 8th 2017, 10:36 AM"

To me you are hypocrites. Just remember Muslims are the ones who are causing trouble, so let them now live with the conquences.
Ask yourself,why are Muslims so blood thirsty.
What’s motivates these Muslims to inflict such brutality and violence on their fellow Muslims,they certainly hate Christins and have declared this to the west.
What gives these Muslims the justification to kill innocent people and resort to such vile actions.
Why is sectarian voilence more sacred than life of a human being,what’s makes them so barbaric.
What drives any human being to stoop so low that their conscience never stops them from shredding blood.
What makes Muslims so blood thirsty and what kind of person are you.
Islamism needs blood to survive hence the reason for suicide bombings.
Other religions want to preach peace,love and forgiveness ,but for Islamism it’s either their way or loose your live.Im not hear to defend Christianity but vampire religion now best describes muslims.
I challenge you here to prove me wrong when I say ,,Islamism are vampires whose religion needs blood to survive.

If you look at the last Irish general election – what was the biggest electoral scoring point/issue? Parish pump politics.
The biggest issues facing us as a nations are:
1. Immigration – are we happy to be a country who will over the next 10 years have a net migration influx
2. Can our public services withstand this influx
3. Should we withstand this influx will the EU nations who have a net emigration status help us subsidise the future healthcare/social provisions for their citizens
4. Are we willing to hand over our right as a republic to make our own laws and treaties.

Membership of what the E.U claims to be would be great but that doesn’t exist and it never has. People seem to assume we’d all be on horse – drawn carts were not for being subjugated and obligated to criminals and a wealthy establishment that only rewards itself to any significant degree. The assumption seems to be that Ireland wouldn’t have been able to cope with educating itself, feeding itself and insuring healthcare is in place for each citizen who lives here. National housing crisis, national healthcare crisis, blatant cronyism and deceit from our own elected officials and yesterday, thousands of people voted as having no faith in the country’s Gardai. Just my opinion but i think we could have achieved these great heights by ourselves and probably without the severity of the bailout that has cost so much. European Union sounds like a great idea, i would of liked to see a corruption free agenda, an end to massive wealth disparity and equality for unified peoples of different countries but that’s just the beans we were sold. Now the cow is gone too and our home nation is built from pyrite. Has the European Union been good for us? What union? The “we” that is supposed to be included simply isn’t and fear is not a good enough reason to remain without restructuring. As long as we continue to accept the status quo, that’s all we’ll get and in the meantime, just pass the on the fear of self determination to the next generation like the country can’t possibly sustain itself.

“I do not believe that Ireland signed up to join a European superstate with its own army and powers of taxation. Even if we had, we would have done so at a time when our closest neighbour, Britain, was part of the European project. Britain’s impending departure fundamentally changes Ireland’s balance of interest, as it faces remaining in an EU project that refuses to acknowledge any limit to its ambition.
The EU is now on a collision course with Irish national sovereignty………… Given the size of the economic threat posed to Ireland by Brexit and the scale of the political threat posed by the EU’s grandiose ambitions to overtly extend itself into areas where its activities have been largely covert until now — foreign affairs and tax — the lack of serious debate that has taken place about the country’s changing relationship with the EU is astonishing.
It is not as if an important question has not been raised. Would you rather that Ireland remains an independent state in a confederation of like-minded states or becomes the equivalent of North Dakota in a federal EU?”

Its very hard for some people who live totally in the Anglosphere to understand that others think differently. But the ‘baggar thy neighbour’ message comes across loud and clear.
The EU is not going to collapse or suddenly make your hard choice between federalism and going back to 1950. I also don’t think Brexit UK or Trump’s USA or Putin’s Russia are going to collapse. Like the EU, they will evolve, hopefully peacefully. Yes, little Englanders got angry about ‘them Poles’ getting jobs they were eithe unwilling or incapable of doing. So off they go and we can thank them for that and for showing us, at some cost to themselves as they jump off the cliff, the opportunties we are missing. I’m sure the foaming water is lovely but let’s just wait and see whether they sink of swim to the blue seas of opportunity. Yes, the Deep South and the Rust Belt have no economic future. I don’t think California and other parts of the US who are successful parts of the global economy are going to follow them.
Ireland is currently a successful part of the global economy. That’s where the good jobs come from. The daft building/banking boom did not drive them away but losing the Single Market would and so would the loss of tax advatages currently more under threat from Trump than from Brussels. The low, or for some, no-tax model is not sustainable inside or outside the EU, but dumping it and/or the Single Market, before we have prepared another course is daft. Yes, Brexit is going to be huge for Ireland but we need to look for the opportunities as well as seeing the threats.
So save us the throwaway comments like ‘Only 2 things can happen….’ Neither of use knows what the future holds but the options are more numerous than two, one of which is unpalatable and the other a form of suicide.","Feb 21st 2017, 8:32 AM"

Cameron also used the Brexit as a gamble for the UK to have more of a say within the EU, more of a leading role than a co operative one.
The people on the other hand was fed up with sovereignty being eroded by the E.U. and there are others who say it was over immigration but it was really about sovereignty as any sovereign state controls what it can do domestically and internationally by itself. The EU does not allow this and therefore is really anti democratic?
The use the terms of single market and all that but that is because the WTO has create the situations to create the E.U. in the first place. Why do you need the WTO in order to trade???
“A sovereign state is a state with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes.”
So a single market with a legislatative union that is turning into a Political Union using the Euro crisis caused by the ECB throwing Euros at banks and telling them to go mad and give loans out because the ECB had cheap loans to these banks to make the Euro stronger on the international markets, wat could go wrong but who got the blame and who got the bill but the tax payer?
The EU promises a single market for goods by using the WTO as the bouncer but it was the WTO that create the situation to force the creation of the EU, who’s final goal is to create a political union. So that the interests of the WTO and the banks are served, the EU is just a pen for sheeple to be slaughtered by the banks.
Many believe that the E.U. wants migrants in order to boost the economy of countries as at the economic heart of each country is money and the amount of people in debt as well.
This means that banks will give out more loans to people with money they don’t have and then the ECB goes QE mad and those who get the money first benefits the most from it like the banks. It is a never ending cycle of debt creating money printing. People forget that QE causes inflation but inflation hits the poor the hardest and not the bankers and by the time the por gets what is left of QE then it will be time to print more money again???","Jan 23rd 2017, 9:36 PM"

“John Perkins, Former Advisor IMF.
“My job was to identify countries with resources that corporations covert, like oil and then arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or from one of its sister organisations. The money however would not go to the country, it would go to our own corporations who would make huge profits, but the majority of the people would suffer terrible as a result, because money would be diverted from Education, Healthcare and other Social Services to pay interest on the debt.”
What happened when the IMF moved in and the debt couldn’t be repaid?
“We go back into that country and say, since you can’t pay your debt, sell your resource oil or whatever real cheap to our corporations without any environmental restrictions or, or social regulations. Privatise, sell your electric utilities, your water, sewage systems, your schools, your jails, all your public sector businesses to our corporations, and in the few cases where we failed economic hitman, the jackals went in and still do and aah, they either assassinate the leaders of the country or overthrow them in coups.”
This IMF is really an asset buying club that works for their pals and it is based in Washington D.C. and Greece has got 84 billion in loans over 3 years and Greece in return has to put 50 billion worth of assets into a segregated account that will later be sold off to the global community and when they are sold off by the Troika to banks and to hedge funds. It is estimated that it will make the Troika under 200 billion minus the 84 billion.
These assets will collateralise the loan but is a LEVERAGE BUYOUT by the global community, banks and Hedge funders.
Yet banks and the E.U. knew everything before loaning the money to these countries especially Greece, Many who were in Goldman Sachs are employed in the E.U. civil service like Dragi and it was Goldman Sachs who cooked the books for Greece joining the E.U. in the first place.
Yet only the Troika are the only ones who can sell Greece’s Income Producing Assets and make a profit from them to the Hedge Fund Community.
In 2010 Merkel protected the European banks and Hedge Funds from Billions in losses by putting the debt onto European tax payers. So PRIVATE DEBT from the loans made to countries like Greece were made knowing that they were bad loans. Yet Merkel knew in 2010 what was going to happen.
Then Merkel stepped in as the saviour of the E.U. and transferred all the bad debt from the banks and put it onto the European tax payer by making private debt sovereign debt issue then and therefore a problem of the whole E.U. falling apart.
Austerity was brought in for this, to look after the financial system using politics to cause LEVERAGE BUYOUT SENARIOS. Remember at the beginning of the Euro that the ECB made countries borrow Euros cheaply at low interest rates to banks that caused a boom and a rise in the value of the Euro and yet the ECB knew the financial make up of every country in the Eurozone in tax intake and debt.
Yet these same people knew that AUSTERITY causes debt to rise, to cause job losses and therefore countries to borrow more as jobs create taxes, imports and less borrowing on the international markets but the Troika forced Austerity as it looks now to create LEVERAGE BUYOUT SCENARIOS.

The internal border on this island. What’s going to happen there exactly?
The period between when the UK leaves the economic block and a new deal can be negotiated. A ~10 year process? WTO rules mean that either side is entitled to levy any such tariffs as they wish, provided the average tariff level does not much exceed that of the other side. You think that can’t get messy, fast? What do you Johnson’s Prosecco comment a few months ago was about?
Financial Passporting. Not covered by WTO rules and London’s exposure is massive. Failure to agree here would hurt both sides a lot but it would crush the Pound and destroy London as a World Financial Capital.
Oil and Gas sales. Covered under WTO rules but offers a way for the EU to gain additional leverage by threatening to hurt Scotland disproportionately with Tariffs.
Oil and Gas Transmission. Not covered under WTO rules as what is being sold is the capacity to transfer gas and not the gas itself. The existing agreement (which includes Russia and the Middle East) would label the UK as an external Network. This will hammer us as our connection to that network is through Scotland.
Man, these WTO rules sure seem so stable and desirable. I wonder why some many countries like making additional trade deals then?","Jan 17th 2017, 9:28 PM"

1. In October 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern became the highest paid Prime Minister in the democratic world at €310,000, more than US President George Bush at €279,000. Fianna Fail Ministers such as Willie O’Dea are paid more than US Vice President Dick Cheney.
2. In October 2007, former Fianna Fail Government Press Secretary Frank Dunlop told the Mahon Tribunal that property developer Owen O’Callaghan paid off a debt of £10,700 for Fianna Fail councillor Colm McGrath when he was facing a court judgment.
3. In October 2007, a book was published that included a claim that a serving Government Minister has admitted taking cocaine, and that he wasn’t the only one doing it. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has made no effort to investigate this.
4. In September 2007, Fianna Fail TD Michael Collins was found guilty in court of obtaining a tax clearance certificate under false pretences. He had previously made a €130,000 tax settlement arising from a bogus non-resident bank account.
5. In September 2007, jailed Fianna Fail councillor Michael ‘Stroke’ Fahey had missed six months of council meetings, and by law he should have been deemed to have resigned. He escaped this by asking the council to deem his absence to be ‘due to illness and attendance in Dublin’.
6. In September 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, while being questioned at the Mahon Tribunal, accepted that his earlier story that Celia Larkin had made a £30,000 sterling transaction on his behalf could not be correct, unless the bank records were inaccurate.
7. In September 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, while being questioned at the Mahon Tribunal, said that he must have given £30,000 to somebody else (to make a transaction that the bank had no record for), but he didn’t know who he gave the money to.
8. In August 2007, Bertie Ahern appointed as a Senator former Fianna Fail TD Ivor Callely, who had just lost his Dail seat in a general election, and who had resigned as a Junior Minister after a scandal in 2005.
9. In August 2007, Bertie Ahern appointed as a Senator former Fianna Fail TD John Ellis, who had just lost his Dail seat in a general election, and who had resigned as chair of an Oireachtas committee after a scandal in 1999.
10. In August 2007, it was revealed that Fianna Fail-led Governments have so far spent €52 million on obtaining and storing electronic voting machines that have only been used once, in a number of constituencies in 2002.
11. In July 2007, after a strenuous seven days of work since being elected in mid-June, the Dail adjourned for a three-month summer holiday.
12. In July 2007 the Standards in Public Office Commission said that Fianna Fail had failed to report a donation in the party’s statutory declarations for 2005.
13. In June 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made secret deals, using taxpayers money, with independent TDs to secure their support as Taoiseach. Two of these independent TDs, Beverly Flynn and Michael Lowry, had previously been forced to resign from their parties after scandals.
14. In June 2007, Fianna Fail changed the law to create three new Junior Ministers with salaries of €150,000 a year. They had previously done this in 1977 and 1980. When Fine Gael did the same in 1995, Fianna Fail called it an abuse of the taxpayer and an act of hypocrisy, and Bertie Ahern vowed to abolish the new posts.
15. In March 2007, Fianna Fail councillor Michael ‘Stroke’ Fahey was jailed for twelve months after being found guilty of defrauding his own council of €15,000 and falsely implicating an innocent contractor in the crime. The jailed councillor was also chairman of the Limerick Prison visiting committee.
16. In May 2007, stockbroker Padraic O’Connor said that Bertie Ahern was wrong to say that he had given Ahern £5,000 as a loan from a friend in 1993. O’Connor said he was not a friend of Ahern’s, that he had been asked for a political donation of £5,000, that he had given that on a company cheque, and that he had been given in return a false invoice for consultancy work that had not been done.
17. In February 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern praised the Moriarty Tribunal for its ‘outstanding work in painstakingly stripping away the layers of secrecy and obscurity surrounding Mr Haughey’s financial affairs and exposing them to public scrutiny.’
18. In December 2006, the Moriarty Tribunal found that former Taoiseach Charles Haughey took payments of €11.56 million, or €45 million in today’s money, between 1979 and 1996, and granted favours in return.
19. In October 2006, it emerged that Taoiseach Bertie Ahern had bought his house from businessman Michael Wall, who had been at a dinner in Manchester at which Ahern was given £8,000 sterling. When asked why he had not previously said that Wall was at the dinner, Ahern replied that Wall had not eaten the dinner.
20. In September 2006, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said that, when he was Minister for Finance, he had unexpectedly received a donation of £8,000 sterling from some millionaires who he had a meal with in Manchester on the night before a Manchester United football match.
21. In September 2006, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern accepted that he had appointed people who gave him money to State boards, but he insisted that he did not appoint them because they gave him money. He said he had appointed them because they were his friends.
22. In September 2006, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said that he had accepted £39,000 from friends, including the brilliantly-named Paddy the Plasterer, in 1993 and 1994. He said it was loans, and that he had tried to pay them back but they had all refused.
23. In September 2006, when Taoiseach Bertie Ahern was first asked about allegations of receiving from €50,000 and €100,000 from businessmen, he told journalists that a lot of the report was correct but that ‘the figures are off the wall.’ This, of course, was true, because he got some of the money ‘off Michael Wall’.

Thats not the problem. The problem is non trade barriers. The UK would have no Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU. That means papers are no longer any good.

The spend the currency into existence as they wish and the then tax it back out of circulation in a continuous flow.
For the state/currency issuer, money is simply a tool to measure and allocate real resources produced collectively by society through the labour of the working class.","Mar 13th 2017, 2:30 PM"

If we were to take the polls as a measuring stick a significant amount of people in Scotland do not want a 2nd referendum. And if we were to look at the two previous referendums the Independence one in 2014 and the more recent referendum on European Union membership more people voted in the independence than in the Brexit one. It is the height of hypocrisy that she believes she can ignore one and champion the result of another which was an UK wide vote not one that was done on the home nation level. If she succeeds in getting the PM to agree to another referendum and win it she would manage to get Scotland out of the United Kingdom and the European Union at the same time. Especially when Scotland does 4 times the amount of trade the rUK as it does with the rest of the European Union. The economic arguments for independence in the original independence referendum have been thoroughly discredited as it was based off oil being sold at a minimum of 100 US Dollars a barrel a figure which Alex Salmond described as “Conservative”. However the price of oil is barley scrapping 50 dollars. So where is all of this money going to come from? And on one final note an independent Scotland will be forced to the back of the queue for membership as the European Union has no mechanism for pieces of nations being able to break off and retain membership. And even if it manages not to flat line in the mean time before its considered for membership all the nations of the EU will have to agree unanimously whether to let it in or not. Which would mean Spain would never let it in as its trying to prevent the Basque and Catalonian peoples from breaking off from their nation. Since if Soctland is let in then every other independence movement in Europe will start clamoring for separatism.","Mar 13th 2017, 12:26 PM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/hsbc-irish-jobs-warning-over-brexit-3179237-Jan2017/,"The depreciation of a currency is not necessarily a negative. As sterling depreciates this makes makes British exports much more competitive abroad and so they will tend to increase in volume which ultimately manifests as increased foreign currency reserves in the Bank of England.
IIn addition, imports are generally paid for in the currency of the importing nation and so the state can always afford to purchase anything for sale in the currency it issues regardless of the price.
In real terms, exports are a cost to a nation and imports are a benefit. A nation loses real resources (goods & services and the labour required to produce them) when it exports. In return it receives the currency of the nation it exported to. That currency is created by pressing computer keys or printing pieces of paper, nothing more. So the exporting nation has swapped it’s real wealth of goods and services for computer keystrokes or paper. The importing nation of course gets the benefit of the good & services it has purchased with electrons or paper.
The foreign currency which the exporting nation has received may in the future be used to purchase the products of the issuing nation (or converted to another currency) but there is no obligation on that nation to sell it’s goods & services if it chooses not to and it gets to decide at what price it will sell and for what currency.
“MMT emphasizes that in “real” terms, imports are a benefit and exports are a cost. Floating the currency and relaxing capital controls allows a nation to enjoy more “benefits” (imports) and fewer “costs” (exports). The nation can “afford” to enjoy all the output it can produce plus whatever output the rest of the world wants to sell to it. It “pays for” those net imports through expansion of its capital account surplus. On the capital account, this is reflected in rest of world accumulation of financial claims denominated in the importer’s currency.”

Look at Switzerland for an example. It is part of the Schengen Agreement and so are all the countries bordering it. As a result travellers generally do not have to show their passports but rather an official ID card. Moreover although private cars may be stopped on occasion for inspection, this is not always the case. Often frontier posts are not staffed at all and travellers are asked to fill in a customs declaration and leave it in a drop box. Passengers arriving at Swiss airports from non-Schengen countries must show their passports, Shengen arrivals do not.
There are plenty of ”fast lane” clearance procedures available to regular EU importers and exporters that can be availed of to reduce delays into and out of Ireland from UK provenance. Local import control, local export control, allow goods to speed through ports and land boundaries and subsequently be declared and duty paid by trusted traders. Everyone intending to do serious business with the UK and other third countries should consider applying for Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status that will considerably simplify and expedite their customs obligations and processes.
Mutatis mutandis the same can be done for citizens of the Common Travel Area between IRL and UK as between Switzerland and the other Schengen Members. The EU will have no choice but to allow this, for otherwise it would be unfair and inequitable treatment of a member state vis a vis what other Member States can avail of. Stop all this scaremongering it’s bad for biz.
One thing we should copy from the Swiss is the ‘vignette’, or toll card, which non-Swiss cars must purchase entering Switzerland if they don’t already have one, and which covers the cost of road tolls for a year.

In other words, one of the main proponents of this massive change isn’t even sure it will work for his country or not. That’s not the way he sold it though. Hypocrite of the highest order.
That said, if Britain do manage to make a success of this, then that would shift sentiment in this country and potentially even make an exit vote close. You’d need to convince some of the centre-right voters though, not an easy sell by any means, even then.
But here’s the reality. No-one has any real idea if this is going to work for the UK or not. Personally I don’t think it is, I think it’s a massive mistake that will cost them dearly. But, of course, I could be wrong; there’s just not a whole lot of precedent here to go by. I do know one thing though, you aren’t negotiating an agreement, of any sort, with the EU in two years.

EU reports shows between 1973-2005 180 Billion was lost to Irish government die to foreign fishing fleets in Irish waters. Additionally if Ireland had fish processing plants then money was 360 billion lost. Exclude the 40 billion in EU aid the loss is 140-320 billion given away because of an underdeveloped fishing industry policy that was deliberately mis handled by FF/FG/LAB led government . From 2008 troika part of Irish waters were handed over to Norway and Iceland in the troika bailout plus the Pension Reserve find of 25 billion. Since 2008 we have lost 7.5 billion in fishing stock alone or 15 billion if a proper built fishing processing industry was in place like in Iceland, Norway as examples. Still not touched on the oil and gas reserves given away is another story of political cowardice and filling their own 1% collective pockets at the expense of the 99% in Ireland.

And yet, this is precisely what so many on the Remain side have been doing – blindly deifying the EU and sneering at anyone who dares suggest the EU is anything less than perfect. True, many people voted Leave for the wrong reasons (immigration for example).

That court case is not vital at all. The UK parliament will vote through A50, and I’ll tell you why.
Let’s imagine for a moment that UK parliament blocked A50. This would almost certainly trigger a ‘snap’ General election in the UK (the recent fixed term Parliament laws still allow for elections in exceptional circumstances). All current polling puts May miles ahead of Labour and the smaller parties. The election would become a ballot on brexit. With Theresa Mays Conservative committed to delivering Brexit and all the other parties (except Ukip) fighting the election on a remain platform, what do you think would happen? The conservative party currently holds a majority in the UK parliament that was won with a lot less than 17 million votes (circa 10mil I think it was – I stand to be corrected!). Even if some of those who voted for Brexit changed their minds, there would still be only one outcome, a massive win for the Conservative party and a huge new majority in the houses of parliament. Many potential conservative candidates in such an election will be faced with the choice of fighting the campaign on a Brexit footing or losing their seat to Ukip, who could obviously stand to gain from such an election, but would of course offer no hindrance to the passage of the A50 bill through parliament.
All the incumbent MPs know this, that is why Labour will not block the A50 bill. They don’t want a conservative party that sits on a 400 seat majority any more than anyone else does, despite the obvious opportunity it would give them to finally get rid of Jeremy Corbyn.","Jan 4th 2017, 1:59 AM"

1) Both very desirable and very possible but will require overall agreement of how to manage the passage of people from the island of Ireland to mainland UK, including non-Irish EU nationals. Most likely a soft border with the North and a harder border with the mainland, enforced at Ferry ports and Airports.
2) A “TTIP-style” trade agreement between the EU and Europe is the work of a decade. In order for this to be achieved seamlessly there would need to be a transition period of at least 5 years to wind the UK out of the common market and move them into this new agreement. May has said that won’t happen so Irish vendors with strong links should, at the least, be preparing for short term tariffs. It seems from her posture that May would like these to be set at a non-punitive level for a period of time as a preference to a transition period. This will be a hard sell for some EU countries who just won’t benefit from it.
4) I’d be amazed is Scotland is still part of the UK in a decade but ultimately that is a Scotland-England issue. I bring it up only because the tone set here will not fly in Holyrood *unless* May can get them serious concessions on the transfer and sale of their North Sea Gas. The current EU wide agreement here would put Scotland squarely in the Russia box (ie 3rd Party Transporter) which will mean high tariffs for using the European transmission network. This would be very bad for Ireland as we’d get hammered for Gas moving in to Scotland and again to get it back across our inter-connectors. This is one of the areas where our government really needs to be on the ball. Shame they haven’t even mentioned it yet…..
6) Pretty sure the Americans won’t be allowing the Brits to share their intelligence with the EU, there is already a different, more restricted agreement in place that. I reckon this is just being thrown out as a disingenuous platitude.

Yes, there were times, I’m sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
And through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
I’ve loved, I’ve laughed and cried
I’ve had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
“Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way”
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
The right to say the things he feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!","Jan 17th 2017, 10:21 PM"

• National Transport Authority (NTA) study shows that the largest increase in in morning peak travel (0700-1000)is inside the M50 – not to/from the Airport which hasx peak time of 0600 during hte working week;
• the need for quick access between the Airport and the City centre is a red-herring given as another NTA study found that
1. Almost half (46%) had a journey time of less than 30 minutes to the Airport;
2. Three-quarters (75%) had a journey time of less than one hour to the Airport;
3. Three quarters(75%) of all trips were either for holiday/leisure (nearly 50%) or visiting friends/relatives (over 25%), which does not suggest people being time-constrained;
4. Less than one-third of Airport trips originated in Dublin City Centre/south part of Dublin City;

Interesting way of phrasing it. What is being implied of course is that those who are voting against the EU and Merkel’s refugee policies, against the EU policy of appeasement of fundamentalist Islam, against the scale of immigration of the past 40 years, against neoliberalism and against the failed policy of multiculturalism are:
1. Simply protesting – i.e. they’re lashing out blindly, emotionally, irrationally, driven by their deep, dark fears and instincts. The knuckle dragging plebs couldn’t possibly be making decisions based on policies and interests, oh no….
2. Being manipulated by rich people into believing that furriners are the cause of all economic difficulties and economic interests are what is motivated their decision making. The concept that they might have legitimate interests other than ones that can be counted in euros and cents doesn’t seem to occur to some commentators.
“We know to our cost from European history, the totally destructive forces that nationalism can unleash. The EU has over the past 50 years provided a bridgehead away from war and nationalism and towards cooperation and peace.”
You know what else can be totally destructive? Appeasing a committed, violent and intolerant minority – that’s Islamist fascism, open borders and leaders lying to and sneering at those who put them in power to disguise their own blatant economic interests.
Nationalism can be destructive, yes. So can an unlimited number of other human ideas. This obsession with one evil – racism is of course what they mean by nationalism – is a short-sighted hangover from a particularly traumatic period in recent memory in one tiny part of the world. It’s parochial, it’s historically lacking in perspective and it’s destructive.","Dec 29th 2016, 10:59 AM"

It was only when Henry VIII converted to the Protestant faith, removed the title of sovereign from the pope and took it for himself, that the Irish began to rebel against foreign occupation. For the next 400 years the Church did all it could to regain the control it once enjoyed. Following independence the Church’s influence was re-established and actually enshrined in the 1937 constitution. This subservient attitude permeated all levels of Irish society, with one ex IRA chief of staff- the so called radical Sean MacBride- telling the pope in 1948: “my colleagues and myself desire to repose at the feet of Your Holiness the assurance of our filial loyalty and devotion…”.

1) While I was voting yes to each and every EU referdndum (except the last one), Sinn Fein was strongly advising me to vote NO. Back in the 1970′s, 1980′s and 1990′s they wanted a No vote. It was not just the border, It was the concept that the Irish people could best govern themselves alone as an equal partner with the rest of the world.
Now they have turned a full 180 degrees and want Ireland to stay an EU member. In order for that policy to be justified, there would have to be a significant change in the policy direction of either the EU, The Irish government or the British government in the interm.
So why did I trun 180 degrees against Ireland’s membership of the EU?, It was because I tried to use the EU institutions and complaints sytem to demand compliance with EU laws on protecting the environment and discovered this access is denied.

Well……it looks like the State will MAKE a £500 million subsidy to assist in decommissioning and try and retain oil sector jobs in hope of a turn around in oil prices!!
A cost of -£500million!!!!!!!!!!
A swing of £5.5bn from the SNPs manifesto projections!!

Then it becomes a case of fitting the facts and manipulating the arguments to justify the end!
That’s why we see so many inconsistencies, half-truths, creative statistical interpretations and crucially a strong reliance on the emotional argument (which you’ll note has shifted now from braveheart patriotism to one of Brexit injustice and disenfranchisement) from the SNP.
Remember when it came to the crunch (and despite years of demanding a referendum) the SNP had no plan on currency, no economic plan (literally 2 paragraphs), hoped the EU would open its arms despite its official position, didn’t account for its share of national debt and in the face of every projection promised an oil price boom to pay for everything!
I could go on.
Let’s face it there is no economic benefit to Scottish independence. It’s a matter of arguing how bad things will be! The economy is 2nd to Greece at the moment at the foot of the EU table. So now they claim that every Scottish vote to remain in Europe is a mandate for independence. This is extremely dangerous lunacy!!

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/uks-brexit-choices-3140053-Dec2016/,"“From the time the EU makes its final offer, the UK has only two choices: “take it or leave it”. If rejected, on the expiry of the period, there will be a Brexit which is as hard as you can get and on no terms whatever.” That is how I understand the situation. But you will have Brexiters insisting that UK holds all the cards because they buy so much from EU. In fact 45% of UK exports go to EU, 5% of EU exports go to UK. But Brexit is about faith over facts, particularly uncomfortable ones. EU and UK will calmly discuss terms and when it’s over it’s over. They either take the deal on offer or they leave as a ‘third country’ with no links and they join queues in Brussels, Washington, Beijing, wherever, for future trade deals in an increasingly polarized world.
“It would be lunacy for the UK to proceed with the Article 50 notice without some vital terms being agreed in advance. Without this the UK will be entirely at the mercy of the EU in the negotiations and the EU itself at the mercy of a “rogue member”.”. Yes, I don’t put it past them to let the 31 March self-imposed ‘deadline’ drift past and then seek to remain at the centre of EU concerns and discussion pretty much indefinitely. They’d like being a festering sore, pissing inside the tent rather than from outside. There is an EU treaty article which the EU could invoke to cast them out but that too would take time. I’ll bet on their letting 31 March slide. They’re not totally mad but they are totally cynical about the EU project since day one in about 1950.
“It would be lunacy for the UK to proceed with the Article 50 notice without some vital terms being agreed in advance. ” That is definitely not an option for the EU before March 31. It’s not going to happen without UK’s ignoring their own deadline and maybe not even after that. I think it (” vital terms being agreed in advance”) is never going to happen because every member state would be in permanent negotiation and functional disruption under threat of leaving. Ireland could do it to ‘save Apple jobs’, or whatever. Not going to happen but they may very well play the waiting game until they are thrown out.
The current cabinet ignores Parliament. They can ignore the people too until 2020 GE.
Lastly, I agree “Ireland has done due diligence on Brexit.” I have seen impressive and precise documents about the possible outcomes. I don’t much like our government, but I’m not into reflex assumptions that the system is endemically incompetent. Some issues involving important interests (banks, FDI) are firmly dealt with. The Irish government saw the Apple case coming and had been an interested party in similar ECJ cases, one involving Spanish banks that I vaguely recall. So be assured, all ye foreign multinationals and other important interests, Team Ireland (ridiculous term) is on the job and while we are part of ‘Team EU’ (ridiculous label from Mr Flanagan), we will look out for our own inner circles and the Apples and Pfizers who, not EU/Germany, really own us. Just like UK will look out for the City, first and foremost. There is nothing else this side of a general election against a clueless, divided Labour.

In my view this statement misunderstands the Article 50 withdrawal procedure. Yes, the process is loaded against the departing state and places them at a significant disadvantage. That much is true. But this isn’t a flaw in the process. It’s an integral part of it.
An organisation like the EU lives or dies by internal stability. Any activity damaging to that stability (i.e. the withdrawal of a member state) must be actively discouraged. This isn’t some underhand European conspiracy… it’s the nature of almost all large organisations to resist and disincentivise disturbance and uncertainty.
While we in Ireland may want a “soft Brexit”, and while European negotiators will publicly speak about “securing the best deal for everyone”, in reality if Britain is not negatively impacted by the Article 50 procedure, then it won’t have done what it was designed to do… discourage nations from choosing it.","Dec 20th 2016, 9:07 PM"

I wonder if Ruairí uses this lie deliberately or not but it has been a common tactic of the remain propaganda machine which he clearly is a part. The fact that so called “hate crime” is purely subjective gives rise to an ever expanding occurrences being reported and recorded.
It is a ludicrous piece of law that anyone could fall foul of, for instance two Irishmen in a Manchester pub, overheard discussing the merits of Mr Bonner as a goalkeeper, could be hauled down the police station based solely on the subjective opinion of someone sat in the corner and took sensitivity to hearing Mr Bonner’s first name.
And God knows what might happen if they were also discussing a well known Bayern Munich winger of the 1970′s
Here is the text to the conclusions to a Civitas report about the spike Ruairi mentions. It pretty much debunks it.
“There was a rise in reported hate crime incidents in the immediate aftermath of the EU
referendum. Precisely what this signified, however, is open to question.
First, it should be noted that the vast majority of recorded hate crime incidents consist of verbal harassment
rather than physical violence. Further to that, the police definition of a hate crime is one that
is „perceived‟ by the victim to have been based on prejudice; this means that in the strictest
sense the surge in reported incidents only represents a surge in perceived prejudice. This is
an important caveat usually ignored in media coverage. Many crimes reported as being hate
crimes, most notably including specific incidents that have been highlighted by the media in
recent weeks, actually have little evidence to support them being classified as such. By the
same token, there is usually little if anything to connect individual incidents with the EU
referendum, even if there have been many more people reporting „hate crimes‟ since the
vote.
It should also be noted that reported hate crime has been trending upwards for the last few
years, long before the EU referendum campaign began.
Does this reflect a widespread increase in intolerance towards certain minorities? Or does it reflect the rising profile of hate crime as a category of offence and the opportunity to report it via, for example, True Vision?
It is difficult to say with any certainty but there is no objective barometer signalling rising
intolerance. Similarly with the surge in reports in the aftermath of the referendum. It seems
as likely that reports of hate crime were being fuelled by the perception of a rise of
intolerance, which was in turn fuelled by police and media reports driven by that perception,
in a vicious circle. “","Dec 28th 2016, 12:03 PM"

The document in question specifically stated that police forces had recorded ‘no major spikes in tensions’ since Britain went to the polls.
However, its footnote added that 85 people had logged hate crime ‘incidents’ on True Vision, a website that records unverified allegations of such behaviour, during the four days in question, up from 54 during the corresponding period a month earlier.”
