For example, I wrote to the Taoiseach regarding the inequity of an Irish citizen being denied car insurance because she had an Australian Driving Licence and after 6
months of passing the buck from one department to another, I was informed that
the relevant Minister could not do anything about this blatant inequity due to EU regulations.
A simple thing like a citizen’s eligibility for car insurance and, consequently, her ability to drive her car in Ireland should not be regulated by the EC, IMO.
It seems silly for a Bulgarian or a Rumanian who has driven on the right side of the road, can’t speak English let alone Irish to be eligible for Irish car Insurance when an Irish citizen , born, educated and lived in Ireland
for 21 years (but now living in Australia) and who has driven on the left side of the road all her life is denied Irish Car Insurance and thereby prevented from driving her own car while visiting Ireland.

It is best to consider and debate the consequences for Ireland of a Hard Brexit vs a Soft Brexit rather than shooting from the hip. Ireland is taking some minor steps to diversify trade so that its dependancy on the OK is minimised and with it the negative impact of a Hard Brexit.
For example Kerry Gold butter has appeared on supermarket shelves down here in Aus in the past 4 months and even though it’s priced at $4 versus $2.50 for local generic brands, it seems to be being bought by the Irish here for sentimental reasons rather than value for money.
Perhaps before advocating a Hard Brexit we should first consider its impact on the Irish
Economy and on the working class’ standard of living. After all self interest is the basis
of Western Economics.","Jul 17th 2018, 5:32 AM"

Also if the UK leaves without any agreement the EU will lose tens of billions from not reaching a deal.

When the economic crisis did come about, it was the British who were the first to offer a helping hand when they extended a generous loan to the Irish state at a very reasonable interest rate. The interest rate on Britain’s bilateral loan to us was considerably lower than the usurious interest rate that the EU initially demanded of us when they forced us to accept their bailout. The British have been Ireland’s best friend during the 21st century.

Which is what the author wanted. Basically he said that UK trade growth with with WTO counties has massively increased (135%ish) from their 1993 base levels while UK trade within the EU and trade agreement countries has increased less (70%ish). There he stops and asks no one to look any deeper. It’s ignores the law of trade gravity entirely. And the original base levels of trade. Also these figures are precentage increase in trade not precentage of trade. In 1993 WTO only trade was 15%ish of the economy. The EU and TACs making up the rest. By 2016 WTO trade had decreased to 12% even though the volume of goods the 12% represented was a 135% increase on 1993.,"Dec 18th 2018, 10:24 AM"

I live 2 miles from the border in an area that has suffered such economic degeneration border areas need more trade not barriers to trade .There is many a border crossing too in Louth way more than Sweeden has.And Sweeden closes its borders in Ireland .The border crossings in Loufh of which there are over 100 remain open all the time.And the state will never have the manpower to close all crossings

A lot depends on how the future, post-Brexit UK shapes up. The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) was predicated on the understanding that Britain no longer had any “selfish or strategic interest in Ireland”. Since Brexit, the language has changed and some are openly calling into question the value of the GFA. The truth is that, in the context of Brexit (both the negotiations in the run up and what follows after), Northern Ireland becomes a valuable strategic asset, from Britain’s point of view. To some, it might seem like Britain’s legacy problem but post-Brexit, it could be a torn in the EU’s side – one that Britain would use for maximum leverage in the event that the EU doesn’t ‘play nice’. If things get nasty, Britain will know how to use the existence of an invisible and largely porous border to their advantage. How is the EU going to face up to the problem of sealing it, if that is deemed to be necessary? Get the Irish Government to do it? That would be controversial but not unfathomable. How did the border come into being in the first place and how has it lasted this long? People harbouring the dream that Brexit is a further stepping stone in the inexorable drive towards a United Ireland, might do well to prepare themselves for a (crushing) disappointment. Who is to say that the outcome might not be to make partition, not just formal but as final and complete as say, that of India and Pakistan?","Apr 11th 2018, 9:42 PM"

Personally as painful as and no deal BREXIT will be in the short-term in the longer term it would benefit us immensely.
It would force the EU to reform itself. The EU (mostly Germany and France) have tried on numerous occasions to up end our corporation tax. The UK was our main ally in resisting this. Without reforms respecting national sovereignty how long to you think we can hold out with them gone? If there was a common EU tax policy it’s a near certainty that multinational companies looking to set the shop here would jump to parts of Eastern Europe where wages are far cheaper.

Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit has been ridiculed by European ministers after he told Italy it would have to offer tariff-free trade in order to sell its prosecco in the UK.
Carlo Calenda, an Italian economics minister, said it was insulting that Johnson had told him during a recent meeting that Italy would grant Britain access to the EU’s single market “because you don’t want to lose prosecco exports”.
“He basically said: ‘I don’t want free movement of people but I want the single market,’” he told Bloomberg. “I said: ‘No way.’ He said: ‘You’ll sell less prosecco.’ I said: ‘OK, you’ll sell less fish and chips, but I’ll sell less prosecco to one country and you’ll sell less to 27 countries.’ Putting things on this level is a bit insulting.”","Jul 7th 2018, 2:29 PM"

sort out our priorities and then decide on the compromises we want to make in order
to achieve the long term goal of unification.
If we don’t believe in unification , then we disrespect the aims of the 1916 martyrs and those who died in the War for Independence who gave us the 26 Counties with the prospect of 32.
We in the South have contributed to religious bigotry by allowing the Catholic Church
too much latitude in the formation of the Republic when we should have been a secular
state with religion treated as a private matter.
No wonder the Rev Gibson has brought up education with his meeting with an Taoiseach. The Catholic Church has hogtied primary and secondary education in the State since 1921 and now a clutch ageing Catholic clerics living off the taxpayer through school premises’ rent while calling the shot on cariculum and teacher selection;
not a bad gig for a seemingly obsolescent religious regime who has proven itself to be not trustworthy around children,,,,eh?
Take Killarney for example:
We have 2 St Mary’s Churches; one a magnificent Cathedral refurbed twice over the past 40 years by American Catholic millions: First by Bishop Casey and later by John McShane (the builder of the Pentagon)
And we also have St Mary’s Protestant Church, shabby chic to be charitable, going wreck and ruin if we are realistic, with a withering congregation.
And needless to say; the local primary and secondary schools are dominated by the
Kerry Catholic Diocese.
To someone like the Orange Rev, the merger of NI & the Republic would decimate Protestantism in NI if we judge what happened in the South from 1921 to the present.
We simply have to make compromises if we want a united Ireland and a secular State
with the State ownership of primary and secondary schools and the Catholic Church
debunked from its role in forming curriculum and selecting teachers a fundamental start.

The richest Muslim women in the world are battered, tortured, drowned and stoned because they make choices. Unfortunately, their barbaric and heartless culture predicts that for them and ultimately, they are without choice.
The Princess Trilogy By Jean Sasson
Draft review
When a girl is born in Saudi Arabia, her birth is not legally recorded. It is an event of insignificance.
‘The Princess Trilogy’ tells the story of one such princess, Sultana, her eight sisters, her brother, husband and two daughters. It is rare to get such a realistic, frightening and honest hands on insight in to the life of the royal princesses born in to the exuberant wealth of Saudi Arabia.
She gives us a glimpse in to a guarded and secret society. She describes in detail the experiences that she, her sisters, daughters and friends endured at the hands a strict, male dominated society, steeped in archaic cruelty, egotism, ignorance, abuse and violence.
She tells us about one of her friends who innocently flirted with a young boy. Her punishment was death by drowning. The young girl was murdered in the family swimming pool. The event was attended by the girl’s family, friends and neighbors. Sultana was forced by her father to watch her friend die.
Another friend narrowly escaped death for a mediocre oversight. The young woman spent the rest of her life under stringent house arrest in what is commonly known as ‘The Women’s Room’. She spent the remainder of her life there, alone with no human contact, nothing for company except the voices in her head that would eventually drive her to madness and death
Her brother Alex is guilty of brutal barbarities, including the rape of an eight year old child. On another occasion as the result of a’ sexual emergency’, he raped a woman in a coma in her hospital bed.

- What are your proposals for recognition of the unionist community in the North?
- How do you propose to integrate the PSNI with AGS? What do you propose to do with PSNI members who don’t want to be in AGS, or won’t swear in. How do you propose to monitor said members with advanced police training afterwards?
- Do you propose to ban or allow the orange order marches? What’s the plan for civil unrest against either outcome. Will the newly merged Police Service of Ireland be able to enforce one or the other within their own communities? Will we ship up former AGS members to police the parades? How will this be thought of by members of the unionist community? Will they see this the way the nationalist community saw British soldiers on the street.
- Should the NHS in the north continue under general taxation, or does it get merged into the HSE? How do you propose to deal with protests in the event of the latter?
- Will students in the North have to sit the Irish leaving cert? If they don’t, will the exemption be allowed for a kid in Cork? Will that kids parents be able to take the department of education to court?
- WIll they pay water charges in the 6 counties and not down here? Will they pay council tax and not the south?

- The border is a proxy for the ROI maintaining a close and frictionless trading relationship with the mainland UK. The real economic goal is the common travel area and business as usual for Irish exporters to the UK. Our government knows that the Irish sea would never be accepted as a border, so the real goal is to forces a soft brexit
- The EUs interests in obtaining a soft brexit deal and keeping the UK within its customs and other controls are well served by the border question. They can maintain a peace stance, a comradery with their Irish partners stance, but the border solution will be a reflection of the trade solutions for Rotterdam, Le Havre, Calais etc.
- The border is a proxy both sides in the UK, for soft brexiteers and remainers to push for remaining within the envelope of extra-EU co-operation; for hard brexiteers as a symbolic shutting of the border with the EU, and as a symbol of the UK’s autonomy and self-governance.

Before Brexit the UK did the head of the EU by trying to run the EU their way and at its core is arrogance, vanity and pride by those politicians who think they can still control the EU after Brexit on their own terms. They want to keep everything the same on their own side with trade without realising what Brexit is. Brexit has shown how racist the Brexiteers are and how they don’t realise what a hard Brexit is. A hard Brexit will ruin the pound, the majority of people will lose their jobs and people will take their anger out on politicians. A hard Brexit would make the UK people turn against the DUP and therefore N. Ireland, it could be as bad as the UK people wanting a referendum to get rid of N. Ireland due to a Brexit that will destroy peoples lives.
All the Brexiteers are complaining about how bad May is doing it but yet not one of them will offer any ideas on what to do for Brexit especially the DUP and the DUP will damage themselves with Brexit for good because of their stance?
I feel that the EU has created its own destruction now with the rise of extreme parties in it, with problems with the Euro that only a Political Union could fix but that would be going too far and the more integrated it becomes then the bigger its cracks become as well? Brexit might be harsh but if it works then if anything happens to the EU then the UK might save us as the EU sinks.

Buying goods from the UK will play havoc with the cashflow of EU businesses, and I hope that they are looking around for alternative suppliers in other EU countries.

The British government is committed to issuing an official response to any petition which reaches 10,000 signatures — although it has left the UN compact petition unanswered for 12 days now — while petitions which break the 100,000 signature mark must be considered by Parliament’s Backbench Business Committee for a full debate. Contrary to what the powers that be say, the Compact has legal value and is legally binding on its signatories. Not only this, but it allows no room to reverse these policies, and blocks the signatory countries from EVER restricting the entry conditions into their lands. Key points of Compact for Migration: 1. Migration will be a human right ( illegal migrants will not be arrested ) 2. Countries must promote the cultures of these immigrants, and promote diversity to it’s citizens 3. Countries must help inform the migrants so they best can choose which country they want to migrate to, develop legal immigration pathways, thus turning consulates into actual agencies for the management of migration routes and the settlement of migrants into the host country of THEIR choosing. The Compact aims to provide assistance at all stages of their migration routes and facilitate their settlement into the host countries by providing legal advice, customised financial aid and protection. And , of course, to facilitate ‘family reunification’. Another ‘objective’ is - to put in place the pillaging of the host countries, to implement the portability of social security benefits for those migrants who choose to leave their host countries. - to support massive transfer of funds to their countries of origin - to encourage salaried migrants to transfer the technologies they acquired in industrialised countries in their own countries of origin. - To INSTITUTIONALISE THE EXISTENCE OF PARALLEL SOCIETIES of alien origin, by granting communities of origin full legal recognition, access to public funds and then give them the means of public action and their own financial capability such as investment funds for these ‘communities’. 4. Countries must “sensitize and educate media professionals on migration related issues” and stop public funding to outlets that promote so called ‘intolerance’ 5. Countries must work to eliminate all forms of COUNTER EXPRESSION to this mass migration 6. Newly arrived migrants in Europe should have the same rights as native Europeans This Compact will give ‘legal status’ to 225 million migrants, who’s journeys will be promoted, organised and protected by international law. The following countries already refused to sign this Compact: United States, Hungary, Czech Republic , Croatia , Slovenia , Slovakia , Austria, ,Bulgaria, ,Poland , Australia , Belgium , Denmark , Italy , Israel , Dominican Republic , Estonia , ,Russia , Korea , Japan, Latvia, Romania.

In case you don’t want to read it all I’ll quote you a section, (excuse the length but there were a lot of exports)
The export of livestock to Britain (with the exception of pigs) also increased during the Famine. Whilst the export of pigs decreased, the export of bacon and ham increased from 930 cwt. in 1846 to 1,061 cwt. in 1847. In total over three million live animals were exported between 1846-50, more than the number of people who emigrated during the Famine years. In 1847, 9,992 calves were exported from Ireland to Britain, which represented a thirty-three per cent increase on exports on the previous year.
A wide variety of other foodstuffs left Ireland apart from livestock—vegetables and pulses (particularly peas, beans and onions), dairy products, fish (especially salmon, oysters and herrings) and even rabbits. In February 1847, 377 boxes of ‘fish and eggs’ and 383 boxes of fish were imported into Bristol alone. The butter export trade was particularly buoyant. In the first week of 1847, for example, 4,455 firkins of butter (a firkin equals nine gallons) were exported from Ireland to Liverpool. In the following week, this had risen to 4,691 firkins. Large quantities of butter were exported from Cork to all parts of Britain. For example, in the first nine months of 1847, 56,557 firkins of butter were exported to Bristol and 34,852 firkins to Liverpool. During the same period, 3,435 poultry were exported to Liverpool and 2,375 to Bristol.

The EU has no major incentive to seek a deal with the UK. The loss to the EU in a hard Brexit scenario is minimal compared to the loss the EU will face if the UK gets a good deal and prospers outside the EU. Similar to the Greek situation, the EU must inflict the hardest cost possible on the UK in this instance.
However, the EU took a lot of criticism in their approach to the Greek crisis. They did not come across as a friendly and cooperative bloc. This is where Ireland and the Irish border comes in. The Irish border allows the EU to inflict a substantial cost on the UK for leaving. And it can all be completed by actually appearing to be supportive of smaller EU states.
The UK won’t accept the restrictions that the EU will aim to put on them in the talks. So both the EU and UK will figure that a “no deal” is the best outcome for both parties. Leo and Simon will rejoice that their EU friends have stuck beside them without realising that a “no deal” is actually the worst outcome for Ireland.

It also ties the UK into a possible “never ending” backstop. For Brexiteers this is useless. For remainers it is worse than what they currently have. For those reasons there is not a snowballs chance in hell this will be agreed.
TBH the whole idea is so dumb it is hard to believe so many people fell for it. The people were sold a pup in the lead up to the original vote. The EU is not to blame for the poor economic performance of the UK, its also not to blame for the widening divide between the “haves” and the “have nots”. That is the fault of the UK government and wont change if there is a brexit.
The whole idea of brexit is full of contradictions. I listened to a Cornish fisherman who voted for Brexit so they could control their waters. He captained a trawler with a crew of three, all from Lativia because he couldnt get Brits to do the job and most of his catch was sold to Europe. A hard brexit will really mess him and his business big time! He also mentioned the amount of political lobbying he witnessed on his one visit to Brussels. I wonder has he been to westminster to witness the similar lobbying that goes on there?
The Brexiteers, Boris, Mogg and co should be asked what they actually want. Do they really believe the EU will give them a better deal than is currently on the table and why? And what is their plan for a hard brexit and the inevitable economic mess that will follow?","Nov 27th 2018, 1:18 PM"

No matter how much one hates it (immigrants, big trading blocks making the rules) it is the world we live in today and that world is about getting access to hundreds of millions of the world’s wealthiest populace. Britain outside the EU loses access to the EU’s marketplace and the EU’s FTA trade deals to sixty-one countries outside the EU. Getting a free-trade deal on goods is easy, its almost impossible when it comes to service, capital, and supply chains. There are three big marketplaces on the planet, namely EU, ASEAN, and USA. All three are highly protective and use their size as leverage to get trade deals that suit them. ASEAN or USA would be more than happy to sign Britain up to an FTA deal on goods and send a super-sized container ship to Britain’s shores, but that is missing the point completely of being a member of a trading block and it can have detrimental effects like a large quota of NZ / Australian lamb putting Welsh farmers out of business. Hence trade deals take years to accomplish in order to set tariffs correctly and get a trade deal that is suitable for Britain. The Brexiteers are liars, who know full well that Britain will never leave the EU as Westminster will never allow it, they are doing it for their own selfish political gain or have ulterior motives that are not transparent. Leaving the EU for a special trade deal with USA will not be a good idea, for starters American industry will colonise the UK and USA is too far away for Britain to access American supply chains. Ships take a long time as opposed to road, rail, sea, and air transportation links with EU and the fact Europe is on Britain’s doorstep.","Dec 15th 2018, 2:55 PM"

The comparisons made are:
1. Both issues stemmed from plebiscites: But so what? Democracy was a generally accepted idea in these islands at both times.
2. The negotiations took place against an unequal political landscape: So what? Life is often unequal.
3. One side had to pay the other to leave: Wrong and disingenuous – The UK is not being asked to pay a portion of an invading empire’s debt, they are being asked to fund previous commitments on projects and UK officials’ pensions. Furthermore – they can simply refuse to pay. It’s their own prerogative.
4. Sovereignty. This is funny – the UK is not being forced to handover any sovereignty whatsoever. They can leave without a backstop if they choose. Furthermore, the customs and standards arrangements in the backstop are not onerous. Even from a practical perspective, there are currently livestock checks between the two islands, and every passenger already has to show a passport flying from Belfast to, say, Birmingham. The argument that NI would have to take on future EU standards is a bit weak – NI farmers want to sell into the EU and know dropping standards will not be good for business.

In politically normal times we could perhaps depend on the opposition in Westminster to provide an alternative, but sadly, the Labour Party is immersed in a concocted “anti-semitism” controversy, while the far-left faction currently in control of Labour are at one with their mirror-image counterparts on the right of the Tory party in wanting to be rid of the shackles of EU membership. The irony is that the far-right wants Brexit because it will allow them to follow a regulation-free course of ultra capitalism, while the far-left believes the EU shackles the UK to capitalism, and precludes nationalising the commanding heights of the economy they desire. Given the far greater likelihood of the Tories continuing to be the principal governing party unless the Scottish Nationalists implode, the only (highly unlikely) hope for a good ending to the Brexit debacle would be for the centre and left of the parliamentary Tories to co-operate with the centre and right of the parliamentary Labour Party in the manner they came together in the national interest in 1940.","Sep 2nd 2018, 12:49 PM"

Incidentally, there is no “neighbouring agreement” between NI and Ireland that allows fishing inside the 0-6 mile zone. If you check with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) they will confirm this. Moreover, Northern Ireland is not a separate country and is not an entity that could ever contract with Ireland under the London Fisheries Convention. This was tested and confirmed by the Supreme Court recently in a case taken by Irish fishermen when Dutch owned mussel farms in Northern Ireland were “somehow” given fishing rights in Ireland for mussels.
The UK and Ireland do allow reciprocal fishing in each other’s 6-12 mile zones based on limited historical areas and species at the time of the Fisheries Convention. Needless to say Ireland got very limited access to the UK …..","Nov 16th 2018, 3:43 PM"

The statement that “A majority of the English public see themselves as something separate, something apart from their European neighbours” hits the nail on the head but that has always, rightly or wrongly, been the case. We have always, rightly or wrongly, seen ourselves as semi-detached from European civilisation. This isn’t about being anti-Irish or anti-Polish or whatever. It isn’t about failing to see the common humanity in a person from Bratislava. It just that an attempt to put our identity into a box which includes Ireland but not Canada, or Austria but not Australia or Spain but not Singapore doesn’t fit with our conception of ourselves. There are obviously some countries with which Brits have more in common than others, and Ireland would be near the top of the list for many people, but you wouldn’t find that the list is full of EU countries at the top and everyone else at the bottom.
It is not the Brits who have changed so much as the EU. We were happy when it was a trading area, but its political ambitions have grown and it is dawning on the Brits that the ultimate plan of some at least (and let’s be honest, the Germans especially) is the creation of a single federal state. We blame the EU for having deceived us about that, even when most of the deception was practiced on ourselves.
Sometimes leavers are criticised for wanting a return to the British Empire, but I think that that misses the point. Whatever British people think about the rights and wrongs of Empire, there is a general feeling of warmth towards ex-colonies and an acknowledgment that independence from Britain, although perhaps not easy, was absolutely the right thing to have happened. We see Ireland, India Canada and Nigeria prospering outside of an Empire, decide that leaving an empire and reclaiming sovereignty is a good thing in principle and we decide we want a bit of that too for ourselves. Trouble is that we are not in an Empire, so we see the EU (not completely without justification – think about the symbolism of signing the Treaty of Rome on the Capitoline Hill) as an emerging empire and kick against that.","Mar 22nd 2018, 9:52 AM"

But I bet you would rightly give the Germans credit for confronting their past and being particularly vigilant about the future even if it occasionally makes their nationalism antenna over sensitive.
The point is that the Brits did empire, we acknowledge that it was wrong and are glad it is now over. That past makes us rather reluctant to be involved in anything that looks even a little bit imperial again. Maybe we are oversensitive, but the British Empire was not wrong because it was British, it was wrong because it was an Empire.","Mar 22nd 2018, 11:34 AM"

In fact, when it comes down to it probably every three in ten has some sort of Irish heritage. In some areas that rises significantly. As many second, third and ,fourth generation offspring have integrated they may appear on the outside to be ” English” or whatnot but they still have even tiny amounts of loyalty to “the hone country”. Also, they haven’t been subject to the rampant propaganda of the early 20th century which prevailed in Irish society after independence right up to the 80′s (note, I am by no means saying independence is a bad thing or that it wasn’t right in Ireland, it simply wasn’t a big thing in GB outside the local community or holidays home).
Having grown up in England during the height of the troubles I, nor my family or friends who were diaspora ever experienced issues for our nationality (that I’m aware of). In fact, we were welcomed into society. Yes there were the paddy jokes and whatnot but back in the day anyone ” different” was fair game before we achieved the upper echelons of snowflake society. In fact, the only thing our family “experienced” in a bad way was regularly being pulled over by the police…that could have been because of the dodgy hand painted Cortina (it was a thing in the early 80s for rusty cars) or it could have been because of my dads strong Donegal accent (perceived as nordie)..hard to prove though! Ultinately, life was pretty ‘normal’ and no different to here.
It’ll be interesting to see how Brexit affects the relationship between Ireland and England\GB, it truly would be a shame if it impacts our ability to be good neighbours, good friends (see what I did there?). I’m pro European and without going into too much detail I would hate to see barriers between these islands…the only issue any of us have in any area of these islands is the the nordie politicians on both sides insistent on hate.","Mar 22nd 2018, 10:08 AM"

This reminds me, when growing up and getting ready for the big summer holiday, we would say “were off to Ireland” and the reaction nearly always was “but wouldn’t you prefer to go abroad?”. Ultimately, most English don’t know a great deal about Ireland or Irish nationality because its barely mentioned in the education system, unless they have Irish relatives. Also, you have to bear in mind the English are instinctively inward looking when it comes to anywhere else on these islands. They have their own misguided propaganda touts and many think other places on these islands get some better deal or some such.
Overall, the old saying ” An Englishman’s home is his castle” is pretty much spot on, he will view anyone he doesn’t know particularly well with distain and contempt until he knows them better…that’s why high walls/hedges and net curtains are a big thing over there, its a privacy thing.

The purpose of the registration was to establish to what degree immigrants were filtering into the workplace and into higher level office jobs. In other words it was a way of establishing the extent of integration.

My distaste and concern is mainly towards the government’s behaviour rather than that of the British people, who I think really don’t realise how personal the anti-immigrant narrative that the Leave campaign established around Brexit has felt to us. I have not noticed a difference in the behaviour of British people towards me –although I am arguably so integrated most people probably don’t register I am foreign, and of course our patients don’t care one way or the other. But it is like something was said that has left an embarrassing silence, and now cannot be taken back.","Mar 22nd 2018, 4:13 PM"

*************************************************
I think any country who voted to leave would be in the same position. Once the UK decided to leave you are right that the UK was unprepared. Juncker and Co. demanded that article 50 be handed in almost immediately and so the UK was forced to proceed without proper preparation. I think that the hostility felt in the UK by the European Commission in particular is definitely having an influence on peoples feelings now. This does not mean that the UK is anti Europeans but it is increasingly becoming anti EU. Even staunch remainers are now questioning themselves in light of increasingly hostile language from the commission. (draft withdrawal agreement and every Barnier press conference)
I’m not sure that when other EU countries including Ireland have to pay tens of billions more into the EU every year then they ever got out and be over ruled by a Franco/German alliance that their attitudes wont change also.","Mar 22nd 2018, 9:13 AM"

decisions do to social-change movements, Roe’s critics focus on
the damage done by judicial intervention to the larger society.
This criticism, which the Article calls the “beyond backlash”

Scalia has woven this argument into a demand for the overruling
of Roe. In the broader legal academy, scholars believe that post Roe
polarization provides a powerful warning about the
consequences of particular interpretive methods—particularly,

He was notoriously anti-Germany but during a “Who Do You Think You Are?” TV show, he discovered that he was descended from German Royalty.

In true Boris flippant manner, after this ‘shocking’ discovery, he cheekily looked at the camera and said “I must be off to claim my kingdom!”
But he’s got it all wrong on Brexit.
If a new vote was held, now that so many awful consequences for British people have been exposed and realities of a Brexit are biting hard, I’d bet that a very large majority would now change to ‘Remain’. Boris and other Brexit diehards do not want their political careers destroyed now that their claims during their ‘Remain’ campaigns have been proven wrong, which is why they still battle on, on a losable cause.

He was genuinely shocked, on TV, to discover he had to go to Germany to go back further from Parisian origins to discover where he was from. His found he is of German Royalty origins.
I always believed myself to be a true blue Dubliner (ya can’t call yerself such if ya don’t have at least 3- or 4- generation prior Dublin forebears; I’m 5th-generation) but surprisingly discovered my male DNA is likely of Nth coast of Ireland origin (Derry/Antrim county border areas, of O’Connor Irish kingship blood origin) but more likely of Offaly kingship origins (it depends on the differences in the scales of DNA, the Offaly one is closer). Both would make me of ancient Irish “royal” families, for which I should perhaps reclaim my own Irish “kingdoms”.
However, I was totally shocked to find, on my maternal side, that I might have minor British Royal blood, introduced into Ireland under Cromwell’s invasion of Ireland. I’m still chasing that up any truth in that.
Boris, the anti-German Brexiteer, was really shocked to find, in that TV programme, that he is of German Royalty origins.

South and north of the border share electricity grids, agriculture, healthcare, or tourism and it has lead to prosperity as a united Ireland is prosperous. If an economic border is placed there, which disrupts this prosperity its going to be DUP’s fault. There is already a different customs arrangement between Britain and NI on livestock, so what is the DUP’s issue with the customs border being in the Irish sea?

Companies have already started to address the issue of a shortage of labour by automation which Britain lags behind Europe in, even eastern Europe. Repetitive cognitive jobs will eventually be replaced by robots, which will increase productivity and wages.
The reality is for me whether it be Britan or whatever country exercises their right to Independence and tries to get the best deal possible for their people even if it does mean some financial hit is worth taking.

Irish people have a right to move freely anywhere on this island north or south.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-theresa-4395054-Dec2018/,"The British showed courage and a truckload of self-confidence by voting for Brexit, after the EU bureaucracy had rebuffed former UK prime minister David Cameron’s very reasonable proposals for reform of the European Union (reforms which would have benefitted all EU countries, including Ireland especially).
Now the British Government has been bitterly rebuffed, once again, by Brussels at a critical time when flexibility would have been a more prudent course by Brussels, given the zero room for manoeuvre that Theresa May has in the House of Commons.
The only course left for the UK in the aftermath of yesterday’s EU summit is to once more be self-confident, and boldly leave the EU on March 29th ready to trade on WTO terms. When that happens, the EU will come hurtling up the Channel Tunnel willing to settle for any deal.
The UK being prepared to trade with the EU according to WTO rules does not constitute a “no-deal” or “crash” Brexit (these are emotive terms contrived by the media and by the opponents of Brexit), of which there is no such thing. WTO rules are designed to facilitate orderly and smooth trade and, hence, Brexit on WTO terms would be an orderly Brexit.
After March 29th, if trade between Britain and the EU is based on World Trade Organisation rules, the EU will come looking for a favourable trade deal with the UK because continental European countries (and Ireland) export a lot more to the UK than the UK exports to other EU countries. The EU will also desperately want some more (as a final settlement) of what the UK currently contributes in membership fees. For these two reasons (the UK’s trade imbalance with Europe and the mountains of cash that the UK can give as a kiss-off settlement), Britain has the upper-hand with Brussels if the UK waits until March 30th to sign a deal and shows that it is prepared to do business with the EU on WTO terms.","Dec 14th 2018, 9:56 AM"

the Office for National Statistics Pink Book 2017 (see tables in Chapter 9) and the HMRC
database UK Trade Info.
• In 2016, UK exports to Ireland were worth £26.7 billion; imports from Ireland were
£20.8 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of £5.9 billion with Ireland.
• The UK had a surplus with Ireland in both goods and services.
• Ireland accounted for 4.9% of UK exports and 3.5% of all UK imports.
• Ireland was the UK’s 5th largest export market and the 9th largest source of imports.
(Source: House Of Commons Briefing Paper 8th Dec 2017)
The big issue is how much of this trade will be adversely effected by Brexit and what
is the Irish Government doing about it now? Surely the Government should be diversifying trade with the rest of the EU to soften the inevitable negative impact
of trade barriers.

Enda Kenny was presented with an award today by the European Movement in Ireland. The award was for “Irish European of the Year”. However the award is nothing more than a self congratulatory slap on the the back.
You see the European Movement has an Honorary President. His name is Leo Varadkar. Before Leo got the job Enda held the position. On the board of the European Movement Ireland is Jillian Van Turnhout. Jillian became a senator as result of a Taoiseach’s nomination by Enda Kenny.
Of course such an organisation must be funded. Where does it get it’s funding from? €200,000 from the department of the Taoiseach.
So basically today we have had to listen to wall to wall coverage of Enda giving an award to himself. Worse still. You had to pay for it.","Jun 11th 2018, 4:55 PM"

The ROI has to:
-Change the constitution to enable a secular State
-Decentralise Government by establishing 4 strong provinces like the Canadian model
-Allocate reponsibility for education, health & welfare to the provinces
-Enable the provinceds to collect tax
-redistribute the VAT pro rata to the Provinces
-Abolish the Co Councils
-Exclude Churches from public primary & secondary education
-Religious education should be privately funded
As such, this would allay most of the fears held by the Unionists about having fair and equitable treatment in a United Ireland. The Catholic Church has had untoward influence
on the ROI since 1922 and it is about time to debunk it given its horrible track record in te 20th Century.

Germany managed to bridge an economic and ideological gap to achieve its unification

In my opinion there is bigotry on both sides of the border and we have to wake up to that just as much as we expect the DUP & the Orange order to wake up to their NI brand.
Just as the Catholic Church still harbours a deep resentment towards Protestantism, so does Protestantism return the “favour”
Ireland is more than we and them, its more than religion because if there is a God, I’m sure He/She will not discriminate . Like most Catholics, most Protestants are good
generous and charitable human beings and upright citizens and just as the Protestants have their extremists, so also do the Catholics.
Ireland should simply come out and declare itself as a secular state to accommodate its
citizens whether the be Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or any other religion because religion should be a private matter and not an integral fabric of the state and let’s face,
Ireland existed before Christianity.","Dec 17th 2018, 10:09 AM"

Thing is, compared to the previous idiots we had in charge of the Garda, this one actually understands intelligence reports. A definite first for the Garda.
On top of that, if he has contacts in MI5, then he might actually be useful, as the previous Garda Commissioners were to thick to contact the security services in other countries regarding serious crime, which they were supposed to do as it is part of their job.
Irish candidates for Garda Commissioner so far have been a disaster. Even if he was working directly for MI5, he might still be better than the previous bunch of muppets.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-super-canada-brexit-4258500-Sep2018/,"@Chris Mansfield:
I believe there’s an agenda in not defining the technology. Lots of large companies already maintain traceability systems to ensure there’s no corruption in their supply chain. For example, pharmaceutical companies have origin traceability which can be used to demonstrate fake prescription drugs sold online etc.
Similarly, large food processors need to monitor and control the contents and the environments in transport vehicles, so they have trusted systems for verifying origins.
Now, here’s the rub. Any technological solution that could cover the next 8-10 years would likely amount to a standards certification and inspection regime being applied to a tweaked version of what certain corporations already do. The technological solution won’t be available to small to medium sized importers, other than where individual registrations can be traced (such as bovine livestock, which was widely fixed due to BSE some time ago).
So a technology solution can be found quickly for the biggest companies, many of which will have the legal and compliance departments to get up to speed rapidly during a transition period. For others, the cost of electronic compliance will be too high.
In the medium to long term, a combination of physical and virtual seals, combined with traceability on a trusted public transaction ledger (e.g. a Blockchain solution) can probably work. A lot of cross-border trade will likely end up going down this road, and the EU and China are already investing in this to weed out counterfeit products and provide accurate food origin traceability in both directions e.g. for beef going to China.","Sep 28th 2018, 10:02 AM"

Lie after lie that Westminster got away with because the McCrone Report which anyone reading this should go and read, how England shafted Scotland by getting this report done to find out how wealthy a country Scotland would be with discovery of oil, the report stated, a very wealthy small country, Westminster went on to file that report away, never to be read by the public for 30 years, in that time, they made sure Scots would never contemplate Independence, we never knew how much wealth we had because it all went into Treasury and Scotland only ever got around 8.7% in return, England benefited mostly from Scotland’s oil yet insulted us decade after decade calling us scroungers. The reason interest in Indy went from 27% for many years to at one point near the IndyRef vote of over 50% then back to 45% was because so many Scots read the McCrone Report and realised that once again, Westminster had shafted Scotland. There is a lot the people south of Scotland and in N.Ireland that are absolutely clueless as to what actually has happened throughout the history of this bloody awful union. This time we will leave, the polls show results but most exclude 16/17 years who are the biggest pro Indy group, we know how politically active they are and how much they will fight to be part of EU, it is their future and when they get the vote again in our soon to be IndyRef then this will take us over the 50%.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-trump-uk-visit-protest-4126682-Jul2018/,"I have a hard time getting behind these current anti-Trump protests. Perhaps I’m being unfair but I cannot help but wonder would these middle class young urban protestors be out this weekend if the war-mongering Wall Street puppet Hillary Clinton got elected in 2016 instead. Because to not do so is to legitimise this horribly duplicitous system which makes one right wing party (ie, the Democrats) seem like the compassionate humanitarian good guys. Like where they interview one protestor and he states he believes that many Trump supporters are good people. So could this give a Trump supporter the right to turn around and reply back that he believes all Hillary supporters have the same blood of Iraqi or Libyan children on their hands as Hillary does because they only come out to protest Trump’s crimes but ignore Hillary’s (or Obama’s) … but he too believes Hillary supporters are mostly ‘good people’.
Let’s say for example, Hillary was 80 per cent as bad as Trump and was president instead. Would we have seen 80 percent of the protestors this weekend? Sadly, I hypothesize the turn out wouldn’t even come close but would just be a mere fraction. And those few that did come out to protest Hillary would get no media coverage in the ‘respectable’ Democrat crime white-washing outlets like the NYT, the WP, the Guardian, Ch 4 News, etc, etc, because afterall she’s their fascist! And perhaps if there was scant coverage, it would be to show scuffles with the police (stirred up by paid agitators).
So while we have these kind of duped, naïve or even cynical protestors (which I fear a great many of them are) then the way is paved for the Democrats to run another fascist in 2020 but just in a more liberal wrapper than Trump. She will be a feminist woman of colour no doubt and will tick all the middle class identity politics buttons of these very protestors and then they will all stay home or come out to celebrate her visit.
Or another protestor stating he’s out to protest a fascist Brexit. Does that give the impoverished Brexit supporter from a small Northern English town on life support the right to challenge him about the fascist EU that imposed brutal class war fare like austerity especially on the people of Greece to punish them for voting the wrong way?! Or an increasingly militaristic and police state EU kinda sounds fascist too, doesn’t it?
Another female protestor stated she was out protesting the misogynistic things Trump said about women. Are misogynistic statements really that bad that they warrant protest. Because those women in the Rust Belt that voted Trump obviously don’t agree as they do not have the luxury of stressing over misogynistic statements when putting food on their tables is a major concern instead – Trump promised to put food on their table, Hillary largely ignored them but to call them deplorables. I would also ask that young female protestor if she was repulsed by all the non white women throughout the world that Hillary, who claims to be a feminist, killed and maimed. And why she didn’t protest any of Hillary’s previous UK visits?
This is not an endorsement of Trump but an attempt to see the bigger picture. I wish I could be more positive about these protests but I can’t, as I fear they possibly do not see the bigger picture.","Jul 16th 2018, 3:17 PM"

The arch-bigots of the DUP are brought into the centre of power, with Labour making overtures to them also. Thereby also boosting the control of the DUP over the protestant workers in Ireland. Sinn Fein are keeping their heads down, playing the same role as Labour, in restraining working-class action against political reaction and austerity. Did Sinn Fein collapse the Northern Ireland Assembly because of the contradiction between their feeble anti-austerity protests and their actual implementation of austerity in the Assembly?

“The deal will create a trading zone comprising 635 million people and a third of global GDP” (Independent)
We live in a highly competitive, globalised world, with large trading blocks fighting for dominance. The three biggest marketplaces are EU, ASEAN, and the USA. But its not just about an FTA deal on goods (usually very protective on services and capital). It’s about access to supply chains and easy access to hundreds of millions of the world’s wealthiest populace, which is what makes the EU so powerful.
The reason why there is an Irish backstop is that ROI has EU leverage in the trade talks with Britain. There would be no Irish backstop if Ireland (ROI) was not an EU member. Barnier negotiated the Irish backstop for ROI.
The EU is by no means without its faults, but it could maybe described as a necessary evil in today’s world. Britain is leaving the EU through sheer arrogance and blindness. I doubt Britain will leave with no deal from the EU as the economic cost is enormous and its a right-wing element in British media and a few British politicians (manipulation) that are being deliberately deceitful for selfish interests.","Dec 14th 2018, 12:58 AM"

Calling the very obvious consequences of the decision to leave Project Fear and setting their own red lines that contradict the EU’s is woeful management of the situation.Only the most stupid believed that Britain could leave the EU and dictate terms that gave them preferential treatment to the 27 remaining members,Teresa May didn’t believe it which is why she campaigned for Remain.

The Independent in the UK interestingly quoted polls which showed a swing in Labour’s favour if Corbyn promised a final vote on the deal, and potentially enough votes to overturn Brexit altogether. Given Corbyn is a Eurosceptic though, I’m not sure the volte-face is in him. He always seems quite genuine and true to his beliefs, and I don’t think he’s power hungry enough to try and see where the wind is blowing.

Argentina formally claimed the Malvinas in 1820 (after ceding from Sapin, who where the previous de facto owners). By 1826, a year after the British officially recognised Argentine independence, Argentina had a military garrison and colony on the Malvinas promoted by Argentinian businessman Luis Vernet.
However, on the 2nd January 1833 the British annexed the Malvinas; a Captain John Onslow arrived forced Vernet to lower the Argentinian flag, they did not resist due to superior firepower of the British. The British then kicked the garrison off the Island but they allowed Argentinian settlers to stay.
The British claim the Islands because they say they discovered and landed on the Islands first in 1690, but the Island were later claimed by Spain. The British built a fort on the Island 1766, Port Egmont, however, there was no civilian colony established and the British did not defend the sovereignty of the Islands. In fact, the French had established a colony on the Island in 1764, before the British set up their fort, called Port Saint Louis it peaked with a population of 250. The French turned their colony over to Spain in 1766 (renamed port Puerto Soledad) and when the Spanish found out about Port Egmont in 1770 they sent ships to tell the British to feck off, which they did. Spain took control of the Islands.
The British also claim the Argentinians never made a fuss about annexation till 1941. On the other hand, the Argentinians claim they made an official complaint to the British each year from the time of annexation and the annexation was debated in the Argentinian parliament for many years after. Also, US recognised the Malvinas were Argentinian in an 1839 court case (Williams v. Suffolk Insurance Company), over an incident where Vernet had impounded a US whaling ship, the US court recognised that the Islands were indeed Argentinian.","Nov 30th 2018, 10:11 AM"

The term Sandwich comes from when the Earl of Sandwich used to order his meat between two slices of bread in his favourite club, of which I cant remember the name. Its a very English thing. Anyway the UK grows plenty of things to put between slices as they have a more diverse agricultural industry than ours. They have bumper crops of salad produce this year, as well as the grapes and apricots looking good. The wine industry is booming due to the amount of vineyards expanding at a massive rate and they are producing bubbly that knocks spots off champagne.

Only chance of a deal now is a UK election and the conservatives returned with a majority. The DUP could no longer blackmail the government.

We caught our own fish in the river and lakes which are now polluted by ag chemicals and piggery run-off. Of course we had to import the tropical fruits .
We grew our own oats and wheat and wheat and ground it for porridge and flour
Last year while travelling around the country we played a game of “spot a potato field” and we travelled over a week before we saw one on the far south west tip of Donegal and it was more a garden than a field. I asked my farmer brother-in- law why he did not grow potatoes but he said it wasn’t worth while when you can buy a puck in the supermarket for 5 Euros. Perhaps we outgrown our agrarian economy through EC subsidies and laziness. and we need a catalyst to reset the economy and bring us to our senses because local food has a low CO2 footprint. But of course the Greenies forget that and want wind generated electricity at a price we can’t afford!

Ireland needs to walk a tightrope between pushing the UK and EU to make the border as soft as possible but avoiding making unrealistic demands (like that there cannot be any automatic number plate recognition cameras at all, something which ignores the fact that on many roads the cameras are already there for security and policing and anti-smuggling purposes) which run the risk derailing the talks completely and causing a disorderly Brexit which would be very damaging for both the UK and Ireland.","Apr 20th 2018, 11:12 AM"

I have no issues with Ireland’s approach other than Varadkar could be more constructive, bring some ideas for solutions to the table and then sell them to the rest of the EU if they look workable.
Telling the UK that we need to come up with a solution and then rubbishing any and all proposals put forward is an entirely predictable tactic by the EU, who’s raison d’etre is to prevent the UK seceding.
I’m not an expert in border technologies, but you can’t tell me that a solution is beyond the wit of man. The political will has to be there though. It is both in Westminster and Dublin, and I believe in Stormont. It isn’t in Brussels.
The state most at risk is Ireland. The UK and NI will absorb the economic shock of a hard border more readily, unpalatable as it would be.
Most likely the UK would simply not enforce it. Let the EU set up checkpoints, good luck with that.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eu-border-3967833-Apr2018/,"One remarkable fact that came to my attention in looking into this is the percentage of trucks arriving from outside the EU that Irish Customs currently inspect is 1%, the lowest in Europe. The EU appears quite content for them to do that and doesn’t see that as a systemic threat to the integrity of the single market.
The UK has an inspection rate which is almost, but not quite as low, although the container port in Bristol says that it has only opened 2 containers in the last decade.
The fact is that modern borders don’t typically require a huge amount of inspection of goods.
A UK-Ireland border could potentially be more lightly policed than Ireland’s current border with non-EU countries because:
1, CTA means that people smuggling is not an issue
2, contraband like drugs/guns etc are illegal on both sides of the border,
3, the UK is likely to stay in an all-Ireland animal healthy agreements meaning that veterinary inspections would not normally be needed (unless of course there is something like a foot and mouth outbreak, but when that happens you get movement restrictions and inspections even within a country),
4, a comprehensive FTA would eliminate tariff differentials and therefore an incentive to smuggle many goods.
It doesn’t mean that the post brexit border is not a massive issue and a huge headache that Ireland didn’t ask for and doesn’t want, but it does help to put the size of the problem into perspective. Both NI and Ireland are small places where most trade is local and both places are on an island with a limited number of freight ports out to the wider world.","Apr 20th 2018, 11:01 AM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-4320405-Nov2018/,"English nationalism will eventually split up the UK & the Irish Border debacle is simply the tip of the iceberg. For me some values underpinning Brexit are reasonable. For example, the EC has gone too far in impinging on the sovereignty of its member countries by enacting legislation away outside of its original objective of a common market with the EC acting as a comprehensive Federal Government.
We now have a significant shift to the right among younger generations and sovereign
governments’ ability to change domestic legislation as per political parties’ policies is
essentially hogtied.
For example, I wrote to the Minister for Finance expressing concern that I was being denied Irish Car Insurance simply because I had an Australian Driving Licence while
recent immigrants from East Europe automatically qualified for car insurance was unfair and inequitable even though I was born in Ireland and I now live 3 months a year in Killarney and that I have retained my Irish citizenship for 53 years.
Almost a year later I received a convoluted letter explaining that the relevant Minister could do nothing because the Republic was bound by EC regulations.I simply can’t get an Irish driving licence within 3 months and then when I return to Australia I am required
to change my licence back to an Australian driving licence before I can drive in Australia.
This puts me in a “catch22″ pucker.
The EC (EEC-Common Market) should have stuck with its original plan of being a common trade zone and not a common Government Zone. Objections by populist nationalists throughout the EC now threatens the entire EC/EZ and Brussels will simply have to repeal its raft of laws that do not directly relate to a free trade/free customs zone;
otherwise Brexit will likely lead the way to the EC’s demise.
The original intent of the Common Market was to protect Europe from another WW and free trade was the vehicle. The morphed EC now seeks to be a defacto Federal Government ultimately relegating national governments to Co Council status.
IMO there will be another Brexit Referendum with the option to either accept a hard Brexit or to remain in the EC but by then the Uk will have done considerable economic damage to itself and permanently fractured the UK .

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-amendments-4133708-Jul2018/,"The “backstop” is really gone… it went when the UK government announced that it would not be a permanent arrangement anyway. Now the “no border” is really gone too if the UK leaves the Customs Union and drops EU regulations and makes trades deals with the USA. The only real question, based upon the current UK position, is how hard the border will have to be as the UK has said “no border” in the Irish Sea.
Disregarding the UK and Ireland common travel zone (no passport control) the question I pose is how the EU can protect itself from imports of Chicken from the US as it is currently banned as they use chlorine in the production process. Post Brexit the UK could allow this to be imported and what is to stop a consignment from the US arriving in Belfast and being driven to Dublin and on to other EU countries. There are actually two options…. one being customs control on importations from NI (and those being the same as importations for the US or any other non EU country) or there being a customs control on the export of goods from Ireland to the rest of the EU.
Unthinkable as it sounds, there could be checks on our exports to the rest of the EU to ensure that goods are EU compliant. It a customs check going to another EU country is not an option the we have to have a border with proper border controls. The irony of it is that the UK need not implement a hard border on goods entering NI from the rest of the EU via a land route but the EU will insist on border controls on imports into the EU, so when the UK government say “no hard border” they can only talk about the UK side of the border, the EU will dictate the Irish side of the border.
This is actually not a time for political bashing, this is the most important thing to face the country in 50 years at least and everyone should stop wasting brain power knocking others and work on understanding the problems and getting a position that suits Ireland best.
My personal opinion is that we need to stick with the EU, Stirling is in turmoil, the UK industry and financial services are in a panic, major firms has plans to move some operations from the UK, Brexit will almost bankrupt the UK and lead to a reduced standard of living. All this will happen initially, one cannot forecast the long term. I think that given the prosperity of the South versus the failed entity of NI, there will be sufficient pressure on NI to join back into the EU either as an independent entity or as part of a United or federated Ireland. But it is a gamble and in the mean time people living near the border or operating on cross border trade will suffer, no more cheap NI milk for us though","Jul 18th 2018, 10:53 AM"

Example of EU legislative bullying:
A year ago I wrote to the Irish relevant minister expressing concern that I was being denied Irish car insurance for my Irish car because I have an
Australian driving licence (15 Irish based car insurers refused to offer me a quote)
I live in Ireland 3 months a year. I am not allowed to have both Aussie & Irish driving licences simultaneously. It takes 4 months in Ireland to swap my Aussie licence for an Irish one and also 4 months to swap my Irish licence for an Aussie one when I return to Aus . I am and have been an Irish citizen all my life.
Following 12 months of toing and froing between ministers, I was finally informed that the Republic is bound by the EU 2009 Motor Insurance Directive and as such the State powerless to assist me in obtaining Irish Car Insurance.
The absurd thing is:
The Gardai recognise my Australian Driving Licence with its international
Endorsement
-I can rent a car in Ireland even for a prolonged period with my Australian Driving Licence without impediment or penalty
-I have driven all my life on the left hand side of the road
-I haven’t had an insurance claim for over 30 years
-my comprehensive car insurance policy in Aus is less than $200 AUD
for a car similar to my Irish one.
I own a house in Ireland and pay my taxes
-Recent arrivals who arrive from East Europe who have never previously
driven on the left hand side , can’t speak English (let alone Gaelge) can
insure their car in Ireland right away.
What are we?
So in my case, EU law (actually a directive) prevents me from getting Irish car insurance and , consequently, the right to drive my own car even though I am well qualified and fit to do so.
No wonder many in the UK favour Brexit because of the EU’s unnecessary and intrusive laws, rules, regulations and directives which
deprive local citizens of their perceived rights.
Before 2009 I had no problem insuring my Irish car.","Nov 10th 2018, 1:32 AM"

The euro was premature and misguided in the absence of fiscal, legal and economic alignment, the removal of interest rates as a mechanism of monetary policy was wrong headed and not controlling the supply of credit was disastrous.
But the vision of Brexit is ignoble, exclusionary, unworthy and sinn fein in its original meaning. It seeks to restore a notion of pure Britishness, an idea of insular nation apart and not part of Europe.

It looks inevitable now there will be a hard brexit, a return of border controls between North and South and a painful ecenomic hit for us all.

There is certainly no question of its coming about within ten years. You seem to be a southerner like myself making assumptions about the attitude of northern Catholics which are more appropriate to a pre-Brexit scenario. Polls -or at least some polls-seem to show that this section of the population is in the process of re-assessing its attitude
Regarding the European angle you have touched on the nub of the change which Brexit has brought about. In the past the UK provided a large safety net for NI which many middle ground Catholics were persuaded by I’ll warrant. But now the UK itself has embarked on a hazardous path of almost hostile economic independence from its main trading partners. The Euro has suffered after the recent extraordinary crash but Sterling has lost over ten percent and has ten years of Brexit induced volatility in front of it and the UK as a whole is facing a potentially very damaging transition period. The EU safety net looks much more secure to me than the UK one.
While I agree, don’t we all, that it would be in our interest to have proper trading relations between the EU and UK ,I don’t agree at all with your suggestion as to how best this might be brought about. I don’t think that a tiny country like us would have any influence whatever if we detached ourselves from the other EU partners and adopted an independent position on Brexit.
I have personally been shocked at how the UK has been reduced to such utter childishness over this Brexit issue. There is a definite impression that this issue has managed to collect all of the uninformed idiots into one corner while anyone with a bit of sense is in the other. The EU cannot make a deal with these hard Brexiteers nor can it be seen to entertain their laughable Anglo-centric red lines. The EU can only do a worthwhile deal with soft Brexiteers/remainers and needs this section of the UK population to remove the jackasses from the centre of the decision making process. Chequers was only a first step along this road and it is yet to be seen whether it will bear fruit ultimately but if it does not then WTO is the only game in town. The EU does not need our tiny little stick with which to beat Britain. The UK has been busy providing a stick for its own back.
The Brexiteers have completely ignored the effect of their actions on this island and have used their positions of authority to offer vacuous re-assurances that they did not want a hard border and that everything would be alright. Barely credible and trite evaluation comes naturally to them.. They are no friends of Ireland. Lets try to hold on to the ones we have got in the EU.","Jul 27th 2018, 9:21 AM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-costings-4144760-Jul2018/,"There are many Germans, east and west, that now would want the border back up. East Germans feel they are still being ignored and not having the same chances and the west Germans don’t think it’s right they still pay a monthly tax for the east. Which is compulsory for everyone. Wages are also not at the same level throughout Germany. There is a reason why so many Germans working in ireland are from the former east. In my personal opinion the east is now much better off, but the west isn’t. Then again it didn’t hurt Germany too much either.
Now take that back to Ireland. We can make a saving in the north by no longer paying for defence and security, but that would mean police officers and soldiers will get unemployed. If we save €1.7 billion on civil servants it will see another 200.000 unemployed north and south. How about our health sector? Can the HSE afford the number of doctors and nurses in the north?
Will people in the republic want to give €150, and probably more, to Northern Ireland out of their wages every month? Especially people on lower incomes? And if we make the rich pay for it will they not just move away making the situation even worse?

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-costings-4144760-Jul2018/,"If I may make an observation on Irish unification from across the Irish Sea (England) it is that it is instructive to listen to the voices of NI unionism and to their arguments against unification. I have noticed that these have changed. The old reasons to be British rather than Irish have faded. These included:
1, Ireland is poor (not any more)
2, Ireland is “backwards” (no longer true if it ever was)
3, Ireland is “priest ridden” (much less so)
4, Ireland was not on the right side in WWII (fading into irrelevance as time passes).
Unionists still (by definition) have reasons to prefer NI being British rather than Irish, but they are much more pragmatic concerns like loosing access to the UK NHS. Crucially many of the concerns of Unionists are now things that in the event of reunification Dublin could, if they were smart, at least partly address. Whilst there are still “hard core unionists”, there are many in NI who have a unionist preference but could live with NI switching from being a somewhat self governing part of the UK with some Irish features to being a somewhat self governing part of Ireland with some British features. I predict that that switch will happen in my life time and so long as it is done smartly, sensitively and cooperatively, I don’t think many in GB would object.

“2. Union law on the banking union conferring upon the European Central Bank, the Single Resolution Board or Union bodies exercising similar functions, authority over credit institutions is applicable only to credit institutions located in Member States whose currency is the euro or in Member States that have concluded with the European Central Bank a close cooperation agreement on prudential supervision, in accordance with relevant EU rules and subject to the requirements of group and consolidated supervision and resolution.
The single rulebook is to be applied by all credit institutions and other financial institutions in order to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market. Substantive Union law to be applied by the European Central Bank in the exercise of its functions of single supervisor, or by the Single Resolution Board or Union bodies exercising similar functions, including the single rulebook as regards prudential requirements for credit institutions or other legislative measures to be adopted for the purpose of safeguarding financial stability, may need to be conceived in a more uniform manner than corresponding rules to be applied by national authorities of Member States that do not take part in the banking union. To this end, specific provisions within the single rulebook and other relevant instruments may be necessary, while preserving the level-playing field and contributing to financial stability.”
“3. Emergency and crisis measures designed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area will not entail budgetary responsibility for Member States whose currency is not the euro, or, as the case may be, for those not participating in the banking union. ”

But there is also a parliamentary no-confidence vote. This can be brought by the opposition at any time.
By now it can be assumed that DUP would vote against May, as would the 6 ministers that have already quit for Brexit reasons, plus all the opposition parties. Even without further internal dissent, the government is basically guaranteed to lose such a vote; subsequently fail to form a new government within 14 days; and trigger a General Election.
The only question is what is the opposition’s strategy for timing a no-confidence vote. Better to let the Tories and coalition tear themselves apart, rather than risk the electorate blaming opposition parties.","Nov 16th 2018, 1:10 PM"

Faced with the disastrous implication of having lost—largely as a result of a protest vote expressing widespread social and political alienation—the ruling elite was thrust into bitter factional conflict over how best to defend Britain’s global interests.
The pro-Brexit factions pinned their hopes on using the election of Donald Trump to piggy-back on US demands for unrestricted access to European markets combined with the right to negotiate independent trade deals internationally. May sought the same end goal but was brought face to face with the reality of Britain’s weak position and the full implications of the growing antagonisms between the US and Europe.
Rather than folding under US pressure, Germany and France have taken a hard line against the UK to preserve the unity of the EU while seeking to strengthen their hand against Washington. The week leading up to the Brexit text announcement was dominated by official commemorations of the centenary of the end of World War I, leading up to the meeting in Paris of 70 world leaders. Such is May’s isolation that she could not contemplate attending and stayed to mark the occasion in London. More significant still, hostile relations erupted between the US, France and Germany over President Emmanuel Macron’s declaration that Europe needed its own army—not only to combat the threat from Russia and China—but in recognition that the US was no longer a reliable ally.”","Nov 16th 2018, 11:53 AM"
