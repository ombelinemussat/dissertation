IRELAND HAS GONE on a charm offensive following Britain’s vote to leave the EU, hoping to woo London-based financial institutions despite fears Dublin is ill-equipped for an influx of high-flying executives.
Martin Shanahan, head of IDA Ireland, said he expected British companies in all industries that depend on access to the EU market to relocate some services to countries within the union.
As the race to secure such business heats up, Ireland is honing its pitch.
“Make no mistake, any investment that becomes mobile as a result of a UK exit from the EU, we are in the market for that business,” Shanahan told AFP.
Dublin is just one of the cities hoping to poach some of London’s investment bankers, with Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Amsterdam also aiming to reap some of Brexit’s spoils.

As the only other EU member where English is the first language, Ireland believes it is best placed to host City of London exiles.
Among its other attractions, the IDA cites the fact that Dublin is just an hour’s flight from London, Ireland’s legal system is similar to that of Britain, the country has a well-educated workforce and it boasts a low 12.5% corporation tax rate.
City on the Liffey
Dublin’s financial hub – the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) – has been in business for three decades and employs around 30,000 people.
In one of the first such announcements, British investment fund manager Fidelity last week said it would move 100 jobs from London to Dublin, while stressing the decision was made before the Brexit referendum.
But not everyone is convinced that Dublin is a little London in the making.
Paul McAuliffe, chairman of Dublin City Council’s Economic Development and Enterprise Committee warned that the city’s “creaking” infrastructure made it unfit to cater for a corporate influx.

“One man remarked to me recently that if even one percent of London’s economic activities migrated here, we would be absolutely crippled and I would have to agree with his assessment,” he told AFP.

McAuliffe relates a litany of shortcomings, from a dearth of properties for sale or rent, patchy public transport that causes daily traffic gridlock to the existence of a single runway at Dublin Airport.
Housing shortage
The annual Web Summit that used to attract tens of thousands of heavy-hitters from the global tech world announced last year it was decamping from Dublin to Portugal to ensure participants had access to hot showers and wifi, among other staples.
“After three years of asking and asking we still don’t have even one single page outlining even a basic committed plan for the city,” the event’s frustrated co-founder Paddy Cosgrave told the government.
The IDA chief played down the problems, pointing out that investment from abroad had added 19,000 new jobs last year and that the economy, which rebounded from years of austerity to post a staggering 26.3% growth last year, is in rude good health.
He conceded that the emergence of a the ‘Silicon Docks’ tech hub in Dublin, housing European operations for giants like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn had added to the housing backlog.
“There are pinch points, particularly in housing but this is now top of the government agenda and will be addressed,” Shanahan said.
A senior IFSC-based finance executive said a shortage of experienced traders in Dublin would also see it struggle to compete.
“There is certainly no reserve pool of experienced forex traders in Dublin so relocation of first-line services on the asset management side would mean recruitment in London,” the executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
At the moment, such hires were only happening at the rate of “ones and twos,” he added.
The IFSC trader was under no illusions about Dublin’s ability to take advantage of a London “Brexodus”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/business-warned-refund-irish-consumers-2853135-Jun2016/,"EUROPE HAS WARNED businesses in the UK against trying to dodge giving refunds to EU customers.
The issue was brought to the attention of the European Consumer Centre (ECC) after one UK-based trader refused to refund an Irish consumer who had bought goods online – citing the result of the Brexit referendum as the reason.
The item in question was a dress which the buyer said didn’t fit correctly.
Under EU law a 14-day ‘cooling-off’ period exists, when the person doesn’t have to give a reason to receive a full refund.
However, when this person went to get their money back the company told them that EU consumer law no longer applied in the UK.

Not happy
The ECC are pretty clear on this: EU consumer law for Britain is going nowhere just yet.
“A trader using Brexit to refuse the consumer’s right to cancel a distance contract is disregarding the legislation currently in force in the UK to protect consumers,” it said in a statement.
The consumer body states that these rules are “unlikely to change in the near future” and that “negotiations in relation to trade and other issues that may impact our future relationship are expected to take quite some time”.
The part of EU law that makes sure consumers can change their mind when buying something off the the internet is the EU Consumer Rights Directive, which is transposed into the UK law.
Beyond the initial fortnight laid down, it is possible that this period can be extended should there be a “breach of information” from the trader.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-questions-2829259-Jun2016/,"WITH BRITAIN SET to go to the polls next week on leaving the EU, much of the Irish focus has been on the border.
With Ireland’s only land border an already contentious issue, its use as a political football this week has vexed many.
Speaking in Northern Ireland two weeks ago, British Chancellor George Osborne said that the Warrenpoint ferry could become the subject of passport checks.
Just this week, in the last Prime Minister’s Questions before the vote, David Cameron reiterated that point.
He said that a leave vote would mean either a return to a land border between north and south or “some sort of checks” as people leave Belfast for the rest of the UK.
“Therefore you can only either have new border controls between the Republic and Northern Ireland, or you’d have to have some sort of checks on people as they left Belfast.”
Border argument

The European Commission says it is not commenting as it does not want to campaign on either side, but Revenue in Ireland is investigating the practical implications – like how much reinstating the border checks would cost.
Locals in the border area fear that reinstatement of checks would be a deterrent to trade and travel.
Leave campaigners say the focus on the border is disingenuous and point out that the EU has a border with a non-EU country that is unpoliced between Sweden and Norway.

However, these are both Schengen Area countries, something neither Ireland nor the UK is.
A Foreign Office plan for the event of a Brexit is more clear on the issue.
Of course, Ireland and Britain had a common travel area before either were in the EU and that arrangement has prevailed over the years.
A government spokesperson directed us to this FAQ, which contains the following:
“It is difficult to imagine a situation where there would be no controls or checks on the movement of goods if the UK left the EU. This would inevitably involve additional costs. There might conceivably also be British as well as EU measures.
“It should be noted that the customs régime between the EU and some other third countries does not, however, involve fixed border posts but a less disruptive mixture of electronic filing and random physical checks.”
Confusion
Sources familiar with the discussions between the UK and EU say that there is “a lot of work to do” on what the exit terms will be if the Leave camp wins on Thursday.
Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides for member states to leave the EU in accordance with their own constitution. However, it does not say how this would be handled.
In that way, the confusion remains over whether the EU would push the Irish government to enforce a border crossing with the north or whether Ireland’s government would resist such a plan.
Some in the Leave campaign worry that Brussels would impose punitive exit terms as a measure to dissuade other countries from leaving the union.
That, however, remains to be seen and would likely not be finalised until sometime this year, should the UK vote to leave this week.

A BRITISH EXIT (Brexit) from the EU could spell very bad news economically for Ireland according to anew report.
The claims, made by London-based apolitical think tankOpen Europe, are based upon an analysis of what economic and political impacts an exit would have on both the UK and Europe at large.
Ireland, as Britain’s closest neighbour and trading partner, would take any exit particularly hard the report claims, possibly even worse than Britain itself.
A worst case scenario for the Irish economy in the event of a Brexit would see us incurring a permanent loss of 3.1% to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030, or roughly €6 billion, while the best we could hope for would see us lose about 1.1% of GDP.
This contrasts with the predictions for the UK itself, which see a percentage increase to their GDP by 2030 assuming the best case scenario for any Brexit plays out.
Open EuropeOpen Europe
In both cases that would see us fare far worse than Britain itself.
There are several reasons given for why an exit would treat us so badly.
Firstly, our trade with Britain dwarfs that which we do with any other country -we currently export 16% of manufactured goods and 19% of services to the UK, with imports totalling 34% and 18% respectively. Given the barriers that will arise if Britain becomes a non-EU territory, the impact on our trade would be significant.
Such barriers would depend on what free-trade agreements the UK could strike up with the EU (an optimistic scenario), if any, or whether or not they’d be forced to rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
The new border costs that would be incurred by the UK going it alone would also be significant according to the report. Regardless of how well Britain might do in striking up trade agreements with the EU, their borders (particularly between the south and Northern Ireland) would have to be secured.

Finally, Open Europe suggest that a Brexit would mean Ireland having to contribute an additional €177 million each year to the EU budget by the year 2030.

British prime minister David Cameron has promised a UK referendum on whether or not to stay in the EU should he be returned to power following next month’s general election there.
The report urges the UK and Ireland to focus upon a common travel area between the countries in the event of a Brexit when the borders between the two countries are redrawn, removing the need for passport controls for example.
But most importantly, Open Europe stress the fact that given Ireland is so dependent on the UK from a trade point of view, it is in Irish interests to back the UK’s (for that, read David Cameron’s) efforts to reform the EU, most of which involve the removal of existing barriers to trade within the union itself, and also with the US.
It should be said that throughout its analysis Open Europe acknowledges that it has consistently campaigned for reform of EU trade rules to the UK’s benefit.
The think tank also claims that a UK exit would see the EU’s political and economic influence “become less globally competitive”, with the new entity’s Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) arrangements to be dominated by a France-led protectionist bloc, fundamentally opposed to free trade agreements.
Potential impact on political dominance within the EU following a BrexitOpen EuropeOpen Europe
So is this all doom-mongering, or do these fears have substance?
Speaking previously toTheJournal.ieon the subject, professor of finance at Trinity College Brian Lucey was very dismissive of both the chances of a Brexit happening, and of the potential impacts on Ireland should a Brexit come to pass.
“Look, a lot of misguided British people may want to leave Europe, but plenty of sensible British people don’t, common sense will most likely prevail,” he said.
It seems that Open Europe themselves are yet to be convinced on the likelihood of an exit happening – they runa barometeron the estimated chances of any exit, and currently the standings show an 83% probability that the UK will remain within the European Union.

He announced his resignation just after 8.20am this morning, hours after the UK voted to leave the European Union.
Cameron said that he will serve as interim prime minister until a new prime minister is in place.
“I’m very proud to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years,” he told a press conference outside 10 Downing Street.
The Conservative leader said that there can be “no doubt” about the referendum result, after the electorate voted by 51.9%to 48.1% to leave the EU.  Cameron called the referendum, but had campaigned for the UK to remain.

“The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected,” he said.
“I fought this campaign in the only way I know how – to say directly and passionately what I think and feel. Head, heart and soul. I held nothing back.”
Cameron said that he will leave it to his successor to trigger the formal process for Britain to leave the European Union.
He pointed to the achievements during his time in office, including the introduction of same-sex marriage and “restoring Britain’s economic strength”.
Cameron told reporters that the new leader should be in place by the Conservative party conference, which is held in early October.
The early favourite to replace Cameron is former London mayor Boris Johnson, who campaigned for the Leave side.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-what-happens-next-2842893-Jun2016/,"
AFTER BRITAIN’S LEAVE vote, the next hours, days and weeks will be crucial for the future of the European Union.
Here are the next steps to be taken ahead of Brexit becoming a reality:
Save the markets
With the stability of the global economy at risk, the European Central Bank is widely expected to make a statement to reassure markets.
Top EU officials meet
The EU’s top officials meet in Brussels at 8.30am today.
EU President Donald Tusk, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, European Parliament head Martin Schulz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose country holds the six-month EU presidency, are expected to make a statement and address the press at around 10am.
Article 50
The 28 EU leaders — still including British Prime Minister David Cameron — will meet on 28 and 29 June in Brussels to digest and debate the results of the Leave vote.
Cameron may trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, officially notifying EU leaders of Britain’s intention to leave. If he does this, Britain has a two-year window to complete negotiations over the terms of exit, although this period could be extended.
The article notesthat any member state “may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements”.
If Britain wishes to re-enter the EU it must do so under Article 49, meaning this scenario is subject to a unanimous vote of member states.

French and German solutions
Foreign ministers from the EU’s six founding countries — France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg — are expected to meet on Saturday in Berlin, according to European sources.
French President Francois Hollande will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next week to discuss “European initiatives”.
The Merkel Hollande meet-up could be the occasion to announce plans for a long-rumoured Franco-German initiative on a better integrated defence and security strategy for Europe.
The leaders are seeking to use the plan to dispel doubts on the EU project unleashed by the British vote campaign.
Brussels acts
On Monday the European Commission’s top officials, who are nominated by the EU’s 28 member states, will begin mapping out the long road to an official Brexit at an extraordinary meeting in Brussels.
MEPs had also called for an extraordinary session of the European Parliament to be held in Brussels on Monday in the case of a Brexit vote.
Enter Slovakia
On 1 July, the Netherlands hands over the EU’s six-month rotating presidency to the relatively inexperienced Slovakia, which now must lead the negotiations towards Brexit.
Britain had been due to take the helm at the end of 2017 but will now give that up.
Legal work
EU civil servants will delay summer holidays to begin the painstaking legal work to bring about Brexit. The official British divorce from Europe would take at least two years.
But EU president Donald Tusk has warned that the whole process of negotiating trade and immigration deals with a non-EU Britain could take seven years in all.

https://www.thejournal.ie/osborne-brexit-speech-2848070-Jun2016/,"BRITISH CHANCELLOR GEORGE Osborne has spoken for the first time since Friday’s Brexit vote result.
Osborne was a leading voice in the Remain camp but has, unlike his Prime Minister David Cameron, been silent since the result.
Speaking at the Treasury in London today, he said that he did not “resile from” the fallout of the result and said his department had put in “robust contingencies” for the result.
“The Bank of England (BoE) is able to lend in foreign currency, if needed. As (BoE governor) Mark Carney made clear on Friday, the bank is ready to make £250 billion available if needed.
“It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead, but we are equipped for what will happen.”
Osborne said that it was right that Britain would delay triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would begin the process of leaving the EU, until after a new Prime Minister has been elected.
“The British economy is fundamentally strong…we remain open for business.
“Only the UK can trigger Article 50. In my judgement we should only do that when there is a clear view about what new arrangements we are seeking with our European neighbours,” Osborne said in his first public comments since the result.
While Osborne delayed the so-called “emergency Brexit budget” which he had said would come within two months of the vote until the autumn, he also addressed his own future, in light of his Prime Minister’s resignation.
Osborne said that he would address his future in the coming days and did not say whether he would serve an anti-EU government.

Meanwhile at home, the Dáil will be recalled to discuss the impact of a Brexit.
Markets
On the markets, the pound dropped again against the dollar, dipping 2% in early exchanges before climbing slightly.
While the currency recovered marginally as Friday wore on – helped by promises of financial market support from major central banks – the pound resumed its losses in early Asian business.
Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA Asia Pacific, warned sterling “is extremely vulnerable” and predicted an interest rate cut in the summer.
Proud and positive
Former London mayor Boris Johnson says that Britain should be “proud and positive”.
Writing in The Telegraph, Johnson said the country must heal.
“We who are part of this narrow majority must do everything we can to reassure the Remainers. We must reach out, we must heal, we must build bridges – because it is clear that some have feelings of dismay, and of loss, and confusion.
“We should be incredibly proud and positive about the UK, and what it can now achieve. And we will achieve those things together, with all four nations united. There is every cause for optimism; a Britain rebooted, reset, renewed and able to engage with the whole world.
“This was a seismic campaign whose lessons must be learnt by politicians at home and abroad.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/gerry-adams-united-ireland-2922882-Aug2016/,"THE ISSUE OF Irish unity has been absent from official Ireland’s centenary celebrations to mark 1916.
Parades and TV specials were seen, books were written, and reams of newspaper articles published. Songs of the period have been sung and debates held. But the fracture of the island by partition, the abandonment of the 1916 Proclamation as a declaration of freedom and justice for all of Ireland, has been ignored.
The Republic envisaged by the leaders of 1916 and by the Proclamation was to be a rejection of all that was bad, divisive and elitist in British imperialism and colonisation. It was to be an Ireland of equal citizens. A republic for all.
Today those of us who desire that outcome are told by some that we are being divisive. We are told that there will be a united Ireland at some undefined time in the future. But it will not happen through wishful thinking or sitting in a bar singing songs – not that there is anything wrong with singing songs of freedom – or simply talking about it.
It needs a political strategy with clear objectives and actions.
Failure to honour commitments
Those who advocate the wishful thinking approach to Irish unity point to the enhanced relationships between London and Dublin. They praise the ‘special’ relationship between the Irish and British governments as evidence of change. And while it is true that much progress has been made, the reality is that the British government has failed to honour key commitments within the Good Friday and other agreements.
It has unilaterally set aside elements of the various agreements, with barely a whimper of protest, especially from the Irish establishment. It has failed to deliver on a range of important issues, including:
The British have also obstructed efforts to resolve the legacy of the past by refusing to honour its commitments under the Haass agreement, failing to provide information on the Dublin/Monaghan and Dundalk bombs, and reneging on its Weston Park commitment to hold an inquiry into the murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane.
Brexit
The real value of the special relationship between the Irish and British governments was demonstrated in the recent Brexit campaign. It is clear the economic interests of the island of Ireland are collateral damage in a fight between factions of the right wing of British politics.
The implications of Brexit are becoming increasingly apparent. It is a real threat to the economy, imposing barriers to trade and a possible EU frontier across Ireland, creating a fundamental crisis in North-South co-operation.
At no time in the Brexit debate was the impact on Ireland, North or South, considered. Our national concerns were dismissed.
The people of the Northvoted againstBrexit. Just as they did in the Good Friday Agreement referendum, all sections of the community, republican and unionist, voted in the best interest of all. They voted to remain in the EU. Yet the British Government say they will impose Brexit on the North against the expressed will of the majority.
The economies north and south are interlinked and interdependent. It has been estimated that 200,000 jobs depend on all-Ireland trade. Arecent reporton economic modelling of Irish unity demonstrated a dividend and growth in a united Ireland.

The aftermath of the Brexit vote is a clear demonstration of the injustice of partition. It is fundamentally undemocratic and economically wrong. Partition makes no sense. Yet it continues.
Unity
A mechanism exists to end partition and bring about Irish unity, througha border poll.
The vast majority of people across Ireland voted for the Good Friday Agreement. It is worth remembering that 94% of people in the south and 74% of people in the North voted for the agreement.
It included a peaceful and democratic pathway to Irish unity that provided for concurrent referendums north and south. It obliged the two governments to legislate on the basis of referendums for Irish unity.
National unity is in the national interest. Wishful thinking will not bring about unity. We have a mechanism to achieve unity. We need all of those in favour of unity to act together to bring it about.
This is the time to plan and to build the maximum support for unity. The leadership of those parties which support Irish unity, acting together, could be the leadership which delivers it.
Eighteen years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we should not need to convince the leaders of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to become persuaders for Irish unity.
The Irish government should have a plan for unity. A first step in the next term of the Oireachtas would be the development of an all-party group to bring forward a green paper for unity.
In addition, we need to develop plans for an all island health service; for public services in a united Ireland, through a united Ireland investment and prosperity plan.
Now is the time
The New Ireland Forum in its time created a space for discussion on constitutional options of change and developed a comprehensive economic options paper on the cost of partition.
It failed because it excluded Sinn Féín and operated at a time of a British veto on change – given voice by Margaret Thatcher with her “out, out, out” rejection. Thatcher is gone and so is the British veto.
Constitutional change is in the hands of the people of Ireland, North and South. The politics of exclusion failed, and Sinn Féin is jointly leading the government in the North.
We have the opportunity to end partition and build support for a new and united Ireland. A new Ireland that is built on equality and which is citizen centred and inclusive. The shape of that new Ireland remains to be drawn.
Now is the time for all parties who support Irish unity to come together to design the pathway to a new and united Ireland.
Gerry Adams is the leader of Sinn Féin.

IRISH EU COMMISSIONER Phil Hogan has slated the “lazy narrative” that the European Union is undergoing an existential crisis.
The EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development isappearingthis afternoon before the Oireachtas joint committee on EU affairs.
“It’s a very interesting time for all of us in the union and, as Commissioner, there’s not a dull moment,” he said.
“Commentators lay all the problems up on top of one another: Terrorism, refugees, the euro, poor economic performance, high unemployment, Brexit, and they look for solutions.
“The prime minister of France, Mr [Manuel] Valls, did it the other day, when he argued for an approach to positions in Europe from citizens that emphasises our European identity, our shared values and our European patriotism, if you like.
Of the naysayers of the European project, Hogan said it was a lopsided attitude.
“It’s also a lazy narrative that does not stand up to scrutiny. Yet it is naive to argue that nothing is wrong with the European Union… the union is working through its problems.”
Hogan before the committee today.
Brexit
Hogan said he wanted to reassure Ireland, and the Irish Government, that the European Commission takes very seriously Ireland’s predicament over Brexit.

Brexit, “a headache for the union but a full-blown crisis for the UK, and with a high risk of collateral damage for Ireland”. He said it concerns Ireland “almost as much as it concerns the UK”.
“I want to leave you with no illusion that the EU is going to be clear-headed” with its UK negotiations.
“Ireland has developed an almost disproportionate trading dependence with the UK, and must increase in this context with the rest of the union.
“What is clear above all is that any deal must, by its nature, be inferior than the deal the UK currently enjoys due to its membership of the European Union.
He added that the Brexit referendum campaign in the UK “was characterised by some half-truths and some outright lies”.
“And we are already seeing features of Brexit becoming evident, even though they were dismissed in the referendum debates and pure scare-mongering.”
Seanad
The former Environment Minister also questioned the Seanad’s rejection of the Ceta trade deal, between the EU and Canada, due to the globalisation of Ireland’s economy and our historic ties to North America.
“I was therefore surprised at [how] the Seanad rejected Ceta recently. Such a rejection was reported widely in the media sources in Europe.
“It’s difficult to see how this trade deal is in the interests of the citizens of Ireland.”
The Joint Oireachtas committee this afternoon.
Committee chairman Michael Healy-Rae applauded the Commissioner “for giving it to us straight”. “We like it straight, and you’ve given it to us straight, and we thank you for that,” he said.
Senator Terry Leyden of Fianna Fáil said Hogan’s comments were “the most comprehensive” response the Oireachtas had yet received over Brexit. Leyden called for an observer role for Ireland during Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU.

The safety pin movement is similar to the ‘I’ll ride with you’ campaign that spread across Australia following a rise in anti-Muslim attacks after the Sydney cafe siege in 2014.
Since the Brexit result in the UK last week, there has been a wave of hate crimes and racist incidents across the country.
Three men were arrested in Manchester yesterday aftervideo footage of a racist attack on a tram went viral.
Video footage showed three young men, who appeared to be drinking beer, screaming at a man on a tram during the early morning commute shouting “go home to Africa!”
Many commuters came to the victim’s defence, telling the men they were “disgusting” and a “disgrace to England”.
In Huntington, Cambridgeshire, signs were posted through the letter boxes of Polish families, stating, “Leave the EU, no more Polish vermin”.
Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police in Hammersmith and Fulham are investigating after offensive graffiti was daubed on the front of a Polish Social and Cultural Association.
Many people have taken to social media to share their stories and express concern over the rise in attacks.","9.13am, 29 Jun 2016",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-trade-northern-ireland-3057462-Nov2016/,"WITH THE PROSPECT of a border between Ireland and the UK, Ireland Thinks was recently commissioned to carry out a survey to find out the views of the ordinary Irish people.
Through the polling company, the Irish Daily Mail asked a nationally representative sample of just over 1,400 people whether they would favour free trade and open borders with either the UK or the EU.
While the results indicated that a majority favoured tying our raft to the hull of the EU, a still significant39%favoured the relationship with Britain and Northern Ireland.
In material terms, before 1973 over half of all our exports went to the UK.
Since then, Irish exports to the EU increased rapidly at an average rate of 10% per year. By the end of 2015, exports to the EU excluding the UK accounted for 44% of all exports while exports to the UK accounted for just 16%.
The value of exporting goods is predicated on our ability to capture some of the benefits of doing so. Pharmaceuticals and organic chemicals are largely driving our European trade and account for roughly half of all exports.
However, because they are among the most productive and tax efficient companies in the world, those gains are not captured to the same degree. For example, while roughly 24,500 people work in the pharmaceutical industry, 163,000 are employed in the agri-food industry.
Essentially our European trade is dependent on our FDI-generated economic model rather than our indigenous firms, which naturally have much closer ties to the UK.
Indeed, the agri-food sector is disproportionately adversely affected by Brexit – primarily due to its dependence on trade with the UK.
A 2016 report by Teagasc estimated that the total loss arising from Brexit in exports in the agri-food industry would be €800 million.
To take just two counties, Dublin is most in favour of a relationship with the EU with65%reporting whereas, in Kerry this falls to a 50/50 split among respondents.
When we look at the farming community, we observe a majority of52%favouring a relationship with the UK.

The relationship is, of course, more complicated as farmers are typically dependent on assistance from the EU in the first place.
It is therefore worth noting that in any involvement we might have in negotiations, the EU will need to recognise the importance of additional assistance for the Irish agricultural sector.
While it is more likely to make both parties poorer, the EU recognises a risk of contagion if Britain leads a successful exit from Europe – ie having full access to the single market and closed immigration.
This is of particular concern given the rise of populist, anti-immigration, and strongly Eurosceptic parties in Austria and the Netherlands, who, incidentally are leading for the first time in the latest polls.
While trade is undoubtedly important, Theresa May’s government has interpreted the Brexit result as a rejection of inward migration from the EU.
Surprising Sinn Féin factor
As the poll shows, there is a significant difference between how people view this choice in the three Ulster counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, compared with the rest of the country with up to 49% favouring the relationship with the UK.
Due to support from Sinn Féin in the region, this creates the somewhat bizarre situation where, for all the talk of irrational politics and emotion-trumping-reason, the party’s supporters are the most likely to prefer a closer alignment with the UK.
However, it would seem unlikely that Brexit negotiations could fully undermine the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.
A form of passport control will almost certainly be required for people travelling between Northern Ireland and Britain, while Ireland would probably exercise a similar relationship with Northern Ireland to that which exists between Germany and Switzerland.
This arrangement, however, increases the prospect of smuggling which may potentially have the adverse effect of adding fuel to the fire. Or in this context: financing sectarian activity in a politically unstable Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/geldof-farage-brexit-2826502-Jun2016/,"DESPITE BEING AN assiduous campaigner on everything from famine in Africa and the refugee crisis to the Scottish independence referendum, Bob Geldof’s contribution to the Brexit debate has been, if anything, a little understated.
Until yesterday, that is.
The Boomtown Rats frontman is perhaps the best-known Irish resident of the UK. He’s not short on opinions either.
Given his reputation, we could have probably expected a show-stealing outburst or performance from the Dun Laoghaire-born singer before now.
Perhaps he was just biding his time. In all likelihood, the showman in him couldn’t resist the opportunity to grab a loudhailer, jump on a boatand shout things across the Thames at Nigel Farage.
Their spat dominated headlines in the UK yesterday…
BBC News/ YouTube
‘You’re no fisherman’s friend’
In case you missed Geldof’s ‘fisherman’s friend’ intervention in the debate – it began when a Brexit fishing flotilla sailed up the Thames as part of a PR stunt to call for a Leave vote.
Around 30 fishing boats floated past London’s Tower Bridge, sounding their foghorns and displaying anti-EU signs – led by Farage, the UKIP leader.
Geldof pulled up in a rival (bigger) boat, shouting “Nigel you’re a fraud” through a loudhailer, only to be hosed with water from a ‘Leave’ boat.
“Here are the facts about fishing,” the singer and businessman yelled.
“One, Britain makes more money than any other country in Europe from fishing. Two, Britain has the second largest quota for fish in Europe after Denmark. Three, Britain has the third largest landings.
“Four, you are no fisherman’s friend.

Farage, as you might expect, branded the “multi-millionaire” as “just disgusting” – going on to claim:

Previous campaigns
Geldofalso made a late interventionin the Scottish independence referendum back in 2014 – pleading with a crowd of thousands at Trafalgar Square not to break up the “family”.
His biggest contribution to the current debate, until yesterday, had been to record a video with the Irish4Europe group – urging Irish people who are entitled to vote to get themselves registered.

Speaking toRyan Tubridy on Radio 1this morning, he explained that recent polls had him worried.
“I think Britain’s going out,” an exasperated Geldof said.
“If you ask me this morning we’re going out. Everyone keeps saying the bookies have got it right – they say it’s 5 to 2 as opposed to 2 to 1.
He continued:

He also painted a stark picture of what would happen in the event of a Leave vote in next Thursday’s ballot.
“I would say they’re going out which means a border between North and South – a police border again, and the consequences of that – the smuggling and everything else.
“I really, really hope that anyone listening to you gets on to their folks in the UK,” he implored – stressing that there are “five and a half million paddies” in Britain, including emigrants and direct descendents.
Charm offensive
Taoiseach Enda Kennyis also beginning a two-day visitto the UK today to campaign for Remain – and Ireland has been sending over a steady conveyor belt of ministers in recent months to meet with community groups and try and mobilise the vote.
We’re now heading into the final week of campaigning.
Given the way the polls are going, we can no doubt expect a few more high-volume contributions from Geldof too.
“We’ll give you a shout the morning after – how about that, and see where we’re at?” Ryan Tubridy asked the singer, on the line from London, as this morning’s interview ended.
Geldof’s response registered somewhere between a guttural moan and a very loud sigh.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-oleary-brexit-2772141-May2016/,"RYANAIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE Michael O’Leary has come out campaigning for Britain to remain in the European Union.
The airline supremo spoke to journalists from a stage inside a hangar at Stansted airport earlier today.
Behind him was a Ryanair plane emblazoned with the words ‘Stronger Safer & Better Off in Europe’.
Politicians from the Conservatives, Labour and the LibDems followed O’Leary on stage with the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne saying that an expected £1 billion investment from Ryanair would be “at risk” if the country left the EU.
O’Leary, who has previously been a harsh critic of the EU’s aviation policies,told Sky News that the UKwould be “absolutely crazy” to leave.

He also took aim at Boris Johnson, the leading figure in the pro-Brexit camp.
“With the greatest respect to Boris Johnson, he’s never run a sweetshop,” O’Leary said.
When it was put to him that Johnson had been a Mayor of London for four years, O’Leary seemed unimpressed:
Ryanair’s bid to take over Aer Lingus was blocked by the European Commission in 2013 over competition concerns and O’Leary has previously described theEuropean Commission as “the evil empire”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-truth-trump-farage-3084296-Nov2016/,"THE TERM REACHED its apogee with Brexit and Donald Trump, and now “post-truth” has been named the word of 2016 by Oxford Dictionaries.
Post-truth connotes claims or circumstances “in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”.
Social media giant Facebook has beenaccused of facilitating the election of Trump as US president-electby failing to remove “fake news” from its online feed.
Manufactured news is seen as an example of the post-truth concept, which Oxford Dictionaries say made its first appearance in a 1992 essay by Serbian-American playwright Steve Tesich.
“It’s not surprising that our choice reflects a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse,” says Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries.
“Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, post-truth as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time.
Advertisement
“Given that usage of the term hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down, I wouldn’t be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time.”
Othercontendersthis year included:
In 1992, reflecting on the Iran-Contra scandal and the Persian Gulf War, Tesich lamented that ‘we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world’.
This was the first time the phrase was used with the new meaning that truth itself has become irrelevant.
Oxford added that the compound word expands the meaning of the prefix post-.
Rather than simply referring to the time after a specified situation or event – as in “post-war” – the dictionaries said it now has a meaning more like “belonging to a time in which the specified concept has become unimportant or irrelevant”.
To qualify for Oxford Dictionaries word of the year, a word need not have been coined in the past 12 months.
Post-truth is now included in OxfordDictionaries.com, and editors will monitor its future usage to decide upon inclusion in future editions of the Oxford English Dictionary.

RIVAL SIDES ARE throwing their efforts into the final day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s vote on Britain’s EU membership.
Prime Minister David Cameron is conducting a spate of last-minute interviews to get his pro-EU message to voters before polls open at 7am tomorrow.
“Nobody knows what is going to happen,” he told the Financial Times. “I believe it will one way or another be decisive. Britain will not want to go through this again.”
The Remain camp has the slimmest possible lead – 51% versus 49% support for the Leave side, according to an average of polls compiled byWhat UK Thinks.
In a final push to win over the undecided voters who could tip the referendum, campaigners will speak at rival Leave and Remain rallies taking place within hours of each other in London.
Representatives from both sides clashed during aBBC debatelast night. A final television debate will be broadcast on Channel 4 tonight, featuring anti-EU UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond for Remain.
The prospect of Britain becoming the first state to defect from the EU in the bloc’s 60-year history has raised fears of a domino-effect collapse of the European project.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker  has urged Britain against leaving the EU. He described it as “an act of self-harm” that would endanger everything Europeans had worked together to achieve.

Two newspapers used their front pages today for last-minute endorsements of opposite sides of the campaign.
“Lies. Greedy elites. Or a great future outside a broken, dying Europe,” the Daily Mail wrote. “If you believe in Britain vote Leave.”
But the Daily Mirror urged readers to back EU membership “for your jobs … for your children … for Britain’s future”.

The campaign has been fought over the two key issues of the economy and immigration, with both sides accusing the other of “scaremongering”.
The Mirror described it as “the most divisive, vile and unpleasant political campaign in living memory”.
Jo Cox
Around the world, events will be held to mark what would have been the 42nd birthday of MP Jo Cox, who was murdered last week on a street in her electoral district in northern England.
Thomas Mair is due to appear in court for a preliminary hearing after the killing. In his first court appearance he gave his name as “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain”.
Cox’s widower Brendan said his wife, a noted pro-EU campaigner who advocated for refugee rights, had been killed because of her political views.
“She worried about the tone of the [referendum] debate … The tone of whipping up fears and whipping up hatred potentially,” he told the BBC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/farmers-budget-3021074-Oct2016/,"THERE WERE A number of measures announced in the Budget this afternoon that will be of big interest to farmers across the country.
Changes in income tax, investment in sheep welfare and an increase in rural development funding will all impact the daily lives of farmers.
Finance Minister Michael Noonan kicked off the mentions of farmer supports as he gave his Budget speech to the Dáil this afternoon.
Farmers and agri-food businesses have been worried about Brexit and the implications it could have on their sector.
The UK is by far the largest export market for Irish agri-food and drink, with over 40% of all exports going there last year.
As a result of this, Noonan said Brexit and any weaknesses in sterling could have a huge effect on farmers.
“This poses a competitive challenge for farmers and agri-food companies that sell a great deal of their output into the UK market,” said Noonan today.
1. “Step out” option for farmers incomeaveraging
First up is the introduction of a “step out” option for farmers who are income averaging for tax.
Income averaging involves a farmer paying income tax on their average income over a period of five years.
Under this new measure, farmers who have had a particularly bad year income wise will be able “step out” of this tax averaging and pay the income tax due on that year alone.
This will reduce the overall amount that they have to pay should they have a bad year.
2. Increase in flat-rate addition for farmers not registered for VAT
The flat-rate addition for farmers not registered for VAT will increase from 5.2% to 5.4%. This scheme compensates unregistered farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.

3. Farm restructuring relief extended
Farm restructuring relief – which was first introduced in Budget 2013 – has been extended until 2019.
4.Introduction of low-cost €150 million loan fund
Noonan announced that a low-cost loan fund was being developed using EU exceptional adjustment aid.
Noonan said this loan would be:
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed announced later that there was a loan fund of €150 million being introduced at an interest rate of 2.95%.
5. Improvements to Farm Assist and Rural Social schemes
Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe announced that there would be 500 new places introduced on the Rural Social Scheme for low income farmers.
He also said there would be there would be “improvements” to the Farm Assist Scheme – saying that Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar would announce further details later today.
6. Increased funding for Rural Development Programme
Spending in the Rural Development Programme will be increased by €107 million to a total of €601 million next year.
Included in this will be a €25 million sheep welfare scheme.
Other areas of investment include:
Comment
Commenting on the Budget allocations, the Minister for Agriculture, Food & Marine, Michael Creed TD, said that his department had been preparing for the Brexit fallout since before vote took place in June.
“Supporting and developing our food businesses is central to what we do as a Department,” he said.
Farmers groups broadly welcomed the measures in today’s Budget.
Irish Farmers Association (IFA) president Joe Healy welcomed the introduction of the low-cost loan fund, saying 2016 had been a very difficult year for farmers.

This change has prompted PM David Cameron to state that politicians would have to “properly face up to the economic consequences of a choice to leave”.
Eurosceptics in the United Kingdom have said that if the country were to leave the union it would be able to maintain its trade relations while taking control of its own laws and borders.
Six of David Cameron’s cabinet members have already declared their intention to support the campaign to leave the bloc with around one third of all Conservative MPs in the House of Commons also supporting the exit.

During the interview host Marr put it to Gove that his comments had been a “horrendous error of judgement”, and that he had been absolutely wrong in making them, to which Gove responded:
Responding today, Sinn Féin MEP and chair of the party’s United Ireland project Matt Carthy described the comments as “warped fantasies of British military glory”.
“Michael Gove’s stated views in relation to Ireland are deeply disturbing for someone who seeks to become British Prime Minister,” Carthy said.

ENDA KENNY HAS held his first meeting with Theresa May since the former UK Home Secretary took over as Prime Minister earlier this month.
The new PM, who campaigned to remain in the European Union in June’s referendum, said during the Conservative leadership contest that “Brexit means Brexit” – going on to appoint three leading ‘Brexiteers’ to key roles in her new Cabinet.
She’s been on a diplomatic tour in recent days as the UK plans its departure from the EU, however.
Last week,she announced alongside Angela Merkel in Berlinthat she wasn’t going to bow to calls to immediately trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would formally kick off the two-year exit process.
And meeting with Northern Ireland’s First and Deputy First Ministers in Belfast yesterday, she insisted that “nobody wants to return to the borders of the past”. There have been concerns from political and business leaders that border controls could be reintroduced in the wake of the Brexit result – potentially harming the peace process.

Kenny, who was the first foreign leader to visit Downing Street since May’s appointment, said it had been a good meeting, and that they had discussed issues like jobs, trade and tourism in addition to reaffirming their commitment to the peace process.
“We also discussed the many issues that arise in the context of the outcome of the recent UK referendum on EU membership,” Kenny said.
“While it is not the outcome that we in Ireland wanted, we fully respect the democratic vote of the people of the United Kingdom.

There would be complex issues to address in the coming negotiations, Kenny said – stressing that he wanted the process to end with “a prosperous and outward-looking UK which retains a close relationship with the EU”.
“Neither I nor the Prime Minister are in any doubt about the complexities of the negotiations that lie ahead of us all, nor do we underestimate the importance of the issues involved for all of our citizens.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-cameron-divorce-from-eu-2850077-Jun2016/,"DAVID CAMERON, WHO pushed EU leaders for a special deal for Britain before losing a referendum on EU membership at home, will today meet European leaders for the first time since last week’s vote.
British Prime Minister Cameron, who announced he would stand down after losing the Brexit vote, has said he will leave it to his successor to begin the process of withdrawing from the EU.
However, spurned EU leaders will press Britain to waste no time triggering its divorce from the bloc at a tense summit this morning, while trying to plot a future course through a crisis that has rocked global markets.
Germany, France and Italy agreed on the eve of the summit in Brussels that there could be no talks on Britain’s relations with the group until after it has formally notified the European Union of its intention to leave by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

The summit will be a chance for the Taoiseach to underline Ireland’s specific interests and concerns.
The talks are expected to prepare the way for exit, addressing issues such as the phasing out of UK budget payments, the completion of existing programmes in which the UK takes part, the status of UK officials in Brussels and other concerns.
Cameron will first sit down with EU President Donald Tusk, before the European Council meets later in the day.
Later, the British prime minister will “explain the situation” to his fellow leaders over a dinner, according to an invitation letter from Tusk.
Britain’s reluctance to start divorce proceedings has led some countries to think there may be space for a solution to keep it in the bloc, with Poland’s ruling party chief suggesting yesterday there should be a second referendum.
But hawks including France are taking a harder line, with Hollande telling Britain it should “not waste time”.
Tomorrow, Cameron will be left out of the room as leaders of the remaining 27 EU states discuss the future of the EU amid fears of a domino effect of referendums in eurosceptic countries.

https://www.thejournal.ie/czech-pm-asks-britain-to-stop-hateful-attacks-on-its-citizens-3004569-Sep2016/,"
THE CZECH PRIME minister has asked his British counterpart Theresa May to take action to stop what his government considers violence against Czechs in the wake of Britain’s decision to quit the European Union (EU), his office said today.
Czech leader Bohuslav Sobotka said Prague was “disturbed by the increase in hateful attacks in Britain aimed at the citizens of EU member states”.
The Czech premier spoke to May by telephone on Thursday after Zdenek Makar, a 31-year-old Czech, was killed in a brawl outside a London pub.
A 29-year-old Briton has been charged with his murder, according to reports.
“The Czech government finds it unacceptable to see Czechs attacked because of their origin and being treated as second-class citizens,” Sobotka told May.
In a statement, a Downing Street spokesperson said May had offered her sincere condolences for the Czech national killed in London last week but stressed that police did not consider racism to have been the motive.
“She said that while we understood this particular incident was not considered to be a hate crime, the UK Government condemned hate crime in the strongest way possible and it had no place in British society.”

The killing of the Czech national follows the murder of a Polish man in August.
Police in Harlow, northeast of London, are investigating the 27 August murder of 40-year-old Polish factory worker Arek Jozwik as a possible hate crime although they have said the motive is still not clear.
Two Polish officers also joined British police in the town after two Poles were also attacked outside a pub there on 4 September.
British police said in July that hate crimes surged before and after the 23 June referendum in which voters chose to exit the EU following a campaign dominated by a divisive debate about immigration.
Although police attributed the increase in part to greater vigilance by officers and greater awareness among the public, more than 3,000 incidents were reported to police across the country from 16-30 June, up 42% on the same period last year, according to the National Police Chiefs’ Council.
The most common offence reported was harassment, including assault, verbal abuse and spitting.
Poland has also urged London to protect its nationals living in Britain, of whom there were about 831,000 in 2015, following the Brexit vote.
Czech authorities put the number of their citizens working in Britain at some 37,000.

THE LEADERS OF Italy, France and Germany have insisted that Britain’s shock decision to leave the European Union (EU) will not kill the bloc.
Speaking aboard an aircraft carrier anchored off the Italian island of Ventotene, the leaders vowed to strengthen the European project following the Brexit vote.
“Many thought the EU was finished after Brexit but that is not how it is,” Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said.
Calling out the continent’s Eurosceptics, he said it was “easy to complain and find scapegoats”.
The EU “is the answer” to Europe’s problems, for it cemented “peace, prosperity and freedom,” he said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalled that the EU had been born from some of the “darkest moments” of European history, a reference to World War II.
Echoing Renzi, she said the time had come to “write a better page” in European history.
French President Francois Hollande warned that Europe faces a risk of “fragmentation and division”.

It needed a “new impulse” on three fronts, Hollande said: the economy; defence and security; and ensuring jobs and education opportunities for young people.
The three leaders were speaking ahead of a working dinner aboard an Italian aircraft carrier, the Giuseppi Garibaldi.
Symbolic location
In a symbolic move, Renzi earlier took his guests to the grave of Altiero Spinelli, a founding father of the ideal of European integration.
Renzi called the meeting in a bid to forge a common position on the EU’s future ahead of a summit of the 27 remaining states in Bratislava on 16 September.
Europe’s economic outlook, jihadist attacks, the refugee and migrant crisis, the Syrian conflict, and relations with Russia and Turkey are also expected to be covered.
The Brexit vote has raised fears of similar referendums in other countries, particularly the Netherlands, which opposes changes to the EU to achieve closer integration.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia vowed after Britain’s vote to draw up their own plans for a less centralised EU.
The Ventotene trip was the start of an intensive tour for Merkel as she attempts to coordinate a response to one of the EU’s biggest crises in decades and quell fears Berlin wants to monopolise the debate.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS said he won’t run to become the new British Prime Minister.
He made the shock announcement just before the noon deadline for Conservative party leader nominations.
Johnson was seen as one of the frontrunners for the position. He was one of the most vocal Leave campaigners in the Brexit referendum.
Speaking during a live press conference at St Ermin’s Hotel in London, he said: “Last week, the people of this country voted to take a new path and a new direction for Britain, in a decision that I passionately support.
“It is vital now to see this moment for what it is … It is a moment for hope and ambition for Britain. A time not to fight against the tide of history, but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune.”https://www.facebook.com/skynews/videos/1385783864769540/
Johnson added that he is not the right person to lead the Tories.
David Cameron announced his resignation after the UK voted to leave the EU last week.
Justice secretary and Leave campaigner Michael Gove announced his intention to run this morning. He had been expected to back Johnson’s bid.
Gove said he was standing because he had come “to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead”.
Earlier this week, a leaked email from Gove’s wife Sarah to her husband warned him about the risks of backing Johnson.

Meanwhile, interior minister Theresa May vowed to unite Britain as she launched her bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative Party leader in a letter toThe Timestoday.

Like Cameron, May supported remaining in the bloc but played a low-key and conciliatory role in the campaign that has seen her tipped as a unifying figure.
She wrote:
She said her leadership would launch a “radical programme of social reform” that would “make Britain a country that works for everyone”.
In a swipe at Johnson, former mayor of London, May wrote that a leader was needed who understood hardship.

“Some need to be told that what the government does isn’t a game, it’s a serious business that has real consequences for people’s lives,” May wrote.
Cameron promoted the 59-year-old vicar’s daughter to Home Secretary following his 2010 election victory and she kept the role after his 2015 re-election.
Known as a hardliner on immigration, May’s stern demeanour has drawn comparisons with 1980s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Boris Johnson
Bookmakers had Johnson as a slight favourite over May and The Sun newspaper reported yesterday that he had already secured the backing of 100 of the 330 Tory MPs who will whittle down the field to two nominees. He was expected to officially announce his bid this morning.
TheConservativeHome blogsurveyed more than 1,300 members and found the slimmest of leads for May, mirroring the results of a YouGov poll published on Tuesday.

Pro-EU finance minister George Osborne, long seen as a possible Cameron successor, has ruled himself out.
Critics had questioned whether the Leave camp — and Johnson in particular — had any idea how to manage the unprecedented situation left by last week’s vote.

“He has still to offer anything like a concrete plan on how he would negotiate the post-Brexit future,” former BBC political editor Nick Robinson wrote.
Cameron’s successor is expected to take office in early September and will face the prospect of assuming negotiations with the EU on Britain’s relationship with the bloc and a decision on whether to call an early election.
First to throw his hat into the ring for Cameron’s job was work and pensions minister Stephen Crabb, a virtual unknown to the British public, whose campaign is expected to stress his working class credentials in a party often seen as elitist.
The 43-year-old urged the Conservatives to “get past this Boris/stop Boris dichotomy”, in reference to the divisive Johnson.

The new Conservative leader, who will be chosen by a postal ballot of party members currently numbering around 150,000, is expected to be announced on 9 September.
He or she will also become prime minister, but may call an early general election.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-corporate-tax-cuts-2-3093829-Nov2016/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has pledged to cut her country’s corporate tax rate to the lowest among major economies.
The move to potentially reduce UK company taxes down to 15% – or even lower – could put a major dent in Ireland’s appeal as the EU’s only English-speaking economy post-Brexit.
May this morning offered business leaders a trade-off, pledging more support while insisting that the benefits of private enterprise must be more evenly spread around the country.
She pledged more investment in research and development, declaring that Britain would commit to investing an extra £2 billion a year (€2.3 billion) by 2020 in the hope of making the country a leader in tech industries.
The goal is to help fuel the economy at a time when Britain is leaving the EU following the referendum in June.
The countryis expected to face a £100 billion budget black holedue to weaker growth and the fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote.
However May also suggested she might slash corporate taxes, matching promises made by Donald Trump to cut rates during his successful campaign to become president of the US.
She said her goal was for Britain to have the lowest corporate tax rates among the G20 a group of 20 major economies including the EU.
The rate now stands at 20% and is expected to fall to 17% by 2020. Trumphas promised a tax rate of 15%.

Irish threat
Significant cuts to both UK and US company taxes are both seen as direct threats to Ireland’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment.

Earlier this month, a key Trump economic advisor said creating a more “level playing field” would help attract US firms tocreate jobs at home, rather than offshore.
However he added that the administration was mainly focused on companies relocating operations to countries like China and Mexico.
Lower UK company taxes also pose a significant risk to Ireland’s ability to lure multinationals with its much-publicised 12.5% corporate tax rate.
Research from think-tank the ESRI, released earlier this year, saidIreland was the most reliant on low taxes to entice firms from outside the EUof any country within the European bloc.
A one percentage point cut in the UK’s tax rate corresponded to a 4% drop in the Republic’s attractiveness for investment from outside Europe, the research found.
May and Taoiseach Enda KennyStefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
A grand bargain
May’s comments today were offered as part of a grand bargain of sorts, in which she promised support and investment in the rocky days ahead as the country prepares to leave the EU.
They acknowledged a nation still suffering from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis – one from which many households have not recovered.
The investment in science is set to be the first step in May’s industrial strategy, which is “not about propping up failing industries or picking winners, but creating the conditions where winners can emerge and grow”.
May also stressed that she will “always believe in business”, even as she insisted that those benefits must be more widely spread around the country.
Her comments followed recent pledges from US tech giants Facebook, which announced it would hire an extra 500 jobs in the UK next year, and Google, which said it would add 3,000 jobs in London.

THE HIGH COURT in London has ruled that parliament, not the government, must approve the start of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, in a landmark decision that could delay Brexit.
Three senior judges ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May did not have the right to use her executive power to trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon treaty, which begins a two-year countdown to leaving the bloc.
“We hold that the Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown’s prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the TEU for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union,” the judgement said.
The government was given leave to appeal and is widely expected to take the ruling to the Supreme Court, but it made no immediate announcement on the subject.
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the government was “disappointed” at the decision on Article 50, adding: “The government is determined to respect the result of the referendum.”

May has said she intends to trigger Article 50 by the end of March, and accused those bringing the court challenge of seeking to frustrate the process.
Most members of the House of Commons campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU in the June referendum, and there is speculation they could push for a softer break with the bloc or even delay it altogether.
“I am grateful to the court for the result, this is a victory for parliamentary democracy,” one of the claimants in the case, Grahame Pigney, told reporters outside court.
“I now hope everyone will respect the court decision so parliament will now make a decision on relation to the service of the Article 50 notice.
“The government has indicated that they wish to appeal to the Supreme court, we would ask them not to do that, but if we do will we take it there and fight this.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-uk-exit-eu-sturgeon-2847109-Jun2016/,"SCOTLAND’S FIRST MINISTER has said that its regional parliament may be able to stop Britain’s exit from the European Union.
In an interview with the BBC, Nicola Sturgeon has argued that Holyrood may still hold veto power over the vote.
Speaking toBBC’s Sunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, Sturgeon said that it was her belief that the Scottish Parliament would have to provide legislative consent for the referendum to be enacted.

“Looking at it from a logical perspective I find it hard to believe that there wouldn’t be that requirement,” she said.
She was then asked by host Gordon Brewer whether this would mean Holyrood voting against the result, even at the risk of infuriating voters in the rest of the UK who voted to leave.
Sturgeon said that this fury would be, “similar to the fury of many people in Scotland right now as we face the prospect of being taken out of the European Union against our will”.
In the immediate aftermath of Thursday’s vote Sturgeon called for a second referendum on Scottish independence.
Scotland voted by 62% to 38% to remain in the EU, joining London and Northern Ireland as the three regions of the UK who voted to remain in.

Both Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU, but the leave campaign was able to convince Wales and England to leave the union.
“We have a situation where the north is going to be dragged out on the tails of a vote in England… Sinn Fein will now press our demand, our long-standing demand, for a border poll,” Sinn Fein’s national chairman Declan Kearney said after the UK as a whole had vote to leave the EU.
Northern Ireland could now be faced with the prospect of customs barriers for trade with the Republic.
Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Secretary can initiate a poll in circumstances where it was clear public opinion had swung towards Irish unity.
The Republic would then vote on the matter.
Sinn Féin’s Ireland South MEP Liadh Ní Ríada said that today’s results showed that.

Two years after Scotland voted in a referendum to remain in the United Kingdom, its political leader First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a new independence vote is “definitely on the table” after Britain voted against the majority will expressed by Scots.
“Scotland sees its future as part of the EU,” Sturgeon told Sky News after the vote.
Speaking this morning, Sturgeon said she would begin the process of creating the legislation needed to run a second Scottish independence referendum.
“There are many people who voted against Scottish independence who are reconsidering their vote this morning.”
She said the legislation would be available to the Scottish parliament whenever it desires.

The MP for Batley and Spen had been hosting an advice clinic at a library in Birstall, Yorkshire when she was grabbed by the hair and attacked by a man.
Cox was taken to Leeds General Infirmary in a critical condition immediately after the attack.
West Yorkshire Police spokeswoman Dee Collins told reporters this afternoon that she was “very sad” to report that Cox has been pronounced dead.

A 52-year-old man has been arrested by armed officers. An eyewitness told theManchester Evening Newsthat the man shouted “Britain First” as he started the attack.
Police chief Dee Collins told reporters, “We are trying to establish what we do know about this gentleman.
She added, “We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.”
An eyewitness said the man walked “calmly” away from the scene “as if he wasn’t panicking”.
A man in his late 40s or early 50s was also “slightly” injured in the incident.

Witnesses
Clarke Rothwell, a cafe owner in Birstall, toldthe BBCthat he was alerted to the incident by a “loud popping noise that sounded like a balloon burst – a loud balloon”.
“When I looked round there’s a man stood there in his 50s with a white baseball cap on and a jacket with a gun, an old-fashioned looking gun in his hand.
“Somebody tried to grab him, wrestling with him and then he wielded a knife, like a hunting knife, just started lunging at her with a knife half a dozen times.”

When he came back out to look, he saw Cox on the ground with blood on her face.

She is a former head of policy for Oxfam and advisor to Gordon Brown’s wife, Sarah.
Cox graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1995, where she first got interested in politics.
She helped to launch the pro-European campaign organisation Britain in Europe, and spent two years with European Parliament member Glenys Kinnock in Brussels.
She then spent a decade working for the aid agency Oxfam in New York, Brussels and war zones as the head of policy and of humanitarian campaigning.
On Twitter she has 10,400 followers and describes herself as: “Mum. Proud Yorkshire Lass. Labour MP for Batley and Spen. Boat dweller. Mountain climber. Former aid worker.”
‘Horrified’
She entered the House of Commons in the May 2015 general election, winning 43.2% of the vote.
Cox co-chairs the newly-formed cross-party parliamentary group on Syria.
She is also part of parliamentary groups working on Palestine, devolution, Pakistan, Kashmir and Yorkshire’s economy.
She was one of 36 of Labour’s 232 MPs who nominated veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn to become party leader last year.
Like the vast majority of Labour MPs, she was campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union in the 23 June referendum.
Both sides in the EU referendum campaign have suspended their campaigning for the day and Taoiseach Enda Kenny’s talk to Irish people in Liverpool has also been cancelled.
Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said the attack had “horrified” him.
“The fact that Ms Cox was attacked in this vicious way in the course of carrying out her duties for her constituents is deeply shocking. At this very anxious time, my thoughts are with Ms Cox, her husband, family and Labour colleagues.”

https://www.the42.ie/tommy-martin-column-sam-allardyce-2890269-Jul2016/,"LET’S BE FAIR to Sam Allardyce: it’s probably not completely accurate to label him ‘the England manager that Brexit made’.
I mean, however much his appointment might seem to chime with the prevailing Little Englander climate, he’s far from the football equivalent of real ale pubs and Spitfire appreciation societies.
For instance, there’s his groundbreaking use of statistical analysis, his ability to man-manage the full gamut of players from Kevin Nolan to Nicolas Anelka and his love of transcendental meditation (admittedly he described the latter in a recent press conference as ‘trans-dental meditation’, making the search for higher consciousness sound like a toothache remedy).
Associated PressAssociated Press
But the notion of Sam Allardyce: England Manager still feels very much of the times in which we now live. Think about it: is there any other point in recent history when this could have been remotely possible?
This may be completely the wrong idea, but at just the right time.
While Allardyce has survived and, to an extent, thrived in the multi-cultural bazaar of the Premier League, he remains quintessentially of English football. But more than just that, he evokes a sense of well-made Britishness that harks back to their glorious industrial past. Strong, proud, solid; Big Sam is an engineering marvel, as if designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, trussed together with steel girders and powered by steam. It’s a wonder that Danny Boyle didn’t order a 40 foot animatronic Allardyce to be wheeled in as part of the London Olympics opening ceremony.
Advertisement
Like the aspirations of the Leave campaign, Allardyce has been carried to victory on the belief that time can be turned back. The blame for England’s miserable Euro 2016 campaign has been placed squarely at the pedicured feet of the molly-coddled academy generation. The current batch of players, it’s claimed, have none of the spunk and manly vigour of previous generations, responsible for 50 years of unbroken success up to 2016′s shame.
Claude ParisClaude Paris
Allardyce’s main rival for the England job, Steve Bruce, explained the philosophy of the movement in a recent interview. “We go to tournaments now and we’re wrapped up in fear. I see the players arrive, tracksuits, washbags, headphones, in their own world.”
England’s John The Baptist figure goes on: “Call me old fashioned, but we’re now holding umbrellas up as our players get off a plane. Do they need that? It’s a few spots of rain. OK, they might get wet. Well, let them get wet. That’s what happens when it rains.”
Yearning for a time before washbags and umbrellas aside, it’s hard to argue with this kind of worldview, just as its hard to disagree with statements like “Let’s Get Out Country Back” and ”Honk If You Love Sovereignty!”. But reversing the course of history to an idealised English past is easier said than done, as Allardyce and Theresa May may both shortly find out.
If it is English virtues that the FA want, then it may as well be Allardyce. Other than Harry Redknapp (sorry Harry, you’re just not the right ‘type’, old bean), he’s the most successful Englishman currently working in the game.
EMPICS Sports Photo AgencyEMPICS Sports Photo Agency
But Sam’s is a certain kind of ‘success’. Not the ‘success’ of actual trophies, unless you count his League of Ireland First Division title with Limerick City in 1992 and his Third Division crown with Notts County in 1998. Sam is more of a shelter in the storm; he’s the lump of driftwood on the ocean that the drowning man clings gratefully to. But the trouble with driftwood is that the man eventually yearns for more salubrious sea-going transport.
If you are football club down on its luck, then Big Sam is a man you want to see. He’ll get you promoted or save you from relegation, and you’ll be so grateful that you won’t mind the kind of football he’s playing or that’s he’s irritatingly smug in press conferences. For a while at least. But then suddenly you’re hanging up banners saying ‘Fat Sam Out’ and everyone’s wondering what the hell is wrong with you.

The question which will decide whether Allardyce is a success in his new job is this: Are England now in the international football equivalent of a relegation battle?
If they are, then Sam could indeed be the man. As Bruce put it, in his anti-washbag polemic: “We’ve got to find our humility again because, frankly — we ain’t that great.”
If England’s players, post-Iceland, have accepted that sobering fact, then Allardyce’s methods may be just what they need. Like the English electorate, they may feel that things have gotten so bad, that they might as well go along with this previously unthinkable idea.
But it’s more likely that, re-galvanised by a return to the comforting bosom of their Premier League employers, England’s best and brightest might think themselves too good to be a Sam Allardyce team, and may prefer to keep the headphones on.
If that’s the case, like Brexit, Big Sam might prove that there’s never a right time to have the wrong idea.

I have negotiated a deal to give the UK special status in the EU. I will be recommending it to Cabinet tomorrow. Press conference shortly.
EUROPEAN LEADERS FINALLY sealed a deal on British Prime Minister David Cameron’s reforms after hours of haggling at a marathon summit, paving the way for a referendum on whether Britain will stay in the EU.
The European Union’s two top figures, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, presented its 28 leaders with draft proposals at a long-delayed dinner after hours of painstaking face-to-face talks on an issue that threatened place in the union.
Shortly afterwards, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite wrote on Twitter:
Agreement#UKinEUdone. Drama over.— Dalia Grybauskaitė (@Grybauskaite_LT)February 19, 2016Dalia Grybauskaitė/ Twitter
Agreement#UKinEUdone. Drama over.
Tusk then tweeted:
Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for#UKinEU— António Costa (@eucopresident)February 19, 2016Donald Tusk/ Twitter
Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for#UKinEU
The deal paves the way for campaigning to start in earnest in Britain ahead of a referendum expected on 23 June – and for Cameron to lead the “In” campaign.
He is now expected to return to London where, after a cabinet meeting on Saturday, the referendum campaign will whirr into life as ministers who want Britain to leave will be allowed to speak out for the first time.
The deal came after France, Belgium and eastern European countries dug in their heels over changes to areas including regulation for non-eurozone countries and benefit payments to EU migrants.
The talks that started on Thursday afternoon have dragged on for more than 30 hours as Cameron sought to cajole fellow leaders into supporting a deal. Earlier in the evening Cameron took to Twitter to say:
Negotiations are continuing into this evening. A Cabinet meeting won't be possible tonight. One will be held if and when a deal is done.— David Cameron (@David_Cameron)February 19, 2016David Cameron/ Twitter
Negotiations are continuing into this evening. A Cabinet meeting won't be possible tonight. One will be held if and when a deal is done.
Cameron must now sell his hard-earned reform package to eurosceptics in his party and to the British public, which opinion polls suggest is finely balanced on whether to back a Brexit.
A ‘credible’ deal?
Cameron was pushing for an agreement to limit the number of EU migrants coming to Britain and reassure voters that the key EU principle of ever-closer union did not apply to them.

However, eastern European countries were concerned that his plans were discriminatory and violated the EU principle of freedom of movement.
Brussels offered an “emergency brake” which Britain could invoke for a limited period if its welfare system is overwhelmed by the inflow of workers, as it believes it has been.
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat indicated that most countries looked set to accept a seven-year period for the emergency brake but British officials had said they wanted to see detail on this.
Cameron had said that without a satisfactory agreement, he would campaign for Britain to stay in the EU in a referendum and was prepared to walk away from the summit.
Francois WalschaertsFrancois Walschaerts
Under pressure from eurosceptics in his Conservative Party and an anti-EU popular press, Cameron has been pushing since his re-election last May for sweeping changes to the EU which he hopes will stop Britain from becoming the first nation to leave the bloc.
On day one of the meeting Thursday, Cameron urged his fellow EU leaders to reach a “credible” reform deal.
He added that the issue “has been allowed to fester for too long” and there was now a chance “to settle this issue for a generation”.
Headaches at home
With the EU negotiation out of the way, domestic politics are set to cause him fresh headaches as key allies including London Mayor Boris Johnson make up their minds whether to support Cameron in urging Britons to stay or join the leave side.
PA WIREPA WIRE
One of his closest allies, Michael Gove, has already reportedly made up his mind to campaign for Brexit.
On Monday, Cameron’s government is expected to table measures in the Houses of Parliament to set the date of the poll.
This will be Britain’s second referendum on European membership in just over 30 years — in June 1975, voters backed membership of the then European Economic Community (EEC) by just over 67%.
However, that failed to prevent years of divisive quarrelling about Britain’s role in membership in the Conservative party, now led by Cameron.
It was this, fuelled by a surge in support for the anti-EU UK Independence Party led by Nigel Farage, which first prompted him in 2013 to promise a referendum.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-british-papers-support-sunday-2833085-Jun2016/,"WITH THE UK steamrolling towards Thursday’s vote on whether or not to remain in the EU, the country’s newspapers have been declaring their sides.
Britain’s right- and left-wing publications are taking a variety of positions, citing the pros and cons of staying in or leaving the union.
Rupert Murdoch-owned the Sun on Sunday, Britain’s most read Sunday, declared its support for a Brexit earlier this week in its daily edition.

Its editorial states a vote to leave would allow the country to free itself from “dictatorial Brussels”, describing the EU as ”increasingly greedy, wasteful, bullying and breathtakingly incompetent in a crisis”.
The Mail on Sunday, which boasts Britain’s second largest Sunday circulation, has taken the unexpected move of urging its readers to vote to remain – a contrary stance to its sister paper the Daily Mail.

The Times in the UK and its Sunday edition have also taken contradictory positions.
In an editorial today, the Sunday edition of the paper has cited the possibility of a future EU army without a British veto as an issue.

On Friday the Times, one of the country’s most-read non-tabloids, came out in support of the remain campaign saying that it would be “the best outcome of next week’s referendum” and that it would be “a new alliance of sovereign EU nations dedicated to free trade and reform, led by Britain”.
Also on the right, the Sunday Telegraph has backed a vote to leave, saying that the campaign had “articulated an ambitious vision for Britain as an independent nation, once again free to make its own decisions”.
On the other side of the political spectrum, the Observer has today published an editorial backing the UK remaining in the EU.
In it they state that making the decision is important for “an international, liberal and open Britain” and call the EU an “idealistic undertaking, born out of a desire to never again see the continent racked by war”.

The former Tory leader, who stepped down as Prime Minister in July after Britain voted to leave the European Union, has held his seat in Witney in Oxfordshire since 2001.
He told his successor Theresa May of his decision to stand down this afternoon, and is said to have decided he is unable to be a full constituency MP due to his past as leader of Her Majesty’s Government.

In an interviewwith ITV, Cameron said:
Cameron said that Theresa May was “very understanding” of his decision, which will trigger a by-election.
“Obviously I’m going to have to start to build a life outside Westminster,” he said as he announced his decision in Witney. “I hope I will continue to contribute in terms of public service.”
Cameron said he’d remain as an MP just two months ago, and his sudden change of heart has prompted speculation from political correspondents in London that it may be down to differences with Theresa May.

That was pretty much David Cameron’s brief as he continued an EU-wide charm offensive ahead of a summer ‘Brexit’ vote.
That was the idea, but it’s fair to say that his continental excursion hasn’t quite gone to plan.
The only question now is whether it will make any difference when the UK votes on whether it should stay or go.
It’s not the easiest time to be asking the EU for things. The bloc is still reeling from the economic crash and now also has the biggest migration crisis since World War II to cope with.
Two issues which, not coincidentally, are exactly why so many Britons are so keen to leave in the first place.
BBC News/ YouTube
EU president Donald Tusk unveiled the proposals yesterday, here’s the jist of what’s contained in them.
Most of the points are watered down versions of what the Prime Minister wanted.
On migrants and benefits
Sovereign control and the economy
Cameron has accepted that the proposals themselves with not stop the level of legal migration into the UK from Europe.
He said that the plans showed “real progress” and made it likely that he would campaign to stay in the European Union when the referendum comes around.

Cameron had said that he would not support the UK staying in Europe if he didn’t get a deal he was satisfied with.
The position of his cabinet colleagues will also come under increased focus as the referendum nears. Some are known eurosceptics but may be unwilling to resign their posts to campaign for a British exit.

Bad press
The Prime Minister was today savaged on the front pages of the UK’s national press.
The Daily Mail branded the deal ‘The Great Delusion!’ while The Sun pictured Cameron in a Dad’s Army pose with the headline ‘Who do you think you are kidding Mr Cameron?’

Cameron has not given a definite date for the referendum yet but, asked about the rumoured date of 23 June,said that the date would not be too soon after regional elections planned for 5 May.
The first ministers of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have requested that the referendum not to be held in June because of these votes.

A NEW OPINION poll published today showed more Britons want to leave the European Union than want to stay ahead of a referendum to be held by 2017.
The poll is the first to put the EU exit camp in the lead.
Forty-three percent of respondents said they would vote to leave, 40 percent would vote to stay and 17% are still undecided, according to the poll by Survation research agency for the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
The survey, which was conducted online on September 3 and 4 and had 1,004 respondents, had a margin of error of two percentage points.

Survation’s last poll published at the beginning of July showed 45 percent in favour of staying, 37 percent for leaving and 18 percent undecided.
Sunday’s poll also showed that 22 percent of those who wanted Britain to stay said they could change their mind if the migrants crisis worsened.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents also told the pollsters that Britain should not accept any more Syrian refugees — the highest response to a question on how many refugees Britain should take in.
British lawmakers in the House of Commons are expected on Monday to debate and vote on a draft bill to allow the referendum, which will then pass to the House of Lords for final approval.

THE POUND HIT a three-year low against the euro today after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain will trigger Brexit negotiations by the end of March and her finance minister warned of “turbulence”.
Sterling weakened to 87.46 pence against the euro, the lowest level since August 2013, after May’s government gave more details about how Britain will leave the European Union at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, central England.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said people should expect “some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process”, adding that consumer and business confidence could go up and down like a “rollercoaster”.
His comments came the day after May revealed Britain would start the two-year exit process by the end of March, putting it on track to leave by early 2019 and opening the door for painful negotiations with EU partners.
The new premier, who took power in July after David Cameron quit following the Brexit vote, also indicated willingness to leave the single market in order to secure control over immigration from the EU.
At the start of the week’s trading in London, sterling also fell to $1.2853 against the dollar, a fall of around 0.5 percent since closing on Friday.
“Whilst markets welcome the update (from May), there is still a great degree of uncertainty surrounding what Brexit negotiations will involve,” said Ana Thaker, a market economist at PhillipCapital UK.
“It is generally considered that the more May insists on immigration control, the more the EU is likely to close access to the single market,” an analysis by Rabobank Financial Markets Research added.
“The drop in the value of the pound this morning reflects investors’ concerns.”

Speaking this afternoon on RTÉ’s News at One, chief executive of the Irish Exporters’ Association Simon McKeever said that Irish businesses were between “a rock and hard place” when it came to the Brexit negotiations.
“I don’t see anywhere where the UK can go with this,” said McKeever.
“[The UK] are heading towards a very hard Brexit which is very bad for Irish exporters.
McKeever said it was “absolutely crucial” that Irish businesses started to perform risk assessments and future planning to offset the potential damage Brexit could cause them.
Strongeconomy
Britain’s economy has performed more strongly than some analysts expected in the aftermath of June’s surprise Brexit vote.
In a key indicator of the strength of the manufacturing sector, the Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) rose to its highest level since mid-2014, according to figures out yesterday.
Sterling stabilised on the news, which showed manufacturing had benefited from the lower pound.
However, there is uncertainty among many major employers about long-term investment decisions due to Brexit.
Last week, carmaker Nissan’s chief executive Carlos Ghosn said it was delaying new investment at its giant plant in Sunderland, northeast England, announcing: “We cannot stay if the conditions do not justify that we stay.”
Hammond acknowledged yesterday that there could be difficult times ahead as Britain negotiates its exit from the EU.
“We have to expect a period when confidence will go up and down — perhaps on a bit of a rollercoaster — until we get to a final agreement,” he told the BBC.

IN THE AFTERMATH of Brexit, attention has turned to our own future relationship with the EU, and there have been calls for Ireland to emulate the UK and leave the Union.
OnMonday’s Claire Byrne Live, Education Minister Richard Bruton vigorously rejected this argument, emphasising what he presented as the benefits of our continued membership.
He even claimed that “about 700,000 jobs” depend on Ireland’s “open access” to the EU.
Is that true? We’ve crunched the numbers and analysed the facts.
(Send your FactCheck requests tofactcheck@thejournal.ie, tweet@TJ_FactCheck, or send us a DM).
Claim:700,000 jobs in Ireland depend on our membership of and access to the EU
Verdict: UNPROVEN, but very likely to be a significant exaggeration.
What was said:
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
You can watch the relevant excerpt from Bruton’s comments in the video above, or watch the full episodehere. Our focus in this fact check is on this claim:
In response to our request for evidence, a spokesperson for Bruton told FactCheck that the number was in fact713,045 jobs, made up of:
The sources of these figures are the 2015 annual reports ofEnterprise Irelandand theIDA. In addition, the spokesperson provided figures forindirectemployment:
Those figures were reached by applying “multipliers” estimated by the Department of Jobs. (More on that later).
Along with the data, the Minister’s spokesperson provided this explanation:
There are several significant problems with these figures, and this rationale. Let’s unpack it, piece by piece, as clearly and briefly as we can.
The first Irish contingent at an EEC meeting in Brussels, after we joined the union in 1973: Sean Kennan, Brian Lenihan, and Hugh McCann.AP / Press Association ImagesAP / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
First, a bit of reasoning that undermines the logical premise of the Minister’s contention, as explained by his spokesperson.
A claim that says “700,000 jobs are dependent on” access to the single market and EU trade deals is a claim that is essentially saying that without these factors, those 700,000 jobs would not exist, or would be lost.
This is the definition of dependence. FactCheck asked for clarification as to whether Bruton intended some other meaning, and his spokesperson replied “the Minister’s comments are clear”.
But the claim fails to take into account a number of important factors:
We can’t say with certainty how many jobs might be lost (or for how long) in the event of Ireland leaving the EU, or if Ireland had never joined, but we can say it is extremely unlikely to be all 713,045 purportedly associated with Enterprise Ireland and IDA companies.
Access to the single market and collective trade agreements no doubtfacilitatedthe creation of many of the jobs in question, but this does not mean the existence of all those jobs isdependenton them, or many of them could not have been createdwithoutaccess to the single market and collective trade agreements.
IDA Ireland Annual Report 2015IDA Ireland Annual Report 2015
Let’s take a closer look at those employment numbers. The 713,045 jobs cited by Bruton’s spokesperson essentially come in two parts: direct and indirect.
We’ll take a look at the direct jobs first.
IDA
Of the 187,056 jobs at IDA-supported companies in 2015 (pg 10):
That’s81.4%of IDA-backed jobs that are at companies originatingoutside the EU, in a post-Brexit scenario.
Even if the UK retains access to the European single market, that will be 77.6% of jobs at companies originating outside it.
Of course, the argument could be made that Ireland’s membership of the EU facilitates foreign direct investment by employers based outside the EU (particularly from the US), especially those who have set up European headquarters here.
But the argument could also be made that Ireland’s comparatively very low corporate tax rate, and other factors, also facilitate this FDI, and the creation and retention of these jobs.
Again, the combination of these factors has no doubt facilitated this employment, but it is extremely unlikely that all 713,045 jobs aredependenton two of them, namely access to the single market and EU trade deals.

FactCheck’s analysis of data provided by Enterprise Ireland (spreadsheet download) shows that, of the €19.76 billion in exports by Irish, Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2015:
Whatever shape the UK’s exit from the EU takes, that’s a significant chunk of Irish exports set to go outside the European single market.
If the UK leaves the single market as well as the EU, the majority of exports by Irish, Enterprise Ireland-supported companies are set to go outside the single market, based on the pattern in 2015.
Again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that access to the single market and EU trade deals isn’t very helpful in facilitating Irish exports, or that Irish companies wouldn’t face significant trade barriers in their absence.
But it does mean, again, that it’s implausible that all 192,223 jobs at Enterprise Ireland-supported Irish companies would be lost.
Or that the number that would be lost, would not be at least partially recovered in due course.

The second set of jobs cited by Richard Bruton’s spokesperson are theindirectones, which – so the rationale goes – were stimulated by the creation of the direct employment at Enterprise Ireland and IDA companies.
This happens through increased demands on a supply chain (subcontracters, materials providers, etc…) and increased spending and consumption throughout the economy by those new employees.
As was mentioned above, Bruton’s spokesperson calculated these by taking direct employment (379,279) and applying a jobs “multiplier” of 0.88, yielding 333,766 indirect jobs.
This is a formula derived by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the Enterprise 2025 report, which estimates that for every 100 jobs created at an Enterprise Ireland or IDA company, 88 jobs will be stimulated indirectly, elsewhere in the economy.
In fact, this is based on two separate multipliers: 0.84 for IDA companies and 0.97 for Enterprise Ireland companies.
If we apply those multipliers separately (which we should) we get343,583, a slightly higher figure for indirect employment than the one presented by the Minister’s spokesperson.
This in turn would yield an overall estimate of722,862jobs, as opposed to 713,045.
But there are further problems with these multiplier estimates.
Overestimation
Firstly, the multipliers are calculated using (in part) estimates of the additional salaries introduced by employment at IDA or Enterprise Ireland companies.
However, the calculations include an assumption thatall those new incomes will be spent.Which we know is also simply implausible.
Indeed, this is something that Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor warned about in response to a recent parliamentary question,statingthat as a result of this assumption, these multiplier estimates “should be interpreted with caution”.
So the numbers themselves are very likely to overstate the actual “ripple effect” of added employment at IDA and Enterprise Ireland companies.
Dependence (again)
Secondly, there is (once again) an assumption here that because direct Enterprise Ireland and IDA employmentfacilitatedthis additional, indirect employment, none of this additional, indirect employment would otherwise have come about.
Again, it’s likely that at least some of this indirect employment would otherwise have been stimulated by employment at non-IDA, non-Enterprise Ireland companies.
So the notion that all 343,583 of these jobs should be included in the total of 722,862 jobs that, according to Richard Bruton,dependon EU access, constitutes a further layer of implausibility.
Claire Byrne LiveClaire Byrne Live
There is clearly an element of truth to this claim. No doubt some of the “about 700,000 jobs” referred to by Bruton would be lost without access to the European single market and EU trade deals.
But a very significant chunk of Irish exports, and FDI, goes to and comes from outside the EU, especially in the event of a “hard Brexit”.
So a sizeable portion of these jobs would most likely either stay, or be replaced in due course.
Furthermore, employers and companies would have no choice – in the event of Ireland leaving the EU – but to quickly find alternative export markets and sources of FDI.
However, Bruton’s claim fundamentally revolves around an unspoken prediction (if Ireland were to relinquish access to the EU, these 700,000 jobs would be lost) and counterfactual (if Ireland had not had access to the EU, these 700,000 jobs would not have been created).
So ultimately, we are obliged to offer a verdict ofUNPROVEN, but the claim ishighly likely to significantly overstate the number of jobsthat would not have been created, or would be lost, without open access to the EU.

AUSTRIA’S NORBERT HOFER has just gained another shot at being elected the European Union’s first far-right president, after a court dramatically annulled May’s closely fought election result because of irregularities.
The Constitutional Court ruled that the run-off on 22 May, which saw independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen beat Hofer of the Freedom Party (FPOe) by just 30,863 votes, must be held again.
“The challenge brought by Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache against the 22 May election… has been upheld,” court president Gerhart Holzinger said in an announcement live on national television.
Gun enthusiast Hofer, 45, came top in a first round in April but then lost in a runoff with the 72-year-old Van der Bellen, sparking relief among Europe’s centrist parties.
Preliminary results had given Hofer a narrow lead but after some 700,000 postal votes were counted, the Greens-backed Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the largely ceremonial post the next day.
The FPOe, which is topping opinion polls ahead of the next scheduled general election in 2018 tapping rising unease about immigration, launched a legal challenge on June 8 claiming massive irregularities.
These included allegations that tens of thousands of votes were opened earlier than allowed under election rules and that some votes were counted by people not authorised to do so.
As the court heard from dozens of witnesses, Van der Bellen’s lawyer had described the transgressions as having an “insignificant” impact on the election result, but in vain.
Friday’s ruling stops in its tracks Van der Bellen’s planned inauguration on July 8. It is unclear when a new election will be held.
In the meantime, current President Heinz Fischer will still step down as planned and will be replaced on an interim basis by three parliamentary officials – one of whom is Hofer.

Brexit to play a role?

The decision sets in motion what is likely to be a hard-fought and nail-biting new summer election battle between van der Bellen and Hofer.
It remains to be seen whether the FPOe’s success in getting the election held again will translate into getting Hofer into the Habsburg dynasty’s former imperial palace, the Hofburg.
It is possible that Britain’s referendum decision on June 23 to become the first member of the European Union to leave the bloc could also turn Austria’s future membership into a key election issue.
Hofer, echoing French National Front leader Marine Le Pen, said after the Brexit bombshell that he would be in favour of holding a referendum in Austria if EU fails to implement necessary reforms “within a year”.
“If (the EU) evolves in the wrong direction, then in my opinion the time has come to ask the Austrians if they still want to be part of it,” Hofer told the Oesterreich tabloid on June 26.
Chancellor Christian Kern of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPOe), who in mid-May replaced Werner Faymann after he quit after his presidential candidate was knocked out in the first round, has ruled out such a vote.
“It makes no sense… This is a time to learn lessons and dispel people’s doubts and fears,” he said just after the Brexit result.
Van der Bellen, a calm but sharp-tongued slightly dishevelled economics professor known as “Sascha” for his Russian roots and who used to be leader of the Greens, is staunchly pro-EU.
As Austrian president, he has said he dreams of a border-free “United States of Europe” that defends the rights of minority groups.

CAMPAIGNING IN THE UK’s Brexit referendum officially begins today, 10 weeks ahead of a vote that will hand Britons their first chance to have their say on Europe since 1975.
With opinion polls suggesting the British public are deeply divided on whether to stay in the EU, the Leave campaign’s biggest name – charismatic London mayor Boris Johnson – will lead its “Brexit blitz” with rallies today and tomorrow in three northern cities.
Johnson, who is seeking to persuade the British people that they could thrive if cut free from EU red tape, has compared leaving the bloc to escaping from prison, saying the referendum was “like the jailor has accidentally left the door of the jail open and people can see the sunlit lands beyond”.

In the “Remain” corner is Prime Minister David Cameron, who says Britain has a “special status” within the EU thanks to a renegotiation he sealed in February, and that the country will be richer and stronger if it stays in.
He is confident of winning the 23 June poll, despite deep divisions within his Conservative party on Europe and recent difficulties over a controversial budget, threats to Britain’s steel industry and the so-called Panama Papers leak.
His “Britain Stronger In Europe” campaign has drawn support from the country’s main political parties and some of its biggest employers.
International bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have also warned that a Brexit could damage Britain.

Debate about whether Britain should stay in the EU has been raging for weeks, but the race shifted up a gear this week when the two official campaigns were crowned by election officials.
This unlocked a treasure chest of publicly-funded benefits for both sides to ramp up their campaigns, as well as removing the ambiguity about who will be the major faces seeking to persuade Britons either way.
Close battle
The “Remain” and “Leave” camps are level on 50% support, according to a poll of polls run by academics at the What UK Thinks project.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour, only made his first big pro-EU speech yesterday and previously opposed EU membership but could play a key role in engaging voters, particularly the young.

Voters are also increasingly distrustful of what Cameron tells them about the referendum, YouGov polling for The Times suggested this week, as the government started sending millions of pro-EU leaflets to British homes.
It found that only 21% of people trusted his statements and claims on the issue, down eight percentage points in two months.
Turnout is likely to be key in determining the outcome, experts believe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-theresa-may-2952047-Aug2016/,"
PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY wants to trigger Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union without a vote in parliament, according to UK reports.
A source in her Downing Street office said the Daily Telegraph report was speculation but added that May was “committed to delivering on the verdict the public gave” in the June referendum, when 52% voted for Britain to leave the EU.
May’s government already faces a legal challenge to prevent it beginning the process of leaving the EU without an act of parliament.
Lawyers from the Mishcon de Reya law firm are poised to challenge the government in the English High Court, arguing that May cannot trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty — the legal process for leaving the bloc — without a parliamentary debate and vote authorising her to do so.
Most members of parliament’s lower House of Commons, including May, campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU. More than three-quarters of the cabinet also campaigned for the Remain side.
Once Article 50 is triggered, it would start a two-year countdown to Britain’s exit from the European Union.

May has said it will not be triggered this year, the government needing time to shape Britain’s exit objectives first.
Meanwhile Gus O’Donnell, the former head of the civil service, said Brexit was not inevitable and Britain could still remain a part of a changed EU.
“It very much depends what happens to public opinion and whether the EU changes” before Britain is ready to leave, he told The Times newspaper.
He told BBC radio that elections in France and Germany next year meant “it is not even clear which leaders our prime minister will be negotiating with, so I don’t think there’s any great rush to do it”.
Bookmakers believe there is a one in eight chance of a second Brexit referendum before the end of 2020.
The prime minister is due to host minsters at her country residence this week, demanding “action plans” from each department about how they can make the most of Brexit, according to the Sunday Times andSunday Telegraph.
Ministers will “discuss the next steps in the negotiations,” a government source told the Telegraph, before the prime minister heads to China for a meeting of G20 world leaders.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-anti-immigrant-racism-education-2855964-Jul2016/,"YESTERDAY, I JOINED the team of Show Racism the Red Card UK in a visit to a secondary school in County Durham. In theiranti-racism workshops, they ask a question. What percentage of the population in the UK are immigrants?
The average answer from the group was 54% and the actual answer is 13%. Such a difference in opinion and facts surely raises questions as to how people have formed their views.
Racist attacks
Views of immigrants have hardened in recent years and the referendum on the EU has unleashed a wave of racist attacks across the UK. There have been protests outside Mosques and police are investigating who put up signs posted in Cambridge saying ‘Polish vermin not welcome here’.
Other incidents reported on Twitter include Polish kids coming home from school on Friday crying and groups ganging up on and taunting children from migrant backgrounds.
If there is any doubt as to the level of influence of racism on this referendum, the outcome ofone of Lord Ashcroft’s pollssurely clarifies matters. He found that 75-80% of leavers felt that multiculturalism, immigration and liberalism were ‘a force for ill’.
Former Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi described the atmosphere on the streets as ‘not good’. There has even been a hashtag on Twitter to profile post referendum racism – #PostRefRacism.
Anti-immigrant sentiment
Brexit was driven by anti-immigrant sentiment and fuelled by racism. The vote has been cheered on by Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders and others of the far right across Europe.
Advertisement
Aided by relentless media coverage, people began to blame all of their problems on immigrants. Newspapers such as the Daily Mail, Express and the Sun have been the chief culprits. Day after day for almost twenty years they have had horror and scare stories about migrants and refugees.
David Cameron must now recognise that his decision to call this referendum was a mistake and one that could have catastrophic consequences. As it is, he has lost his job and Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to keep his. But what is most concerning is that there appears to be free reign for race hatred.
Unfortunately attention is not focused on the streets or in the schools and certainly not on the children subject to racist abuse. The absence of a plan by Brexiteers has opened up a vacuum which is becoming toxic. Without a clear plan as to what happens next, people are acting out with hatred.
Ireland’s future?
We would be foolish to underestimate the possibility that racism will take hold in Ireland. Racism has grown in the UK because it has not been challenged, at least not in the course of this referendum.
Much of the focus of Ireland’s response to the referendum has been on business relations and the consequences for the economy. However, Ireland is not all that different when it comes to the impact of racism, as the evidence shows.Research by Trinity CollegeChildren’s Research Centre found that racism affects children as young as seven.The Teachers Union of Ireland foundthat 46% of teachers had witnessed racist incidents in the classroom in the month previous to their conference.
With increasing reports of racism, many people will want to know what can be done in response.
There are genuine fears that people have in regards immigration. It is important to address those fears and not feed them.
At the same time, it is vital that in Ireland we are attuned to the challenges of racism and recognise the need to respond. We cannot afford to be complacent and think this is not a challenge for us. This requires investment in anti racism education but also investment in communities to develop cohesion.
Through these measures, we can build a better society.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/irish-in-britain-courted-brexit-2804866-Jun2016/,"“YOU CAN’T REALLY speak of an ‘Irish vote’ in Britain: and that shows our success in assimilating”.
These were the words of Ireland’s Ambassador in London, Dan Mulhall, speaking a recent event in which he urged Irish citizens in Britain to register to vote in the coming referendum on European Union membership.
True, you can’t speak of an ‘Irish vote’ in Britain in the same way people talk about the ‘Black vote’ or the ‘Hispanic vote’ in the US Presidential race. And in Britain there are certainly more sizeable ‘ethnic group’ block votes to be had.
But with the latest polls showing a very narrow lead for Brexit, the ‘Irish vote’ in Britain could prove more important than anyone previously realised as the rival campaigns pick up pace before voting opens on 23 June.
The latest two polls,conducted by The Guardian/ICM, indicate that British public opinion has shifted towards the UK leaving the EU, with voters split 52% to 48% in favour of leaving.
It would be not only bad maths but highly presumptive to start calculating just how many Irish citizens resident in Britain would be required to tip the scales back towards a Remain result.
But let’s have a go anyway:
The 2011 census showed that 407,357 residents of England and Wales and 23,000 residents of Scotland were born in the Republic.
Add to that the estimate that 10% of the UK population has at least one Irish grandparent (good news for Republic of Ireland soccer manager Martin O’Neill).
Now add to this the very substantial number of Scottish residents who would identify as Irish rather than British (again, good news for Martin O’Neill).
You may also add in, if you like, the 300,000 or so British residents born in Northern Ireland and, for good measure, the expanding pool of British-born people driven by anxiety over the consequences of Brexit to recently apply for an Irish passport.
Advertisement
What you have, then – in fact – is a potentially pivotal ‘Irish vote’.
The Irish government realises this. What’s more, they are terrified about Brexit for three main reasons:
And so, as historian Diarmaid Ferriter has recently observed, the Irish in Britain are currently being subjected to a relentless campaign of ‘love-bombing’ which will extend over the next two weeks. Ministers are being parachuted in to British cities with substantial Irish populations to press the case for Remain. And, like commanders in a theatre of war, they are sending back despatches from the Front. You can follow these via Twitter.
At the time of writingCharlie Flanagan, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is soldiering manfully through a business breakfast in Manchester while Ambassador Mulhall is clocking up some serious Virgin Traveller loyalty points on the Liverpool-London train.

Amidst all this, even Bertie Ahern has surfaced, the former Taoiseach giving Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers a ticking off. The sight of Bertie, enough to raise ire at the best of times, has prompted some hostile Brexiteers to ask what exactly the Irish government is up to here. Ireland isn’t trying to sway the British electorate, Ambassador Mulhall insists, but in the role of “friendly neighbours” are expressing “very real concerns” about the consequence of a vote to leave.
But who are to be the front-line troops conveying these “very real concerns” with pencils in the polling booths? Why, the mass of the Irish in Britain, of course, who are expected – for the good of Ireland – to Do The Right Thing and vote for Britain to remain in the EU.
So what will the Irish in Britain get in return?
In return, the Irish government has promised to do absolutely nothing to address the lack of voting rights for Irish passport holders resident in the UK. Anyone who witnessed the huge temporary exodus of Irish citizens in British ports and airports around the time of the 2015 Marriage Equality referendum will realise how seriously many take their right to vote.
And yet the government continues to point to its pride in the Irish diaspora while denying them voting rights. It has not even acted on last year’s report urging that Irish citizens abroad be given the right to vote in Seanad elections. All of which smacks of hypocrisy of the worst kind.
Between 1951 and 2001 the Irish were the largest foreign-born group in Britain and being Irish in Britain wasn’t always easy. The recent news that fresh inquests are to be opened into the IRA’s Birmingham pub bombings of 1974 will have come as welcome news for many, but it is also likely to have reawakened uncomfortable memories for some of the Irish in Britain, who found themselves the victims of consequent anti-Irish violence and abuse in the street and in the workplace.
But you’re not supposed to bring up the Bad Old Days while the ‘love-bombing’ is in progress. Superficially, at least, all the children of the nation are being cherished equally. But only as long as the Brexit referendum debate rumbles on.

Courtroom sketch of Thomas MairElizabeth CookElizabeth Cook
FAR-RIGHT EXTREMIST Thomas Mair has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release for murdering British MP Jo Cox.
Sentencing Thomas Mair, 53, to a rare “whole life term” punishment, judge Alan Wilkie told him: “Because she was a member of parliament your crime has an additional dimension that calls for particular punishment.
The jury at London’s central criminal court took just 90 minutes to convict Mair of killing the mother-of-two as she arrived at a library to meet constituents a week for the Brexit vote.
Cox, a 41-year-old member of the opposition Labour party and a vocal supporter of the EU, had been due to meet her constituents in Birstall, northern England, when she was attacked in broad daylight on 16 June.
Mair showed no emotion as the verdicts and sentence were read out.
Inhis sentencing statement, the judge said that Mair would die in jail and would only be released to die in his home at the discretion of a Secretary of State.

Following the verdict, Cox’s husband Brendan called the murder “a political act and an act of terrorism”.
“We have no interest in the perpetrator, we only feel pity for him,” he added.

Far right extremist Mair repeatedly shouted “Britain first” as he shot Cox three times and stabbed her 15 times in a murder that shocked the country, the trial heard.
Mair was also found guilty of possession of an offensive weapon with intent, possession of a firearm with intent, and grievous bodily harm against a 77-year-old man who attempted to intervene during the attack.
Cox was married with two children. She had been campaigning for a Remain vote in the UK’s Brexit referendum at the time of her death.
She was first elected to Parliament in the 2015 General Election.
Police had found Mair’s Birstall home to be full of Nazi literature and other memoribilia in the wake of his arrest.
Investigators found an extensive collection of books on German military history, the Holocaust and Nazi race theory and a statue of a bust of the eagle of Germany’s Third Reich.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/why-british-politicians-resigning-farage-cameron-boris-2862057-Jul2016/,"NIGEL FARAGE, THE UKIP leader,announced yesterdaythat he is stepping down, claiming he “wants his life back” and that his “political ambition has been achieved” now that the UK has voted to leave the EU.
This comes on the heels ofBoris Johnson’s decisionnot to take part in the race for leadership of the Conservative Party. This followed David Cameron himself announcing that he wasstanding down as Prime Minister.
So, what’s going on with British politics? The details are murky and rapidly evolving, but let me attempt to provide an explanation for this week’s events.
Cameron resigns
David Cameron launched the referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU. The reason why he did that has to do with internal Conservative Party politics.
Indeed, there has always been a Eurosceptic current in the party, and it became rather strong. With the rise of Nigel Farage’s UKIP, the Conservatives worried about being out-flanked on the right on immigration and Europe. In order to clamp down on that threat, Cameron said that if elected he would hold a referendum. He hoped that Remain would win, thus neutralising the Eurosceptic challenge.
But people voted for Brexit. Having lost his gamble, Cameron was virtually forced to resign, because the referendum was such a huge issue that it became a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister.
David Cameron resigns as Prime MinisterDaniel Leal-OlivasDaniel Leal-Olivas
Leavers jump ship
In the wake of their victory, the Leave camp’s lack of planning for an EU exit quickly came to light.
Few of those who had inflamed the campaign trail with alarmist speeches about immigration and the evil nature of the EU seemed to have thought about what to do in the event that people would actually be convinced by their declarations.
The Brexit referendum has let the genie of far-right forces out of the bottle. Both the UK and EU, by implementing austerity that led to job losses, economic recession and cuts to public services, have set the stage for extremist elements to emerge feeding on popular resentment. This is best represented by Nigel Farage in the UK, but the same applies to Marine Le Pen in France and Donal Trump in the US.
The problem is that once out of the bottle, those forces are somewhat uncontrollable. The individuals who led the Leave camp made sensationalist speeches without much rational thinking about the likely consequences, leading into the current unpredictable environment.

Conservative Real Politik
Boris Johnson was set to lead the new Conservative government, teaming up with his pal Michael Gove. But Gove decided to go it alone and betrayed Boris. Boris then assessed the situation and concluded that without Gove, he didn’t have enough support to lead the Party and so dropped out of the race.

Almost immediately after Gove triumphantly launched his own candidacy, he lost support from the Conservative Party MPs because he was seen as unreliable and inclined to backstabbing.
This leavestwo main contenders:Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom. Their candidacy helps to explain much of what’s at stake in the leadership race.
In a nutshell, the party must balance two factors: On one hand, the British political and business establishment is opposed to Brexit and so they want a candidate who is favorable to maintaining links with Europe – that’s Theresa May.
On the other hand, given the outcome of the referendum can’t be ignored, they need to present a candidate that’s also open to cutting links with Europe – that’s Andrea Leadsom. It remains to be seen which one will be victorious.

Farage’s farewell
This leaves us with Farage, which is a trickier case. Why did he resign, having won his referendum and now seemingly in a position of strength?
Here is a possibility: He concluded that leading UKIP was no longer useful to further his ambitions.
Nevertheless, Farage’s political capital has increased thanks to the referendum. Therefore, he may want a new vehicle to exert his influence. For example, he could have eyes on joining a Tory Party led by Andrea Leadsom.
Maybe he wants to join the efforts of his multi-millionnaire friend Arron Banks, who has bankrolled UKIP but now wants to start a new party, which would be an improved version of UKIP, fixing its many problems. Farage could play an important role there, in particular, to mobilise members and voters through a grassroots effort nicknamed a “right-wing momentum”, in reference to the left-wing activist group supporting Jeremy Corbyn.
Or maybe Farage just threw everything up in the air in an emotional outburst, unable to deal with the unexpected Brexit vote. But I very much doubt it. Some politicians are depicted as irrational fools, but they could never have made it very far without a plan.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/sean-barrett-brexit-impact-ireland-2711012-Apr2016/,"STABILITY IS AN attractive idea for nations and governments.
Take the UK, which financed its role in the First World War largely by perpetual bonds known as consols. Consols were used by the British Treasury to pay for troops, ammunition and public works as long ago as the Napoleonic War.
They were also a testament to the stability of the UK parliament and the sterling currency: the surety of the British empire was so complete that such instruments were considered credible.
Close to a century later, in March 2016, Ireland issued a 100-year bond at an astonishingly low annual yield of 2.35%. (Remember the Irish state pushing 10% for a 10-year bond in November 2010 before the IMF came in?)
To make it all even more amusing, the bond is denominated in euros, a currency that didn’t exist before 1998 and almost disappeared in 2012.
This is before we consider the idea of the stability of the European Union, the impact of climate change, the potential for a serious slowdown in the emerging market economies and China. The benchmark for stability seems to have fallen considerably.
Scepticism
Into this fraught situation, Brexit has entered. The UK political system has projected an internal dispute within the Tory party into a debate on membership in the European Union.
UK scepticism of the Common Market and eventually the EU was always front and centre going back to the 1950s when it declined to become involved in the 1959 Treaty of Rome and focused on what was considered a rock-solid empire and a so-called “special relationship” with the United States.
Rejection of the single currency placed the UK into lower gear of the two-speed Europe. Since 2008, the management of the Eurozone crisis, the open toying with the expulsion of Greece in a financial de facto sense added fuel to the skepticism.
The hamfisted treatment of the North African and Middle Eastern refugee crisis by the EU has once again made the EU seem less like a framework for effectiveness and more like a broken-down car limping along from summit city to summit city leaving a trail of smoke, oil and bills to be paid sometime in the future.
Given all that, Brexit can look pretty attractive until you start getting your calculator out.
The Common Market was about trade. It created one of the most effective customs unions in the world and in the international context where the only countries able to negotiate individually are economic giants like China and America, the EU provides the framework where trade negotiations can take place with some modicum of success.
In that context, the reality of Brexit is that it will cost a lot of money, not just to the UK but also to Ireland. The estimates made by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics has Ireland suffering a negative economic impact that is around 80-90% of the size of the UK losses.
Repercussions
The economic impact of Brexit to both jurisdictions cannot be underestimated. The UK represents in goods trade around 10% of exports and 25% of imports and in services about 20% of exports and 10% of imports.
The UK is still a major trading partner for Ireland, even though in terms of exports the US is the single largest destination country. Estimates by the National Treasury Management Agency put the losses for Ireland at 3.1% of GDP by 2030.
In terms of unemployment, there could be as much as a 1% increase in unemployment and significant wage reductions for low-skilled and high-skilled works, as high as 5% according to Economic and Social Research Institute estimates.

Ireland’s position as fully part of Europe and Economic and Monetary Union and a former bailout country means that it is knitted into the EU even if a Brexit takes place.
The common travel area with the UK, an essentially single labour market and a long political and legal history with Britain result in a situation where Ireland is in many ways closer to the London that it would be to Paris or Berlin, despite a policy of relative movement away from Britain.
Prime Minister David Cameron addresses activists at the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign headquarters in London.PA WIREPA WIRE
Why is Brexit going to be so expensive for the UK and therefore Ireland? In 1973, around one third of UK trade was with the Common Market. In 2014, the 27 other EU members accounted for 45% of the UK’s exports and 53% of UK imports. EU exports comprise 13% of UK national income.
Trade reductions brought about by tariff and nontariff barriers will reduce income. In the optimistic scenario, there is an overall fall in income of 1.3%. In the pessimistic assessment, that goes to 2.6%.
In cash terms, Brexit reduces average income per household in the UK by £850 (€1,066) per year in the optimistic scenario and £1,700 (€2,132) per year in the pessimistic scenario.
Swati Dhingra of the London School of Economics calculated that households would lose out by roughly £453 (€568) per year on average due to the reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) alone before adding in the trade effects.
After accounting for the loss of trade with the EU, lower FDI and lower immigration, he reckoned that GDP would be between 1.3% and 2.6% of GDP lower (£850–£1,700 per household in Britain), rising to between 6.3% and 9.5% after the dynamic on productivity are included.
As the UK makes up only 18% of the EU’s single market, the idea of bilateral agreements with the US are unlikely to be easily brokered and when they are concluded they will not be as favourable as under a single umbrella.
All EU countries would lose income after Brexit. The overall GDP fall in the UK is £26 billion to £55 billion (€32 billion to €69 billion). The rest of the EU would lose €15 billion to €35 billion of income. Overall, factoring in the losses in productivity due to reduced pan-EU trade the cost of Brexit substantially increases to 6.3% to 9.5% of UK GDP.
Displacement
The situation for Ireland will be a shock where the economic cost is only a minor part. With over 400,000 Irish citizens living in the UK, 230,000 British citizens living in Ireland, and the border with Northern Ireland, Brexit poses the possibility of the potential displacement of those individuals.
This would be a significant challenge to the Irish economy and new diplomatic and legal structures would need to be agreed due to the unique history of Anglo-Irish relations.
The latest YouGov figures in the UK show a statistical dead heat with both sides at 38-39%. Brexit will be one of the most risky events of 2016 along with the US presidential election and the potential for a hard landing of the Chinese economy – and it is a real possibility.
It is a risk that, if it takes place, Brexit will have a very costly impact on the Irish economy and force the now excellent relationship between London, Dublin and Belfast to be redesigned, opening up cans of worms that all parties would desire to keep closed.
The European Union’s existence is being challenged and the debate, as it heats up in May and June, will do much to illustrate the failures of the European project thus far. This will weaken the EU but may encourage much needed reform.
European movements that jeopardise the existing political situation, including the Valencian and Scottish separatist efforts, will find renewed energy from the Brexit debate.
My recommended reading for all parties would be Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: “Vicissitude of fortune, which spares neither man nor the proudest of his works, which buries empires and cities in a common grave.”
Fortune can deliver all manner of outcomes but preparation for them is key. Ireland needs to develop contingency plans.

EU LEADERS GO into a make-or-break summit today, facing difficult compromises to keep Britain in the bloc and wrangling with Europe’s worst migrant crisis since World War II.
Prime Minister David Cameron’s demand for key reforms in return for Britain’s continued membership has exposed a rift over whether the EU’s future is to move ever closer together or to ease ties, becoming a looser group of distinct sovereign nations.
Fail to get a deal and Cameron has said anything is possible, including Britain becoming the first country to leave the 28-nation bloc after an in-or-out referendum that could come as early as this summer.
Cameron has staked his political survival on securing the reform deal and winning the plebiscite in hopes of ending a political feud over Britain’s place in the EU that has plagued his Conservative Party for a generation.
Leaders will also seek to get a new grip on the refugee crisis, which has seen over a million migrants flood into Europe.
Most of them are Syrians making their way from Turkey via Greece, which has been overwhelmed by the numbers.
Brussels has rounded on Athens, saying it is not doing enough, but a solution is elusive.

Welfare sticking point
To avoid a so-called “Brexit”, Cameron has four key demands – welfare restrictions to help curb immigration, safeguards for non-euro Britain, increasing EU competitiveness and an opt-out from closer EU integration.
The key sticking point is his demand that EU citizens working in Britain not have access to welfare benefits for four years.
Poland and other east European member states who have hundreds of thousands of citizens in Britain bitterly oppose such a change, saying it would discriminate against them and undercut the EU’s core principle of freedom of movement.
Brussels has offered what is known as an “emergency brake,” which Britain could invoke if its welfare system is overwhelmed by the inflow of workers, as it believes it has been.
To his call that non-euro Britain have safeguards against closer integration of the single currency area, France insists that London must “in no circumstances” get a veto over the eurozone.
An opt-out from the EU’s mission of “ever closer union” is also proving controversial amid charges concessions to London will create a two-speed Europe of countries wanting to limit integration and those wanting to press ahead.

THE PRICE DISPUTE which saw Britain’s famous Marmite spread pulled from supermarket shelves following the plunging pound has been resolved, Unilever announced this evening.
The nation’s biggest retailer Tesco had halted sales of top Unilever brands yesterday including Marmite – the yeast extract which is mostly eaten on toast and is known for the “love it or hate it” slogan.
The pound, which has slumped against the euro and dollar since Britain voted to leave the European Union on 23 June, has placed food retailers in a squeeze between suppliers and consumers.
Jars of Marmite were “currently not available” in the online store of Tesco – the world’s third biggest supermarket chain – after the company reportedly refused Unilever’s request to hike prices.
Unilever demanded the prices of its products be increased in order to offset the cost of imported commodities following the recent fall of the pound,the Financial Times reported(subscription required) citing executives at numerous supermarket groups.

Other Unilever products including PG Tips tea and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream were also unavailable on Tesco’s online store, but it was the sudden absence of Marmite which prompted national furore.
Fears of impending shortages were abated this evening with Unilever announcing the company had “successfully resolved” the supply situation with Tesco.

“We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available.
“For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love,” Unilever said in a statement.

Ahead of the agreement the sudden absence of British institution Marmite had appeared to spark a national crisis, lighting up Twitter with hashtags #marmageddon and #marmitegate.

Britain’s media seized on the news, with the BBC running a live report, while the Metro daily newspaper splashed with the headline “Marmite wars”.

Accompanied by the motto ‘Love it or hate it’, the dark-coloured spread first hit the shelves more than a century ago from a factory still operating in England.
Made from spent brewer’s yeast, Marmite is usually spread on toast although the company says it can also be used as an ingredient for dishes such as bolognese and French onion soup.

SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER Nicola Sturgeon is travelling to Brussels today for talks to defend Scotland’s place in the European Union after a vote by Britain as a whole to leave the bloc.
Sturgeon said she was “utterly determined” to protect Scotland as she obtained a formal mandate for direct talks with the European Union institutions at an emergency session of the Scottish parliament.
“I will make an initial visit to Brussels to set out Scotland’s position and interests” to European Parliament leaders, Sturgeon said.
“Through all of this I am determined, utterly determined, to preserve Scotland’s relationship and place within the EU,” Sturgeon, head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), said.
Britain as a whole voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU but Scotland voted strongly for Britain to remain — by 62% to 38%.
However, European Council President Donald Tusk has refused a meeting with the first minister, according to a source in the group of EU leaders.
“Sturgeon requested a meeting with president Tusk, but Tusk thinks it’s not the appropriate moment,” the source said.
Scottish independence
Scotland is to draw up legislation for a new independence referendum to ensure it could be held during any negotiations for Britain to leave the EU, which would last a maximum of two years unless all EU member states agreed to extend them.
Outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled Sturgeon’s initiative out, saying Scots had already voted against independence in 2014, and the referendum would require the authority of the British parliament to go ahead.

“The last thing Scotland needs now is another divisive referendum,” his spokeswoman said earlier.
But Sturgeon stressed the circumstances had changed since 2014 and Scotland was in “uncharted territory” and that a new referendum was now “highly likely”.
Cameron will be excluded from a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today as they discuss the Brexit fallout.
Standing ovation
Gibraltar, the rock outcrop on Spain’s southern tip that was ceded to Britain 300 years ago, also voted to remain within the EU and is seeking to stay in the bloc.
“Technical experts” from both Scotland and Gibraltar are to meet to review the possibility of both remaining in the EU, according to a statement from Gibraltar.
Sturgeon is due to meet European Parliament president Martin Schulz today, along with senior liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt.
Scottish SNP member of the European Parliament Alyn Smith called on it to stand by Scotland in an impassioned speech yesterday in which he described himself as “proudly European”.
“Scotland did not let you down … Do not let Scotland down now,” Smith implored in a mix of French and English, bringing fellow MEPs to their feet in a standing ovation.
Experts have said one way in which Scotland could remain in the EU would be if it became independent and then applied to be a “successor state”, effectively inheriting Britain’s EU membership.

FORMER LONDON MAYOR Boris Johnson has claimed the European Union (EU) is behaving like Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler by trying to create a superstate.
Johnson is one of the leading figures campaigning for Britain to leave the EU ahead of the referendum on 23 June. His controversial comments come six weeks ahead of the vote, which opinion polls are suggesting is too close to call.
He told theSunday Telegraphthe last 2,000 years of European history had featured repeated efforts to bring the continent together under a single government, emulating the Roman empire.
“Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,” Johnson said.
“There is no single authority that anybody respects or understands. That is causing this massive democratic void.”

Johnson is a leading member of the ruling Conservative party of Prime Minister David Cameron, who is leading the campaign to keep Britain in the EU.
The ‘Leave’ campaign argues that a Britain outside the EU would be stronger, seeing institutions in Brussels as bloated and believing that the Houses of Parliament in London should have absolute sovereignty.
50:50
The ‘Remain’ and ‘Leave’ camps are currently tied at 50% each, according to theWhat UK Thinkswebsite’s average of the last six opinion polls.
A separate poll for Sunday’s newspapers suggested that Johnson is more trusted than Cameron by the public to tell the truth about Europe.
While 45% said they trusted Johnson more than Cameron, only 21% said they trusted the prime minister more than his old rival Johnson, a ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent found.","7.52am, 15 May 2016",
https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-john-halligan-2975315-Sep2016/,"ENDA KENNY HAS said he is focused on implementing the Programme for Government after a difficult few months.
Fine Gael returned with 26 fewer TDs than in 2011 after February’s general election. Kenny’s party is still the largest in the country and leading a minority government.
Speaking to thePat Kenny Showon Newstalk, the Taoiseach said he normally enjoys meeting people and the arguments that sometimes go with this when out canvassing.
However, he said of this year’s election: “I just didn’t enjoy it.”
After a testing few months of talks on forming a government, Kenny said: “I’ve got my mojo back.”
The Taoiseach said the Government has “a huge agenda in front of us” in terms of issues such as homelessness, the Apple tax ruling and the upcoming Budget, adding: “I intend to go flat out.”
Kenny is the first-ever Fine Gael leader to be returned as Taoiseach. However, he said he’s “not interested in history” in this regard.
He previously said he would not lead his party into another general election but refused to be drawn on when he might step aside, amid ongoing speculation Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald and ministers Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney have their eyes on his job.
“I have a mandate … and I’m not going to walk away,” Kenny said, refusing to be drawn on this.
The Fine Gael parliamentary party is having a think-in in Kildare today.
Kenny said reports into what went wrong for Fine Gael in the general election and how the party can perform better in the next one, whenever that may be, will be published after they have been presented to the party’s executive council.
John Halligan
Junior minister John Halligan has been making headlines in recent days over his unhappiness that University Hospital Waterford (UHW) will not receive a second catheterisation lab, which specialises in examining the heart.
Halligan said he was promised the lab would become a reality if he supported the Government. In an interview with the Sunday Independent yesterday, the Independent Alliance member said: “I will bring all hell down on top of them if they don’t deliver this.”
He accused three Fine Gael ministers, Michael Noonan, Simon Coveney and Simon Harris, of “dirty politics” in relation to the issue.
“What they should do now, if they believe I am destabilising the Government, is put me out. F*** ‘em. Put me out. I don’t care. If that’s what they want to do, put me out. But I know what I am doing is right and honourable.”
John HalliganRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
When asked about these comments, Kenny said: “I won’t comment on that interview”, but added he didn’t think the language Halligan used was “suitable”.
Kenny said the Programme for Government committed to the development of a second cath lab in UHW, subject to a favourable recommendation from an independent clinical review of the needs of the region.
Dr Niall Herity, a Belfast-based cardiologist, carried out the review and did not recommend a second lab was needed, but did call for more investment in existing cardiac services.
Advertisement
The Taoiseach said the recommendations have been accepted and will be reviewed in the future.
Kenny said Halligan has 11 responsibilities under his role as Minister of State for Skills and Training, adding: “I would like to hear him devote himself to those responsibilities.”
When asked if he would sack Halligan, Kenny said the the Taoiseach of the day can only appoint or sack ministers and cabinet majority is needed to remove ministers of state.
Kenny said Halligan is “entitled to represent his constituents in Waterford” but added: “You cannot have a situation where every week you have somebody holding a government to ransom.”
Apple Tax
Last week the Government won a Dáil vote,by 93 votes to 36, to appeal the European Commission’s ruling that Ireland seek to get some €13 billion in back taxes from Apple.
“I believe that the decision was profoundly wrong,” Kenny said today, noting the commission is entitled to look into the issue of state aid, but “not to determine that Ireland should become a global tax collector for Apple” as other countries could be entitled to part of the money.
Kenny said Ireland, as a sovereign nation, is entitled to “set the level of corporation tax that we believe is appropriate” in terms of maximising foreign direct investment and creating jobs.
Brexit
Kenny said he has spoken to British Prime Minister Theresa May about the implications of the UK voting to leave the European Union and it is “appropriate that she has some time to reflect on what Britain wants”.
Pat Kenny and Enda KennyMAXWELLS DUBLINMAXWELLS DUBLIN
Kenny said if the UK wants the benefits of free trade it also has to accept the principle of the freedom of movement of people.
In terms of Ireland, Kenny said no one wants to see a “hard border” involving custom controls between the Republic and north.
Kenny said people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement did so with understanding that “people on this island had the right to move up or down as they please”.
When speaking at a British Irish Association event in Oxford University last week, Kenny said a united ireland was a possibility post-Brexit.
Clarifying these comments, Kenny today said he meant Ireland “should be able to cater for that eventuality were it to happen”, noting this could be 30 or 40 years down the road.
Budget
Kenny said “the expectations of many ministers will not be met” in next month’s Budget, but Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe will sit down with them in the coming weeks and “sort it out”.
“We don’t have a blank cheque,” he said.
Kenny also said the Government won’t be writing a cheque to solve the ongoing Dublin Bus industrial dispute.
He said Transport Minister Shane Ross is “keeping a close eye on it” but “can’t interfere”.
He said he hoped “compromise and solution” would be reached by negotiations with workers and management.

AN ONLINE PETITION calling for a re-run of Britain’s EU membership referendum, which amassed over four million votes, has been dismissed.
The petition, which called for a new referendum given that a certain quota hadn’t been reached, was quashed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in a statement.
Last month’s vote saw the British public choose to leave the EU by a margin of 52% to 48%.
“We the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s Government to implement a rule that if the remain or leave vote is less than 60% based a turnout less than 75% there should be another referendum,” the petition reads.

Thepetition garnered4,127,123 signatures.
Today’s response by the UK government says that the EU referendum act “did not set a threshold for the result or for minimum turnout”.
“The referendum was one of the biggest democratic exercises in British history with over 33 million people having their say,” the FCO’s statement reads.
“We must now prepare for the process to exit the EU and the Government is committed to ensuring the best possible outcome for the British people in the negotiations.”
Last month’s referendum result provoked anger on the Remain side, most especially among younger voters who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU.
The result saw prime minister David Cameron fall on his own sword, with his place currently being hotly contested by Conservative MPs Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom.
The result has also triggered the creation of a pop-up newspaper, entitledThe New European, aimed at the 48% of the electorate who voted to stay in the EU.

May won the support of more than half of Conservative Party MPs in the first round of the leadership contest last night – more than the combined support won by the four other contenders.
She has also a won the backing of fellow leadership contenders Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, following their withdrawal from the race.
May is seen as the most likely leader to steady the ship, amid ongoing recrimination and uncertainty following Britain’s narrow referendum voteto leave the European Union.
Former investment banker Andrea Leadsom, who is being backed by a large Ukip backer, came second with 66 votes, ahead of Michael Gove (48), whose betrayal of Boris Johnson, the man for whom he had campaigned, has shocked even hardened Tory MPs.
Even though he backed Brexit, Boris was seen as a moderate centre-right figure more interested in keeping access to EU markets in return for some free movement of people.

From an Irish perspective, Theresa May is much more of a centrist than either Leadsom or Gove.
Having quietly backed the Remain campaign, May is much more likely to negotiate a ‘soft’ exit from the European Union. Immigration to the UK, for which she as Home Secretary is responsible,rose to 330,000 last year.
Gove backed the invasion of Iraq two days after 9/11, has attractedfierce criticismfor his stance on the Northern peace process, and has previously called for regime change in Saudi Arabia and Zimbabwe.

As well as racist attacks, Thornton said that there had been an increase in “community tension” directed at the migrant community since the vote.

Once tipped to succeed his ally Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne has decided not to run after several unpopular budgets and his role in an unsuccessful Remain campaign.
Public favourite Boris Johnson, meanwhile, riding high after a successful Brexit campaign, was cut down in his pomp after his chief supporter Michael Gove decided to stand at the last minute – in the most dramatic piece of intrigue since the ousting of Margaret Thatcher 26 years ago.
Here we give you the three men and two women vying for control of the world’s fifth largest economy, beginning with the two main contenders, Theresa May and Michael Gove.
Theresa MayPA WIREPA WIRE
Theresa May (favourite at 1-2 on)
The 59-year-old has replaced Boris Johnson as the bookies’ favourite to become Tory leader, and Prime Minister, following the swift defenestration of Boris Johnson.
She has held the Home Office brief – often something of a poisoned chalice – since 2010, making her the longest-serving Home Secretary for almost a century.
A former Tory party chairman, she says she can offer the “strong leadership” and unity the UK needs, and has promised a “positive vision” for the country’s future, focusing on connecting with poorer voters. She quietly backed staying in the EU during the referendum campaign, but remains popular among Tory grassroots.
She is often compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel, and like Thatcher is a workaholic, frequently working until 3am. A fan of Jamie Oliver rather than Delia Smith, she has a reputation in public as a no-nonsense authoritarian, famously chastising the Police Federation in 2014 for “mouthing platitudes” over corruption in the force.
Like Merkel, she is a clergyman’s daughter and never had children. “It just didn’t happen,” she told theTelegraphin2012. “You look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you don’t have.”
Like many Tories, May believes the UK can keep access to free movement of goods and capital while trying to stop free movement of people, ie immigration.

Michael Gove (3-1)
The 48-year-old former newspaper columnist has helped to depose both David Cameron and Boris Johnson in the space of a week.
He has argued for a points-based immigration system similar to Australia, something which may severely limit the ability of Irish people to live or work in the UK.
In 2000, as a policy wonk hecompared the Northern Ireland peace process to the appeasement of Hitler. Around that time he attracted a reputation as a British neo-con, calling for regime change in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.
A foreign policy hawk, he called for the invasion of Iraq just two days after 11 September 2001 and was regarded as a slavish admirer of George W Bush, whom he likened to America’s Churchill. In 2008, after five years of bloodshed in Iraq, he described the Iraq invasion as aforeign policy success.
He has two children with Sarah Vine, a columnist with the Daily Mail who wascompared to Lady MacBethafter mistakenly sending a Machiavellian email meant for her husband to a member of the public.
In the email, she issued strict instructions to the Justice Secretary.
He was also likened to Donald Trump after claiming the UK sends £350m to the EU every week, a figure that was rubbished by economists.

Due to a phobia of flying, he asked not to be foreign secretary when Cameron was elected Prime Minister in 2010, instead getting the education portfolio, where he was branded a ‘zealot’ by teachers.
Advertisement
Described as a ‘modest Bible-basher’ by the LondonTimes, Gove sent a Bible to every school when he became Education Secretary in 2010.
A reforming, if controversial, minister, he was demoted to chief whip in 2014 by Cameron, but appointed Minister for Justice in 2015.
He was a leading player in the Brexit campaign, leading to an open breach with David Cameron, formerly a close friend. He has pitched himself as the only candidate that can provide “unity and change” – effectively painting May as a regressive force.
Born in 1967 to a young single mother, he was adopted by a religious working-class couple from Aberdeen.
His father Ernest had a fish processing business and they moved from a small flat to a three-bed semi-detached house, before scraping together fees for a private school.
Gove stunned his family by moving to England to attend Oxford University, becoming president of the Oxford Union. “Insufficiently Conservative” for the Conserative Research Department, he became a journalist for theAberdeen Press and Journal,and later a columnist forThe Times.
THE DARK HORSES
Andrea Leadsom (9-2)
Andrea Leadsom
The 53-year-old former banker and fund manager was a leading light in the Leave campaign.
She was made a junior minister in the energy and climate change department in May 2015, and has served as a junior Treasury minister and as a member of the Treasury select committee.
Stephen Crabb 20-1
Stephen Crabb
The 43-year-old was promoted to cabinet in 2014 as Welsh secretary, and in the past year was elevated to work and pensions secretary.

Raised on a Welsh council estate by a single mother, an unusual back story that, supporters say, would strike a chord with new voters. He supported remaining in the European Union, but now says the UK must accept the reality of Brexit.
He has set out three aims for EU negotiations: controlling immigration; as much access to EU markets as possible; and ending the supremacy of EU law.

ONE OF THE two candidates to lead Britain is facing a backlash after apparently suggesting that her rival is less well placed to do the job because she is not a mother.
Andrea Leadsom made the comments to today’s London Times newspaper after Theresa May spoke, in an interview earlier this week, of how she and her husband were unable to have children.
The two women are battling it out to replace David Cameron as Conservative prime minister and party leader after he resigned following last month’s vote to leave the European Union. The winner will be announced on 9 September.
Leadsom, who is married with two sons and a daughter, was quoted as saying that May “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people”.
“But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be a part of what happens next,” she added.
After the comments were published, Leadsom tweeted a link to the story, saying: “Truly appalling and the exact opposite of what I said. I am disgusted.”

During an interview with Sky News yesterday, Justice Secretary and Leave supporter, Michael Gove, listed several high-profile people who he said support a Brexit.
Gove said there were “lots of people from sport like (former England footballer) Sol Campbell and John Barnes” who support Britain leaving the EU.

Unfortunately for Gove, Barnes is NOT a member of the Leave camp.

Barnes said he believed the misinterpretation came about after he commented last month on how it would be easier for English footballers if Britain wasn’t in the EU, as they wouldn’t have to compete with European players for club positions.
The next day, he said he received a call from the Leave campaign thanking him for his support.

“I made it categorically clear I was speaking from the point of view of English footballers it will be better off, but I don’t support the Leave campaign,” Barnes said.
“That’s a very selfish view – looking at English footballers. I have to look at what I think is right for the entire country. So I made it very clear I do not support them. I support the remain.
Barnes went on to outline his support for Britain remaining in the EU, saying he was “flabbergasted that Britain could be the first to jump ship when the going gets tough”.
“This is not, in my opinion, what we have been told being British is about. It’s a very selfish view,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nicola-sturgeon-independence-survey-2960827-Sep2016/,"
SCOTLAND’S FIRST MINISTER Nicola Sturgeon today launched a major new survey on independence, saying the Brexit vote had changed the conditions that existed when Scotland voted against secession in 2014.
“Brexit raises afresh the issue of independence… It would allow us to take control of our own destiny,” Sturgeon told lawmakers from her Scottish National Party, which favours breaking off from the rest of Britain.
Centre-left leader Sturgeon said the survey would be conducted through a website and by polling party members, aiming to reach two million people, or around half the electorate.
The results are due by St Andrew’s Day on November 30 – celebrating Scotland’s patron saint.
“I believe it is right that our party does now lead a new conversation on independence. It will be a new debate, it will not be a re-run of 2014,” she said.
New poll
Scots are deeply divided on the issue and a new poll by YouGov published today found 54 percent were against independence and 46 percent in favour.
In Scotland’s independence referendum two years ago, 55 percent voted against and 45 percent in favour.

But Sturgeon said she believed support for separation would increase once the effects of Brexit become clear and argued that the weakness of the main opposition Labour Party meant the centre-right Conservatives could be in power for decades to come.
She called the Conservative government’s failure to prepare for a “Leave” victory in the June EU referendum “reckless and irresponsible” and warned the result would badly damage the Scottish economy.
“I am not prepared to stand by and watch that happen without a battle,” Sturgeon said, adding that she would seek extra powers from London for Scotland to preserve EU ties to help businesses and universities.
Addressing Prime Minister Theresa May she said: “You do not have a clear mandate to take any part of the UK out of the single market” of the European Union.
Scotland in the EU
May has spoken out against Scottish independence and promised to involve Scotland in negotiations on Britain’s future relationship with the EU.
Britain as a whole voted to leave the European Union by 52 percent to 48 percent, but in Scotland the result was 62 percent to 38 percent in favour of staying in the EU.
Within hours of the result, Sturgeon said a new independence referendum was “highly likely” although formal consent would be required from Britain’s national parliament to hold a new vote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-foreign-workers-3010573-Oct2016/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT will force companies to list all their foreign workers in a bid to shame firms that turn down UK citizens.
The proposals, revealed by the new UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference yesterday, are intended to pressure companies to take on more local workers and to “prevent migrants taking jobs [that] British people can do”.
It is believed that, as the proposals refer to non-British workers only, that the list will include EU citizens, including those from the Republic of Ireland.
The UK Home Office was unable to confirm this following a query fromTheJournal.iethis morning, but said further clarification will be forthcoming later today.
Rudd, who lived in New York for several years, also promised to target students from outside the EU with tougher visa rules, in a speech to applause from Conservative Party members. She has denied the proposal is xenophobic.

Taking jobs
The London Times reports that it would initially apply to non-EU workers, but be extended to all non-UK staff upon the completion of Brexit.
Business would be expected to publish the figures for each site where the workers were based. “The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do,” Rudd said yesterday.
After keeping a decidedly low profile since his re-election as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn finally released a statement this lunchtime condemning the Government’s plans.
He said:
Today, Rudd was unrepentant.
“We should be able to have a conversation about immigration, we should be able to have a conversation about what skills we want to have in the UK and whether we need to go out of the UK in order to get them to boost our economy and I don’t think we should have a situation where we can’t talk about it,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
The scheme was one of several under consideration and “not something we’re definitely going to do”, Rudd admitted this morning.
Her comments have sparked a backlash among business leaders, who point out that migrants benefit the economy, amid record levels of employment in the UK.
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said the plans could have come from the hard right of the Tories, who are attempting to heal it divisions over the Brexit referendum.
“The ‘nasty party’ hasn’t come back, rather it seems it never went away,” hetold the London Independent. ”This speech is exhibit A on how the Liberal Democrats restrained the Tories. Without us they are showing their true colours – reckless, divisive and uncaring.”
Lord Bilimoria, the chancellor of Birmingham University told BBC Radio 4 that Rudd’s plans were “absolutely shocking”.
Rudd also said that the Government would look at “tougher rules for students on low quality courses”. From December meanwhile, landlords who knowingly rent to illegal immigrants could go to prison. Taxi drivers will also face a clampdown, while bank accounts also face checks.
Jess Phillips MP, a close friend of Jo Cox, the MP who was shot dead in her constituency, is one of several MPs who have criticised the proposals.

Her husbandblamed her killingon the divisive and ‘coarsening’ tone of the Brexit debate.  A man accused of her murder refused to enter pleas when he appeared at the Old Bailey in London yesterday.
Referring to Rudd’s speech, Phillips said “division killed my friend”, in reference to the late Labour MP.

Special badges
Defence Minister Liam Fox also told the conference that EU citizens living in the UK consisted of the Government’s “main card” in Brexit negotiations.
A Scottish National Party MP, has compared the plan for a list of foreign workers to the policies pursued by the Nazi Party in Germany during the 1930s.
“What next?” asked Paul Monaghan. “Make them wear them special badges and stop them owning anything?”
The Green Party has said the “falsehood” that migrants are to blame for the UK’s problems “must be confronted head-on”.

Foreign doctors
The new proposals follow the announcement that England will train more doctors so that it can end its reliance on foreign recruits for the state-funded National Health Service after it leaves the European Union.
“Currently a quarter of our doctors come from overseas,” Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the ruling Conservative Party’s conference in Birmingham.
“They do a fantastic job and the NHS would fall over without them. When it comes to those that are EU nationals, we’ve been clear we want them to be able to stay post-Brexit,” he said.
From September 2018, England will train up to 1,500 more doctors every year, increasing the number of medical school places by up to a quarter, he said. There is currently a cap of 6,000 on the number of medical students.
“By the end of the next parliament we will make the NHS self-sufficient in doctors,” Hunt added. Hunt said training a doctor costs more than £200,000 (€230,000). Doctors would be asked to work for the NHS for four years in return.

Net migration
Rudd also told the conference that the Government is committed to getting annual net migration below 100,000. It stood at 327,000 in the year ending March 2016, of which 190,000 were from outside the EU.
Her consultation includes looking at whether student immigration rules should be tailored to the quality of the course and the university.
It will also consider whether to tighten the rules on recruitment and job advertising to make sure immigrants are not coming to jobs that could be done by British workers.
Brexit minister David Davis meanwhile said a work permit system might apply for “low-skilled” migrants.

McGuinness added that there was a lot of uncertainty around the future, and that Sinn Féin’s four MPs “were opposed to Brexit”.
A spokesperson for Sinn Féin denied the party’s long-held policy towards Westminster would change, issuing the following statement:
Although the overall result of the UK referendum saw 52% vote to leave the European Union, the majority result in Northern Ireland was to remain – creating a split within the Union over whether they should leave, and a scramble for loopholes.
Yesterday, London’s High Court ruled that only parliament alone, and not the sitting government, can instigate the process to extricate Britain from the EU –a decision which could slow down the whole process of Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-poll-2849468-Jun2016/,"THERE HAS OBVIOUSLY been huge political fallout on the other side of the Irish Sea as our UK neighbours try to predict what the future of the nation will look like.
However, the Brexit vote has inadvertently sparked other debates in relation to Scotland and Northern Ireland, two jurisdictions where the majority voted to remain within the European Union.
Scotland has come out all guns blazing with its First Minister Nicola Sturgeon threatening to block Thursday’s decision in parliament, as well as putting a second Scottish independence vote on the table.
Meanwhile, focus on Northern Ireland has centred on the border with Sinn Féin demanding a border poll.
What is a border poll?
A border poll will ask the people of Northern Ireland whether they want to remain part of the United Kingdom or create a united Ireland.
Depending on the result, the Republic would then vote on the matter.
Why now?
Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State can initiate a border poll in circumstances where it is clear public opinion had swung towards Irish unity.
Following the Brexit result, Sinn Féin came out to say now was the time because voters in Northern Ireland want to remain in the EU.
Louth deputy Gerry Adams and First Minister Martin McGuinness said the Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement that the Irish government should support.
“The British government has no democratic mandate to represent the views of the north in any future negotiations with the EU,” said Adams.
Sinn Féin’s Ireland South MEP Liadh Ní Ríada reiterated the view, stating that the British government no longer has a mandate to represent the views of the North in any future negotiations with the EU.

Knee jerk reaction
Speaking onThe Week in Politics on RTÉyesterday, Sinn Féin’s Deputy Leader Mary Lou McDonald denied claims that calling for a poll now is a “knee jerk reaction”.
However, the calls from Sinn Féin were rejected by Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Leave supporter Theresa Villiers – the one person who can trigger the vote under the Agreement.
She rejected the party’s demands, sayingthere are no grounds to hold a border pollon a united Ireland.
She said it would not be “helpful” in the current situation.
In terms of support for a border poll, there isn’t much of an appetite for one among other political parties.
The Minister for Education Richard Bruton said that now is the time to give reassurances to people, not to raise issues that are divisive.
On the same programme, Green Party member Catherine Martin said calling a border poll now would be “opportunistic” gamble that is “destined to fail”.
‘Sectarian headcount’
She said now was not the time for a “solo run”. Martin also believes that a border poll would be nothing more than a “sectarian headcount”, while Labour’s Brendan Howlin said there is no evidence that such a move would change the status quo.
Speaking in the Dáil during the eight-hour long Brexit debate today, Anti-Austerity Alliance/People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger said given the existing level of sectarianism in the north, a border poll would be “particularly divisive and polarising”.
What do the people want?
Results from a survey for a joint RTÉ-BBC TV production last Novembershowed that two-thirds of people in the Republic of Ireland would like to see a United Ireland in their lifetime, but it’s a different story north of the border.

EU PRESIDENT DONALD Tusk says the only alternative to a so-called “hard Brexit” which would see Britain pull out of the bloc’s single market and impose tough immigration controls, is “no Brexit”.
“The brutal truth is that Brexit will be a loss for all of us,” he said in a speech at Brussels think tank the European Policy Centre.
“I think it is useless to speculate about ‘soft Brexit’,” he added.
“In my opinion, the only real alternative to a ‘hard Brexit’ is ‘no Brexit’. Even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility,” said the head of the European Council, which groups the 28 EU leaders.

The pound has taken a battering as British leaders bicker over how to leave the European Union, with many fearing a “hard Brexit” would mean Britain withdrawing entirely from Europe’s single market, and having to negotiate new trade arrangements, in order to impose strict immigration controls.
EU leaders have said Britain must accept free movement of people if it wants continued access to the single market and have warned the Brexit negotiations will be tough.
British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month her government will trigger those negotiations by the end of March, putting the country on course to leave the EU by early 2019.
“We will conduct the negotiations in good faith, defend the interests of the EU 27, minimise the costs and seek the best possible deal for all,” Tusk said.
“But as I have said before, I am afraid that no such outcome exists that will benefit either side.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-pound-declining-2826701-Jun2016/,"WHILE THE UK goes to the polls this week on leaving the EU, uncertainty over a Brexit has sent the strength of the pound up and down.
A surge in support for Brexit had sent investors racing for financial shelter in the days ahead of a referendum that could redraw the political map of Europe.
It also sent the pound down to two month lows against the Euro as markets become increasingly uncertain, but the currency has rallied this week.
Part of that uncertainty is that nobody knows exactly what kind of Europe would be left behind should Britain leave.
Bookmakers put the chances of Britain leaving the EU at about 42%, a sharp rise from just a few weeks ago.
Last Monday, the pound dropped to a two-month low against the euro and dollar. However, it surged again yesterday as the race becomes tighter and tighter.

The pound has been on a see-saw as the referendum approaches, with critics of a so-called Brexit warning that leaving could spell disaster for Britain’s prospects.
“It is difficult to take long positions now ahead of the vote,” said Minori Uchida, head of Tokyo global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
On the flipside, the euro has suffered in the last two days, with one of the single currency now buying just over 77 cent. That had hit 79 cent last week.
Kay Daniel Neufeld, an economist with the Centre for Economics and Business Research in London says that a Brexit would mean a depreciation in the pound which would mean better exchange rates for Irish people, but bad news for businesses.
Polls ahead of the British referendum have now become masters of market sentiment, said Greg Jones, managing director at Henderson Global Investors.
“As we come closer to the referendum vote, market reaction really depends on where the polls go with volatility likely rising on any prospect of a leave outcome,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-irish-campaign-2721589-Apr2016/,"AN IRISH ORGANISATION that works to develop Ireland’s relationship with the EU has launched a campaign urging Irish people living in the UK to vote in the upcoming referendum.
European Movement Ireland launched the campaign today, gearing it towards British citizens who live in Ireland and Irish people who live in the UK.
The campaign will try to get these people registered in time to vote in the ‘In-Out’ referendum on 23 June, when the UK will vote on whether or not to stay as a member of the European Union.
The campaign launch comes as a new report by the British Treasury warned that its economy could be six percentage points smaller than it would otherwise have been by 2030.
The report said a Brexit would cause “permanent” economic damage as Britain would never be able to negotiate quota-free, no-tariff access to the single market if Britons vote to leave in the referendum.
Campiagn
Called the #PhoneAFriend campaign, it will seek to spread the message to people to register who may not be aware that they are eligible to vote.
“It is worth noting that an estimated 500,000 Irish people based in England, Scotland and Wales, are eligible to vote on 23 June and can do so,” said Maurice Pratt, chairman of EMI.
EMIEMI
“Everyone will of course accept the final decision of the UK electorate but we hope that all of those who are eligible to vote will do so.

People have until 7 June to register their vote.
EMI is an organisation focussed on linking Ireland to the EU. Founded in 1954, it describes itself as an “independent, not-for-profit, membership-based organisation working to develop the connection between Ireland and Europe”.
Report
The new report by the UK Treasury published today warns about the negative impact leaving the EU would have on the country.
The report says that Britain will never recover from the economic damage leaving would have.
It puts a particular focus on the damage that could be done to the Northern Ireland economy, saying that leaving would damage trade with Ireland as customs controls may be introduced.
“Outside the customs union, goods being exported across the border could be subjectto various forms of customs controls and their liability to duty determined according tocomplex rules of origin,” the report states.
However, the Leave campaign has dismissed the report.
John Redwood, a pro-Brexit lawmaker and former government minister, dismissed the Treasury analysis, comparing it to arguments made in favour of staying in the EU’s Exchange Rate Mechanism.
“The remainers were wrong then and they are wrong now – people should not trust their judgement on the EU,” Redwood said.

BRITAIN’S QUEEN ELIZABETH II has told an audience in Berlin that she has “every confidence” that Britain and Germany will continue to work together.
In what is already being interpreted as The Queen’s intervention in the UK’s referendum on EU membership, she told a state banquet about her country’s “close involvement” in the continent.
“Since 1945, the United Kingdom has determined to remain among Germany’s strongest friends in Europe,” she said.

“Our work together includes every part of life from politics to commerce, to industry to every aspect of the arts. In particular, music, museum and education.”
“The United Kingdom has always been closely involved in its continent,” she continued to 700 dignitaries. “Even when our main focus was elsewhere in the world, our people played a key part in Europe.”
It’s not the first time the Queen has been seen as getting involved in a referendum vote. Ahead of Scotland’s vote on independence, aides were quoted as saying that she felt “a great deal of concern” over the independence referendum.
As she spoke alongside German President Joachim Gauck and opposite Chancellor Angela Merkel, The Queen talked about how Britons have been involved in building many parts of Europe.
“In the 19th century, in the Russian empire, a Welsh engineer called John Hughes founded a mining town in Ukraine which is now Donetsk.”
“And in the 17th century, a Scottish publican called Richard Cant moved his family to Pomerania. His son moved east to Memel and his grandson then moved south to Königsberg, where Richard’s great-grandson Immanuel Kant was born.”
Immanuel Kant is an 18th century German philosopher whose work is considered vital to modern philosophy.

Former prime minister Gordon Brown has made quite a forceful case for what a British exit (or ‘Brexit’) from the EU would mean for the UK, specifically all the bad things it would mean.
In an opinion piece forThe GuardianBrown argues that leaving the EU, as the current Conservative government has been making strong noises about doing under pressure from UKIP, would be ‘sheer defeatism’, and leave the UK isolated as the ‘North Korea of Europe’.

“(Leaving the union, aka the ‘Hong Kong option’) is really the North Korea option,” says Brown.
Saved the world
Earlier today, prominent euro-sceptic Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash spoke in front of our own Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs regarding the effects of a UK exit. His conclusion? Britain needs to leave the EU and the sooner the better.
Should the Conservatives regain government in next May’s election prime minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on the UK’s participation in the EU.  He has had little choice in the matter given the rise in popularity of Nigel Farage’s UKIP.

“We (the UK) are the only member state without a constitution, we are in a different position to other members, we are voluntary,” Cash told the committee.
Implications
Hmmm.  So what would the implications be of the UK leaving the European Union, both for them and for us?
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, professor of finance at Trinity College Brian Lucey said that any such move by Britain would be “absurdly stupid”.
“It would be absolute imbecility on their part,” he said.
Brian LuceyBrian Lucey / WordpressBrian Lucey / Wordpress / Wordpress
As for how Ireland would be affected, Lucey doesn’t think it would be half as bad as people might fear.
“It would be enormously destabilising, no doubt about that. We would have to secure our borders, and that means with Northern Ireland whether we like it or not. And there’s the issue of the several hundred thousand Irish working in the UK and vice versa,” he said.
Not that Lucey expects it to happen.
“Look, a lot of misguided British people may want to leave Europe, but plenty of sensible British people don’t, common sense will most likely prevail,” he added.
Not all bad news then. The UK election is certainly going to be an interesting one though.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/what-happens-to-ireland-if-the-uk-exits-the-eu-1201725-Dec2013/,"Ireland joined the EU in 1973, following in UK’s wake. When the UK goes to vote on staying or leaving the EU in 2017, there’s no prospect of Ireland leaving alongside her. However, if the UK exits, Ireland seems certain to feel the largest effect from any potential UK departure.
THE BRITISH, and the English in particular, have never fallen in love with the European Project. The European Community they joined in 1973 and the European Union they find themselves in now was not the product of UK engineering. It was an economic and pragmatic decision to apply for EC membership, first in 1961 and then again in 1967. The same economic logic applies today and argues for the UK to remain in its loveless but lucrative marriage to the EU.
But one should not underestimate how unpopular the EU is in England. The arrangement represents a pragmatic, not heartfelt, union. The Germans and French saw the EU as a political project, reconciling historic wounds. Smaller countries like Greece, Spain, and most of Eastern Europe saw membership as a return to Europe after decades of isolation and dictatorship.
The UK has never felt the need for either. To the UK, Europe is where Waterloo happened. It’s where Dunkirk and the Somme happened. Europe is not Coventry or Dover or Bristol. For the UK, the purse strings are not attached to the heartstrings, and the EU is taking on ever more political and social powers. The UK wanted merely a European Free Trade Area and set up the still existent EFTA in the 1960s.
But other countries would be affected by a UK exit from the EU, and none more so than Ireland. Economic links between the UK and Ireland are very deep. Ireland joined the EU in 1973 alongside the UK, as its economy at the time was extremely dependent on the UK (Denmark entered at the same time as well for similar reasons). The UK is still Ireland’s largest trading partner. The two countries share a major land border (the only major land border for either state); the UK pitched in over 3 billion pounds for the Irish bailout, despite staying out of the euro. It did not provide similar relief to Spain, Greece, or Portugal.
No member state has ever left the EU so it is hard to know exactly how a Brexit would play out and what the relationship between the EU and the UK would be.
Advertisement
Here are two possible scenarios and what they would mean for Ireland. The first assumes the UK simply downgrades its membership with the EU by falling out of the EU itself, but remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) or returning to the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) like Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland. The second assumes that the UK and EU do not find a fallback position and the UK falls completely out of the EU without any preferential trade agreement in place.
If the UK manages to move from the EU into the EFTA, much can and will remain the same in terms of trade between the UK and Ireland. The UK would be on the same trade terms as Iceland, Norway, or Switzerland: part of the Common Market, but with little or no say in its own trade policy or import tariffs. Members of the EEA adopt all EU legislation aside from agriculture and fisheries legislation. For the UK, an island nation whose economy is built on trade, not having a say in these vital economic policies such as external tariffs would be unacceptable. While this best case scenario (from our perspective) for a UK exit would see little real change, it may be unrealistic.
Therefore the UK may bounce out of the EU and the Common Market altogether. This is a worst-case scenario. While harmful both to the EU and the UK, which would see trade barriers raised between them, it would be especially harmful to Ireland. There is massive trade between Ireland and the UK. Much of it is seemingly invisible as trade in services such as software, consulting, and professional services. Tariffs on this “invisible” trade could be very detrimental to the Irish economy, as it makes up much of the €50 billion in trade between Ireland and the UK.
The psychological impact of the UK exit could be much greater. If the UK completely left the EU the major question to arise is how to apply tariffs across an open border? This would almost certainly necessitate putting in border controls between the Republic and the North, to prevent smuggling and enforce the payment of taxes. It would also require border controls on ferries and airlines between the UK and Ireland. It could also see Frontex, the EU border agency, being called in to help police the Irish/UK border, which may not sit well with either the UK or Ireland. However, they may stand down if their presence is not requested.
In the long-term, even more foreign multinationals might decamp from London to Dublin, not just for the low corporate tax, but for full access to the EU Common Market. However, this might be counterbalanced by another long-term threat, the loss of an ally in EU negotiations.
The UK and Ireland often see eye-to-eye on EU regulation and have aided each other in supporting free trade policies within the EU. Ireland would lose an ideological ally, but also one with linguistic and cultural ties.  Ireland without the UK on the Council of Ministers will be more exposed than with a larger and stronger ally sitting with it. It may become ever more difficult to prevent a French-led drive to “harmonise” corporate taxes at the same level across the EU.
Ireland will have no say over whether the UK stays in the EU; it will be down to a UK referendum. But it may be the country most heavily affected. Even should the UK exit, it is in Ireland’s interest to keep the UK bound up in the EEA, and to prevent it from bouncing out of EU trade agreements – and thereby avoiding the worst-case scenario. While Ireland has no say over the outcome in the UK, it should already be working on contingency plans if the worst should happen and reach out to both the UK government and to its EU partners. If a bust up can be avoided, Ireland stands the most to gain. If not, it stands the most to lose.

A MAN’S EXTRADITION to the UK on sexual assault charges should be refused because of the Brexit vote, a lawyer has told the High Court.
The case concerns a 78-year-old Irish man, who is wanted to face prosecution in the UK on ten alleged offences including rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and indecency of a child alleged to have been committed in the Camden area of London as well as Essex on dates between 1960 and 1973.
The south Dublin man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denies the allegations, contending that they are “scurrilous” and “totally groundless”.
He was arrested by gardaí last October on foot of a European Arrest Warrant issued by a Westminster Magistrates Court in September 2015 and has been on bail since that date.
At today’s hearing, the man’s barrister, Patrick Gageby SC, told the court that there “isn’t any doubt” about the UK leaving the EU.
No assurance
“Mr Cameron and Ms May have committed to exit,” he said. “Both the EU and the UK have nominated able candidates to negotiate same.”
Mr Gageby said that the the court can give no assurance whether his client’s trial would be pre- or post-Brexit.
“It cannot be assured the trial will be pre-Brexit,” he said, adding that there was “a real risk it won’t occur pre-Brexit”.
Previously, at the submissions in the extradition hearing on 12 July the court heard that the 78-year-old man grew up in south Dublin and moved to England in 1961 until the mid 1970s.
His health was described as poor and his wife has recently passed away.
One of two alleged complainants first approached the authorities in England in 2005. In that year, a letter was also sent to the man in Dublin outlining certain allegations.
In an affidavit opened in court, the man stated that he was shocked and dismayed at the contents of the letter. The allegations were the first he had heard of this from any source, he stated.
Advertisement
He said the allegations were “scurrilous and “totally groundless”. He said he was very disappointed on a personal level given the close relationship he had with the complainant’s family for many years.
He said he never stayed overnight in the complainant’s home and rarely saw the second complainant.
Third suspect
He moved back to Ireland in the 1970s but frequently spent Christmas in the UK as recently as 2001 and was always welcome, he stated.
Owing to the absence of time and lack of specificity, the man said he could not think of any witness to call in his defence.
It appeared from police material that there was a third suspect, Mr Gageby said, whose surname was unknown. As such, it appeared there was some other unascertained person.
Mr Gageby said the court ought not to extradite his client because it would interfere with his family and privacy rights under Article 8.
Today, Gageby said that the court ought to refuse the surrender of the man.
Counsel for the Minister for Justice, Ronan Kennedy BL, said that Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty “has not even been invoked”.
“The court must exercise jurisdiction on the basis that the UK is a member of the EU,” he said, adding that the UK is required to abide by EU treaties.
“The court is aware that the UK is a signatory to the EU Convention on Human Rights,” Mr Kennedy told the court.
He said that it is to “enter into the realm of speculation when Article 50 hasn’t even been invoked”.
“What Mr Gageby refers to as a commitment by Mr Cameron and Ms May that the UK will at some time leave the EU, it is unclear when that will occur,” Mr Kennedy said, before adding that it seemed “unlikely” that Article 50 will be invoked in the immediate future.
After listening to the arguments, Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly said that she would reserve judgement in the case until 14 October.
Comments are closed as the case is before the courts

BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER Boris Johnson today brushed off as “trivia” an offensive poem he wrote about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, boasting of the strength of Ankara-London ties even after Britain’s vote to leave EU.
Johnson won £1,000 from the Spectator magazine earlier this year when the magazine ran a contest for offensive poems about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
A former editor of the Spectator, Johnson composed the limerick in response to Erdogan’s decision to take legal action over a German comedian’s poem about him.
The poem read:There was a young fellow from Ankara
Who was a terrific wankerer
Till he sowed his wild oats
With the help of a goat
But he didn’t even stop to thankera.
On his first visit to Turkey as top diplomat, Johnson called for a “jumbo free trade deal” with Ankara that would strengthen economic relations that take in everything from cakes to washing machines.

But he said he was “delighted” the poem had not come up at all during talks since he arrived in Turkey earlier this week.
“As for the trivia that you raised… it has not come up at all,” he said, referring to the poem.
“In fact I am not remotely surprised that it hasn’t come up, that nobody has seen fit to raise it until you did,” he told a journalist at a news conference alongside Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara.
Afterwards Johnson met with Erdogan at the president’s palace with any lingering animosity over the poem forgotten.
Cake diplomacy
Underlining the strength of the Britain-Turkey relationship even after the vote to leave the EU, he noted that the iconic Jaffa Cakes biscuits “that I grew up on as a child” were now owned by Turkish confectionary giant Ulker.
“What more visible symbol could there be of our economic partnership than that,” he said, after emphasising the UK’s wish to increase economic ties with Turkey.
Johnson revealed yesterday that he owned a “beautiful, very well-functioning Turkish washing machine”, in a nod to the importance of Turkey’s consumer goods exports.
He called for a “jumbo free trade deal” between the two countries, adding while Britain was leaving the European Union, it was not leaving Europe.
Johnson, whose great-grandfather Ali Kemal was briefly a Turkish minister shortly after World War I, also referred to his personal ties to Turkey.

GERMANY’S EU COMMISSIONER Guenther Oettinger raised doubts today about whether Britain would leave the bloc, saying he wouldn’t bet on “Brexit”.
Oettinger told Germandaily newspaper Bildthat he assumed June’s referendum outcome in favour of Britain exiting the EU was “binding”.
“But it is possible that public opinion will tip if the economic situation in the wake of the Brexit vote worsens,” said Oettinger, who is Digital Economy Commissioner.
Oettinger predicted that the longer the British government waited to trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty – the legal process for leaving the bloc – “the more insecure the situation will become – economically and politically”.

Once Article 50 is triggered, it would start a two-year countdown to Britain’s exit from the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ryanair-brexit-2622108-Feb2016/,"RYANAIR BOSS MICHAEL O’Leary has urged the UK public to vote to stay in the European Union in the June referendum.
The airline announced today that it will  actively campaign for an ‘In’ vote which would prevent a so-called ‘Brexit’ from the EU.
Ryanair, which employs over 3,000 people across its 13 airport bases in the UK, said that foreign inward investment in the UK will be lost to Ireland and Germany if the UK leaves Europe.
The company said that the free movement of goods and services throughout the 28-member bloc has made the UK “one of Europe’s most competitive and best performing economies”.
It also claimed that the EU open skies has “transformed UK tourism and job creation prospects”.
Despite the voice of support for the EU, Ryanair, never one to pass up a chance to have a dig at bureaucrats, added it is still critical of both the UK and EU “failure to promote low fare tourism growth in areas such as the UK travel tax”.

“Stronger in the EU”
Speaking in London today Michael O’Leary said that the UK’s economy and future growth prospects “are stronger as a member of the European Union than they are outside of the (it)”.

He added: “Leaving Europe won’t save the UK money or red tape because like Norway the UK will still have to contribute to Europe, and obey its rules if it wants to continue to trade freely with Europe, so it’s clear that UK voters should vote yes to Europe and yes to the reformed Europe, that David Cameron has delivered.”
O’Leary had previously flagged his intent to campaign for an ‘In’ vote, saying Britain is one of the few sensible voices in the EU.
The UK public is due to vote on whether the UK should remain a member of the EU on June 23. British Prime Minister David Cameron is campaign for an ‘In’ vote after recently securing a deal which gives the UK ‘special status’.
Among other concessions, the legally binding agreement grants the UK an exemption from the founding goal of “ever closer union” and concessions on the welfare rights of migrant workers.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pokemon-go-porn-searches-2884778-Jul2016/,"WHENEVER A NEW topic explodes in popularity, so to do the searches for it.
It’s pretty safe to say that Pokémon Go has occupied this position for the past fortnight. The game has been downloaded more than 10 million times on Android alone, while searching for the term brings up close to 35 million results. That brings with it a number of comparisons.
In recent times, you may have seen statements about how Pokémon Go wassearched more times than porn, or how British people searched for “what happens when we leave the EU” in their droves after Brexit, citing Google Trends as the source.
Google TrendsGoogle Trends
Looking at the above graph, it does seem impressive, but it’s important not to mention that this isn’t a graph for search volume.What Google Trends measures is search interest.
Advertisement
Trends ranks search interest up to 100, but that figure is relative to searches across the globe (or specific areas if you want to hone it down).
As Googlementions in its help section, a term going down or up doesn’t mean the total number of searches are decreasing, just that its popularity is decreasing in comparison to other searches:
So in other words, the volume of searches for one particular term can be consistent, but its search interest ranking will rise and fall relative to the amount of attention other search terms are receiving around the world.
One of the ways it assesses this is by understanding the relative search interest in the topic compared to itself.
In a post explaining howGoogle Trends works and what its data means, Google’s data editor Simon Rogers uses the applications for Irish passports after Brexit as an example of how this works (emphasis our own).
For the above example, it doesn’t mean that the term ‘Irish passports’ wasn’t searched for before this period, just that interest in them increased significantly.
So in short, while it’s good at figuring out the popularity of a topic, it doesn’t tell you anything about volume of searches. At best, just use the data from it to determine rising/falling interest and leave it at that.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eamon-gilmore-british-irish-relations-1073642-Sep2013/,"TÁNAISTE EAMON GILMORE believes there is nothing normal or conventional about British-Irish relations and in a speech tonight will emphasise that a UK exit from the European Union would be bad for the two countries’ relations.
In a wide-ranging speech on British-Irish relations to be delivered at a British Irish Association event in Cambridge this evening, Gilmore says that a British “detachment” from the EU “would slow and limit our efforts towards closer cooperation with each other”.
The current Conservative-led government has committed to holding a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU in 2017 if re-elected in two years time with a straight ‘in or out’ choice to be put to voters.
Gilmore also warns that a UK exit could reverse gains made in recent years. He says there is nothing “conventional or ‘normal’” about the two countries’ relations.
“There is no relationship between any two other states in Europe where history, culture, people, economy, land and maritime proximity are intertwined in such a way,” he says.
In his speech, the Tánaiste points to the complexities this relationship pointing out that Irish fans cheered for British boxer Nicola Adams just as British fans cheered for gold-medalist Katie Taylor when the two fought separate bouts at the London Olympics last year
He points to the close relationship Ireland and Britain have economically “to an extraordinary degree” and the dependence they have on one another.
“We each have over $65 billion directly invested in each other’s economy.  Our exports to each other support around 200,000 jobs in both Britain and Ireland,” he says.

He says that a British exit from the EU would be bad for Europe, bad for Northern Ireland and bad for North-South cooperation.
He adds: “I believe it would be bad for British-Irish relations. I don’t doubt that any consequences would be unintended, and that we would make every effort to mitigate them.
“But at best British detachment from Europe would slow and limit our efforts towards closer cooperation with each other.  At worst it could reverse them.”
He says that the Irish government will continue to work to emphasise to British people “the genuine economic and political choices they face as they address their future in the EU”.
The Labour Party leader also says that Ireland will not take a position on the Scottish independence referendum being held next year, saying: “Ireland is not a participant in this debate which is entirely and appropriately a matter for voters in Scotland.”
Gilmore also express concerns about the peace process in the North saying that the past “is exercising a corrosive effect on political life and on community relations”.
“I am concerned at the pervasive and undiminished influence of sectarianism on civil life – and not solely in the more deprived communities,” he says.
He says it is important that the forthcoming multi-party talks being chaired by the US diplomat Dr Richard Haas will see every participant carry responsibility.
He adds that the Irish government needs to “acknowledge those unionists who feel that, notwithstanding the sacrifices made by members of an Garda Síochána and the Irish Army throughout the Troubles, the Irish state could have done more to prevent the IRA’s murderous activities in border areas.”
Gilmore says the Haas talks must provide a clear way forward on contentious issues such as “flags, parades, and the past”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/credit-rating-britain-2849767-Jun2016/,"THE FALLOUT FROM Britain’s referendum to leave the EU last Thursday continues to snowball.
In the past hour Standard and Poor’s has downgraded Britain’s credit rating by two grades from AAA to AA, citing the result of the Brexit vote as the direct cause of this.
Credit ratings were at the centre of much of the discussions during Ireland’s tumultuous period following the collapse of the Celtic Tiger in 2007/2008 – and are an indicator on a country’s ability to pay back its debts, and in turn impacts on its ability to borrow on the international markets.
In a statement this afternoon the credit rating agency has said:

In the statement the remain vote that has taken place in Northern Ireland and Scotland is also noted as a concern due to the “wider constitutional issues” it brings up.
This will come as unsettling news to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne who earlier this morning sought to give assurances to international markets.
Speaking at the Treasury this morning he said that the British economy would have to “adjust to the new situation” but that it was prepared for the fallout from Brexit.
“I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for what the future held. Thank goodness we did. As a result our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces,” he said.
The chancellor stated again that the article 50 of the Lisbon treaty – which would trigger Britain’s formal withdrawal from the EU – would not have to be triggered until later this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-irish-border-controls-2709115-Apr2016/,"FORMER BRITISH CHANCELLOR Nigel Lawson has warned that border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic could be reintroduced if Britain leaves the EU.
The Brexit campaigner told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday that checkpoints may be needed to stop illegal immigration into the UK.
“That could be stopped. There would have to be border controls but not a prevention of genuine Irish from coming in, from crossing the border,” he said.
The message was later echoed by British Justice Minister Dominic Raab, who also backs withdrawal from the EU.
The Conservative MP told Sky News’ Murnaghan programme: ”If you are worried about border controls and security, if you are worried about the effect of those EU rules, you couldn’t leave a back door without some kind either of checks there with any country or assurances in relation to the checks that they are conducting.
“Otherwise, everyone with ill will towards this country would go round that route.”

Northern Secretary Theresa Villiers has previously rejected claims that Brexit would lead to border controls being reimposed in Ireland.
“I don’t think anyone should assume that border checks should be introduced as a result of a UK exit,” she told the BBC’s World at One in February.
“We are in the area of scare stories. We do need to recognise that the relationship between the UK and Ireland when it comes to this common travel area is decades older than our EU membership and doesn’t depend on it.”
The common zone covering Ireland and the UK allows Irish and British citizens to travel between both countries with minimal ID. Some argue a British exit from the EU would force the reintroduction of passport controls to prevent people moving across the border for work.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan last week urged Irish people living in Britain to vote in favour of remaining in the EU in the June referendum.
The worry among political parties here – and Sinn Féin in the North – is that Brexit could damage Northern Irish trade and threaten the peace process.

A HIGH COURT ruling that the British government cannot begin divorce proceedings from the European Union without parliamentary approval has added further confusion to the bewildering implications of Brexit.
Here are key things known about the Brexit process, and the issues that remain shrouded in doubt.
- Britain will leave the EU -
Kirsty Wigglesworth / PA WireKirsty Wigglesworth / PA Wire / PA Wire
Prime Minister Theresa May’s office reacted to the court’s decision by stressing the “government is determined to respect the result of the referendum” while opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he “respects the decision of the British people”, despite nearly all his parliamentary party members being against Brexit.
The ruling allows lawmakers, technically, to delay indefinitely the triggering of Article 50, which starts the break-up process, but such a move would be highly unlikely given the weight of public opinion.
- UK plans immigration curbs -

May last month insisted that Britain would no longer accept the free movement of people to and from the EU on Brussels’ terms, and also pledged to repatriate legal powers.
“We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again and we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,” she told her Conservative Party’s conference.
- Economy defies expectations -
Kirsty Wigglesworth / PA WireKirsty Wigglesworth / PA Wire / PA Wire
Confounding economists, Britain’s economy has grown solidly since the June referendum, household spending has grown faster than expected, while the housing market has remained resilient.
“For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,” Bank of England chief Mark Carney said today while announcing an upward revision of growth predictions for next year.
- Parliament not sure to vote -
The government immediately announced it would challenge the High Court ruling, taking the case to the Supreme Court early next month. If successful, the government will be able to trigger Article 50 as planned, without a parliamentary vote.
Advertisement
- Timing of Article 50 -
May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 between the New Year and the end of March, but the High Court ruling opens the possibility of lengthy parliamentary debates and complications in enacting legislation.
However, May insisted that the government remained committed to its deadline, despite the ruling.
- ‘Soft’ or ‘hard’ Brexit -
May has revealed little about what Britain will ask for during Brexit negotiations, but her vow to curb immigration and repatriate legal powers suggested she favoured a “hard Brexit”, which would mean Britain leaving the EU’s single market.
Japanese carmaker Nissan’s recent announcement that it would continue to invest in its British plant – due to government assurances – led to speculation that the government was seeking an industrial sector-by-sector trade deal.
Pro-EU politicians have demanded that they get a say on the negotiating terms, and could use the High Court ruling as a basis for demanding more information on the government’s strategy and a softer stance in return for approving Article 50.
- Result of a parliamentary vote -
Ahead of the referendum, pro-EU lawmakers outnumbered pro-Brexit counterparts by more than three to one, and they could easily frustrate the government’s plans to trigger Article 50.
But it remains to be seen whether enough MPs will be prepared to defy the will of their constituents and vote against the government.

Bookmakers slashed the odds of a 2017 general election to 2/1.

- Long-term economic prospects -
While short-term economic data is encouraging, Carney announced that growth forecasts had been downgraded for 2018, when business investment and uncertainty are expected to bite.
The court case is “an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process”, he warned.
Critics point out that Britain is at least two and a half years away from actually leaving the EU, when any new trade, immigration and other arrangements would come into force.

May’s announcement earlier this month that she would start formal exit negotiations by the end of March was welcomed by EU leaders, who are pressing for a swift divorce to limit the uncertainty.
But she sparked anger with promises to her Conservative party to limit EU migration while also seeking “maximum freedom” to operate in the bloc’s single market  – two things that Brussels says are incompatible.
The French leader’s outburst was in stark contrast to EU president Donald Tusk, who had earlier taken pains to welcome May after she was excluded from last month’s summit of 27 leaders in Bratislava.

“Some media described her first meeting in the European Council as entering the lion’s den. It’s not true. It’s more like a nest of doves,” Tusk told reporters.
But he repeated that there would be no negotiations before Britain triggers Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon treaty, which begins a two-year countdown to leaving.
May will hold her first bilateral talks with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker over lunch today, but no substantive debate on Brexit is expected.

Meetings of the 27
Arriving in Brussels for her first EU summit since taking office in July, May emphasised that Britain was leaving the bloc but said it would play a full part until then.
This included calling for a “robust and united” approach to Russia’s air strikes in Syria, although EU leaders were unable to agree on a threat of sanctions.
“The UK is leaving the EU but we will continue to play a full role until we leave and we’ll be a strong and dependable partner after we’ve left,” May told reporters.
During the summit talks, the prime minister questioned the validity of decisions made without her in Bratislava last month.
But Tusk warned that once Article 50 is triggered, “we have our right and also our legal obligation to meet as 27 to discuss our strategy”.

‘Immensity of the task’
Over a working dinner on yesterday evening, May gave a brief update of her plans, urging EU leaders to help make Brexit work for both sides.
“We want our departure to be a smooth, constructive, orderly process, minimising uncertainty,” a source in her office said, on condition of anonymity.
The source later shrugged off France’s tough talk, saying: “It’s a negotiation. There’s lots being said.”
May has refused to give details on her plan for Brexit, amid sharp divisions in her government between ministers who back a clean break and others seeking continued ties to protect the economy.

The UK is set to vote on the issue in a referendum on 23 June.
Linda Barry, SFA assistant director, said trade between the two countries directly supports over 400,000 jobs – half of them in Ireland.

“For small Irish businesses looking to expand, the UK is often their first export market and 43% of exports from indigenous Irish companies are destined for the UK.
“The UK is a strong voice for free trade, reduction in red tape and other pro-enterprise policies at EU level. For all of these reasons, it is in the interests of the Irish small business community that the UK remains in a reformed EU.”
Barry said uncertainty is “never good in business” and Brexit “introduces layers of uncertainty for companies in Ireland”:
“The looming referendum is already having a significant impact on exchange rates. Uncertainty has pushed the value of sterling lower, increasing the competitive pressures on Irish exporters. If the UK votes to leave, this effect could intensify.”
Barry called on the next government to focus on this issue in the months ahead.

YOUNG PEOPLE COULD be the deciding factor in whether Britain stays in the EU, according to an opinion poll released today, which put the Leave campaign in the lead.
The online survey for The Observer newspaper found support for Britain to quit the 28-country bloc was at 43%, with the campaign to stay in the EU on 39%.
Some 18% of the 1,966 adults asked in the Opinium online survey, conducted between Tuesday and Friday, said they were undecided on how they will vote. 1% refused to say.
There have been considerable fluctuations in the opinion polls ahead of the 23 June referendum.
Telephone surveys tend to put the Remain campaign ahead while those conducted online show them to be much closer.

The Observer said turnout among younger voters could hold the key to which way the referendum will go.
“Government strategists and pollsters privately admit that the central problem for the Remain side is that its support for staying in the EU is strongest among young people, the group least likely to vote,” its story said.
The poll found that 53% of people aged 18 to 34 wanted Britain to stay in the European Union, with 29% wanting out.
In the 35 to 54 age group, 38% wanted to stay while 42% wanted to leave.
Amongst the over-55s, 30% want Britain to remain in the EU while 54% want to pull out.
Bookmakers currently give odds of around 2/5 for Remain, compared to around 2/1 for Leave, suggesting gamblers believe overall it is more likely Britain will stay in the EU.

POLICE IN MANCHESTER have arrested three in connection with a hate incident in Manchester City Centre.
Video footage showed three youths, who appeared to be drinking beer, screaming at a man on a tram during the early morning commute today shouting “go home to Africa!”
Two men aged 20 and 18 and a 16-year-old boy have been detained on suspicion of affray.
They are being held in police custody for questioning.
It comes after there was an increase in reported racist incidents that have occurred in the wake of the UK’s decision to leave the EU last week.
Chief Inspector Gareth Parkin of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: “We are aware of a video of a hate incident that has surfaced online this morning.
Police released part of the footage from the incident and urged anyone who recognised the men to come forward.

The video, which was widely shared on social media, showed the men calling another passenger a “dirty little immigrant” and shouting “Get back to Africa” and “Immigrants get deported”.
The victim could be heard responding, “How old are you, 18 or 19? I have been here longer than you. You are extremely ignorant and not very intelligent.”
The abuse escalated when the youths approached the men and appeared to throw some beer at him.
Other commuters stood up for the man, telling the young men they were “disgusting” and “a disgrace” to England.
Channel 4 News reported that the woman who videoed the incident said the abuse started when the victim asked the men to stop using bad language.

UKIP MEP STEVEN Woolfe is understood to be recovering well in hospital after earlier being hospitalised following an altercation with a fellow MEP.
That MEP is now understood to be Mike Hookem, who is understood to have gotten into a verbal spat with Woolfe during a vote in Strasbourg.
Hookem reportedly confronted Woolfe this morning after it emerged that Woolfe had considered defecting to the Conservatives in the fallout from Diane James resigning as Ukip leader earlier this week.
A spokesperson for Hookem, a veteran of the RAF, this evening insisted that the altercation had been verbal only, and denied that Hookem had punched Woolfe.

TV footage later showed Woolfe sprawled on a gantry after collapsing. He is believed to have suffered two ‘epileptic-like fits’.
Earlier, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said that Woolfe was in a “serious” condition in hospital after collapsing “following an altercation that took place at a meeting of Ukip MEPs this morning”.
Farage confirmed the news after the party had earlier released a statement saying that he had “suddenly taken ill”.
In a statement released by Woolfe this afternoon, the MEP has said that his condition is improving but that he will be staying in hospital overnight.

“The CT scan has shown that there is no blood clot in the brain. At the moment I am feeling brighter, happier and smiling as ever,” the statement from Woolfe said.

“I am sitting up and said to be looking well. The only consequence at the moment is a bit of numbness on the let hand side of my face. ”
UK media reported that Woolfe had been punched by a colleague but there was no immediate confirmation from the party.
Another of the leadership candidates Raheem Kassam tweeted that Woolfe’s condition was “life-threatening” before later tweeting that he had “regained consciousness”.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Reports have suggested that Woolfe was punched by one of his colleagues before falling and hitting his head.
Speaking on BBC News, Ukip Welsh Assembly member Neil Hamilton said that this is what he had heard.
Hamilton also said that Woolfe had an argument with MEPs and that he “picked a fight with one of them and came off worst”.

Only yesterday, Diane James MEP quit the leadership citing “personal and professional reasons” just 18 days after her election to the role.
It transpired that Farage remained as the de-facto leader of the party because James’ position had not yet been formalised by the party.
Woolfe had been the bookies’ favourite to lead the party in the wake of James’s decision.
He had also been the favourite to win a leadership election after Farage stepped down over the summer but was excluded from the ballot for not submitting nomination papers in time.
Farage has ruled out continuing in his leadership of the party, saying that leading a party is a “rotten” job.

https://www.thejournal.ie/andrea-leadsom-not-running-2872602-Jul2016/,"Updated 5.36pm
IT NOW LOOKS certain that Theresa May will become the new Prime Minister of the UK on Wednesday evening.
Earlier today, Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the Conservative party leadership race, leaving the Home Secretary as the only candidate in the contest.
This afternoon, David Cameron announced that he will travel to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday to tender his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
He confirmed that there will be a new Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night.
He noted his delight that there was no longer a need for a “prolonged period of transition” and said Leadsom “absolutely [made] the right decision” in dropping out.
Describing May as “strong, competent and more than able”, he said she was the best choice to lead the UK.
Making a success of Brexit
Making her own statement as Prime Minister-elect outside Westminster this evening, May said she was “honoured and humbled” to lead the Conservative party.
She also added that she will make a success of Brexit with a “vision of a country that works not just for the privileged few” by giving people “more control over their lives”.
She also praised Cameron and Leadsom for their dignity.

Leadsom announced her decision this afternoon, pledging support for Home Secretary May.

Standing down from the campaign, Leadsom said she had concluded that it was in the best interests of the country to have a strong and stable leadership in place sooner rather than later.
She said a nine-week Conservative party leadership contest at a critical time is “highly undesirable”.
Speaking about May’s 60% support within the parliamentary party, Leadsom said that she was “ideally placed to implement Brexit on the best possible terms… [and] she has promised she will do so”.
Controversy
The candidate had a bruising weekend, culminating in her apology for remarks linking motherhood to the Prime Minister role. She was widely criticised for indicating to The London Times that she was more qualified to lead the country because she has children. May, her rival, has previously spoken about how she cannot have children.
The politician, who was a lead voice in the Brexit campaign, said she has felt under “intense, shattering pressure”. However, in her statement this afternoon, Leadsom did not mention the weekend’s controversy, her political inexperience or the stress of the campaign. She, instead, framed her decision as one made because of support levels and what she felt was best for the UK.
Leadership contest
The Conservative party all but confirmed May as its next leader immediately after Leadsom’s address, with chairman of the Conservative Backbench 1922 committee saying there was no possibility whatsoever that the contest would be re-opened.
Graham Brady told reporters that there was “no need” to re-run the election.
Certain formalities need to play out in the next day or so, with that committee first having to consult the party’s board, he explained. Brady noted that the process had to be respected and that certain “constitutional things” also need to be followed.
May is now the Prime Minister-elect, with the formality of Cameron’s resignation due to happen on Wednesday after he takes leaders’ questions in parliament.
‘Incredibly grateful’
Noting the support she received for her last-minute campaign from 84 colleagues, Leadsom said she was “incredibly grateful” during her bowing-out speech.
“Nevertheless, this is less than 25%,” she added, claiming that was not sufficient to support a strong and stable government.
“There is no greater privilege than to lead the Conservative party in government. I would have been deeply honoured to do it.
“I am therefore withdrawing from the leadership election and I wish Theresa May the very greatest success. I assure her of my full support.”

A new reportfrom the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee echoes the words of former US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld in noting that there are a number of “known unknowns” in the debate – referring to the impossibility of predicting the full extent of the fallout should the UK public vote to leave.
The report notes that the border could be “hardened” should a vote to leave go ahead.
Neither Ireland nor the UK are signed up to the Schengen Agreement (the EU policy that allows for free movement across most of mainland Europe), and free movement between the two countries hinges on a common travel area that has been in place since the 1920s.
In the Northern Ireland Committee’s report, it says that “in spite of there being no desire on either side of the border to change the current arrangements”, in the event of a Brexit the common travel area would be “put into question”.
It notes that there are concerns around Ireland acting as a possible backdoor for immigration and that there would be issue connected to trade.
In a UK government document entitled ‘The Process for withdrawing from the European Union, it is stated that it would be “necessary” for customs checks to be imposed in the case of a Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-effect-on-ireland-2100392-May2015/,"AS THE RESULTS of the UK General Election rolled in during the early hours of last Friday, it became clear that the opinion pollsters had been wrong and that outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron would be returning to Number 10 Downing Street, but this time with an overall Conservative majority.
Back in 2013, in a move to appease the fractious Eurosceptic wing of his party and combat the then-rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) led by Nigel Farage, Cameron announced that if re-elected, he would hold a straight ‘In-Out,’ referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU by autumn 2017.
Hours after the election result, Cameron confirmed that he would keep with this promise. It is not yet clear when this referendum will take place but it may depend on what, if any, concessions Cameron might get from other EU leaders in relation to the UK’s financial contribution to the EU’s budget and also the extent to which certain EU rules and directives will apply to the UK.
How will Cameron will go about leading the referendum campaign?
Cameron’s original plan to hold the referendum by the autumn of 2017 might also be problematic due to the fact that the UK is actually due to hold the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU in the latter half of 2017. Another potential factor in the mix is what’s happening elsewhere in the EU with the French presidential elections, in the spring of 2017, and the German federal elections in September 2017.
It remains to be seen how Cameron will go about leading the referendum campaign and what precise stance he will take, although he has signalled that he does want the UK to remain in the EU but that his government would need major reforms if that were to happen.
A significant number of Cameron’s backbenchers are resolute that they want the UK out of the EU no matter what and the same can be said for UKIP. In Northern Ireland both the DUP and UUP have said they are in favour of holding a referendum. Both have also signalled that if such a referendum was to be held today, without any reforms, that they would advocate for an EU withdrawal.
The Liberal Democrats, who shared power with Cameron in the last government, want the UK to stay in the EU while both the Labour Party and the SNP have said they don’t think a referendum was necessary and that they want the UK to remain within the EU.

A potentially fatal blow to the European project
The prospect of the UK leaving the EU presents a massive challenge to the future of the Union; its entire viability is at stake. Only Greenland has left the European Union and only after it received full devolution from Denmark. The departure of a full member, especially one the size of the UK could be a fatal blow to the European project.
Of all the Member States, Ireland would suffer most if the UK were to leave. Our original accession to the then EEC was wholly dependent on the UK joining too. The UK remains Ireland’s largest trading partner while the social and historical links cannot be overstated.
As it stands, the vast majority of treaties, agreements and trade deals that Ireland has with the UK all now come under the auspices of the treaties of the EU. If the UK were to leave, all these deals would collapse and either Ireland directly or the EU as a collective would have to negotiate new deals, which could take time and any delay could be disastrous for a recovering economy like ours.
The practical implications would also be stark for Irish people: would we require visas to travel to the UK? How much would they cost? Would we have to go through border controls in Heathrow similar to when entering the US? What will happen to all the Irish people working in the UK or the people from the UK working here; will they have to go home and apply for work permits for their current jobs?
Ireland has a crucial role to play
The Chinese proverb of ‘may you live in interesting times,’ seems to apply to what faces the EU over the short-term. EM Ireland believes that the European Union is a good thing, and that Ireland’s membership of the EU has been positive. So much of that success is allied to our strong relationship with the UK.
It is very clear that that the most important issue arising from last week’s General Election is to keep the UK in the EU. Ireland has a crucial role to play in convincing the UK that it is better off in rather than out, and in working with the rest of our EU partners to ensure such an outcome.

BRITISH JUSTICE MINISTER Liz Truss offered her belated support for the independence of the judiciary after the High Court faced a string of political attacks over its controversial ruling on Brexit.
Truss had been criticised for staying silent over the backlash against Thursday’s landmark judgment that the government cannot start the process of leaving the European Union without parliament’s approval.
The Daily Mail denounced the three judges as “enemies of the people” while members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative party accused them of “judicial activism” and of seeking to undermine the June referendum vote for Brexit.
“The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality,” Truss said in a brief statement.

Just a few hours earlier, the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, had issued a statement of regret at the minister’s silence over “serious and unjustified attacks on the judiciary”.
As justice minister and Lord Chancellor, Truss took an oath to defend the independence of the judiciary.
“A strong independent judiciary is essential to a functioning democracy and to upholding the rule of law,” the council said in a statement.

Communities minister Sajid Javid said the case was an “attempt to frustrate the will of the British people”, while former government minister Iain Duncan Smith accused the court of “judicial activism”.
Bob Neill, the chairman of parliament’s scrutiny committee on justice affairs, urged May to intervene, saying personal attacks on judges “have no place in a civilised land”.
The High Court ruled that the government did not have the power to trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, which sets off a two-year countdown to leaving the bloc, without prior approval of parliament.

The ruling prompted outrage among supporters of Brexit, sparking fears that it could delay the process that May had promised to start by the end of March.
Before the ruling, the prime minister had condemned those who brought the legal challenge, saying they were trying to “subvert” democracy.
Early election?
The court decision has fuelled speculation that May might call an early election to strengthen her support in the House of Commons before the EU vote.
Her slim majority was reduced further on Friday when pro-Brexit MP Stephen Phillips resigned, accusing the government of becoming too right-wing.
The next election is not due until 2020, but The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that ministers were now discussing the option of bringing the date forward.

THOUSANDS OF EU citizens who are not eligible to vote in Britain’s referendum have mistakenly received polling cards and postal votes, the election regulator said today.
The Electoral Commission said that so far, it had found 3,462 ineligible electors had been affected but that none of their votes would be counted even if submitted.
The commission said the error was down to software used by some local authorities in England and Wales.
Six local authorities were yet to report back, meaning the total figure could be higher, the regulator said.
“The software provider has resolved the issue which means that, if any postal votes have been issued to these electors, they will be cancelled,” the commission said.

“None of these electors will be shown as eligible on the electoral registers to be used at polling stations.”
Some citizens of other European Union countries can vote in the 23 June referendum on whether Britain should stay in the bloc or leave.
British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens aged 18 or over and resident in the UK or Gibraltar, plus Britons abroad who have lived in the UK in the the last 15 years, can cast their vote.
Therefore Irish, Cypriot and Maltese citizens are the only non-British EU citizens who can have their say in the referendum.
The Electoral Commission is an independent body set up by parliament to regulate party and election finance.
It sets standards for well-run elections and is responsible for the conduct and regulation of referendums.

That means that water charges are set to be suspended for at least nine months – and a whole barrage of people who actually paid them will in all likelihood be not one bit impressed at the suggestion that the payments they have made are non-refundable.
Then there is the issue of thenational water situation itself. For all its faults, particularly in how it was set up and a less-than-clever approach to customer service, Irish Water was established to deal with the serious issue of the country’s antiquated water supply. That problem hasn’t gone away.
Should the new commission come up with findings that are not to Fianna Fáil’s tastes, you get the feeling the government will be on a very shaky footing indeed. Still at least that’s all that Coveney has to worry about. It’s not like he’s also been dumped with…
Housing
Modular housing under construction in Poppintree, BallymunRollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
Yes, as the new Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government (one of the three parts that the old Department of Environment has been split into), Coveney gets another poisoned chalice in the national housing situation. And it isn’t pretty.
One of the biggest brickbats that the opposition were able to beat the last government with was their performance on housing and homelessness. Nowhomeless numbers are spiralling at a rate of knots, while house prices are barrelling upwards all around the country after reaching something of a plateau of unaffordability in Dublin. Meanwhile, thelack of supply of social housinghas led to initiatives like the modular housing builds being seen in certain areas of Dublin.
It’s not a nice situation to have to deal with, but it is one which requires effective action and, probably, some fresh ideas if the new government isn’t to founder. Over to you Simon.
Independently speaking
Michael Fitzmaurice, Finian McGrath, and Shane Ross of the Independent AllianceLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
Lordy if this new Dáil isn’t full of independents. They’re everywhere, and quite a few of them have snagged plum ministerial appointments to boot. The problem is,working within governmentis a deal different from the cosy playing to the gallery which many independents are so fond of indulging in.
However, if the madness of last Friday (when theDáil was forced to wait for the arrival of the Independent Alliance(IA) from last minute negotiations before holding a vote to elect a Taoiseach) is anything to go by, keeping the various independents in line may be easier said than done.
Michael Fitzmaurice eventually abstained from that vote, saying he didn’t want to prevent the formation of a government because of his own concerns over access to bogs in his constituency. If his stable-mates in the IA begin to feel dissatisfied with their own lot then the government could be finished before it gets started.

One of the most high-profile of those independents is of course Shane Ross, the new minister for transport. In breaking a media silence overthe makeup of the new cabinetby announcing he’d landed the transport portfolio, Ross possibly gave an indication of how he plans to conduct himself in government. By behaving as and how he wishes in other words.
Well, he has immediately landed inthe middle of a strike situationthat has captivated the nation in the guise of the Luas industrial action. It’s an impasse that no amount of threats on either side have managed to break. Bringing it to a conclusion would be quite the feather in Ross’ cap. He has form here too – he’s been plenty critical of the likes of CIE in the past.
He would want to do so quickly however, because one of the sole substantive results of the ongoing Luas action is thatother unions and professions are starting to make pay-related noises also. Bus and rail strikes don’t feel like they’re a million miles off.
And it’s not just transport. Justice and education ministers Frances Fitzgerald and Richard Bruton could have their work cut out with possible garda and teachers’ strikes in the near future. Not to mention…
Health problems
Simon HarrisRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Fine Gael wunderkind Simon Harris has come a long way since being elected to Dáil Éireann in 2011. Previously serving as a super junior minister in the Department of Finance, he now joins the top table by taking overthe health ministry from Leo Varadkar, who moves to social protection. And he’s not even 30.
Unfortunately, health may be the most problematic department of them all. Between under-funding, the trolley crisis, the ongoing furore over the location ofthe new children’s hospital at St James’s in central Dublin, nurses threatening industrial action, controversy over ambulance first-response times, and the ongoing fallout over the re-allocation of €12 million in mental health funding from the last budget, the poor man has his work cut out.
And then there’s the news today that the new government is set to dismantle the HSE and replace it with a new health commission – something Fianna Fáil has already said that it opposes.
None of these situations is going away. Regardless of how talented the minister, health seems to be an area where one step up is followed by two steps back in recent times. Can Harris buck the trend?
Should they stay or should they go?

There’s a big vote coming up in Britain next month on the 23 June. Yes, after what seems like endless discussion and speculation, the UK is finally set to decide on whether or not toBrexit or Bremain(as Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly would have us say).
The Brexit has been on the agenda for a long time here, but the true reality of what it would mean for Ireland has probably not fully hit home as yet. That’s something the government and Michael Noonan as Minister for Finance are going to have to get to grips with because a return to border controls andan enormous aftershock hitting our relationship with our biggest trading partneris just a Yes vote away.
What about the Eighth?
Anti Austerity Alliance councillor Michael O'Brien at a pro choice protest at Dublin's City Hall in July 2015
As it became clear that it was facing into an almost total drubbing at the polls in the last election, Labour sought solacein pushing its progressive policies- chief among those being a call for a referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment to the constitution – the clause which guarantees the right to life of an unborn child.
Labour may have been soundly walloped in the election, but the national clamour fora referendum is very present. It’s hard to imagine this government staying the course without holding such a referendum, not least because one of the new independents in government, children’s minister Katherine Zappone, has said in the past she would not sign up to any programme for government that didn’t include an allowance for such a referendum.
You would imagine that fast-tracking such a referendum would have to be a priority if the government is to last any length of time. Of course, once you’ve done that, the fallout from the referendum result has to be dealt with. Who’d be a politician eh?
How long has Enda got?
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
Finally, the elephant in the room. After making what could politely be described as a hames of its election campaign, to the extent that it is only barely still the largest party in Dáil Éireann, Fine Gael’s leader is still on shaky ground. He has said in the past that he will not see out his second term, but if Enda goes who takes his place?
The obvious choices are Leo Varadkar (who seems to have takensomething of a scolding in being given the social protection portfolioafter badmouthing Fianna Fáil during the two parties’ protracted negotiations two weeks ago) and Simon Coveney. But can the government handle a switch of driver mid-race?
The last time that happened Brian Cowen took over from Bertie Ahern in May 2008. And we know how that ended up. As the song goes: “There may be trouble ahead…”

https://www.thejournal.ie/oecd-ireland-survey-2330236-Sep2015/,"LAST WEEK THE government was hailing a set of “extremely positive” figures as the country’seconomic growth rate continued to power ahead.
But in case anyone was about to get too carried away with the news, the world’s main economic think-tank has delivered its verdict on the shocks that could again rock Ireland’s finances.
In its latesteconomic survey for the country, the OECD made a lot of positive noises about the way the country was headed.
“Determined policy efforts have boosted confidence and underpinned the robust, broad-based recovery now underway in Ireland,” the report said.
Unemployment had been falling, the budget deficit was closing and public debt was also on the decline, all “propitious circumstances” that offered the chance to “resolve the legacies of the crisis” like still-high unemployment and bank system weakness.
OECDOECD
However under a section headed “uncertainties about the Irish economy’s prospects”, the Paris-based group laid out these five potential pitfalls to that recovery continuing:
“The world economy may experience lower trend growth over the medium term that would affect Ireland strongly given its openness in trade and financial transactions,” the OECD noted.
While the US has been powering ahead, Chinahas been showing major cracksand there is a risk Ireland’s post-crash legacies of high joblessness, high debt and mortgage arrears will cause the economy to stagnate if its trading partners also stall.
OECDOECD
While property costs are still well off the peak of the Celtic Tiger property bubble, the OECD points to sharp rises in both residential and commercial prices since the trough.

There remained a danger that the rapid re-inflation,with prices up nearly 10% over the past 12 months, would trigger another “reinforcing spiral” of higher prices and credit lending that eventually led to more bloodletting from the banks.
OECDOECD
Ireland’s famously low corporate tax rate of 12.5% isn’t up for negotiation,according to the government, but that may not stop powerful EU member states like Germany and France pushing for changes.
The European bloc has been movingtowards a common tax base, while the OECD has been driving its own anti-”profit shifting” measures to cut downon the types of aggressive tax planning that have enabled tech giants like Google and Appleto pay low single-digit rates on profits routed through Ireland.
Those incentiveshave been credited with helping to buildthe modern Irish economy and the report said major international treaty changes could “have a significant economy-wide impact” for the country.
Laura Hutton / RollingNews.ieLaura Hutton / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
While there have been “institutional improvements in the euro area”, the OECD noted that a reemergence of the region’s banking and debt crisis could be trouble for Ireland.
Greece,with its colossal bailout debts,is the obvious flashpoint here, but Spain, Portugal and Italy are all susceptible with high unemployment and massive borrowings when compared to GDP.

This one has been filed in the ‘who knows’ basket, with the prospects of the UK leaving the EU – a so-called Brexit – presenting both “opportunities and challenges”, according to the OECD.
The think-tank noted trade and investment links, particularly for labour-intensive Irish export industries, were “very strong”. A recent study by UK-based OpenEurope.org claimed a Brexitcould shave more than 3% off Irish GDP by 2030.
The bright spot, as noted by groupsincluding Ireland’s NTMA, could come with a boost to industries like the financial sector as more businesses set up in Ireland as an English-speaking gateway to the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-2-2805583-Jun2016/,"THE GOVERNMENT IS investigating how many customs officers and border control units with Northern Ireland would be necessary if Britain leaves the European Union.
TheJournal.iehas learned thatRevenue has been working on a contingency plan if Brexit becomes a reality.
The authority is investigating what would be the reality on the ground — in terms of border control checkpoints, customs officers and costings.
There has been much discussion about the impact the upcoming UK-EU referendum will have on Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers said the common travel area between the UK and Ireland would be unaffected if UK voters opt to pull out of the EU.
However, earlier this week,Taoiseach Enda Kenny indicated border controls could return.
It’s understood the government is planning for both outcomes after the 23 June vote.
Border controls
It’s believed the typical border control huts that dotted the Northern Ireland landscape in the past, which typically had long queues of vehicles waiting to enter the region, will not appear overnight.
Revenue is looking at Norway/Sweden as an example of how it operates its border.

They have invested in new technology to curb the backlog of queues, though random checks do still occur.
An achievement of the Good Friday Agreement is the absence of a border between the north and south of Ireland and the possibility of creating border restrictions is understood to be a major concern to government.
The move by Revenue to plan ahead is part of a government contingency plan, which involves cross-departmental senior official groups meeting on a regular basis.
The government will have a clear plan in place to deal with the aftermath of a UK vote to leave, with a framework, which is believed to be at an advanced stage, being developed to identify contingencies that may arise in the days, months and months after the vote.
Two-year timelines
However, the two-year timeline given to the UK and Europe to sort out its affairs following an exit vote will give the Irish government adequate time to develop the plans further.
The government has been proactive and gearing up its efforts as the referendum gets closer, with ministers travelling to the UK to make the government’s position known to Irish communities.

Ministers have been visiting Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast in recent weeks.
With the 828,000 people identifying themselves as “Irish only” on the 2011 UK census (1.3% of UK population), one might question what impact Irish voters might have on the vote.
However, recent polls show the race is close, and if it is tight, the Irish vote could be significant.

JEREMY CORBYN WILL face Angela Eagle for the leadership of the UK Labour Party after the party’s National Executive Committee voted that the sitting leader should be on the ballot paper in a new election.
The decision comes after a tense few hours when the committee excluded Corbyn from their meeting before conducting a secret ballot.
They were deciding whether Corbyn’s name should automatically appear on the ballot, or whether he’d need the support of 20% of Labour’s parliamentary party. It was estimated that if this was the case he would need to be nominated by 51 MPs or MEPs, in the same manner as any normal candidate.
It’s thought Corbyn would have struggled to collect the 51 nominations needed to make the ballot, as his support is concentrated among the wider grassroots membership of the party.
In a statement follwoing the meeting, the NEC said that the incumbent leader would go on the ballot without needing to be nominated.
Corbyn’s opponents had contended that he needed to be nominated while unions, who have strongly backed Corbyn, contended this was not the case.
Corbyn had also threatened legal action if the party did not included him on fresh leadership vote.
Corbyn was elected in a landslide victory last year, after a campaign that encouraged people to join Labour to cast their votes in his favour. Previously, Corbyn had been a little-known left-wing MP for decades.

The start of the fresh leadership race followed weeks of turmoil for the party. The drama began in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum result, as a raft of senior spokespeople announced their resignations in protest over their leader’s perceived lacklustre performance campaigning for a Remain result.
That was followed by a non-binding vote of no confidence, which Corbyn lost – badly.

Angela Eagle, a former shadow minister, officially launched her leadership campaign yesterday, promising to bring “strong” leadership to the role. Owen Smith, another ex-senior spokesperson, is also mulling a bid.
Len McCluskey, the leader of the UK’s Unite trade union, described Eagle’s decision to challenge for the Labour leadership as a “political lynching”.
Earlier, workers at Eagle’s constituency office said that a brick was thrown through her window.

The Tories
On the other side of the aisle, David Cameron has chaired his final cabinet meeting as prime minister today, with Theresa May expected to take over in the role tomorrow.
May, who has been home secretary since 2010, had been preparing for a long leadership contest of her own. However, her only remaining rival for the leadership of the Conservative party, Andrea Leadsom, announced yesterday she was withdrawing from the contest.
Removal vans have already arrived on Downing Street (below) to begin loading the Cameron family’s belongings.
PA WIREPA WIRE
A happy tune
Cameron announced yesterday that he planned to leave office much sooner than expected, in the wake of Leadsom’s surprise decision to drop out.
The outgoing PM sounded a little relieved to be leaving his post. Making his way back inside Number 10 after making his announcement yesterday, Cameron was heard humming an upbeat tune (listen below).

TEARFUL MOURNERS LAID flowers outside the British parliament last night in memory of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox, hours after she waskilled in a shock attackat a meeting with constituents.
Dozens of people gathered next to a large picture of the 41-year-old former charity worker, who had campaigned in favour of Britain’s membership of the European Union ahead of next week’s Brexit vote.
“What’s happened is beyond appalling. We are here in silent memory of her loss,” Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Cox’s centre-left Labour party, said at the event.
“This is a shocking occasion and I hope everybody realises hatred will never solve problems. Only people coming together will solve problems,” he said.
Corbyn was flanked by fellow members of the Labour party, many of them shaking and tearful, as they lit candles and one by one laid them beside the photograph of a smiling Cox.
“We are suspending all campaigning activities until the weekend as a mark of respect for her,” Corbyn said, referring to the tense run-up to Britain’s EU membership referendum on 23 June.

Mourners left heaps of flowers in the lawmaker’s memory, who was the first British MP to be killed in office since Ian Gow was killed by a car bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army in 1990.
She was left bleeding on the pavement after reportedly being shot and stabbed in the village of Birstall in northern England, according to witnesses quoted by media.
An eyewitness told theManchester Evening Newsthat a man shouted “Britain First” as he started the attack.
A 52-year-old man, named as Thomas Mair, has since been arrested and police say they are not looking for anybody else in relation to the incident.

‘United against hatred’
Fatima Ibrahim, a 23-year-old campaigner with human rights group Avaaz, which helped organise the vigil, told AFP she was “devastated”.
“We feel shaken by her loss,” she added.
Yui Mok / PA Wire/Press Association ImagesYui Mok / PA Wire/Press Association Images / PA Wire/Press Association Images
Cox worked for charity group Oxfam before becoming a lawmaker in 2015, and several at the vigil recalled her tireless campaigning to help refugees from Syria.
Mike, a 55-year-old who works in the charity sector but who did not want to give his surname, described Cox as “someone who was utterly dedicated to the ideals of peace, love, justice on a global scale as well as in the UK”.
Activists set up a white placard reading ‘We carry the banner of love for Jo’ and invited others to add messages to it in coloured pens.

Tributes included ‘You can’t kill democracy’ and ‘Thank you for all you did for Syria, for humanity. We will unite against hatred.’
Another message listed Britain’s main political parties, and insisted that for one day at least the country was not divided by the two sides of the EU referendum.
“We are not Remain, Leave, Tory, Labour or Lib Dem tonight. We are Britons with a belief in parliament and democracy,” the message read.
In Birstall, a village of around 16,000 residents where eyewitnesses told British media they saw her being gunned down, mourners laid flowers at the foot of a statue.
Hundreds also gathered to pray at the local St Peter’s church.

Updated 9.15pm
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May today summoned her senior ministers for their first talks on leaving the European Union since the summer break amid reports of major divisions over how to proceed.
Following the meeting, Downing Street announced Britain will seek a “unique” deal on leaving the European Union.
The government wants to control immigration from the EU while retaining strong trading ties, despite warnings from other nations that single market access is incompatible with limits on the free movement of people.
“Several Cabinet members made it clear that we are leaving the EU but not leaving Europe, with a decisive view that the model we are seeking is one unique to the United Kingdom and not an off the shelf solution,” a Downing Street statement said after the cabinet meeting at Chequers, the premier’s country house northwest of London.
“This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services,” the statement added.
Finance minister Philip Hammond reportedly wants Britain to negotiate a deal that would allow Britain to stay in the EU single market, while other ministers who campaigned for Brexit favour leaving.

There is also confusion over the responsibilities of different government departments in any negotiations with Brussels, particularly between the foreign, international trade and Brexit ministries.
The cabinet meeting at Chequers, the premier’s country retreat northwest of London, is set to feature a brainstorming session on negotiating tactics with Brussels and key objectives.
Britain voted to leave the EU in a June referendum, prompting the resignation of May’s predecessor David Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in the 28-nation bloc.
While May herself also favoured staying in, she has since insisted that “Brexit means Brexit”.Groundwork

The new premier has appointed a trio of anti-EU ministers to the most important Brexit departments, including Boris Johnson as foreign minister.
However, she will not trigger Article 50 — the formal process for leaving the EU — before the start of next year, despite pressure from other European nations to move faster.
Speaking yesterday, May’s spokesman confirmed there would be no second referendum or snap general election, despite the hopes of some “Remain” campaigners that the process of leaving the EU could be stalled.

UKIP LEADER NIGEL Farage has cited Ireland as an example of where the EU has ignored the results of a referendum.
Speaking on the BBC after the UK’s High Court ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May cannot start the process of leaving the European Union without parliament’s approval, Farage said that the ‘ruling elite’ is trying to block a full Brexit.
“I’ve been the European Parliament for years so I’ve seen this happen all over Europe” he said.
Farage was appearing on the Andrew Marr show with one of the named claimant in the High Court case, investment fund manager Gina Miller.
“I just want to ask her what part of the word leave don’t you understand?”, Farage said addressing Miller.
She responded by saying that Farage should be thankful that her case strengthened the role of the British parliament:
Miller also said that she has received online rape and beheading threats after the High Court ruling.
“I am really cross at the politicians and the media who are whipping this up because they are the ones inciting racism and violence and acrimony,” she said.
Farage also warned that the political temperature was “very, very high”, and said there would be public outrage if parliament sought to undermine the Brexit vote.
“We will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country,” he said.

Theresa May also warned UK lawmakers today not to block Brexit.

“MPs and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided,” May said in her first comments since Thursday’s controversial High Court judgment.
The Conservative government is appealing the court’s finding that parliament must agree to the triggering of Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, which begins formal negotiations on Britain leaving the bloc.
The ruling prompted outrage among Brexit supporters, amid speculation that pro-European lawmakers would seek to water down the break with the EU and derail May’s plans to begin formal exit talks by the end of March.
In a statement issued ahead of a trade mission to India, the prime minister said she was focused on getting the best outcome from Brexit following the June referendum vote.
“That means sticking to our plan and timetable, getting on with the work of developing our negotiating strategy and not putting all our cards on the table,” she said.
The ruling sparked attacks on the judges involved, with one newspaper calling them “Enemies of the People”, while one of the claimants in the case

Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party has 231 MPs in the 650-seat House of Commons, said this week that he will not seek to reverse the referendum result.
But the Sunday Mirror tabloid reported that he would vote against Article 50 unless May agreed to press for continued access to the European single market and guarantee EU workplace rights after Brexit.
“These must be the basis of the negotiations. And it doesn’t necessarily cause a delay,” Corbyn told the paper.
The High Court decision has fuelled speculation that May might call a snap election to strengthen her support in the House of Commons before the vote on Article 50.
Corbyn said his party was preparing for the election to be brought forward from 2020, although Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt played down the idea.
“I think a general election is the last thing the government wants,” the cabinet minister told the BBC.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that her government will activate Article 50 before March of next year, triggering a two-year process for the country to leave the EU.
May was speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show and confirmed for the first time a timeline for the formal process of leaving.
Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the legal mechanism by which member states can leave the bloc.
The fresh timeline comes as the UK Prime Minister announced details of a ’Great Repeal Bill’ that will pave the way for departure negotiations with Brussels.
The Conservative Party meets for its annual conference today facing questions over how and Brexit will take place.
Beginning a new era with May in charge, many in the centre-right party are still jubilant after the UK voted to become the first country ever to leave the EU in June’s referendum.
But there is trouble ahead, with the government under increasing pressure to define what shape Brexit will take.

European powers keen to dampen euroscepticism in their own backyards have taken an increasingly hard line, warning that Britain cannot expect special treatment on trade and immigration.
Access to the single market means allowing free movement of people, they say. But May has said she wants to curb the yearly influx of hundreds of thousands of people from other parts of the EU.
Ending the free movement of people from the EU to Britain is a key demand from many of the 58% of Conservative voters who backed leaving the union.
Some key figures in May’s own party have said they want to sever all ties with the EU by leaving the single market and imposing work visa rules.

They argue that the European Union would only be harming itself if it began imposing tariffs on British goods and services because the EU exports more to Britain than Britain does to the rest of the bloc.
However, May herself campaigned to stay in the EU while other key ministers such as finance minister Philip Hammond reportedly want a softer landing, with carve-outs for Europe’s most important financial centre, the City of London.
“There is so little known about Brexit,” said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics.

“It begs the question of whether the government does have a view about exactly what it’s going to do with the country or not.”
May started addressing the concerns by announcing her Great Repeal Bill, ending the authority of EU law once Britain leaves the union.
It will overturn laws that make EU regulations supreme, enshrine all EU rules in domestic law and confirm the British parliament can amend them as it wants.
“This marks the first stage in the UK becoming a sovereign and independent country once again,” May toldThe Sunday Timesnewspaper.

Slapped down
On the face of it, May — whose keynote closing speech comes on Wednesday — goes to the convention in Birmingham, central England, in a strong position.
The Conservatives are well ahead of the deeply divided main opposition Labour Party under veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn in opinion polls.
May is seen as the best prime minister by 67% of people, compared to just 25 percent for Corbyn, according to research published this month by Lord Michael Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman turned pollster.
In the BBC interview, May refused to rule out calling a general election if her government failed to get the Great Repeal Bill through parliament.
With parliament set to get back to work on 10 October, there is a sense that her honeymoon period is over and serious questions are looming unanswered on the horizon.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was slapped down by Downing Street in September after saying Article 50 exit negotiations would be triggered early next year — a rare snippet after weeks of May saying only that “Brexit means Brexit”.
Today’s interview showed that Johnson may have jumped the gun in speaking publicly but that his timeframe was correct.
When it is triggered, it is likely to be a painful process. This could worsen the decades-old arguments between eurosceptic and more pro-EU Conservatives, already inflamed by the referendum.
“The Brexit negotiations will take much longer and be far more complicated than many British politicians realise,” said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform.
Today is set to be the main day for debate on the EU, with addresses from May as well as Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis.
They will be expected “to put some kind of meat on the bones,” said Victoria Honeyman, politics lecturer at Leeds University.

https://www.thejournal.ie/christian-holliday-3030788-Oct2016/,"A BRITISH POLITICIAN has suggested that when the UK leaves the EU people should be tried for treason for campaigning for a return.
Conservative councillor Christian Holliday has launched a petition that he hopes will make it a crime to push for a EU membership.
Holliday’s petition is published on the UK government’s website and will force the government into a response if it reaches 10,000 signatures. As of 12.15pm this afternoon it has almost 450.
The petition reads that the Treason Felony Act be amended to include the following offences:
To conspire with foreign powers to make the UK, or part of the UK, become a member of the EU.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Holliday’s suggestion comes as both sides of the post-Brexit debate clamour for greater clarity about what it will mean for the country.
A case is currently being taken by Remain campaigners to ensure that the House of Commons will have to vote on the government’s decision to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty that triggers EU withdrawal.

Some Leave campaigners and Brexit leaning publications have labelled people who are still campaigning against Brexit as ‘bremoaners’.
It is within that backdrop that Holliday’s petition has been published and he makes reference to such opposition in providing details of his petition.
“It is becoming clear that many politicians and others are unwilling to accept the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU,” he says.
Holliday’s suggestions has been derided by some online for being undemocratic itself in wanting to imprison political opponents.
Others have merely poked fun at the idea.

“I do think the UK personnel are going to have to delve down deeply into all the issues that are going to emerge.”

WITH THE WHIRLWIND brought on by Britain’s EU referendum, the resignation of their Prime Minister David Cameron, and the ensuing debates over the future of the EU, it’s not surprising we haven’t heard much about Australia’s Federal election this Sunday.
There have been a number of policies at the heart of the election debate: immigration, the end of the country’s mining boom, and marriage equality to name but a few. It’s also been a close race: no more than five percentage points have separated the parties in any given jurisdiction – up until last Friday, that is.
Brexit has now become a core issue for Australian voters, and has even caused a swing towards the current government, who traditionally have a strong track record on economic matters.
Polls
Today the Australian leaders made last-gasp pitches to woo voters on the eve of elections as polls pointed to a swing behind Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, where previous polls showed them locked in a dead heat on a two-party basis.
But the survey of 1,377 people also said that when all candidates were included, 27 percent planned to vote for the Greens or other minor parties and independents, raising the prospect of a hung parliament where no side commands a majority in the 150-seat lower house.
Turnbull, who has capitalised on the instability sparked by Britain’s decision to exit the European Union, said the uncertainty of a hung parliament would be a disaster as he appealed for voters not to go down that road.
“We have seen that film before. It’s not a pretty one,” he said, referring to the 2010 elections where a similar scenario occurred after Julia Gillard failed to win majority rule.
He added that the alternative was “chaos, uncertainty, dysfunction, higher deficits, higher debt, higher taxes, less investment, less jobs”.
“That’s what Labor and the Greens and independents are offering,” he said.

Economic management has been a key election battleground with last week’s shock decision by Britain stoking anxiety about pressures facing Australia’s economy.

Ex-union chief and leader of the Labor party Bill Shorten has campaigned on improving health and education while pledging more renewable energy and a fairer tax system, and remained upbeat that Labor could cause an upset.
“I am talking to millions of Australians who want to see Labor lunge with every inch of energy towards the finishing line,” he said.
“I say to these people, we do not give up and we are confident and we believe there’s a good chance we can win the election.”
Shorten also argued that there were parallels between the two countries’ leadership.
Media swing to Turnbull
Another poll in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph has Turnbull’s conservatives 51-49 percent in front on a two-party basis, as the country’s major newspapers also rallied behind the ruling party, with News Corp Australia and Fairfax Media mastheads citing the need for stability.
Rupert Murdoch’s The Australian said Turnbull offered “a path to national economic success”, a stance backed by its tabloid stablemate The Daily Telegraph.
“The prime minister has demonstrated he knows the importance of a firm rein on public spending and offering a leg up for private sector growth,” The Australian said in an editorial about the former banker.
The Fairfax-owned Sydney Morning Herald also endorsed Turnbull on its front-page.
“Given the choice between a coalition led by the socially progressive economic reformer Mr Turnbull, and a Shorten-led Labor party backed by reform-resistant unions, we support the election of a Turnbull government,” it said.
Home and away
Voting is mandatory in Australia and by mid-week some 2.2 million of the 15.6 million enrolled voters had already cast their ballots at pre-polling stations and via postal votes, the electoral commission said.
These votes will be coming from as far afield as Antartica, where three polling booths have been set up for the 70 researchers who are eligible to vote in this year’s election.
“They spend about six months of the year cut off from the outside world, so it’s a bit of fun for them,” said a spokeswoman for the Australian Antarctic Division.

THOUSANDS OF JOBS could be under threat in the aftermath of June’s Brexit vote in Ireland’s food and drink sector according to two new reports.
A report from Food and Drink Industry Ireland (FDII, an Ibec group) has suggested that competitive pressure within the sector has been ramped up significantly in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the European Union.
Much of the report concerns historic economic analysis, with the suggestions that a 1% decrease in the value of sterling results in a 0.7% drop in Irish exports to Britain.
That translates to losses of about €700 million and 7,500 jobs should sterling dip towards a value of £0.90 versus the euro.
The report, which can be readhere, calls for a review of Ireland’s national agri-food strategy FoodWise 2025, together with a ‘Brexit-proof’ budget to address the issue of Ireland’s tax competitiveness with the UK.
“Urgent action is now required to protect our vital exports to the UK market, limit damage in the domestic market from imports, and address competitive pressures caused by the fall in sterling,” said Paul Kelly, director of the FDII.

Perfect storm
Meanwhile, the CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland Adrian Cummins said that high excise duty on products and Brexit uncertainty have caused a “perfect storm” for both the restaurant trade and the tourism market here in general.
Adrian CumminsRollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
Cummins was speaking as the results of a poll of members suggested that there has been a downturn of 12% in British tourists’ spending here in July and August in the aftermath of Brexit, with the exchange rate with sterling again cited as a possible cause.
The trend is compounded in the Border counties where a decrease of 20% in British tourist spend is being seen according to the poll.
“Now that we are moving towards recovery, we need to take this heavy burden (excise increases) off consumers, tourists, businesses and employees across the drinks and hospitality sector,” said Cummins.
His call was reiterated by Padraig Cribben, CEO of the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), who said “our members are feeling the pinch too”.
“Budget 2017 should compensate for the negative effect of Brexit, such as exchange rate uncertainty, impacts of a new border, and the impacts that Brexit might have on British tourist spend in Ireland,” he said.

TENS OF THOUSANDS of people marched through London today, waving European flags and chanting ‘We love you EU’ to voice their opposition to Britain’s vote to leave the bloc.
The march went past Downing Street — where demonstrators shouted ‘Shame on you’ aimed at outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum — before ending up at parliament.
Breverse, The Leave Campaign Lied, Save our Future and Never Gonna Give EU up, were among the colourful banners on display, the latter referring to the 1980s hit by pop star Rick Astley.
Organisers said over 40,000 took part, but police did not give figures.
“I think the Leave campaign misled people, we are [making] a wrong decision because of the lies,” protestor Casey (37) told AFP.
“Baguettes not regrets,” others chanted along the route.
Second referendum urged
In a move that stunned Europe, Britons voted 52% in favour of withdrawing from the EU bloc with 48% against, with many citing immigration concerns as the reason to leave.
The narrow victory has triggered anger in Britain among those who wanted to remain in the EU and more than four million people have signed a petition calling for another referendum.
“There must be a second referendum. Everybody knows that if there is … we’ll vote to stay,” former television producer Nicholas Light (82) said at the march.

The seismic 23 June vote prompted the resignation of Cameron — who called the referendum in a bid to decide the long-contentious issue once and for all, but backed the failed Remain campaign.
It also unleashed a bitter leadership battle in the ruling Conservative party and chaos in the main opposition Labour party, whose leader Jeremy Corbyn is now facing all-out revolt.

The favourites to succeed Cameron have meanwhile been pushing for a delay in starting the process that will eventually see Britain leave the 28-member EU.
Frontrunner Theresa May and high-profile rival Michael Gove have both said they do not expect Article 50 — the formal procedure for leaving the bloc — would be invoked this year.
EU leaders have urged a swift divorce, fearful of the impact of Britain’s uncertain future on economic growth and a potential domino effect in eurosceptic member states.
Markets turmoil
Last week’s shock vote plunged financial markets into crisis, wiping trillions off equities around the world and sending the pound to its lowest point against the dollar in more than three decades.
The Bank of England has said it could slash interest rates this summer to counter the downbeat economic outlook.
Finance Minister George Osborne has warned the government would abandon its promise to achieve a budget surplus by 2020, sparking forecasts of more spending cutbacks and tax hikes.
The vote over the EU laid bare serious divisions in Britain.

Younger voters — many of whom worried about their right to travel and work in the EU — mainly voted to remain while their Baby Boomer elders were likelier to vote Leave.
Voters in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the capital London backed remaining, while those who chose to leave were largely from less affluent areas in England and Wales.
The Scottish vote has re-ignited the debate over independence there.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon went to Brussels on Wednesday to press Scotland’s desire to remain part of the EU, and said a second independence referendum is now “on the table,” after voters voted No in 2014.
A poll for BBC’s Newsnight programme found that 16% of voters think Britain will stay in the bloc, and 22% said they do not know if it will leave.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has stepped back from a plan to make employers list their foreign workers as it talks tough on immigration following the Brexit vote, after a backlash among business leaders.
“We are not going to be asking companies to list or name or publish or identify their foreign workers,” Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC radio, saying the proposal had been “misinterpreted”.
The idea of making employers publish a record of how many non-British citizens they hire was floated at the annual conference of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative party, which closed on Wednesday.
But it was swiftly and widely condemned as divisive and discriminatory, and the British Chambers of Commerce warned against making a global workforce a “badge of shame”.
Education Secretary Justine Greening said the proposal was about “informing policy so that we understand [in] which areas and parts of the country there are skills shortages”.

“This is not data that will be published. There will be absolutely no naming and shaming,” she told ITV television.
The EU referendum campaign was dominated by the issue of immigration and May has said that imposing controls on new arrivals will be a priority in negotiations over Brexit.
But EU leaders have also made clear that this will not be possible if Britain wants continued access to the European single market — which British businesses say is vital.
Politicians concerned about May’s strategy have begun mobilising in a bid to force her to give parliament a vote on her opening position before formal exit talks begin with Brussels early next year.
The Conservatives only have a slim majority in the House of Commons, and some pro-European MPs in the party are reportedly in talks with former Labour leader Ed Miliband over an alliance that could defeat the government.
“The PM must get parliamentary consent for her Brexit negotiating position. No referendum mandate for hard Brexit nor a Commons majority,” Miliband said in a Twitter message.

“Brexit or not, our claim will never change,” Macri told reporters in Brussels after talks with European Union leaders.
Britain’s vote to leave the EU in a referendum on 23 June has cast uncertainty on the country’s global position, including whether European states would continue to back Britain’s possession of the Falklands.

Britain and Argentina fought a short but bloody war over the Falklands in the South Atlantic in 1982 after Argentine troops invaded and then prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent a naval task force.
The conflict claimed the lives of 649 Argentine soldiers, 255 British soldiers and three islanders.
In 2013, almost 100%  of the Falkland Islands’ residents voted in favour of remaining under British rule.

A report released by Retail Ireland, a representative group for shops across Ireland, has released a report that outlines possible Brexit-related threats to the Irish retail sector.
The report, entitled ‘Brexit Threatens Retail’s Recovery’, gives its view of how Brexit has already begun to scare customers, and says that the government must react swiftly to counteract this development, and to ensure Ireland’s positive economic outlook.
The director of Retail Ireland, Thomas Burke, elaborated on this:
It is not known the exact impact Brexit will have on Ireland, as there are positives and negatives to Britain leaving the European Union.

However, recent indicators – including sterling being downgraded to its lowest value in UK history – have shown that the outlook for the near future is not positive.
Burke highlighted one difficulty in particular for Ireland if the British sterling was devalued:

The worrying figures
The report measured the performance of retail by dividing the sector into 12 categories, including supermarkets and convenience stores, food and drink, pharmacies, and fuel.
The amount being spent in these categories, plus the quantities that were bought was also noted (e.g. €5 spent in-store versus 10 individual items bought).
It also compared this year’s figures to last year’s, this quarter to last year’s quarter, June 2015 to June 2016, and finally, June 2016 compared to May 2016.
When figures across all sectors are compared to those recorded last year, the numbers seem overwhelmingly positive. However, an emerging pattern appears when comparing figures from the month of June – the month when Brexit occurred – to the month of May, which reflects consumers’ fears of Brexit, according to Retail Ireland.
Retail Ireland Monitor Report Q2.Retail Ireland Monitor Report Q2.
The above decline of 16.2% in homeware store sales, compared to an increase of 7.6% per quarter, suggests that consumers are being cautious about the amount of ‘unnecessary’ spending they are doing, and Retail Ireland are worried that this means they are cutting back.
Higher minimum wage ‘not justifiable’
Burke also weighed in on the rate of the national minimum wage, saying that Ireland’s minimum wage was already 6% higher than the UK’s, with that gap likely to widen if the sterling’s value were to fall further.
He added:
The rate of minimum wage has been debated fiercely recently after a report from the Low Pay Commission recommended that the national minimum wage be increased by 10 cent.
This announcement sparked opposing reactions, with some saying that the minimum wage, currently at €9.15 an hour, should be increased to reflect the current cost of living while others argued that this would put an added burden on small business owners, who employ the majority of Irish workers.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-poaching-investors-3054964-Oct2016/,"ARLENE FOSTER HAS expanded oncomments made yesterdaythat accused the Irish Government of ‘poaching’ Northern Ireland’s potential investors and talking down their economy.
Foster, the First Minister of Northern Ireland said that she was sure Enda Kenny knew what the IDA was up to, and said that the All-Ireland Forum on Brexit “will end up as a piece of grandstanding”.
Speaking onRTÉ’s This Week, Foster revealed where she got her information from:
“And look I understand, we’re in competition with one another, but please don’t portray Northern Ireland as not having a good story to tell becausewe still have the value, we still have the talent, and come 2018 we’ll have the tax!”
“I think we have a very good proposition to sell, and we’ll continue selling it.”
Foster asserted again that there was no will from the party to return to a hard border between the North and Republic of Ireland, but said that the All-Ireland Forum “will end up as a piece of grandstanding” as the DUP refused to take part.
“We need to convince the EU that because of our geography and history that they need to deal with us in a particular fashion and when those negotiations start to recognise that.”

Foster said that it was right to bring this issue up, as people need to understand what’s going on.

Speaking about Enda Kenny, Foster said that “he knows very well what the IDA is up to I’m sure in relation to economic growth in the Republic of Ireland”.
Despite the accusations about the Irish Government, Foster maintained that the relationship between the two administrations wasn’t frosty, and is the best it ever has been.
“We’re big people, we’re not that thin skinned. He’s a grown up politician and so am I.”
“I think it’s right that I’m bringing up what going on in America because it’s actually happening, and people need to understand that.”
“I think the worst thing is if I was saying these things behind closed doors and not saying it straight to Enda – but I think it’s right that we’re saying what’s going on.”
‘Poaching investors’
Niall CarsonNiall Carson
Yesterday, the First Minister of Northern Ireland chose her first speech as leader of the Democratic Unionist Partyto tackle the issue of investment competition for the North:
“Their representatives are sent out around the world to talk down our economy, and to attempt to poach our investors.”
“Well I don’t believe in a hard border, and I’m happy to welcome any shoppers looking for a bargain from anywhere across the border anytime soon.”
This comes as a Red C Poll published in today’s Sunday Business Post shows that one in three of all shoppers in the Republic plan to cross the border to do their Christmas shopping – taking advantage of the slump in sterling.
This could lead to a major drop in revenue for the government, as if true, means the intake from tax on goods will slump.

The statistics show that while Ireland exported €13.7 billion worth of goods to Britain in 2015, exports to Belgium topped €14.5 billion.
A proportion of this is shipped on from Belgian ports to other markets.
Exports to Britain still account for much more bulk – 36% of the total volume of exports were across the Irish Sea.
The United States, meanwhile, remain our most lucrative export market by a country mile, accounting for €26 billion of Irish exports last year.

It’s a slight misnomer in a way, because some of it might be then sent on to other countries.
“You’d be talking very high value and low quantities, because pharmaceuticals are low in bulk.
Whereas with England it could be live animals, maybe lower-value but higher tonnage goods.
“It’s a hard one – we do export a lot to Britain, but a lot of that is food and live animals.

In July, the month after the UK’s referendum vote to leave the European Union, 7,321 people living Britain applied for a passport – compared to 4,242 a year ago.
In the North, there were 6,638 Irish passports requested in July, compared to 4,070 in July 2015 – a 63% increase. It followed calls by the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr for northern unionists to apply for an Irish passport.

Tariffs and border controls
Similarly to Scotland, 56% of voters in the North voted to remain in the EU, bucking the overall trend in the UK.
Prior to the vote, Theresa May, now British prime minister, said it was “inconceivable” the Irish borderwould not be affectedby a Brexit vote.
She also insisted that Brexit would lead to tariffs and some form of controls between the Republic and the North – although Taoiseach Enda Kenny has sought to ensure any new controls are carried out ‘invisibly’ through modern technology.
Last month, Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said the government was “concerned” about ajump in visa applications.
Last year, 10,000 visa applications were made from the North and Britain, in comparison to just 1,800 in 2014.
Sinn Féin has repeatedly said the North must not be “dragged out of Europe on the tails of a vote in England, and wasquick off the markto call for a referendum on Irish unification.
So far the British government has dismissed calls for aborder poll.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-leave-eu-why-stay-2852149-Jun2016/,"AS THE STRUGGLE to understand the Brexit vote continues, everyone wants to know why “they” voted to leave.
The poor and the dispossessed of the English midlands, battered by decades of deindustrialisation and austerity, finally revolted. They expressed their discontent by focusing on immigration, which “we” all know isn’t a ”real” issue, and using that as an emotional wedge they voted against their own self-interest.
The less well-off turn out yet again to be their own worst enemy and “we”, the well-off and educated, must seek to understand why they did it.
The great virtue of this approach is that it lets the rest of the population off the hook and supresses a question of equal importance, namely why did 48% of the British population vote to Remain?
Problems with the EU
Currently the EU has little to recommend it. It has become a damaged and morally bankrupt institution. Whatever about the values that originally gave it purpose, it does not embody it them any more.
Two issues in particular show this. One is the manner in which it ensured that the poor paid the costs of the reckless banking institutions during the crash.
The other is the manner in which it has tried to suppress the movement of refugees that many of the EU countries created through their ill-considered foreign policies in North Africa and Syria.
Petros Giannakouris / Press AssociationPetros Giannakouris / Press Association / Press Association
It could be argued that the EU is salvagable and that is a reason to vote for it. But there is little indication that this is the case. I haven’t read anything in the pronouncements of Jean-Claude Juncker that show he even understands the problem.
So why did the educated middle class voted to stay in? Most likely they were misled by the media experts, think tanks, and politicians. They were the prisoners of dead institutions, dead sources of information and dilapidated habits of thought.
Traditional media is dead
The first dead institution is the traditional media. The main ones wanted the UK to stay, though there were splits in the Tory press reflecting the divisions in the Tory Party.

The Sun predictably enough was for Leave. The Mail group split, with the Daily Mail supporting Leave, and the Mail on Sunday supporting Remain. The Times split too, with the London Times, perhaps surprisingly, supporting Remain, and the Sunday Times supporting the Leave campaign.
What was common to both media camps however was the belief that their endorsements were important and could make a difference.
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
But what the media haven’t figured out yet is that we now live in an age of post media politics. Most people no longer get their information from the media, if they ever did, and for the most part they do not trust or believe what they read.
The problem is that “they” and “we” haven’t realised this yet. The young have moved to so-called social media as sources of information and political opinions. The older and less educated have simply detached from the public sphere and rely for their information on the informal networks of family, friends and the local pub.
Misleading experts
There is a similar problem with “experts”. The Leave vote increased in direct proportion to the pronouncements of “experts” urging them to stay in, whether this was the Bank of England, the economists writing in newspapers, the stockbrokers and other financial soothsayers, or the various London based think tanks.
Increasingly over the decades the influence of experts has waned. It was dealt a final deathblow with the 2008 meltdown, something which none of them had predicted.
The pronouncements and predictions of stockbrokers, banks and academic economists now belong in the same dustbin of history to which theories about the earth being flat or the infallibility of the Cork County Board have been consigned. The problem is that they haven’t realised it yet.
Lack of faith in institutions
The final factor is the way “we” respond to politicians who are off the dominant message. People like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump have become the object of satire and it makes “us” feel good. “We” think laughing at them is politically sophisticated but if they are so stupid compared to us, why did they win the debate?
The Brexit victory is a crisis of legitimacy, but not in the way that it is being presented. A majority of the UK population have shown distrust of the dominant institutions of society that we previously could rely on. This is not their problem but a problem for the institutions themselves.
We in Ireland have the same problem. We, like the UK, just haven’t realised it yet.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/reintroduction-of-border-northern-ireland-peace-process-2836626-Jun2016/,"IN THE COMING days the UK will make its decision on EU membership. If the UK does decide to leave, there is a real prospect of the re-introduction of customs barriers along the border between the North and South of Ireland, a feature that existed from 1923 until the enactment of the EU Single Market in 1993.
Customs barriers were introduced by the Irish Free State government in 1923 in a bid to achieve fiscal independence from Britain and to generate revenue for the exchequer.
For this fiscal independence to be enforced successfully, it was ‘necessary to surround the Free State with a complete Customs ring’. This posed little problems for goods coming in and out of the main ports. It was the ‘land frontier’ (the boundary between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State meandering some 270 miles from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle) that gave rise to most of the complications.
Pending the findings of the Boundary Commission, the Free State government decided to impose a ‘temporary frontier’ along the boundary line. This ‘temporary frontier’ would last for almost 70 years.
The customs barrier
The decision to introduce customs barriers was announced in late February 1923 to be enacted just weeks later, on April 1st, leaving very little time for people and businesses to prepare.
In practical terms, the importing and exporting of merchandise (other than farm produce) across the border was prohibited except through designated routes and at designated times.

People wishing to move merchandise across the border had to submit a carrier’s report to customs officials where the actual goods were tracked against the documented amount and the relevant fees were then gathered.
Although there was free movement of people across the border, those who crossed had their person and personal effects examined to prevent smuggling.
Reaction
There was widespread disapproval of the decision North and South, particularly from those closest to the border. Business groups such as the Chambers of Commerce and the Dublin Mercantile Association vehemently opposed the decision, calling it a ‘suicidal policy’, claiming it would lead to dire economic consequences.

One Dundalk distillery put all of its 150 employees on notice, their employment to be terminated on April 1st unless the customs taxes proposed were modified.
It was generally felt that the new customs barrier would lead to an increased cost of living for consumers, considerable confusion and lengthy delays in the handling of traffic.
Consequences
As well as being April Fool’s Day, April 1st in 1923 was also Easter Sunday. Traffic was light, and little disruption was caused by the new measures. Once the Easter break was over, the real effects of the customs barrier began to be realised.
The new arrangement led to increased congestion at ports and border controls, with goods awaiting clearance, leading to heavy losses and disruption to businesses. It did result in the closure of some border companies reliant on cross-border trade.
The consequences of the new measures were most keenly felt by the border counties, Donegal economically cut-off from Derry, Down from Louth. Although both jurisdictions opted for a relatively open border, with no barbed-wire entanglement to seal the frontier, it severely curtailed the movements of residents along the border.
Railway services suffered considerable disruptions with some lines zigzagging the border on numerous occasions. Customs examinations were expected for each crossing. A train running from Clones to Cavan crossing the border six times in eight miles.
Common-sense soon prevailed and it was decided to curb the examinations to just the first point of entry beyond the border.

Lasting impact
Arguably, the greatest impact the introduction of the customs barrier had was to cement partition. Up to this point, partition was seen by many as just an administrative burden – it hardly impacted on the daily lives of people. The introduction of customs barriers made it tangible, made it real.
Movement and trade were now curtailed across the border, impeding long established economic and social ties. It formalised the border, making it easy for the Boundary Commission to retain the status quo in 1925.
The dilemma of re-introducing physical border controls is a real possibility if the UK does decide to leave the EU. It may have similar repercussions to the original customs barrier of 1923 – detrimentally impacting on trade, highlighting the separateness of the North to the South, and re-introducing physical and mental barriers, and with it potentially destabilising the peace process.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-controls-north-south-eu-2709076-Apr2016/,"CUSTOM CONTROLS BETWEEN the North and the South of Ireland would need to be re-established were a Brexit to go ahead, UK government papers have shown.
In the documents it is stated that the return of the controls would be “necessary” if the UK leaves the EU Customs Union.
They also state that it is “not clear” that the common travel area between the UK and Ireland would continue if both countries were not EU member states.
What does it say this?
Responding to a query fromTheJournal.ie,the British Home Office pointed to two documents:one outlining how the UKwould withdraw from the EU andthe otherdetailing how it would act outside of it.
The document on the process for withdrawing states that “it would be necessary to impose customs checks on the movement of goods across the border”.
It also notes that there would be changes to how structural funding is administered if the UK was to move outside the EU.
In the other document – looking at how the UK would operate outside of the EU – questions are raised about the continuation of the common travel area between the two countries.

Questions over free movement
This follows speculation from figures on both side of the debate on whether or not the return of a border would be necessary.
Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr show last week, former British chancellor in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet Nigel Lawson – chairman of the Vote Leave campaign – said that checks would be needed to prevent illegal immigration.
He did clarify that these checks would not be in place to stop “genuine Irish” from entering the United Kingdom.
This was followed by the junior minister in the Department of Justice Dominic Raab – also campaigning for an out vote – telling Sky News’s Dermot Murnaghan that it wouldn’t make sense for Britain to leave a “back door” open should a Out vote go through.
Vote Leave campaigners Theresa Villiers and Boris JohnsonNiall Carson / PA WireNiall Carson / PA Wire / PA Wire
Although Raab and Lawson are significant voices in the debate, more senior figures on the Vote Leave side have contradicted their assertion that border checks would need to be reintroduced.
Conservative Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, a Vote Leave campaigner herself, told theFinancial Timessaid that Lawson “made a mistake” and the border would remain as “free flowing” as it is today.
Prominent leave campaigner Boris Johnson also said in February that border arrangements at the Northern Irish border would remain unchangedwere Britain to leave the EU.

This week, Ibec called forurgent actionto address “competitive pressures” brought about by the UK’s momentous decision to leave the EU.
Ibec are seeking, among other measures, an “intense” focus from government on competitiveness in terms of labour costs and theminimum wage– plus tax cuts for multinationals.

The call for urgent action by the employers group followed the drop in the value of the UK pound, which makes Irish exports to Britainmore expensivefor 65% of Irish businesses.
Carr, a Labour councillor in the Cabra/Finglas ward of northwest Dublin, said:
Carr, who is also an official in the union Siptu, accused Ibec of using “weasel words” such as “competitiveness issues” to hide what he said is really a call for attacking the livelihoods of working people.
“It is regrettable that Ibec has made such a kneejerk attempt to exploit what is a difficult political and economic issue to further its failed agenda of attempting to undermine the benefits of our economic recovery for workers, particularly those on low pay.”
Carr also accused Ibec of focusing only on the negatives to Brexit, and said they should concentrate on helping businesses take advantage of opportunities, “rather than merely launching another attack on workers…”

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-controls-ireland-3018480-Oct2016/,"THE UK WILL look to have Ireland strengthen immigration controls at its ports and entry points to avoid the reintroduction of a ‘hard border’,according to The Guardian.
Speaking to the newspaper, the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said that the UK government wants to maintain the common travel area (CTA) between Ireland and the UK in the wake of the Brexit vote.
It would mean, he argues, that external borders would need to be strengthened to avoid illegal migration into the UK.
These tougher measures at ports and entry points would include those in Ireland if the CTA is maintained. In effect, UK border control policies could be implemented at Irish entry points.
“We have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government,” Brokenshire said according to the newspaper.
The toughening of controls at Ireland’s entry points would be used as a way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. People on both sides of the border have expressed concerns about this possibility for both economic and stability reasons.
“We are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA,” Brokenshire said.
Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan is quoted in the article as saying that the sharing of intelligence between Ireland and the UK is vital to counter “the threat of illegal immigration through the border.”

Jumping ship?
Separately, data from jobs website Indeed has shown that the number of British residents searching for jobs in Ireland has jumped since the Brexit referendum.
Searches for jobs across the EU from the UK were 7% higher on average in the 100 days after the referendum than prior to the poll.
The strongest interest was in jobs in Ireland, where there was a 20% increase in searches after the UK’s vote to leave the European Union in June.
Indeed research initially showed that job searches from the UK to Ireland on 24 June, the day the result of the referendum was announced, were 2.5 times higher than the average in the days before the vote.

There was also a similar pattern among Britons looking for jobs in Australia. Searches for jobs in the antipodean nation were 13% higher in the 100 days following the referendum than before, with the average matching the 13% surge seen in the vote’s aftermath.
There has also been a steady increase in searches from the UK for jobs in Canada, Germany and the EU as a whole.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-irish-government-taking-investors-3054050-Oct2016/,"A FIANNA FÁIL TD has refuted comments made by Arlene Foster that the Irish government seeks to ‘poach’ investors from Northern Ireland.
Foster, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, was speaking today about opportunities post-Brexit when she suggested that the Irish government ‘talks down’ the North’s economy and takes its potential investors.
In her first speech as Democratic Unionist Party leader, Foster had some strong words for Enda Kenny’s government:
“Their representatives are sent out around the world to talk down our economy, and to attempt to poach our investors.”
The chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, Brendan Smith has reacted to the comments made by Foster.

“While, of course, we need to be aware that the First Minister was speaking to her political base, it is absolutely incorrect for her to suggest that the Irish government talks down the Northern Irish economy, and that Ireland seeks to poach investors away from Northern Ireland.”
“When I was Minister for Agriculture and Food, every opportunity to speak about the all-island economy was taken, and to attract investors to the island.”
“For years, I have called for greater and deeper cooperation between the industrial development agencies in both jurisdictions to promote all-island economic development.”
“I would hope that the First Minister would join with all of us who want increased cooperation to maximise foreign investment on the island, and especially in the border region.”
“A single all-Ireland industrial promotion agency would have huge benefits for the entire island. We need to build further to realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement.
The First Minister can show leadership on this matter, and work with the Irish government to make this a reality. I hope she takes the opportunity,” concluded Smith.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-does-uk-have-to-leave-eu-2850114-Jun2016/,"AS THE FALLOUT from the UK’s decision to leave the EU continues to reverberate across the world, Remain supporters are desperately asking: can a Brexit be averted?
Theories are abounding that Britain’s parliament, a future prime minister or even a second referendum could annul the Brexit vote.
Prime Minister David Cameron ruled such a move out in a parliamentary debate yesterday, telling MPs: “This house shouldn’t block the will of the British people”.
But that didn’t stop some MPs from posing the question and the issue is being widely debated among voters who are still hoping to avert Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Isabel InfantesIsabel Infantes
1. Is there anything to be said for saying another mass?
As some Leave voters publicly voiced their ‘Bregret’ at voting for a Brexit, there were calls for a second referendum to be held.
A petition calling for a new referendum had garnered more than 3.8 million signatures by yesterday.
The New York Timeseven cited Ireland’s twice-held referendums on the Nice Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty as a possible means for the UK to hold another referendum.
However,a ComRes poll on Sundayfound that just 1% of British people who voted to leave are unhappy with their decision.
And analysts have ruled out any new vote right now.
“There is a very powerful principle in British democracy that one vote is enough,” said Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics.
“It would be very unwise to hold another referendum, it’s not going to happen,” he said.
However, a general election could change things.
University of Edinburgh professor Neil Walker said “a fundamental difference of course” could be triggered “if a Brexit government collapsed overnight”.
Top Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson himself earlier this year was widely interpreted as saying that the referendum might not necessarily mean Britain was out.
Yui MokYui Mok
He said that only by voting to leave would the country “get the change we need” in the EU.
Johnson later retracted the statement and said: “Out is out”.
2. Parliament could still vote on it
According to some lawyers and MPs, parliament must still vote on a bill to allow the UK to leave the EU.
David Lammy of the Labour party said the referendum was “an advisory, non-binding referendum”.
“We do not have to do this,” Lammy said. “We can stop this madness and bring this nightmare to an end through a vote in parliament. Our sovereign parliament needs to now vote on whether we should exit the EU.”

Frank VinciniFrank Vincini
Leading lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC was also of the opinion that “it’s not over yet”.
“Laws which passed last year to set up the referendum said nothing about the result being binding or having any legal force,” he said.
3.  Don’t trigger Article 50
The referendum is not legally binding and the process of leaving does not begin until the prime minister officially invokes Article 50 of the EU’s governing treaty. So in theory, the future prime minister could opt not to push the big red button on a Brexit.
A senior European diplomat said over the weekend that their personal view was that London “will never” invoke Article 50.

Cameron has already delayed the process by refusing to invoke the article himself.
He said that formally starting EU withdrawal talks will be a matter for his replacement as prime minister, but none of the victorious Brexit campaign leaders appear in any rush to start what will no doubt be lengthy, complex and painful negotiations.
Johnson – one of his most likely successors – said that changes “will not come in any great rush” while Cameron’s other possible successor, Theresa May, opposes leaving the union.
Chancellor George Osborne has said that only the UK can trigger Article 50.
However, a prime minister who refuses to invoke Article 50 will be going against the expressed wishes of the 17.4 million Britons who voted to leave.
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
European leaders have also been quick to call for Article 50 to be invoked quickly.
Martin Schultz, the president of the European Parliament, told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag: “We expect the British government to deliver now.”
“The summit on Tuesday is the appropriate moment to do so,” he said.
French President Francois Hollande also said Britain should “not waste time”.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was not in favour of pushing for a speedy withdrawal.
“It shouldn’t take forever, that’s right, but I would not fight for a short timeframe,” she said.
4. Scottish veto
Last April, the House of Lords said any decision to exit the EU would have to be approved by the parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
While Wales supported a Brexit and Northern Ireland’s leading party, the DUP, supported the Leave campaign, Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested her parliament could withhold consent.
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
Sturgeon told the BBCover the weekend that she would “of course” ask Scottish MPs to refuse to give their legislative consent in light of Scotland’s 62% vote to remain in the EU.
However, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, insisted the Edinburgh parliament does not have the authority to block Brexit.
“I suspect that the UK government will take a very different view on that and we’ll have to see where that discussion ends up,” Davidson said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/whos-going-to-leave-the-eu-2949050-Aug2016/,"When Britain voted to leave the European Union in June of this year, it took us all by surprise.
That marginal majority has been the topic of many a debate; around the future of Europe, its influence on recovering economies, and of course, the impact it will have on Ireland’s links with Britain.
But what are other countries’ views in the aftermath of Brexit, and how strong is the will for a vote on leaving the European Union?
Althoughfigures collected by the PewResearchCentersuggests that an overwhelming majority of EU citizens believe that Brexit will be a bad thing, when you delve a little deeper into their opinion of the EU, there is clear uncertainty around its future.

France
In many ways, France and Britain are very similar: both are involved in similar missions abroad, both are hugely influential in the EU, and both have a high number of Eurosceptic politicians.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right Front National party, has become even more vocal in her calls for a French referendum on EU membership – even more so now since the “promised apocalypse” that economists and politicians predicted as a result of Brexit, “has not come”:
L'apocalypse promise n'est pas venue...MLP#Brexithttps://t.co/WoPfdUUD6A— Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel)August 22, 2016Marine Le Pen/ Twitter
L'apocalypse promise n'est pas venue...MLP#Brexithttps://t.co/WoPfdUUD6A
It’s not just politicians from the far right who want a referendum, however.
Before Britain’s vote on EU membership, France were the country with the highest support of a Brexit result, showing that there is also an appetite among the electorate for a referendum.
Recent surveys conducted before the Brexit vote show that 52% of the French electorate are in favour of their country staying in the EU – so a referendum held on the subject would be close.
And with the country’s recent terrorist attacks and the current burkini debate, there is no doubt that immigration will be debated just as hotly as it was in the UK.

A View From the Continent ReportA View From the Continent Report
Sweden
“I see nothing negative about leaving this supranational European Union,” said Jimmie Åkesson, leader of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.
Åkesson has repeatedly called for Sweden to “become a sovereign state again” by leaving the EU, and although the majority of his party seem to show a preference of keeping its ties with Europe, this could change if the EU were to impose any new regulations that didn’t agree with the Sweden Democrats’ way of thinking.
It’s also worth noting that Åkesson’s party holds the balance of power in Stockholm; and while they hold only 20% of the electorate’s support, their party has grown hugely last year after Sweden took in a record number of asylum seekers.

Netherlands
As with Le Pen, there has been a huge surge in support for the far-right Dutch populist Geert Wilders and the Dutch Party for Freedom, which he founded and leads.
In a recent interview with Spiegel, Wilders said that the main reason for leaving the EU would be autonomy.
A poll carried out in May of this year by the Ipsos foundation found a narrow majority of the Dutch do not want the Netherlands to hold a referendum on EU membership. It also showed that if there is a vote, 64% would vote against leaving the EU.
But as the British economy evens out after Brexit, the tide may change in favour of a vote to leave.
PewResearchCenterPewResearchCenter
Although there are politicians in every EU country calling for a referendum on leaving the EU, they are almost always in a minority, and don’t represent the concerns or views of their respective electorates.
But as Europe moves on from this shock, and tries to form a path forward, countries will be scrutinising every decision made to make sure it’s the best one for them.
And if European governments and electorates disagree with future EU policies, such as the contentious free movement of people, that’s when there will be a reaction, which could lead to more results like the UK’s EU referendum.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/vincent-browne-brexit-european-union-2851248-Jun2016/,"THE EUROPEAN UNION, its elites, its hyper fans had this coming to them.
They deliberately devised a supposedly idealistic project of a united Europe, founded on the subversion of democracy across the continent – the exclusion of the meddlesome masses, on an agenda that, inevitably, was going to deepen inequality.
All the bluster of a “social Europe” was just that. It was, essentially, never about anything other than the further enrichment of the rich, right from the inception of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951.
One of the “visionary” founders of the European project, Robert Schuman said that European Coal and Steel Community was “to make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible” – and he may have believed that.
But what became of it was a huge cartel that enriched the shareholders and managers of the coal and steel industries. And so it has continued ever since.
The Euro project has progressed by similar deceptions.
Lisbon problems
Just recall the machinations that underpinned the infamous Lisbon Treaty. In its original form, it was a new Constitution for Europe to replace and extend the then existing European Treaties.
It was agreed among the Member States in October 2004 and went for ratification among them.
Some such states, including Ireland, had to ratify the Constitution via referenda (incidentally, Tony Blair promised a referendum in the UK on the Constitution).
The French and Dutch people decisively rejected the Constitution in July 2005, after which the Constitution project was abandoned.
A “period of reflection” was undertaken.
Then, deception
That reflection led to a decision effectively to deceive the people of Europe and have the essence of the Constitution ratified, without resorting to annoying referenda – except in Ireland.
This was what became the Lisbon Treaty, drafted in such a way as to make it indecipherable to the mass of people throughout Europe.
Then when Ireland voted against it again – thereby scuttling the project once more, for the Treaty required ratification by all member states – remember what happened?
Ireland was required to vote again, under the guise of significant changes to the Treaty (a lie) and under the threat of expulsion or marginalisation from the EU if the Irish people didn’t comply (another lie).
We wilted and approved.
Ironically, had we refused again to approve that Treaty, it might not have been possible for the UK to leave the EU for there was no mechanism to do so until the Lisbon Treaty came along.

Subverting democracy
Incidentally, our own Supreme Court ordained in the caseCrotty v An Taoiseachin 1987 that all changes to EU Treaties required the consent of the Irish people in a referendum, for such changes amounted to changes in our own Constitution.
This case had been opposed vigorously by the then Irish government and by our domestic elites who argued that, essentially, the Irish people were too thick to comprehend the subtleties of EU Treaty changes, just as people now argue that the British people were too thick to comprehend the consequence of withdrawal from the EU – precisely the arguments that were proffered in opposition to universal suffrage.
Bit by bit, the European project has subverted democracy by overtly and covertly drawing power from Member States to the centre – most notably via the Maastricht Treaty which led to the creation of a single currency which seemed so sensible at the time.
The ECB
But at a cost, unsuspected by most of us, for it deprived us of control over monetary policy - ultimately over budgetary policy – and created a Leviathan in the form of the democracy-free-zone, the European Central Bank (ECB).
The promises that an “independent” European Commission would fairly reflect the interests of all Member States, including the minnows, and that a further empowered European Parliament would give a modicum of democratic oxygen to the EU were treated as nought when the crisis broke.
Did anyone even refer to the European Parliament during the years of the bail-outs and did anybody bother what the Europeans Commission thought?
Europe openly became the plaything of the Germans and their creation, the ECB.
Remember how Angela Merkel, with her then sidekick Nicholas Sarkozy, got rid of the Prime Ministers of two Member States, Greece and Italy?
Remember when we were brow-beaten into absorbing the €72 billion bank debt for which we had no responsibility or ownership?
Remember the bomb going off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt or was that another delusion of Michael Noonan?
And as we agitatedly wring our hands over Brexit, the Germans and their allies are engaged in devising yet another ruse – a “more flexible Europe” – an EU where they and a few other sidekicks would openly run the show and the rest of us would be spectators (actually not much different to how it is now).
No gumption
There is a chance of reversing much of this if Ireland and a few other States had the gumption to do so but be assured there will be no gumption coming from the Irish side, at least.
The Irish side did not even manage to come up with a contingency plan until Brexit happened – claims to the contrary by Enda Kenny and Michael Noonan that they had been working on this since the British election a year ago have been shattered by Brendan Howlin’s casual assurance that he knew nothing of this even though until 6 May he was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
What we should want
There are a few things we could insist upon: an end to the Euro and the European Central Bank, the replacement of the Council of Ministers with a Senate comprised of two Senators, democratically elected from each Member State (this was a proposal of John Bruton of some years ago before he was colonised).
But there is no chance of that or of anything other than the further consolidation of the power of Germany and the ECB and the further enrichment of the already rich.

ALMOST A THIRD of engineers in Ireland and the UK say their business has already been impacted by Brexit, according to a new survey.
A poll of 3,000 Engineers Ireland members found that while most are experiencing a slowdown in business, only one in ten has plans to fire staff, contractors or suppliers as a result.
However, a quarter said they have changed their plans for hiring or investment as the sector grapples with the economic fallout of the 23 June referendum.
Engineers Ireland director general Caroline Spillane said: “The United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union colours every aspect of Ireland’s economic future, and the associated uncertainty and unease is already affecting the business activity of our members across the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”

Infrastructure projects
Two-in-five said they were proactively changing their business strategy and most agreed that the full impact of Brexit will not be felt for a number of years.
Almost 40% said they had paused or unfavorably altered commercial deals in anticipation of the fallout.
As well as calling on Taoiseach Enda Kenny to make a contingency plan for Ireland, Spillane called on the government to ensure projects like the Dublin to Derry road upgrade were not delayed.
Earlier this year, Spillane, along with the heads of the Association of Consulting Engineers Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, warned there will be a lack of engineering and surveying graduates to meet demand in the construction sector in the coming years.
Spillane said only 38 civil engineers will graduate in Ireland in 2017 and urged more women to pursue engineering in order to deal with the shortage.

The game will include a number of scenarios, from more extreme restrictions on transfers and player movement to less stringent circumstances.
The game’s director, Miles Jacobson, said inan interview with the BBCthat the decision to incorporate Britain’s vote on EU membership into the game was taken in the immediate aftermath of the historic election result last June.

“I started working on the feature on the Saturday morning after the vote,” he said. “I was trying to work out how it would affect my business and the sport that I love.
“The fact that this is going to happen in the next few years means that it really has to be in the game.”
There has been much speculation on how Brexit will impact the Premier League.
Tory peer and West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady has warned that it could have a“devastating” effect on British clubs, though former FA chairman Greg Dyke believes it could result in more young English footballersgetting a chance to play at a high level.
Speaking to the BBC, Jacobson also discussed Football Manager’s employment of 1300 scouts in 51 countries, which he claims is considerably more than Premier League clubs such as Arsenal and Manchester United employ.

On 23 June, the UK will vote on their EU membership, as promised by David Cameron back in 2013.
With only 34 days to go, The Economist’spoll trackershows that 41% intend to vote to remain in the EU, 40% vote to leave and 14% say they don’t know.
The main worries for Ireland – according to business groups – are a loss of trade between Britain and Ireland and an increase of trade barriers for small to medium enterprises.
In May 2015 and in April of this year, IBEC issued its own warnings of the potential risks facing Ireland. Teagasc also voiced concern for the agri-food sector in areport.
Speaking today onMorning Ireland, Professor John McHale, chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, said that a 1% UK loss of GDP would mean a 0.3% loss for Ireland’s GDP.
He added that there would be some benefits for Ireland if Britain did leave the EU, such as Ireland attracting foreign direct investment, but that these benefits would be “small relative to the losses”.
Economist David McWilliams maintains inhis blogthat we could “win big” if the UK opts for a Brexit. He explains that if Britain leaves, some of the investment currently going there will be diverted to Ireland because of attractive tax rates and full access to the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-roaming-charges-2865967-Jul2016/,"THE BANE OF many travellers’ lives is roaming charges – but thankfully the EU has started taking steps in recent years to lower the cost of using your mobile phone while abroad in Europe.
However, the Brexit referendum has left some people wondering what’s going to happen to roaming charges when the UK leaves the EU.
Today, MEP Deirdre Clune said that the “huge uncertainty” over Brexit and what it will mean for consumers extends to roaming.
“Roaming charges are due to beabolished across Europe next year, 2017, and that’s being seen as good for the consumer, good for travellers, good for tourism and another positive sign of how Europe has worked to ensure there are no barriers across Europe,” she said.
But she asked: “If the UK exits Europe as they decided to do, what will that mean for Irish travellers travelling to the UK or across to Europe? Will they have higher charges – will they have to pay higher charges for roaming?”
Advertisement
Answering her own question, Clune said that it is “likely” to mean higher charges, given “that the UK will be outside Europe and the companies there will be free to do what they like; they are not subject to EU rules or EU regulation”.
The MEP said that this uncertainty over charges could also apply to other consumerissuesonce the UK has left Europe.
So far, the UK hasn’t made any concrete promises about what will happen with roaming charges. Once outside of the EU, companies won’t be subject to regulation – but that doesn’t mean they will necessarily want to impose higher roaming charges either.
As with most of the post-Brexit outcomes, the situation is far from clear.
As for the attitude amongst her fellow MEPs toward Bexit, Clune said: “At the beginning there was shock… now people want certainty, want article 50 triggered as soon as possible.”
She said that once the UK has its new prime minister settled in, it is time to trigger the article that will enable it to leave the EU.
The process needs to get underway to “eliminate a lot of the uncertainty that is there”, said Clune.

ALL WEEK, YOU will have seen his face.
On TV, in papers and on the web, Nigel Farage is ubiquitous, it seems. Having seen his dream of an EU without Britain become a reality, Farage is the cat that got the cream.
His abrasive, sardonic contributions to Tuesday’s plenary session in the European Parliament – during which he told MEPs none of them “had ever done a real job” – ruffled the feathers of members of parliament who booed him.
It is a far cry from a year ago when Farage resigned as leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), before being convinced to stay on.
UKIP had taken a single seat in the UK general election and had been completely marginalised after a strong European and local election result a year previously.
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
That resignation came on the back of Farage losing his race in the general election, the seventh time he has failed to be elected to the House of Commons in six different constituencies.
While many who voted leave did so for an array of concerns to do with the anti-democratic nature of the EU, its size and bureaucracy, Farage managed to wrest the narrative away from those issues and bring it to his main focus: immigration.
Dog whistle
LBC/ YouTube
The vote to leave the European Union is a culmination of 25 years of campaigning for the leader of UKIP.
A surge in support for Farage’s anti-immigration, anti-establishment party helped force Cameron into calling the referendum three years ago. The man who had said he would “be concerned” if a group of Romanians moved next door to him proved such an attraction to many Eurosceptic MPs that Cameron was forced to head him off.
It was a political gamble which backfired and has made Farage an international political figure.
But the 17-year MEP was widely condemned by fellow members of the Brexit camp for his relentless focus on how leaving the EU would help cut levels of immigration to Britain.

He faced particular criticism over a campaign poster of queueing refugees with the headline “Breaking Point” unveiled on the same day as the murder of pro-EU Labour lawmaker Jo Cox. It was also compared to a Nazi propaganda film.
Charisma
AP / Press Association ImagesAP / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
The charismatic 53-year-old, who once compared ex-European Council president Herman Van Rompuy to a “damp rag”, led UKIP to victory in 2014′s European elections and third place in opinion polls before last May’s vote.
Born in 1964 to an affluent family in Kent, southeast England, his father was a stockbroker and an alcoholic and his parents divorced when he was five.
He was educated at one of England’s top private schools, Dulwich College, where he says his headmaster saw him as “bloody-minded and difficult”.
Rather than attending university, he followed his father into the City of London, where he says that 12-hour boozy lunches were the norm.
Having supported the Conservatives since his schooldays, he joined UKIP in 1993 as a founder member and was elected to the European Parliament in 1999, aged 35.
Farage became UKIP’s leader in 2006 before standing down in 2009 and then being re-elected the following year, when UKIP’s ascent really began.
He has survived a string of personal misfortunes – a serious car accident, testicular cancer and a plane crash as he was campaigning during the 2010 general election.
Despite his scepticism on the European Union, Farage is married to a German woman and has four children.

Though privately-educated, a former commodities trader and a politician since he was 35, Farage has an uncanny ability to be seen as a “man of the people”.
A TNS survey in January found almost half think that Nigel Farage is “just saying what people think” (43% agree vs 29% disagree).
It is that ability which effectively pushed Cameron to call the referendum, something Farage takes “100% credit for”.
The next step is for Farage, and UKIP, to take more than one seat in parliament.

As the no-frills airline announced a slight increase in first quarter earnings, CEO Michael O’Leary described the UK’s Brexit vote as “both a surprise and a disappointment”.
O’Leary had publicly backed the Remain campaign and had said that a vote toleave would be “absolutely crazy”.
Speaking today, he’s now said that he expects the fallout to effect the airline market.
“We expect this result will lead to a considerable period of political and economic uncertainty in both the UK and the EU,” O’Leary said.
“This uncertainty will be damaging to economic growth and consumer confidence.”

AFTER MONTHS WITHOUT a breakthrough, David Cameron will finally give more details on Tuesday of what reforms he wants for Britain to stay in the European Union before a looming referendum.
Nearly three years after promising a vote before the end of 2017, the British prime minister will deliver his shopping list in a letter to EU president Donald Tusk, which is expected to be made public.
The letter comes ahead of a crunch European summit in Brussels next month and amid hopes that the British referendum on whether to remain an EU member state can be held next year.
Cameron will warn in a speech Tuesday that if Britain’s concerns are met with a “deaf ear”, he will have to “think again about whether this European Union is right for us.”
“I rule nothing out,” he will add, according to pre-released extracts.
His Europe Minister David Lidington told journalists last week not to expect too much new detail in the letter, adding it would be “ambitious” to hope for a deal at December’s summit.

Four key areas
In recent weeks, European partners have put increasing pressure on Cameron to lay out in more detail what kind of reforms he wants.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC that some of the reforms “will require changes to the body of law, to the treaties and secondary legislation,” although the prime minister has accepted that this is highly unlikely before the referendum is held.
Cameron has long identified four broad areas where he wants to see reforms — improving competitiveness, greater “fairness” between eurozone and non-eurozone nations, sovereignty issues including an exemption from the aspiration of ever-closer union and making it harder for migrants to claim benefits.
When Cameron’s de facto deputy and possible successor, finance minister George Osborne, gave a speech in Berlin last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel conceded that Britain had “justified concerns” and stressed she wanted to help prevent a Brexit.
Experts say there is room for compromise in all areas except migration, where Cameron wants to stop EU migrants, including those in work, from claiming certain state benefits for four years after arriving in Britain.
Today’s Sunday Times suggests that Taoiseach Enda Kenny will support many of Cameron’s demands.","2.33pm, 8 Nov 2015",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/european-union-brexit-2716619-Apr2016/,"WHEN IT WAS established first as the European Coal and Steel Community, the goal of the nascent European federalists was clear: Establish the type of close economic bonds that would make a war on the continent unlikely if not impossible in the future.
It was a highly practical response to the problem of European nationalism, implemented at a time when many major cities on the continent were still in ruin. The last refugee camps for displaced persons in Europe were only closed by 1960, three years after the Treaty of Rome that established the European Economic Area.
Trade, access to natural resources and antagonistic co-dependencies played major underlying roles in driving the two world wars. As we learned in Ireland once our revolutionaries became governors, fighting your near neighbours with tariffs is an excellent way to hobble an economy.
A key driver of German expansionism throughout the early 20th century was the desire to attain autarky, or total self sufficiency, for the resource-poor nation. The spectre of trade wars and the fears of economic starvation played a major role in driving the wars that flattened the continent in the 31 years between 1914 and 1945.
Security
As a free trade area the EU and its predecessor organisations has been an unqualified success.
Half a billion people live within an economic zone where barriers to doing business have eroded. Economies and businesses are like racing boats; and trade restrictions, bureaucracy, tariffs and differing regulations are like barnacles on the underside slowing them down.
American taxpayers can claim a lot of the credit for European peace and security through their contributions to defence during the Cold War; but the EU has effectively silenced any talk of conflict among its member nations.
We take this for granted, forgetting that veterans of most major European conflicts were alive to witness the next one due to their frequency: Veterans of the Seven Years War were still knocking about in time to see the start of the Napoleonic Wars.
Participants in that lived to see the Franco-Prussian War, which led on to the First World War; many of whose veterans took up arms again for the Second.
There can be no doubting the role the EU has played in changing this narrative as many of the veterans of the Second World War die without having seen a major war between European powers in their further lifetimes.
But when we come to consider the topic of Brexit, the first time a nation proposes and seems close to departing the club, we are not here to contemplate the principle of European peace and prosperity.
Bureaucracy
Peace between major nations and free trade is no more in question between European countries than the notion of a trade war, let alone actual one, with the United States of America or anywhere else.
What the British are being asked to consider is if the European Union that exists today is one that they want to live as a part of. It is a question that all European citizens should be allowed to ask themselves, and one that most governments are afraid to give voice to.
The EU has metamorphosed into a massive, overbearing and overreaching bureaucracy. It talks about subsidiarity – the concept that decisions should be made at as local a level as is practicable – whilst centralising as many powers to its institutions as it can lay its hands on.

The several hundred members of the European Parliament, their staffs, committees, attendant civil servants and commission departments have yet to discover something they wouldn’t like to oversee and regulate.
We used to have 15 commissioners, who ran 15 departments of the EU government. We now have 28. Why? Because we went from having 15 member states to 28, and everyone has to get a job.
New departments with makey-uppey titles and remits find work for themselves, as do the parliamentary committees that come into their orbit. This couldn’t be further from the idea of a barnacle-free racing boat of a free trade zone.
Recognising that the bureaucracy has become too onerous, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, appointed Frans Timmermans as a vice-president whom he mandated to cut down excessive complexity. Timmermans’ job title has 16 words in it.
Change
Eurocrats tell us that if only the British vote to remain within the EU, things can get better.
The EU can become more democratically accountable and be more receptive to the needs of the citizenry, who have been moving away from the idea of ever closer union for many years now even before the economic crisis.
Eurocrats are incapable of real change. The exist in a bubble and their momentum will drag us in the direction that suits them forever more.
European citizens, beginning with the British, need to deliver a death knell to the European Union. Not, I must stress, to the idea of European free trade and economic integration.
We do not need 750 parliamentarians and 28 commissioners and armies upon armies of bureaucrats looking for things to regulate in order to have that. There is a simpler way, which committed Eurocrats can’t even bend their minds to contemplate.
To them, the British are mad to consider leaving. Simple as. They don’t stop to question why the British, or anyone else, might have a poor impression of the European project.
Reversing the integration that has happened will be painful. There will be economic losses in the short run.
Then again, countries like Ireland have already suffered ruinous losses for being inside the club; when we had inappropriate interest rates in the run up to 2008 and then were unable to devalue our currency afterwards.
We now have interest rates that are too low and will continue to have the same practical problems so long as we are too close to the fire, rather than sitting back at a comfortable distance.
European free trade has helped secure peace on the continent. The marginal additional benefit derived from the army of mandarins that has floated up in the wake of the EU is questionable. The erosion of democratic legitimacy across the EU is unquestionable.
We need to turn the clock back, just a bit. Not to a time of jingoistic self interest; but to a time of free trade ideals, when we were good neighbours rather than pretending to be close family members.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT does not want academics from the London School of Economics who do not have UK passports to give Brexit briefings to officials, a spokesman for the university told AFP today.
LSE staff have been briefing the foreign ministry on scenarios around leaving the European Union but the famous institution has now been told that submissions from non-British staff will not be accepted.
“Some of our experts who were contributing will not be able to contribute because they are not UK nationals,” a spokesman for the LSE said after a complaint by Assistant Professor Sara Hagemann.
The Foreign Office did not deny the report, saying in a statement: “It has always been the case that anyone working in the FCO may require security clearance depending on the nature and duration of their work”.
But it added: “Britain is an outward-looking nation and we will continue to take advice from the best and brightest minds, regardless of nationality”.
Hagemann, who is originally from Denmark, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: “UK govt previously sought work & advice from best experts. Just told I & my colleagues no longer qualify as not UK citizens”.

Hagemann teaches at the LSE’s European Institute, which she joined in 2009. She has held research and policy positions in Brussels, Copenhagen and London, according to her biography on the LSE website.
Reports said up to nine academics could be affected.

‘National security’ issue
An internal memoposted on Twitterby LSE professor Simon Hix said: “Whilst the Foreign Office has long had a rule restricting the nationality of employees or secondees, the extension of the bar to advisory work seems to be new.
“However, it is for the Foreign Office to determine what its national security arrangements are, and their legality, not for us,” read the memo.
The LSE internal memo
The university said in a statement that its academics were regularly called upon to advise the government.
“We believe our academics, including non-UK nationals, have hugely valuable expertise, which will be vital in this time of uncertainty around the UK’s relationship with Europe and the rest of the world,” it said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will initiate talks on leaving the European Union by the end of March 2017, following the shock referendum in June in which Britain voted to end its 43-year membership.
One of the key issues in the referendum campaign was the impact of immigration on British society and May has said she plans to clamp down on EU arrivals.
A government proposal to make businesses publish lists of foreign workers sparked fierce controversy this week after interior minister Amber Rudd revealed it at the Conservative party conference.
The LSE opened in 1895 and has become famous as a global hub for economic and political thinking.
Its alumni include billionaire financier George Soros and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on today.
Hollywood star and UN refugee agency envoy Angelina Jolie is currently a visiting professor at the LSE.

https://www.the42.ie/david-beckham-vote-remain-2836400-Jun2016/,"DAVID BECKHAM HAS come out on the Remain side ahead of Thursday’s Brexit referendum, arguing that the great Manchester United side he played in was made better by its European influence.
“We were a better and more successful team because of a Danish goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, the leadership of an Irishman Roy Keane and the skill of a Frenchman in Eric Cantona,”Beckham wrote in a Facebook messageto almost 55 million fans.
Britain goes to the polls on Thursday morning with the latest opinion polls showing an increase in Remain support, while bookmakers are also expecting a narrow Remain win.
Here’s Beckham’s message:
I played my best years at my boyhood club, Manchester United. I grew up with a core group of young British players that included Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville Brothers. Added to that was an experienced group of older British players such as Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce and Paul Ince.
Now that team might have gone on to win trophies but we were a better and more successful team because of a Danish goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, the leadership of an Irishman Roy Keane and the skill of a Frenchman in Eric Cantona.
I was also privileged to play and live in Madrid, Milan and Paris with teammates from all around Europe and the world. Those great European cities and their passionate fans welcomed me and my family and gave us the opportunity to enjoy their unique and inspiring cultures and people.
We live in a vibrant and connected world where together as a people we are strong. For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together and not alone.
For these reasons I am voting to Remain.

Cianan Brennan/ TheJournal.ie
IT’S QUITE POSSIBLE that by this time next year the UK will have voted to leave the European Union.
The British ambassador to Ireland, Dominick Chilcott, doesn’t want that to happen but acknowledges that his country’s support for EU membership is only “wafer-thin”:
It’s the reason why David Cameron has begun his efforts to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU. Once this process is complete there will be a referendum within four to six months, which probably means in the autumn of next year.

The official UK government position is that it wants to stay in the EU subject to negotiating better terms in these four broad areas:
Three and four are widely considered the most difficult points of the upcoming talks.
But would the idea of exempting the UK from the ‘ever closer union’ principle not lead to other members demanding the same and undermine the entire European project?

No, says Chilcott:
While other major nations like France and Germany seem committed to even greater integration the UK almost stands alone in wanting less of it.
Chilcott acknowledges that this may come across as arrogant, but he wouldn’t use that word. It’s about British exceptionalism, he insists:
Cianan Brennan/ TheJournal.ie
“The UK is not really modernised by the European Union in any meaningful way,” he said.
The Irish government has been very clear in its desire for the UK to remain in the EU in recent months. This is welcomed by Chilcott particularly given the “unprecedented good cooperation” between London and Dublin.
But would ‘Brexit’ be fatal to that close Anglo-Irish bond? Chilcott says:
“You don’t know those by definition because the aim of the game is to remain in a reformed Europe and not have to go down that path.”

“This appears to be corrupt, since the company is offering discounts on the commercial rate to customers with the sole aim of ensuring that they vote and vote to remain in the European Union,” Cummings wrote.
Scotland Yard told The Guardian that it had received the complaint and that it was in the process of considering a response.

Other findings include an enthusiasm for a specific EU-US trade deal, while 69% of those polled were in favour of the controversialTTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership)agreement which is in the works.
Just 33% of Irish people think that there should be an EU army.
The poll has been commissioned by not-for-profit organisation European Movement Ireland (EMI).

EMIEMI
Speaking with regard to the poll’s findings, Noelle O’Connell of EMI said that the situation in the UK “is of huge concern”.
“In the last two years a growing number of Irish people believe that even if our nearest neighbours leave, that we should remain in the EU,” said O’Connell.
The notion of a British exit from the EU, or Brexit, has been postulated for some time now. Ireland and the UK both joined the then European Economic Community (EEC) on the same day in 1973.
One of the key campaign promises by UK prime minister David Cameron before his landslide victory in the recent election was a vow to hold a public referendum on the topic should his Conservative party emerge victorious.
Speaking previously toTheJournal.ieon the subject, professor of finance at Trinity College Brian Lucey was very dismissive of the chances of a Brexit happening.
“Look, a lot of misguided British people may want to leave Europe, but plenty of sensible British people don’t, common sense will most likely prevail,” he said.
A recent studyby UK think tankOpenEurope.orgfound that, economically at least, a UK exit from the EU would be a disaster for Ireland.
The same site also hosts a running poll on whether or not the UK should leave – the good news for us is that it still leans heavily towards the UK staying put.

STERLING SUFFERED A dizzying “flash crash” against the euro and dollar today in a computer-generated sell-off, sending Brexit shockwaves across markets.
The pound plunged more than 6% against the dollar in under ten minutes in Asian trading hours at the end of a tumultuous week of heavy losses.
The rough week for the pound comes after Prime Minister Theresa May signalled she would trigger Britain’s departure from the European Union by the end of March.
A spokesman for the Bank of England said that it was “looking into” the cause of the flash crash — a vertiginous drop in an asset’s value that can be triggered and exacerbated by automated trading systems.
Speaking Thursday, French President Francois Hollande said the EU should take a tough line with London during exit talks to prevent the break-up of the bloc.
“The value of sterling plummeted overnight as algorithmic trading programmes apparently triggered a crash,” said XTB analyst David Cheetham.

Cheetham added that a combination of trades placed by algorithms and stop-loss orders can “exacerbate the move.”

The pound fell off a cliff at about 2310 GMT last night to strike a 31-year low at $1.1841, before rebounding back above $1.24.
The euro also hit a 6.5-year-high at 94.15 pence.
‘Fat-fingered trader?’
“A lot of investors are still scratching their heads as to how and why it happened, whether it was a fat fingered trader in Tokyo, an algorithm scanning for any negative Brexit news, or just a big seller of the pound,” said analyst Alex Edwards at trading firm UKForex.
“Whatever it was, it shows us that the pound is looking very vulnerable right now.”
Approaching midday in London, the pound rowed back to $1.2368, while the euro stood at 89.99 pence.

The crash was the second-largest intra-day decline in the pound, bettered only by its precipitous 11 %slump on 24 June 24, when the shock Brexit result emerged.
After rebounding, the pound again fell sharply this week on fears of a so-called “hard Brexit” that would see Britain depart the single market, or tariff-free zone, and end free movement of people into the country.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-poll-3-2890546-Jul2016/,"ENDA KENNY AND Micheál Martin are merely playing politics when they talk about a border poll for a united Ireland, according to Martin Mansergh.
The former historian, diplomat and minister helped to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement for Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. He also previously acted as a back-channel to the republican movement under Taoiseach Albert Reynolds.
Mansergh toldTheJournal.iethat it’s a complete misrepresentation to say that aborder pollis now more viable than before the Brexit result.
Speaking aboutremarksby Enda Kenny and Micheál Martin about a possible referendum on the status of Northern Ireland, Mansergh said:
“I think you need to read those remarks…
“I think there’s a certain amount of defining, stroking and refining positions in order to not make it look as if Sinn Féin is the only party that has an interest in this.
I think the Taoiseach’s remarks were exceptionally hypothetical, Micheál Martin’s likewise.
“I think they both recognise that the conditions don’t exist [for a border poll].”
TheGood Friday Agreementalso provides for a united Ireland if a majority of people, north and south of the border, each vote in favour of it – but such a border poll would only happen if there was a clear demand from a majority north of the border.
Micheál Martin and Martin Mansergh at a Fianna Fáil ard-fheis.Rollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
Complete misrepresentation
Mansergh said it’s a complete misinterpretation to suggest aborder pollis now suddenly more viable.
“Although I don’t think Sinn Féin are misinterpreting it, I think they are using it to push an agenda for a united Ireland.
They have long wanted a border poll, fully realising it would be lost, but to set up momentum for the future – but I’m not sure it works like that to be honest.
“I also think it’s very disruptive and destabilising to get people going back into the trenches in a fundamentalist sort of way, unionism versus a united Ireland.”
Martin Mansergh and then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in 2003.Rollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
A new Good Friday Agreement?
Former TD and editor Geraldine Kennedy recentlysaidthe Good Friday Agreement hinges on the EU and would need to be renegotiated following Brexit.

Mansergh believes another agreement is necessary – but to amplify, rather than to replace the historic 1998 accord.
“I think she is overstating the role of the EU in the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.
You could say the EU aspect is involved in some of the North-South bodies, and you might have to look at aspects of that again.”
“No, I don’t take the view that the entire GFA has to be renegotiated, I think that would be unwise for a whole lots of points of view.
It was very difficult to achieve and arrive at an agreement.

Mansergh said there might be a further amplificatory agreement, similar to the St Andrew’s agreement:
But renegotiation of the whole agreement? Definitely not. Essentially, you read the agreements together.
I suppose it would be an agreement that would take account of the fact that Britain was no longer part of the EU.
He added that while the peace process is largely funded from London, there is an EU element.
“Public opinion doesn’t fully grasp the reality that British Westminster subsidies of Northern Ireland are many times over the level of subsidies from the EU.
The main subsidies from the EU, and they are mediated through the British Treasury, is the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, and I do think that will be at considerable at risk.
“Some of it may survive possibly under another name, but some of it would certainly be at risk.”

“A real opportunity has not arisen,” Mansergh said.
That’s not to suggest the situation has not evolved at all.
He said the fact that nationalists and a large minority of unionists coalesced during the Good Friday Agreement and Brexit referendum was progress, however.
“My preference certainly would be, even in the changed situation, building on that type of progress, rather than use it as an opportunity to send people scurrying back into their fundamentalist trenches.”

Physical border
Mansergh says that the vote by unionists – including the UUP – to remain in the EU had more to do with opposing a physical border.
I mean, not by any stretch of the imagination were they saying that if the decision goes the other way, we’d prefer a united Ireland.
Mansergh also questioned whether the Republic could afford the North, given the £10 billion subsidy it receives from the British exchequer.
He cited the 2004 Cyprus referendum, in which the Greek Cypriots turned down the offer of their long-cherished dream of unification because of the conditions attached.
People like David McWilliams argue that now that Ireland’s economy is much more successful than Northern Ireland’s… but there’s a large British subsidy, and the population of Northern Ireland is fairly inconsequential in British budgetary terms.

https://www.thejournal.ie/economy-wreck-ireland-economy-2737568-Apr2016/,"WHILE IRELAND’S TWO biggest parties continue to bicker over water charges, there could be major problems around the corner for the economy.
The newStability Programme Update– published yesterday by the Department of Finance – points to problems brewing around the world as things that could derail financial predictions.
The document upwardly revises predicted GDP growth for this year to 4.9%, a jump of more than half a percentage point of what was penciled into Budget 2016 last October.
This is only if (and it is a big if) everything goes to plan, with uncertainty about the state of play internationally being described as “higher than at any stage since the height of the financial crisis”.

High on the list of things that could drag predicted growth off track is the looming possibility of Brexit. Back in November of last year the ESRI, a group that provides economic advice to the government, warned that there would be a “significant economic impact” if Britain votes to leave the EU in June.
Sterling has been taking a hit since the start of the year, and while that might be good news if you’re planning to take a trip to the North, Ireland’s economy would be more exposed should the UK exit.
Another major issue are the world’s ‘Emerging Market Economies’ or EMEs – of which China is by far the biggest.
The economies included under this umbrella have been increasing their share of the world’s GDP in recent years, and the document today warns that any “sharper-than-assumed slowdown” could create a “significant headwind” for the global economy.

JEREMY CORBYN’S YEAR in charge of Britain’s Labour Party has been marked by a string of controversies, ranging from Brexit and the national anthem to a row with billionaire businessman Richard Branson.
Here are some of his highest-profile squabbles as Corbyn prepares for an expected triumph at the party’s annual conference today against a leadership challenge backed by rebellious Labour MPs.
National anthem
On 15 September 2015, three days after being elected party chief, Corbynhit the headlinesfor refusing to sing the UK national anthem God Save the Queen at a World War II commemoration event.
Tabloid newspapers let loose on the new socialist leader. The Sun ran with headline “Corb snubs Queen”, while the Daily Star splashed with “Corby a zero: Leftie refuses to sing national anthem” on its front page.
Speculation mounted as to whether long-time republican Corbyn would join the Privy Council, an elite constitutional group that advises Queen Elizabeth II, and which usually counts the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition as a member.
It wasn’t until November that it emerged Corbyn had joined the council, but The Guardian reported he had avoided kneeling before the queen while taking the oath, a tradition dating back to Tudor times.

No to nukes
The decision whether to renew Britain’s fleet of Trident nuclear submarines soon exposed rifts between Corbyn – a veteran pacifist who is nevertheless reluctant to criticise Russia – andmany of his MPs.
The party leader insisted he would “never” push the nuclear button if elected prime minister, causing “great concern” to Chief of Defence Staff Nicholas Houghton, who warned such a stance “completely undermined” the point of a nuclear deterrent.
Parliament in July overwhelmingly voted to replace the ageing submarines that carry the arsenal, shortly after Prime Minister Theresa May came to power.
Brexit
Corbyn’s lacklustre performance in campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union — the party’s official position – raised questions over his true loyalties andbroke the uneasy truce between Labour’s leadership and its MPs.

Many within the party questioned whether their leader, who spoke out against EU free-trade policies for decades, was actually in favour of Brexit and partly blamed him for the fact that 37% of Labour supporters voted to leave the union.
Former minister Peter Mandelson accused him of “sabotaging” Labour’s campaign to stay in the bloc, claims that weren’t helped when Corbyn’s brother was seen at a pro-Brexit party on the night of the vote.
Following the 23 June referendum, parliamentarians immediately launched a no-confidence vote against their leader, which passed with around 80% support.

Israel-Islamic State comparison
A week after the EU referendum, Corbyn invited further criticism by drawing equivalence between Israel and “so-called Islamic states”, interpreted by some as a reference to the Islamic State jihadist group.
The Labour leader hoped to quash claims that the party had a problem with anti-Semitism by commissioning an independent report, but caused further upset with the comments made at its launch. He said:
Britain’s chief rabbi immediately called the remarks “offensive”, while a Jewish Labour MP left the presentation in tears after being singled out for sharp criticism by a guest speaker as Corbyn watched.
It followed astring of antisemitic allegationsabout the party’s leadership.
The train
Last month Corbyn, as long-time campaigner for railway renationalisation, recorded a video sat on the floor of the 11.11am Virgin Trains service from London to Newcastle, claiming there were no seats on the “ram-packed” carriages.
“Passengers across Britain will have been in similar situations on overcrowded, expensive trains,” he said, blaming the current system.
But the plot thickened when billionaire businessman Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Trains,released CCTV footageapparently showing Corbyn walking past several unoccupied seats before setting up camp on the floor.
The Labour leader was initially unavailable for comment, his team revealing he was busy “making jam” at home, but later said he was forced to sit on the floor as he was unable to find two neighbouring seats for him and his wife.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-press-brexit-reaction-3062572-Nov2016/,"YESTERDAY, LONDON’S HIGH Court ruled that only parliament alone, and not the sitting government,can instigate the process to extricate Britainfrom the EU.
That decision could, in theory, slow down the whole process of Brexit.
And Britain’s pro-Brexit media are not in any way happy about that decision.



The Daily Mail has taken a particularly incendiary line, dismissing the three judges responsible for the decision (Lord Chief Justice John Thomas, Master of the Rolls Terence Etherton, and appeal court judge Philip Sales) as “out of touch” and as being “Enemies of the People”.
The publication has also drawn ire for appearing to condemn Etherton as being an “openly gay, ex-Olympic fencer”. Lord Chief Justice Thomas meanwhile was described as being a “europhile” for his role as a founding member of the European Law Institute.

The opening paragraph is quite possibly the biggest overreaction in newspaper history.pic.twitter.com/VgUj6vr5bW
Thomas yesterday described the decision he and his colleagues arrived at as being “a pure question of law”, unrelated to any “political issue”.
Contrast
The Sun and the Daily Express are two other tabloids that have dealt with the High Court decision in less than positive fashion. The former describes the decision as: “Loaded foreign elite deny the will of Brit voters”, while the Express simply says: “We must get out of the EU”.
Not all of Fleet Street’s outpourings are quite so critical of the decision however, understandable given the press itself was as split as the electorate when it came to last June’s seismic vote.

The Times has called on Theresa May to call a “snap election” over the ruling, the Guardian simply describes the situation as “turmoil for May”, and the Independent describes the move as “the verdict that rewrites the rules of Brexit”.
All are in agreement on one thing however – the decision is bad news for prime minister Theresa May.
The decision itself
While in theory the High Court ruling means that parliament could indefinitely delay the invocation of Article 50, triggering the UK’s exit from the EU, in reality that is less likely to happen.
For starters, the government is certain to appeal the decision to the UK Supreme Court.
Secondly, parliament isn’t likely to block Brexit given the weight of public opinion in favour of leaving.
However, it could turn May’s favoured time period for triggering Article 50, the three months between New Year and the end of March 2017, into something of a pipe dream.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-voter-deadline-extended-leave-side-angry-2812068-Jun2016/,"
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has said it will extend voter registration for the EU membership referendum after a last-minute surge in demand crashed the applications website but Brexit supporters cried foul.
Yesterday’s midnight deadline for registering to vote will be extended by 48 hours, the government announced.
Emergency laws will be rushed through parliament tomorrow, two weeks ahead of the historic 23 June vote, to legalise the extension.
Hundreds of thousands of people tried to register at the last minute causing the online site to fail.
Applications came particularly from younger voters who according to opinion polls tend to favour staying in the EU and ‘Remain’ campaigners had complained the glitch would lessen their chances of victory.
Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign said in a statement:
He added:
“Whitehall will do anything to stop this country taking back control from the EU,” he said, referring to the centre of government administration.
Around 132,000 of the 525,000 people who did successfully register yesterday were aged under 25 compared to around 13,000 from the 65 to 74 age group.
“We think it is right to extend to midnight tomorrow to allow people who have not yet registered time to get the message that registration is still open and get themselves registered,” Cabinet Office Minister, Matt Hancock, said.
Tim Farron, leader of the fervently pro-EU Liberal Democrats which is Britain’s fourth-biggest party, said:
The surge in requests came immediately after a tense TV face-off between Prime Minister David Cameron and anti-EU leader Nigel Farage.

Cameron fended off hostile questions about high immigration rates of EU workers while Farage was forced to defend himself against charges of racism.
The referendum campaign has intensified long-held euroscepticism in Britain but a major survey this week showed it was not alone.
The Pew Research Center survey said opposition to the EU has also increased in traditionally more positive countries. For example in France there was a 17-point drop in EU support to 38% over a single year.
In the 10 countries surveyed only Greek voters, forced by the EU and international lenders to adopt a harsh austerity programme, are more upset with Brussels than the French.
The union is still supported among newer members, with 72% of Poles and 61% of Hungarians expressing a favorable view, compared to only 27% of Greeks.
In Britain, it found 48% of voters were unfavourable to Europe and 44%t were in favour.
TheWhatUKThinkswebsite’s average of the last six domestic opinion polls puts the ‘Remain’ camp on 51% and the ‘Leave’ campaign on 49%.
In yesterday’s debate Cameron faced repeated questions from the audience on high immigration from other EU countries , the ‘Leave’ side’s trump card during the campaign so far.
But the Conservative leader attacked what he called Farage’s “little England” vision and said a Leave vote would mean “quitting, and I don’t think we’re quitters”.
Warning that Brexit could lead to Scotland leaving the UK, he said:
Scotland’s governing secessionist Scottish National Party has said Britain voting to leave the EU, while a majority of Scots voted to stay in, would trigger a second referendum on independence.
However, a TNS survey of 1,008 Scottish voters found that in those circumstances, Scots would still not back independence, just as in the September 2014 referendum.
Excluding “don’t know” voters, 71% of Scots would vote to remain in the EU, but 56% would vote to stay in the UK if Britain pulled out of the bloc, the poll found.","6.09pm, 8 Jun 2016",

The FTSE dipped 0.4% this morning ahead o the publication of Britain’s first-quarter economic growth data.
However, London surged yesterday, wiping out the losses it had suffered on Friday and Monday.
However, analysts warned of possible further market jitters, given the many unknowns about Britain’s path ahead as it handles its exit from the bloc and dealings with EU partners.
“First the panic effect, then the rebound. That’s a well-known mechanism on financial markets,” said Christopher Dembik, an economist at Saxo Banque in Paris.
“But we also know that after the rebound, volatility can re-emerge, and that is the main risk right now,” he said.

“The markets aren’t calm, we are in the eye of the storm,” said Adam Jepsen at Financialspreads, adding that “not a single issue” had been resolved.
The FTSE 250, which handles more companies directly exposed to the UK domestic market, was still 1,400 points off where it was on the day of the vote, but has seen a stabilisation in recent days. The same has happened in Dublin, where the ISEQ – down 1,200 points – has seen a slight upturn in fortunes, up 0.3% today.

The rebound was felt across the world, with New York, Paris and Frankfurt all experiencing strong days.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-hard-could-cost-irish-jobs-3067712-Nov2016/,"A HARD BREXIT scenario would damage the Irish economy, reducing it by 4% and causing a 1.9% surge in unemployment.
That is according to a new report published bythe ESRI and Department of Finance.
The report, which models the medium- to long-term effects of the British exit from the EU may have, attempted to quantify the effects under a number of scenarios.
Under the most severe of these, assuming the UK returns to trading under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, Ireland’s economy would shrink by 3.8% and wages would tumble by 3.6%.
In addition, unemployment would rise by 1.9 percentage points. If this were to happen overnight based on last month’s unemployment figures, this would be around 41,000 Irish jobs lost.
Advertisement
Under the softest Brexit scenario Britain would get a deal similar to Norway’s, where they remain a member of the European Economic Area. This would see the Irish economy contract by 2.3% and unemployment climb by 1.2%.
The paper says that there is “almost a complete consensus in the international literature that Brexit will have a negative effect on the UK economy”.
It adds:
“The UK is one of Ireland’s closest economic partners and, as such, Ireland will be very exposed to the effects of the UK leaving the EU.
However, all of the assumptions are based on the Irish government not changing any policies to react to Brexit.
Today, Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would become the ultimate free trade champion as she laid the groundwork for a potential post-Brexit deal with India, the world’s fastest growing major economy.
In her first bilateral trip outside Europe since taking office in July, May said Britain would not “turn its back on the world” once it has left the EU but wanted new economic relationships that would benefit all sides.

With sterling touching30-year lows, the Bank of England warning of anew recessionin Blighty, and fears that Tory desires toreduce immigrationwill see them frozen out of the European single market, there has been a surge in interest in relocating to Ireland.
Robert Mac Giolla Phadraig, managing director of Sigmar Recruitment, said they have been inundated with job applications and relocating queries from UK-based employees looking to move to Ireland.
“We’ve shown a huge spike in talent for people exploring relocating in Ireland,” he toldTheJournal.ie.
“We’ve had 310 calls in the last week alone.
“Most UK companies operating in Ireland know that salary is demand-driven. When it comes to the low price of sterling, the companies themselves are absorbing the costs.”

Estate agents
Mary Dillon of Sherry Fitzgerald toldTheJournal.iethat they have seen huge interest in Irish houses they are marketing through the UK website rightmove.co.uk.

“The level in our interest in our properties marketed on rightmove remains exceptionally strong since the referendum.
“It’s up around the 20-30,000 mark each weekend. We monitor it on the daily basis.”
Sherry Fitzgerald had 8,556 ‘hits’ for their houses in the weekend before Brexit, but on the two post-Brexit, the hits went up to 20-25,000, despite the fall in sterling.
Employer sentiment
Sigmar’s ‘pulse survey’ of over 100 Irish employers found that 88.79% said Brexit has had no immediate impact on their planned hiring activity for 2016.
And 64.55% feel Brexit will have no effect on 2017 hiring activity either. Around 28.18% are unsure, however.

It was the larger indigenous companies and multinationals that expressed greater uncertainty for 2017, possibly due to the uncertainty of 2017 GDP forecasts.
Around 7% of firms anticipating hiring less staff in 2017 as a result of Brexit, with around two thirds saying it will have no effect on 2017 hiring, while 28.18% of employers said they would take a ‘wait and see’ approach.
Over half of firms said it would make it easier to attract UK-based staff to Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/excise-alcool-cut-2893621-Jul2016/,"A DRINKS INDUSTRY lobby group is calling for a 15% reduction in alcohol excise due to Brexit.
The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland’s (DIGI) said excise tax is a “direct tax on tourism in Ireland” and a reduction would boost the hospitality sector.
The group, which represents drinks suppliers, pubs, hotels, independent off-licences and restaurants, said the Brexit vote has resulted in an even stronger case for a reduction in alcohol excise.
It called on the government to make every possible effort in October’s Budget to compensate for the negative effect of Brexit.

Exchange rate uncertainty
DIGI warned that exchange rate uncertainty might impact on the number of British tourists travelling to Ireland.
Reducing direct tourism taxes such as excise will ensure the survival of Irish pubs, said the group.
The increase in the number of people travelling to northern Ireland to buy alcoholic drinks is also impacting on the sector.
DIGI notes that due to Brexit, Sterling has declined significantly. The lower value of Sterling has boosted cross-borderpurchasing of alcohol.
Maggie Timoney, DIGI Chairperson and Managing Director at Heineken Ireland said:
She called alcohol tax a ”regressive and inequitable tax” and pointed out that Ireland’s tax rate on alcohol is very high by EU standards.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-paisley-polling-station-2842407-Jun2016/,"Daragh Brophy reports from Glasgow -
HEAVY RAIN AND thunder across the southeast of England led to concerns about turnout for the ‘Brexit’ referendum earlier – but there were no such worries in Paisley, to the west of Glasgow, at rush hour this evening asTheJournal.iedropped by the main polling station.
Warm and sunny, it may have been – but it was hardly ‘rush hour’ in terms of voting traffic, from what we could observe.
Footfall was intermittent at best, as we searched for voters to chat to at around 5pm. And while traffic picked up somewhat within the hour – still, locals didn’t appear to be beating a path to the door of the council offices.

The differences between the two sides in the debate appear less marked in Scotland, compared to England,some commentators have noted.And while recent UK-wide polls show it’s simply too close to call on whether the country stays in the EU, or calls it a day – a series of surveys north of the borderhas shown a clear majority in favour of Remain, in Scotland.
That pattern was mirrored in the cross-section of voters we talked to (or attempted to) in Paisley this evening.
A succession of Remain voters were more than happy to share their thoughts on the referendum – those on the Leave side, a little less so (more on that later).
Interestingly, of those casting their ballots to stayinthe EU – all gave different reasons for doing so.
Sporting a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club t-shirt and chatting with a friend, in the shade of the building, Dominic Gibson said he was voting to Remain as “it just seems like the right thing to do”.
But he’s been studying the arguments closely too.
“I would probably have been Remain without thinking but then you sort of think – ‘you should think before you vote’.
And what if the result is 'Leave'? “We’ll deal with that if it happens and work against it,” these voters said.pic.twitter.com/S5RpnLWHhW— Daragh Brophy (@DaraghBroph)June 23, 2016Daragh Brophy/ Twitter
And what if the result is 'Leave'? “We’ll deal with that if it happens and work against it,” these voters said.pic.twitter.com/S5RpnLWHhW
Firmly in the Remain camp, David and Tom said there were a long list of reasons to stay in Europe.
“We’ve had peace in Europe since the Second World War,” Tom observed, worthily. The second half of his argument was perhaps a little less high-minded…
“If you look at the lineup in the exit campaign they’re just people that you’d never, never trust. Dodgy, hyper-dodgy.”
David added:
A broader trend?
Dominic, the first voter we spoke to, had said the majority of his social media feed showed a clear Remain trend – but that it was closer to 50-50 where he worked.

Similarly, David said that while support for Leave was not insignificant, the majority of younger people wanted to stay in.

Amid the dyed-in-the-wool Remainers, there are plenty of voters who’d just, on balance, rather keep things pretty much as they are, rather than take a plunge into the unknown.
George, a student originally from London, said he wanted to stay in the union “for selfish reasons, really” so he could study and travel freely on the continent.
Rhonda and Carl, a young couple on their way to the gym, simply didn’t want to risk a Leave vote. It wasn’t a particularly difficult decision to make, they added.
Finally (from the Remain camp) June Bardon said she’d been “humming and hawing” about which way to go, until the last week or so.
“It sounds terrible but there was a lot of information and it was quite confusing.
Job security was a big factor, she said. “And to keep businesses in the country.”

Whether or not more Leave voters would have stopped to chat if we’d stayed at the polling station for longer – at this stage we’ll never know.
Not that they were necessarily reluctant to admit their preference…
“It was Leave for me,” an older man in an unseasonably heavy anorak acknowledged – declining to say anything much else.
A smiling Gregor King, fresh from voting Leave, was more forthcoming. He voted to leave the EU for the same reason he voted to leave the UK two years ago, he explained.
“Decisions are being made outside our country to benefit.. who?
That said, he’s pretty sure the decision will be to stay in Europe. Whatever happens, though, he’s not really all that concerned.
“I’ve just got an inkling that people are scared of change. It’s the same reason, I think, we stayed in the UK.
There was a train to catch, and it was almost time to go – but another couple looked like theymightbe willing to talk. Unfortunately, they then decided they weren’t.
I’m putting her in the Leave column.
By the looks of it, they’re short of people.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/what-was-brexits-impact-on-irish-jobs-3097573-Nov2016/,"THE IRISH ECONOMY continued to create jobs at a rate of more than 1,000 per week in the three months immediately following June’s shock Brexit vote, defying some of the most pessimistic predictions about the short-term impact.
According to today’sfigures from the Central Statistics Office, 57,500 jobs were created this year to the end of September, signalling robust annual job growth of 2.9%.
The pace of job growth moderated slightly to a seasonally adjusted 13,500 during the most recent three month period, down from 18,900 and 16,100 in each of the first two quarters of this year, respectively. This brought the total number employed to 2,040,500, the highest since the end of 2008, although still 6% below the all-time high of 2,169,600, reached in Q3 2007.
Public sector employment up, despite industrial unease
At a time of increasing industrial unease in the public sector, the small print in today’s figures reveals that by the middle of this year, total public sector employment was 384,700, up 8,500 on a year earlier.
This represents a 12,800 increase on the post-crisis low of 371,900 reached in the third quarter of 2014, but is still 10% below its end-2008 peak of 427,300. These figures include employees of semi-state bodies, but exclude temporary field staff taken on for the 2016 Census.
Although more than three quarters of jobs created over the past year were full-time posts, the total number of part-time jobs stayed close to the 461,900 record reached in the middle of this year, while the number of those in part-time jobs by choice – i.e. not underemployed – has reached a new all-time record of 361,200.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment continues to fall
Continued strong job growth, among other factors, has brought the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate down to 7.9%, with 25,300 removed from the ranks of the unemployed over the course of the year.
The number of unemployed now stands at 177,700, the lowest since the end of 2008. The number unemployed for longer than one year also continues to fall, reaching 92,300, or just over half of the total.
Over the course of the year, the long-term unemployment rate fell from 5.0% to 4.2%. The reduction has been particularly marked among males unemployed for more than one year, which fell by 12,100 over the course of the year to stand at 63,600, compared to 28,800 women who are long-term unemployed.

Majority of economic sectors are growing
Overall, these latest jobs numbers are certainly encouraging.Shutterstock / ESB ProfessionalShutterstock / ESB Professional / ESB Professional
This picture is consistent with job growth across 12 of the 14 economic sectors, with particular strength seen in Accommodation & Food Service Activities (+9.6% or 13,400) and Construction (+7.3% or 9,300). The only sectors to show modest declines over the year were Administrative and Support Activities and Public Administration and Defence.
Growth in the size of the labour force is also picking up, growing by an annual rate of 1.5%, or 32,200, to reach 2,218,200 by the end of September. This is more than double the 0.6%, or 13,500, increase seen in the previous twelve months.
The CSO attributes this acceleration to a number of factors, including changes to the working age population and inward migration, which together caused the demographic effect to turn positive in early 2016 for the first time since late 2009.
Participation in labour market is increasing
The number of people opting out of the labour market remained relatively static, increasingly only modestly by 0.2% to 1,430,300 over the course of the year. Overall, the participation rate continues to edge up from its post-crisis lows, particularly among young males.
These developments bode well for the economy’s underlying growth potential over the coming years if this momentum can be maintained.
Employment numbers are what economists call a ‘lagging indicator’ – not only is the Quarterly National Household Survey published nearly two months after the end of the period being measured, but changes in the economy tend to be reflected later in the jobs numbers later than in sales, production or consumer confidence data, for example.
These numbers nonetheless give the best available snapshot of the health of the labour market, with sectoral breakdowns and other measures that do not appear in the monthly live register figures, for example.
No time for complacency
Overall, these latest jobs numbers are certainly encouraging, but the slowdown in the pace of job growth as 2016 progressed, coupled with the fact that any negative impact from Brexit – let alone a Trump presidency – is unlikely to be felt for some time, suggest there is no reason for complacency in thedrive for full employment.

Then former mayor of London Boris Johnson, who dramatically pulled out of a bid to run himself last week, threw his weight behind Leadsom, an energy minister who campaigned for the Leave side.
“Andrea Leadsom offers the zap, the drive, and the determination essential for the next leader of this country,” he said in a statement.

Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and former Defence Secretary Liam Fox are all trailing May and Leadsom in the poll.

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who yesterday announce he was stepping down, said that May was “spreading fear” by not confirming whether she supported the right of EU citizens to stay in the post-Brexit UK.

Leadsom insisted she would drive a hard bargain during Brexit negotiations with Brussels, if elected.
“I know how to strike a deal in a tough negotiation. And I know, as a woman, how to succeed in a man’s world and how to fight the unfortunate prejudice that many working mothers still experience,” she said.
The former banker added that “freedom of movement will end”, potentially putting her on a collision course with other European leaders.
May has also said she would push for a new trade deal that limited immigration.
But one of her supporters, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, said there would be a trade-off between accessing the EU single market and allowing free movement of people.

The Tánaiste, Frances Fitzgerald briefed her Cabinet colleagues on the matter yesterday, stating that she was highly concerned with the “significant increase”.
It is understood Ireland received 10,000 applications last year from people wanting to become EU citizens, and 5,000 in the first half of this year. This is in comparison to just 1,800 applications being made in 2014.
The rising trend is understood to be linked to the UK Brexit vote.

Brexit vote
It’s believed the government had expected a rise over the last two years due to the anticipated EU referendum in the UK, which resulted in a Leave vote this year.
The applications are submitted by “qualifying family members” who wish to travel to Ireland under the terms of a European directive allowing EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within a member state.

Last month, the Tánaisteraised the rising trend of visa applications with the UK Home Office and the former UK immigration minister, James Brokenshire. He is now the new Secretary of State for NorthernIreland.

POLITICAL LEADERS AND representatives of businesses, trade unions and local authorities are meeting in Dublin today to discuss the potential consequences of Brexit.
The discussions are taking place at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and are being led by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan.
In his opening address, Kenny said: “Brexit is an issue that has the potential to impact everybody on this Island – north and south.
“It has implications for so many aspects of our relationship. It presents the most significant economic and social challenge of the past 50 years.
“It is an opportunity to consider how best to deal with the challenges that lie ahead and ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland and for Northern Ireland.”

All political parties north and south were invited to attend today’s talks, but both the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party refused.
DUP party leader and Northern Ireland’s first minister Arlene Foster dismissed the event as a talking shop for “remoaners” – people who wanted Britain to remain in the European Union.
Several politicians expressed their disappointment that Foster is not attending the discussions today.

Speaking to reporters on the way into the event, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said this was “a matter of disappointment” and the DUP “can’t avoid this conversation”.
“Rather than merely looking at the consequences of Brexit, we need to look for alternatives to Brexit … We would be arguing for designated special status for the north within the European Union. Our preferred approach would be a united Ireland, others have a different view.”

Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister Martin McGuinness added: “There is a huge responsibility on governments north and south to work together to agree a common platform, effectively to negotiate both with the British government and the European Union.”
Speaking of British Prime Minister Theresa May saying she will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by next March, to formally start the process of Britain leaving the EU, McGuinness said: “We are now on the cusp of something very, very challenging for all of us … No one knows where this is all going to end up.”

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said of Foster not attending: “It is disappointing, but we have to continue to work through various channels to make sure that we’re all on the same page in terms of the challenges that face us and indeed the solutions that we need to find together to make sure that we can protect the people on the island from the potential negative impacts of Brexit.”
Colum Eastwood, SDLP leader, said it was “a huge mistake” for Foster to not attend.
He added that Foster “needs to wake up and understand that nobody is trying to poach her investors”.
Flanagan also spoke about this, saying comments Foster made about Ireland trying to poach investors from the north post-Brexit were “unhelpful”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-brexit-ministers-3041829-Oct2016/,"FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has taken aim at cabinet ministers who encouraged a ‘leave’ vote in the Brexit referendum.
Speaking at a commemoration ceremony for Theobald Wolfe Tone today, Martin said the result of its vote had its root in three decades of increasingly “hysterical euro-scepticism”.
“The anti-EU campaign deployed lies and anti-foreigner rhetoric to secure the result. It was also fuelled by nostalgia for an imperial past and a place in the world more suited to the nineteenth century than a modern, globalised reality,” he said in his address.

He described the actions of the British government since the referendum as “little short of shambolic”.
“None of the people who argued for Brexit prepared plans for actually achieving the result – other than the arrogant belief that the world, including Europe, would rush to trade with Britain.”
Martin warned that the cost of Brexit will show itself over time and will push Britain “to the margins of international affairs”.
He also said this decision will affect Ireland permanently, challenging our core economic strategies, demands and policies. The country must work harder to diversify its markets, he said, to reduce our reliance on Britain.
Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would start formal exit negotiations by the end of March 2017.

BRITAIN’S NEW FOREIGN minister Boris Johnson resorted to Latin earlier today as he attempted to bluster his way past questions about his history of undiplomatic language.
Appearing in London with his US counterpart John Kerry to reaffirm the value of the trans-Atlantic “special relationship” in the wake of the Brexit vote, Johnson faced tough questioning.
Why had he dismissed US President Barack Obama’s concerns about Britain’s EU membership referendum as the prejudices of a “half-Kenyan” anti-imperialist?
Had he lied about Obama removing a Winston Churchill bust from the White House or misled British voters about the consequences of their vote to leave the EU?
Would he apologise for comparing the appearance of Democratic White House contender Hillary Clinton to that of “a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital”?
Well, no. These phrases and others that have resurfaced since he was promoted last week were, he said, “obiter dicta” – inconsequential remarks.
Now, along with his new friend “John” Kerry, Johnson has far more important matters to attend to – the wars in Syria and Yemen, negotiating Britain’s EU exit and world trade.
“I’m afraid that there is such a rich thesaurus now of things that I have said that have been one way or another – through what alchemy I do not know – somehow been misconstrued that it would really take me too long to engage in a full-blown itinerary of apology to all concerned,” he told reporters.

Johnson insisted that everyone he had met since becoming Britain’s top diplomat understood that his past utterances should be seen in the proper context of his career as a newspaper columnist and political campaigner.
And he protested that the crises that Britain and the United States are now confronting together are “far more important than any ‘obiter dicta’ that you may disinter from 30 years of journalism.”

Oxford contemporary
Kerry met Johnson in Brussels on Monday at a foreign ministers’ council and is to see him again in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday at summits on Iraq and the war against the Islamic State jihadist group.
The Secretary of State seemed keen to build up his new friend “Boris” and revealed that the US ambassador to the European Union had been a contemporary of Johnson’s at Oxford University and still spoke highly of him.
“He talked to me about some of the great experiences that they had there and he told me that this man is a very smart and capable man,” Kerry said.
“That’s the Boris Johnson that I have met, that’s the Boris Johnson that I intend to work with,” Kerry said. When Boris thanked him – “I can live with that. Stop there!” – Kerry said amid laughter: “That is called diplomacy.”
Earlier, Kerry had made a courtesy on Prime Minister Theresa May, becoming the first senior US official to visit her since she took over last week from outgoing premier David Cameron.
‘Out’ campaign
Cameron was forced to resign after he failed to convince British voters to vote to remain in the European Union, leaving May with the task of negotiating an exit that could have profound economic and geopolitical consequences.
Kerry and Obama were publicly opposed to Brexit and US officials are privately dismayed at the referendum result, which was championed in irrepressible style by Johnson, one of the leaders of the “Leave” campaign.
But Kerry said he had been reassured by his meetings in Brussels and London that the drawn-out divorce process would be conducted in a measured and serious way.
The talks in London were followed by a meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss the fragile cessation of hostilities in Syria, as well as the humanitarian situation and the conditions needed to resume UN-backed talks.
France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will press for the need to step up strikes against Islamic State, after last week’s massacre in Nice that left 84 people dead, his office said.
Kerry and Johnson were also to meet foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this evening to discuss the conflict in Yemen.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passports-belfast-office-2922575-Aug2016/,"RENEWED CALLS HAVE been made to open an Irish passport office in Belfast after the Brexit vote sparked a surge in demand in applications.
Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe is the latest politician to call on the Irish Government to open a passport office in the North, saying that it makes “practical and logistical sense.”
Deputy Crowe stated that there were 46,257 applications for Irish passports from the North between January and July of this year, an increase of 18.85% on last year.
“The huge increase in citizens in the North looking for an Irish passport, particularly following the Brexit vote, merits a new approach, and in my opinion, a new office being opened to meet this growing demand,” said the Dublin South West TD.
While the Sinn Féin Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs & Trade, the EU and Diaspora spoke positively about the Passport Reform Programme, which is underway and which will allow for people to renew their passports online from next year, he says people still have emergencies and need to travel at short notice.
“A trip to Dublin or Cork can take a whole day, is expensive, and can be difficult for those without a car, who have mobility issues, are elderly and with strict work commitments.  A passport office in Belfast would mean people may only need to take a few hours out of their day to get their passport needs sorted and Belfast is well serviced by public transport links from across the six counties and border counties,” he said.
Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Current needs are met
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade toldTheJournal.iethat Minister Charlie Flanagan is satisfied that the existing range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants.

It said that Minister Flanagan was “confident” that the introduction of the on-line application option should result “in significant efficiencies and reduced turnaround times” for passport renewals generally, even with the increase in applications expected from Northern Ireland in the years ahead.
It is understood that the vast majority of passport applicants on both sides of the border submit their applications through the Post Office networks on this island, including at 77 post offices in Northern Ireland.
“This means that no Irish citizen needs to travel a significant distance to renew a passport. Over 90% of passport applications from the island of Ireland to date this year were submitted through the postal service,” said the Department.
Post offices ran out of forms
Deputy Crowe said that after the EU referendum results some post offices in Belfast ran out of passport forms such was the rise in demand.
“With passport applications continuing to rise it is clear that a passport office in Belfast makes practical and logistical sense. It would also make the application process much easier for Irish citizens based in the North of Ireland,” he said.
From early next year it will be possible for adults renewing their passports, whether they are based on the island of Ireland or overseas, to submit their application online.
An appeal for calm was previously issued by the Department after Post Offices ran out of Irish passport applications in the wake of the referendum result.
In Northern Ireland, 56% of voters supported staying in the EU.
Overall however, the UK decided to give up its EU membership with a slim majority of 52% to 48%.","6.17pm, 11 Aug 2016",

SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER Nicola Sturgeon has announced plans for increased infrastructure spending to boost the economy after the Brexit vote, and called on the British government to do the same.
In a move welcomed by business and trade union groups, the devolved Scottish administration said it would invest an extra £100 million (€117 million) on health and other infrastructure projects in Scotland this year.
“There is no doubt that the referendum outcome has created deep and widespread uncertainty, with the impact on jobs and investment already being felt,” the Scottish National Party (SNP) leader said in a statement.
“It is against this background that the Scottish government is announcing early action to boost confidence, stimulate economic activity and support business.”
Autumn
British Finance Minister Philip Hammond recently raised the prospect of a UK government stimulus package but has ruled out an emergency Brexit budget, saying any fiscal response would wait until the normal autumn statement.
Economic data available in that point would allow London to “to reach a proper conclusion as to whether a fiscal stimulus is required”, he said last month.

Governments typically increase spending during recessions to balance plummeting private sector activity.
Sturgeon, who had campaigned for Britain to stay in the European Union, also announced a new dedicated service to provide information and support for businesses affected by the 23 June referendum vote.
£6 billion
The government said it would examine almost £6 billion of infrastructure projects currently underway and invest the £100 million into those that have “significant economic impact and can be delivered this year”.
The CBI business lobby group welcomed the plan, highlighting road improvements and digital infrastructure projects as priorities for investment.
Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Unions Congress, also endorsed the government’s announcement.
“The Scottish economy, already weak due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector, risks falling into technical recession as a result of Brexit-induced uncertainty,” he said.

LABOUR LEADER JEREMY Corbyn has lost a vote of no confidence.
The motion has been passed by a margin of 40 to 172, and follows the resignation of 20 members of his shadow cabinet.
The vote is non-binding, and Corbyn has declared his intention to remain in position despite of it.
Infighting within the British Labour party has exploded since the Brexit referendum last Thursday, with senior members blaming the leadership for failing to connect with Labour voters.
In recent days Corbyn has taken a bullish stance, stating his intention to re-contest the leadership of the party were it to go to a vote from the members.
Party disintegration
The resignations started piling in after Corbyn sacked his foreign affairs spokesperson Hilary Benn on Saturday.
The veteran socialist, widely blamed for failing to rally the party’s core working-class vote base to support the “Remain” campaign, said the country was divided after last Thursday’s shock vote.
But he insisted he would stand again as leader if another contest was called.
Speaking yesterday, Corbyn said he would not betray the trust of the party members who elected him only last September, and vowed to “reshape” his shadow cabinet.
“Don’t let the media divide us, don’t let those people who wish us ill divide us, stay together, strong and united for the kind of world we want to live in,” he told a cheering rally of supporters outside parliament.

The gathering of about 2,000 of the young grassroots activists brandished placards with slogans such as “Corbyn In, Tories Out”.
No confidence
The drama within the opposition Labour party broke over the weekend with the sacking of foreign affairs spokesman Hilary Benn, who had told Corbyn he did not have confidence in his leadership.
“He’s a good and decent man but he is not a leader, and that’s the problem,” Benn told the BBC.
Benn’s departure triggered a wave of resignations, hour by hour, with many of his team publishing letters of criticism on Twitter.
“As much as I respect you as a man of principle, I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding,” wrote shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander.

“It’s just not working,” a tearful shadow business secretary Angela Eagle told the BBC.
The leadership of the party could now be put to its membership, with the 172 votes against surpassing the 20% of the party’s 229 MPs needed to trigger a vote.
Critics say Corbyn – who for decades had expressed eurosceptic views – could have done more to sway voters ahead of last Thursday’s referendum.
Polling showed one third of Labour voters chose to leave the European Union in Thursday’s historic vote, against the advice of the majority of the party’s MPs and the leadership.
Conservative leader
Meanwhile, the UK’s dominant Conservative Party is also reeling from the result of the referendum vote and leader David Cameron’s subsequent resignation.
In the latest development, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that he was “seriously considering” launching a bid to be the next leader of the party.
“I am seriously considering it. Nominations close on Thursday lunchtime,” Hunt said.
File photo of Jeremy Hunt.Stefan Rousseau / PA WireStefan Rousseau / PA Wire / PA Wire
Speaking onITV’s Good Morning Britain, Hunt – who campaigned to stay in the EU – said that the focus needed to be on what Britain would do next as a country.
“But what I want to do now is start making an argument as to what we do next as a country. This is a big, big change and if we get it right we can succeed,” he said.
Hunt has also called for another referendum to be held in the future on the UK’s membership.
Writing in the Telegraph, Hunt called on government to delay invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would set into irreversible motion the UK leaving the EU.
Instead, he said that a deal should now be negotiated regarding the UK’s status and again put before the electorate in the form of a referendum or a general election.
Hunt’s statement of intent comes as another key party figure – the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne – declared that he would not run for leader.
Former London mayor Boris Johnson and interior minister Theresa May are still considered to be the front-runners in the leadership race.
But support for May is higher than for Johnson, on 31% versus 24% in a YouGov poll, according to the Times.
Johnson was a leading campaigner for the “Leave” side. May backed “Remain” but did not play a prominent role in the campaign.

BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE been elbowing each other the past few weeks for a piece of the billion-euro fiscal breathing space earmarked for Budget 2017.
Ministers Michael Noonan and Paschal Donohoe have set aside a third of that amount for tax cuts, with the rest expected to go on spending increases.
The minority government faces the tricky challenge of weaving its proposals through the Dáil with as little drama as possible despite the differing agendas of both the independents and Fianna Fáil.
Paschal Donohoe and Michael NoonanSam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
For that reason, political pundits anticipate a load of calculated decisions with a strong focus on the housing crisis and other social issues like university fees.
On the business side, “Brexit-proof” incentives will be rolled out to encourage entrepreneurship and to keep Ireland attractive for foreign direct investment.
Here are some of the key talking points in business circles ahead of Noonan and Donohoe’s announcement on 11 October:
Capital gains tax
Entrepreneurs are hoping to see a reduction in the capital gains tax, which is chargeable on the sale of assets such as all or part of a business.
The Programme for Government promised to match the UK’s rate by reducing the current charge from 33% to 10% and raising the cap on qualifying gains from €1 million to €10 million.
The Small Firms Association said that thecurrent rate puts Ireland at a competitive disadvantage when it came to businesses attracting funding, while the Irish Stock Exchange said a reduction would bring Ireland in line with international norms.
Dublin’s commissioner for startups Niamh Bushnell echoed those claims in her pre-Budget submission.
Pundits expect the government will follow through with this proposal as it falls in line with its “Brexit-proof” policy of discouraging young businesses from migrating to gain the advantage of Britain’s more attractive scheme.
Excise duty
Unsurprisingly, the alcohol lobby has been vocal in its call for the government to cut the excise duty tax on their products.
Jonathan McDade, head of the the Irish Brewers Association (IBA), previouslytoldForathat the measure has been a “hindrance in terms of growth, innovation and investment” for brewers in Ireland.
Beer makers want a cut in excise dutyBruno Girin / FlickrBruno Girin / Flickr/ Flickr
He claimed that a reduction would lead to job creation in the brewing sector.
Wine makers were also critical of the tax, which has remained at €3.19 per €9 bottle of wine since 2014.
Michael Foley, chairman of the Irish Wine Association (IWA), echoed McDade’s claims that a lower ratewould create employment.
The IWA also claimed that excises were damaging Ireland’s tourism industry because the price of alcohol was one of the reasons why tourists said they wouldn’t return to the country.
However despite cries from the industry, the government is highly unlikely to reduce the booze tax in this year’s Budget. The best businesses in this sector can hope for is that the rate doesn’t go up this time around.
Diesel
It’s pretty much a given that, like the cost of cigarettes, excises on diesel will be jacked up in the budget, with prices in the Republic currently below the average rates for Northern Ireland.
The Irish Road Haulage Association, which represents lorry drivers, argued that end consumers would be hit as the cost of transporting goods would increase – trucks only run on diesel fuel.
Diesel is expected to be hitxlibber / Flickrxlibber / Flickr/ Flickr
Speaking toForaafter the launch of a same-day delivery service, John Tuohy, chief executive of Nightline delivery company, which runs its own fleet of vans, said that he would be “keeping an eye to make sure that excise duty on diesel doesn’t increase too much”.

However, similar to other consumption taxes, the best firms with commercial vehicles can realistically hope for is no change on 11 October.
Tourism VAT rate
Ireland’s booming tourism trade – which saw the number of inbound trips to the country increase almost 11% between June and August – is keen to maintain its preferential 9% VAT rate.
Introduced in 2011 as a measure to boost activity in the hospitality sector, the lower rate was due to be phased out at the end of 2013 but has since been ‘extended indefinitely’.
The programme for government stated that the rate would be retained “as long as prices remain competitive”.
Critics have argued that this is no longer the case, especially in Dublin, whereprices continue to increase as occupancy levels remain sky-high.
The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation said retention of the VAT rate is “vital to the regional spread of tourism”, with its chairman Paul Gallagher calling on the government to “continue pro-tourism policies”.
These arguments have been backed by the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI), whose members also benefit from the tax break.
RAI argued in its pre-budget submission that the food industry is experiencing an unequal recovery, “where a divide remains evident between business in the capital, urban areas and rural Ireland”.
9% VAT rate is tipped to stayLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ieLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
The finance minister’s own department has argued that a return to the 13.5% rate is due, stressing that the temporary initiative has “done its job”.
“The general recovery of the economy and increasing prices in the sector raises questions about (the VAT rate’s) future,” a briefing note to the minister said.
Noonan himself has already acknowledged that the case for retaining the 9% rate for the capital’s hotel sector is diminishing each year, though he added “retention of the measure for the rest of the country remains” as many regional hoteliers have yet to return to a profit.
Meanwhile, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has claimed that the special rate does little to help the sector’s low-paid workers while costing the taxpayer €620 million every year.
The government is under enormous pressure from lobbyists in the hospitality sector to maintain the current rate, even though the industry is thriving.
It would be a controversial move to reverse to the higher rate, so odds are that Noonan will choose to keep the peace for another year and ignore his own officials.
Self-employed
The self-employed are hoping to have their tax bills brought in line with PAYE workers through increased tax breaks and access to PRSI benefits.
At present, the entry point to PRSI for the self-employed is €5,000 each year, compared to €18,000 for employees, resulting in a higher tax rate for both low- and high-earning self-employed people.
Right now, the self-employed pay 4% PRSI on their income, but can’t claim jobseeker’s benefit or sick pay, although they are entitled to jobseeker’s allowance as well as materity benefit and a state pension.
In its pre-budget submission, the Small Firms Association recommended that social protection benefits should be extended to the self-employed.
ISME, the body that represents small businesses in Ireland, called for a “total end to tax discrimination against the self-employed”.
Former chief executive of ISME, Mark Fielding,who stepped down on Friday, said: “Ireland needs to grow its own entrepreneurs. We need to use our tax system more effectively to draw on the increasingly large pool of Irish-born managers, skilled professionals, and entrepreneurs working both at home and overseas.”

At the announcement of the last budget, Noonan promised to “end the unfair treatment of the self-employed” and said that as resources became available, the government would “complete tax equalisation” for those that fall into this bracket.
From the start of this year, the self-employed were given a €550 tax credit – still €1,100 less than the amount PAYE workers could claim against any income.
It is thought that this tax credit will be increased in Budget 2017 as the government makes a move to bring tax breaks for the self-employed closer in line with those available to regular employees, although full equalisation isn’t likely to come this time around.

First up is Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy, who brings up Brexit.
He wants to know what the Government is doing to protect businesses from the “detrimental” effect of the vote and asks if a fund will be set up to help “shield” companies, particularly those who are dependent on exports.

Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar replies by saying the Government recognises the potential threat to businesses and farmers, and is planning ahead.
He says Enda Kenny will travel to Northern Ireland to discuss Brexit on 3 November.
He adds that an all-Ireland civic forum to discuss the implications of Brexit, especially for border counties, will be set up.

Sinn Féin’s deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald has the floor now, bringing up the “outrageous” salaries of TDs and ministers.
She asks Varadkar if he will give a commitment that the Government will “act properly and legislate to stop unfair pay increases for political representatives”, while people on social welfare struggle to get by.

Varadkar responds by saying TDs have had no pay increase since 2008.
He says they will receive partial restoration of some of the pay cut from their salaries during the recession.
He notes that ministers’ pay was cut by 35% and has not been restored, the Taoiseach’s salary has been cut by 40% and not restored, while junior ministers’ salaries were cut by 25% and not restored.
Varadkar goes on to criticise Sinn Féin’s approach to welfare in Northern Ireland, where social welfare payments are less than in the Republic.
“Sinn Féin is terrified of the facts and really hate the truth being told in this chamber,” he says.
McDonald is not impressed, shaking her head.

Independent TD Michael Lowry moves things on to a new topic, bringing up parking and accommodation issues in Templemore as more garda recruits attend the training college in Co Tipperary.
In reply, Varadkar mentions the increased investment in Garda resources, saying, as an example, more than 500 new vehicles will be bought this year, compared to 50 new vehicles in 2010.
He notes that 800 new gardaí are to be recruited in 2017, and the Government is committed to reaching its target of 15,000 gardaí by 2021.
He says an OPW programme of works to improve accommodation at Templemore is “well advanced”, and gardaí and the OPW are analysing the need for additional facilities.
Lowry brings up Templemore Golf Club, saying he hopes the approach to expanding and developing the training facilities at Templemore don’t encroach on the club, which has 300 members and is “used extensively” by members of the community.
Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl then jokes, “Maybe you might invite the minister to play a round?”
Varadkar says he’ll raise Lowry’s concerns with Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald.
Moving on, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan brings up paternity leave and support for families.
He asks Varadkar if he would do anything differently to the current approach if he was in Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone’s place.

Varadkar says the Government has brought in subsidies to the cost of childcare and introduced a second year of free pre-school, saving parents, on average, €4,000 per child per year.
He adds that the uptake of paid paternity leave has been “really encouraging”.
Ryan isn’t impressed, telling Varadkar: “You gave me no answer as to what you would fundamentally do differently.”
He claims the Government’s approach “absolutely discriminates at scale” against parents who stay at home.

https://www.thejournal.ie/angela-merkel-ireland-no-special-treatment-brexit-2874649-Jul2016/,"ANGELA MERKEL HAS not been able to reassure Enda Kenny that Ireland will get any special treatment when the UK leaves the European Union, Cliodhna Russell reports from Berlin.
Speaking after a private meeting with the Taoiseach in Berlin this afternoon, the German Chancellor said:
“It’s difficult to give guarantees at this point of time. We don’t even have the position of the UK, we have to wait for Great Britain to take a stand and give us an idea of the type of relationship they are thinking about.
However, Merkel said Germany will work with Ireland “in a special friendship” following on from Brexit, adding, “We will approach the post-Brexit challenges on the basis of friendship between the two countries.”
The meeting was held so the pair could discuss the future direction of Europe.

Enda Kenny and Angela Merkel address the press after holding a private meeting in Berlinpic.twitter.com/rZ8Pwe1XA5
Addressing reporters in Berlin, Kenny outlined Ireland’s commitment to EU membership and referenced specific Irish concerns, such as having a common travel area with the UK – something that has been in place since 1922.
“Obviously Britain exports most of its goods to countries close by: Ireland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.
“Many of the economic studies pre-the Brexit decision did point out Ireland would be one of the most adversely affected from the Brexit outcome, and that Northern Ireland would actually be the most specifically adversely affected.”
Border from Dundalk to Derry
Kenny also said he doesn’t want to see a European border that runs from Dundalk to Derry but that he can’t say what will happen until Britain lays out its exit plans.
“If you have access to the single market, and free movement of goods and services, then depending on how our negotiations go, you need to be able to monitor and understand the movement of goods from and between a member state of the EU and one that is not a member of the EU.
The meeting with Merkel comes at a time when Kenny faces domestic pressures with backbenchers circling, anxious that if a snap election is called, he will have to continue to lead Fine Gael – a prospect some don’t relish.
Markus SchreiberMarkus Schreiber
When questioned on any possible heave against him, the Taoiseach insisted that his leadership of the party will continue.
“In respect of the government and the party, we are in a position now where the government is in situ, every minister has a brief and a set of commitments to follow through.
The Taoiseach added, “We are a member of the EU and we will continue to be a member of the union and obviously the advantages that flow from that will be part and parcel, that’s why we have made so much progress over the years.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-jobs-at-risk-2905003-Aug2016/,"THE CURRENCY DIP suffered by Sterling after the Brexit vote is putting Irish jobs at risk, employers’ group Ibec says.
The group today demanded a decisive and immediate national response to the crash, which it says has left many key export businesses reeling.
Sterling has slumped since the 23 June vote, though it has held a consistent level over the last week.

An Ibec survey found that the negative exchange implications of the UK vote is by far the biggest concern of business. Almost half (45%) saw this as the main threat. Exporters are operating with a major competitive handicap in the UK market, while domestic firms are facing the prospect of cheaper UK imports grabbing market share. Further survey details below.
In a stark assessment, Ibec Director of Policy Fergal O’Brien said “The Brexit strain is manifest and intense. Without urgent action to address competitive pressures, hundreds of millions of euro worth of exports and thousands of Irish jobs will be lost.
“This is now a full blown currency crisis.”
Separate economic analysis from Ibec also found that the impact on UK focused export sectors, such as agri-food, will be particularly severe. The analysis of the historical exchange rate and agri-food export relationship shows that a 1% weakness in sterling results in a 0.7% drop in Irish exports to the UK.
If sterling was to weaken further towards the £0.90 mark, this would translate to losses of over €700 million in food exports and about 7,500 Irish jobs in that sector alone.

In an interview with the BBC, Brendan Cox said he wants to make sure something good comes out of the death of his wife, who would have turned 42 today.
“She was a politician and she had very strong political views and I believe she was killed because of those views,” Mr Cox said.  ”She would want to stand up for those in death as much as she did in life.
Cox said his wife had been concerned about the “coarsening” tone of the debate around the Brexit referendum and “the whipping up fears and whipping up hatred”.

“She was particularly worried about the direction…of politics at the moment, particularly around creating division and playing on people’s worst fears rather than their best instincts,” he said.
Cox thanked the public for their “outpouring of love”, saying it has helped the couple’s two young children.
“The two things I’ve been focused on is how do we support the children and how do we make sure something good comes from this,” he said. “What the public support and outpouring of love does is help the children see that what they’re feeling, other people are feeling.”
He fought back tears as he remembered his wife as someone who had “incredible energy and joy” who would have no regrets about how she lived her life. On the morning she was killed, she was on the way to her surgery – “one of the things she loved” he said.

WITH THE FILLING out of new PM Theresa May’s cabinet, Theresa Villiers is out and James Brokenshire has taken over the top Northern Ireland job.
A relatively unknown quantity to those in the North, 48-year-old Brokenshire has previously served in cabinet as minister of state for immigration and came out in favour of a Remain vote in last month’s referendum.
Tweeting earlier this evening, the MP said that he was “delighted and honoured” to have been asked to serve in the position of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
Coming into the job, Brokenshire will have plenty on his plate. First up will be how to deal with the delicate issue of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the Republic in a post-Brexit world.

Delighted and honoured to have been asked by the Prime Minister to serve as Northern Ireland Secretary in her new Government.
On the issue of the border Brokenshire has marked it as a concern, without saying anything definite.
“Another huge challenge is to ensure that we make a success of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union,” he said.
“It is vital that Northern Ireland’s interests are fully protected and advanced including in relation to the border.
Also on the agenda will be the implementation of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements which are in place to help tackle paramilitarism.
Securing Stormont’s finances and the future of the Good Friday Agreement are also priorities for the new appointee.
Prior to getting into politics, Brokenshire practised law for 13 years.
Other cabinet positions held by Brokenshire included minister for crime prevention and security minister at the home office.
During his time in government he led the negotiations with the Jordanian government that led to the deportation of radical preacher Abu Qatada, and also oversaw security operations in advance of the London 2012 Olympics.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ian-paisley-jr-border-poll-far-out-2885307-Jul2016/,"IAN PAISLEY JR thinks Taoiseach Enda Kenny’s suggestion that a border poll could be carried out is “far out, man”  - and that, instead, Ireland should move closer to the Commonwealth.
The DUP MP made the comments today in the wake ofKenny’s speechat the MacGill summer school last night, where he said that Brexit negotiations could include a border poll:
“The discussions and negotiations that will take place over the next period should take into account the possibility, however far out that it might be, that the clause in the Good Friday Agreement might be triggered,” he said.
“In that if there is clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the United Kingdom and join the Republic, that that should be catered for in the discussions that take place.”
Asked about his thoughts on the issue on the News at One onRTÉ Radio One, Paisley Jr said:
“We all know first of all the public in Northern Ireland, nationalists and unionists have no interest whatsoever in a united Ireland,” said Paisley, adding that the Republic of Ireland “couldn’t afford us even if they did want us” and “the cost of a united Ireland is something the Republic of Ireland could not bear”.
He said he believes Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, who has called for a border poll, is “grasping at straws at a time when his own leadership is under crisis and that Enda Kenny’s leadership is under crisis”.
The MP said the border poll discussions are “causing diversion from the fact that Enda Kenny will not be Taoiseach in a year and that Gerry Adam’s leadership is probably on its last gasp”.
He said that the idea can be dismissed “gently” but that he hopes the Republic of Ireland will work with Northern Ireland “as a good neighbour”.

Paisely also described Kenny as “foolishly using Northern Ireland as some sort of stick in this election”.
Paisley said that what should be focused on are trade agreements and trade deals.
“I would predict Mr Kenny will soon be living in an Ireland that will be removing itself from Europe, just as the United Kingdom… is removing itself from the EU,” said Paisley.
The British Commonwealth is now known as theCommonwealth of Nationsand has 53 member states, the vast majority of which were part of the British Empire.
The son of Ian Paisley also said that it is in the interests of the Republic of Ireland to have a good relationship with the UK and Northern Ireland, and to have a good border arrangement.
He said that holding a border poll would mean starting a countdown clock – and possibly meaning instability.
Defining moment
The Taoiseach’s remarks about a possible referendum on Irish unity were welcomed by Gerry Adams, who said he will be looking to the government and particularly the Taoiseach to show leadership on the issue.
The new Northern Ireland Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, has said that there is not enough support for a border poll – but Adams said that “sometimes secretaries of state on their first day can be very, very short-sighted”.
He also described a border poll as “a decision for the two governments”.
Earlier this week, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martincalled the Brexit votea “defining moment in Northern politics”, adding that he hoped it would “move us towards majority support for unification, and if it does we should trigger a reunification referendum”.

DAVID CAMERON LAID into Jeremy Corbyn across the House of Commons today, telling him it was not in the national interest for him to remain on as Labour leader, and attacking his performance on the pre-Brexit campaign trail.
It comes as Corbyn faces a revolt from his MPs, who backed a no confidence motion in his leadership by an overwhelming margin yesterday evening.
“I know the honourable gentleman says he put his back into it. All I would say is I would hate to see him when he is not trying,” the UK prime minister said of his opposite number’s referendum campaign effort.
He added:
Guardian Wires/ YouTube
Labour MPs voted against Corbyn in a no-confidence motion by 172 to 40 after dozens of members of his frontbench team stepped down in recent days.
Corbyn, however, is still refusing to go anywhere.

No confidence
The embattled leader was elected to the job last year on a wave of support from grassroots Labour members, but has since struggled to build broad support among the parliamentary party.
His below-par performance campaigning for a Remain vote in Europe was the final straw for many MPs (see below). He had been known for his eurosceptic comments in the past, and voted against a number of EU treaties.

In the latest development in what’s been a nightmare few days for Corbyn, his predecessor Ed Miliband has said the Labour leader’s position is now untenable.
Miliband toldthe BBC’s World at One:
Corbyn has reiterated, however, that he’ll definitely be on the ballot paper in the by-now-inevitable leadership contest. He’s banking on the grassroots members who swept him to power last year to back his candidacy once again.
Meanwhile, organisers of a rally by Corbyn’s supporters planned for this evening have said they had to cancel itdue to “too much demand”as the venue they booked is too small.
Cameron has said he will step down in the wake of the referendum’s ‘Leave’ result, and will leave office when his successor is chosen in early September.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-film-board-funding-strategy-plan-2860776-Jul2016/,"IRELAND’S FILM INDUSTRY needs investment if the country wants more international successes like Room or Brooklyn: that was the message from the Irish Film Board today as it launched its five-year strategy following a year of “unprecedented” critical and commercial success.
Irish films have taken in over $140 million (€125m) in the worldwide box office in 2015/2016 to date, but theIrish Film Boardhas had its funding cut since the recession.
Dr Annie Doona, IFB Chairperson DesignateMarc O'SullivanMarc O'Sullivan
It is calling on the government to help foster future success by reinstating its previous funding level of €20m.
At the launch of the strategy plan today, chairperson designate of the IFB, Annie Doona, said:
The team from the film What Richard Did (from left) Jack Reynor, Lenny Abrahamson, Ed guiney and Andrew Lowe pictured with their IFTAsLaura Hutton / Photocall IrelandLaura Hutton / Photocall Ireland / Photocall Ireland
“People outside of the industry don’t realise how long it takes to make a film – it can be 10 years from conception to screen,” pointed out actress and IFB board member Kate O’Toole, adding: “Making films is an expensive process.”
“Lenny Abrahamson is a case in point,” said Doona.
O’Toole pointed out that new funds can benefit the industry in helping widen the scope of the types of films that get made.
“With limited funding, one has to make difficult decisions – and the inclination is to support proven success. And that is not always helpful in creating young, new, fresh voices,” she said.
What about Brexit?
Asked about the impact of Brexit on the Irish film industry, the board said they were waiting to see how things played out, but that they do have some immediate concerns.
“I think like everyone else we’re not entirely sure yet – we need to see how this plays out,” said Doona.
IFB CEO James Hickey said that the common travel area is another element which the IFB would be concerned about.
Young Offenders/ YouTube
Not working alone
Doona said that the IFB board wants to be a stronger voice for Irish film.

“We would like to develop and want to grow and make the Irish film industry the centre of the world industry,” she said.
“We’re at a good place and I think the timing of this plan has got to the stage where it’s so important and has such a strength that we need to build on that and not let it slip away,” said board member Maurice Sweeney.
He added: “The key to all this is talent, and building on that.”
If Ireland doesn’t feature in the Oscars next year, is there the fear that this could have a detrimental affect on the Irish film industry?
“I would hope not and I don’t think so,” said Doona. “There are some great films that are out this year and are doing well already in the international box office. Now, will they make Oscar nomination? I don’t know, but I don’t think we’d see it as a failure [if they didn't].”

Doona said that diversity and quality in the Irish film industry is important to the board. They set an “ambitious” target of three years to reach 50/50 funding for male and female filmmakers.
They have been working on specific schemes for women, as well as events where production companies get meet with aspiring talent, in an effort to help people network and make new contacts.
“One of the things that we’ve said to production companies was the applications we get from films that include female talent need to go up,” said Donna.
“We’re seeing progress already.”
Sweeney  pointed out: ”We are the facilitators of this, it is up to people to put their projects in.”
A strategy for young filmmakers is currently being drawn up.
Asked if there should be a specific Arts Minister, Doona said that the issue for the IFB is that the arts remains central – whether it is a separate ministry or not.
The strategy comes as it was announced that eight Irish people – including Room director Lenny Abrahamson and writer Emma Donoghue – were appointed to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, meaning they can vote for the 2017 Oscars.

The message from the IFB was clear – the Irish film industry is capable of great things, but it also needs increased government investment.
“This is the time to seize the day, carpe diem, and really move forward. That’s what we need that additional funding for,” said Doona.

ATTENTION IS TURNING to the exact process by which the UK will leave the EU, and on these shores, to how the terms and conditions of Brexit will affect Ireland, and how well we’re prepared for the potential fall-out.

In fact, she claimed it would be “illegal to start discussions or negotiations” before the UK invoked Article 50 of the EU Treaty, thereby formally starting the process of leaving the EU.
Is this true?
Claim:It’s illegal for the Irish government to start discussions or negotiations about Brexit with the UK government, until Article 50 is triggeredVerdict: FALSE

You can watch a video including Minister of State Doherty’s claim, and a breakdown of the facts, above. And you can watch the episode in fullhere.
Our focus is this exchange with Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín, who had been criticising what he regards as the government’s inaction and lack of preparation for Brexit.
Tóibín:Britain are, as Regina says, exerting their demands, and Enda is sitting on his hands. Because what we really should be doing – this government should be working out the best-case scenario for Ireland in this whole mess…
Doherty:And what is that, Peadar?
Tóibín:Well first of all, the best case scenario is that we have free movement in Ireland and within Britain, and that we have people that are able to trade with people in Britain…
Doherty:And how would we do that, at the moment, whenit’s actually illegal to start discussions or negotiations before the article is even triggered?[Emphasis added].
When Vincent Browne refuted this, Doherty insisted, adding “It’s against the treaty”.

In response to our request for evidence, a spokesperson for Regina Doherty cited an agreement made at an informal meeting of 27 of the EU’s heads of government, on 29 June.
Section 2 of that agreement states:
Doherty’s spokesperson added:

In response to our request, Doherty did not cite any law, regulation or rule which would make it illegal for the Irish government, its members, or its representatives, to “start discussions or negotiations” with the UK government, its members, or its representatives, before Article 50 is invoked, other than Article 50 itself.
EUEU
Article 50 of the EU Treaty (page 31) sets out the process by which a member state can leave.
The UK, for example, sends a notification to the European Council that it is invoking Article 50, and a formal process of negotiating the terms of the UK’s exit begins, between the UK and the EU/European Council.
But Article 50 says nothing about negotiations or discussions betweenindividual member states, on issues relating to Brexit.
The negotiations mentioned in Article 50 are those formal negotiations between the UK and EU, and not talks between Ireland and the UK (or the UK and any other member state).
Therefore, the requirement to wait until Article 50 is triggered, only applies to those formal talks between the UK and EU.
Gavin Barrett, Professor of European Constitutional and Economic Law at UCD, told FactCheck:
PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
The point here is that, by definition, Ireland could not negotiate as the EU or on behalf of the EU, with the UK, so the process outlined in Article 50 does not apply.
Any discussions between Ireland and the UK would, inherently, be bilateral discussions even if they touched on issues relating to Brexit, and so would fall outside the limitations of Article 50.
In response to a request for clarification, Regina Doherty’s spokesperson said “any negotiations before Article 50 is triggered fall outside the legal basis set out in Article 50″.
But this is precisely why bilateral negotiations between Ireland and the UK would not be limited by the terms of Article 50. As Professor Gavin Barrett told FactCheck:
Finally, the position agreed by EU heads of government at the informal meeting on 29 June is just that – an informal agreement of principles,without the force of law, or sanctions.
Regina Doherty’s claim was that it is “illegal” for the Irish government to enter Brexit-related negotiations or discussions with the UK, before Article 50 is triggered.
We rate her claimFALSE.

TOM WATSON, THE deputy leader of the UK Labour Party, has told his boss, Jeremy Corbyn, that he has “no authority” among the party’s MPs and that he faces a leadership challenge,the BBC reports.
Corbyn has said he will not step down from his position, after criticism over his handling of last week’s Brexit referendum, which saw a majority of UK voters opt to leave the European Union.
Eleven members of the shadow cabinet resigned yesterday, blaming Corbyn for failing to rally the party’s core working-class vote to support the “Remain” campaign.
The party leader hit back, saying he would not betray the trust of the party members who elected him only last September, and vowed to “reshape” his shadow cabinet starting today.
However, this morning, another three members of his top team followed – shadow foreign minister Diana Johnson, shadow minister for civil society Anna Turley and shadow armed forces minister Toby Perkins.
Chester MP Chris Matheson then announced he was resigning at Parliamentary Private Secretary to the shadow justice team and Stephen Kinnock stepped down from his position as private secretary to the spokesperson for business, innovation and skills, according toSky News. Further resignations are expected.
This morning, Corbyn’s team released details of a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, filling the health, education, transport, defence and foreign affairs portfolios.

Millions of supporters
“I regret there have been resignations today from my shadow cabinet. But I am not going to betray the trust of those who voted for me – or the millions of supporters across the country who need Labour to represent them,” Corbyn said in a statement.
The drama started overnight on Saturday with the sacking of foreign affairs spokesman Hilary Benn, who had told Corbyn he did not have confidence in his leadership.
“He’s a good and decent man but he is not a leader, and that’s the problem,” Benn said.
Benn’s departure triggered a wave of resignations.
One third of Labour voters chose to leave the European Union in Thursday’s historic vote, against the advice of the majority of the party’s MPs and the leadership.
Critics say Corbyn – who for decades had expressed eurosceptic views – could have done more to sway voters.
Meeting with deputy leader
In the wake of this morning’s meeting between Corbyn and Watson,a Labour source told the BBCthat the leader had been told by his deputy that “it looks like we are moving towards a leadership election”.

“Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it everyday of her life with an energy and a zest for life that would exhaust most people.

A few hours later, a West Yorkshire Police spokesperson confirmed thesad news that she had died from her injuries.
The attack
The MP for Batley and Spen – who was a leading campaigner for the Remain side in the Brexit referendum – had been hosting an advice clinic at a library in Birstall, Yorkshire when she was grabbed by the hair and attacked by a man.
There have been unconfirmed reports that the suspect shouted ‘Britain first’ during the attack.
A 52-year-old man has since been arrested and police say they are not looking for anybody else in relation to the incident.
“We are trying to establish what we do know about this gentleman,” said police chief Dee Collins told reporters.
“At the moment the enquiries have just started. We are not in a position to discuss any motive at this time.”

AFTER THURSDAY’S MOMENTOUS UK referendum to leave the EU, there has been what Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan today called “a spike in interest” in Irish passports in Britain and Northern Ireland.
And we’ve already seen anecdotal evidence of particularly increased interest in Northern Ireland:

However, as Flanaganadded, “There has been some exaggeration of demand”.
In the Dáil this afternoon, the Minister urged UK citizens to “take full account of the facts” about their right to travel in the EU (which will continue for at least two years) and advised that there was “absolutely no urgency” to apply for an Irish passport now.
He also warned:

The sharp-eyed among you will have figured this one out already.
The photo used by De Standaard to illustrate a mad rush in the UK for Irish passports since Friday, in fact shows the old passport office on Molesworth Street in Dublin, and was taken on 23 March, 2010.
The true context was a delay in passport processing times caused by anindustrial dispute among passport office staffat that time.
What’s more, the building that used to house the passport office – the one featured in the photo – has since been demolished, as this January 2016 photo shows.
Leah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
We don’t know whether or not the author and editors at De Standaard were aware of the details and context of the photo they used, quite misleadingly, to illustrate British demand for Irish passports.
The story was published at 3.08pm Irish time, and remained online and unedited at the time this article was published.
Although there’s no caption under the photo in the De Standaard article, the clear implication is that it shows a queue for Irish passports in the UK, after Friday’s referendum.
And we know that’s entirelyFALSE.

Leading pollster Ben Page of Ipsos Mori, toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthe vote was a “vote of anger”.
Most polls had predicted the result would be extremely close, but it was mainly predicted that the Remain side would win the vote.
Page said he believed people had voted on immigration rather than economic issues.
He noted that the turnout of 72% was higher than expected, and that more working class people had turned out than in previous elections and referendums.

Divide between London and rest of country
Political scientist Professor John Curtice said the referendum “underlined the social and cultural gap between London and provincial England”.
“London has voted to stay in the EU by around 60% to 40%,” Curticetold the BBCthis morning.
“However, no other region of England has voted in favour of remaining. Remain’s defeat seems to have been primarily the product of the decisions made by voters living north of the M4.”

Some of the country’s most deprived areas voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU, with locals believing Europe and uncontrolled immigration had added to their woes.
In parts of East England, such as Yorkshire and Humber, people voted to leave by 57.7%.  It contains the most deprived area in the UK, with 33% youth unemployment.
Green Party MP and Remain campaigner, Caroline Lucas, agreed that the result showed “how deep divisions” in the country went and the “levels of anger and alienation” people felt.

Labour MP Kate Hoey, a Leave campaigner, admitted the election exposed a “huge disconnect” between her party’s leadership and areas outside London.
“Some of us in Labour Leave have always said this would happen for some time….There is this huge disconnect in Labour areas certainly further out of London from the Labour leadership,” she said.
Labour MP John Mann toldBBCthe referendum result showed the  “division” between the ”working class and middle classes”.
“The polls didn’t have this one”
Share markets in the region spiralled into the red after results came through pointing towards an exit, with financial strategists scrambling in the wake of the unexpected result.
“We all read the same information, we all watch the same screens and clearly the betting companies didn’t have this one,” Westpac bank’s global FX strategy head Robert Rennie told AFP of the result.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY said the Irish government, the British government, and the Northern Ireland Executive all want the open border with the North retained.
Kenny was speaking in the Dáil today after it was recalled to discuss last Friday’s Brexit vote.
There is much speculation about what will become of the border between the Republic and the North, with no decisions made or clear-cut rules to follow.
Ahead of last Thursday’s historic vote, there had been discussions on what a Brexit could mean for the island of Ireland – with Revenue examining how much border controls would cost.
The Taoiseach also pointed to the possibility of border checks prior to the referendum as he urged a Remain result.
Kenny said he fully understands why many people in Northern Ireland are deeply concerned that they will be outside of the European project.
Post-exit arrangements
The Taoiseach said the stakes for Ireland in relation to a Brexit were always higher than they are in other EU countries.
“Urgent” and “intensive” work is underway between the Irish government, the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive, he said, to ensure that the gains of the past two decades are fully protected in whatever post-exit arrangements are negotiated.
Kenny believes bilateral discussions can commence with the UK due to Ireland’s “unique bilateral interests”, particularly with regard to Northern Ireland.
However, for wider issues such as trade, he conceded that talks will have to go through larger EU negotiations.
Contingency planning for Ireland, which Kenny said has already been carried out, is “particularly challenging” because of the unknowns right now are innumerable.

He said the future of the UK is in the hands of the British government now and will depend on how they proceed in negotiations with the EU.
He said it is vital that the UK and the EU continue to operate on friendly terms.
Kenny is advocating a softer approach to Ireland’s neighbours, stating that it is important they are kept in the fold. It is a shift from another narrative – preferred by some EU members – ofstringent and tough measures being imposed on the UK.
Kenny said he will be travelling to Brussels tomorrow for a meeting of the European Council. This will be the first opportunity for the Taoiseach to put forward Ireland’s specific interests and concerns and to make clear the national position.
New British Prime Minister
Calling the Brexit vote a “political earthquake” for the UK, Kenny said he expected there to be broad consensus that there is a need to await the appointment of a new Prime Minister before a formal exit notification can be made under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

SOME EU CITIZENS may not be allowed to stay in the UK after it leaves the bloc, the minister in charge of negotiating Brexit has said.
Brexit Secretary David Davistold the Mail on Sunday newspaperthat he wants “a generous settlement for EU migrants here now and a generous settlement for British citizens in the EU.”
He dismissed suggestions the estimated three million EU nationals in Britain might have to leave, but said if there was a surge in arrivals before the deadline, the British government may have to set a cutoff date.
“We may have to say that the right to indefinite leave to remain protection only applies before a certain date,” he said. “But you have to make those judgments on reality, not speculation.”
A desire to reduce immigration from other EU nations was a key reason many Britons voted last month to leave the EU. Under the bloc’s rules, EU nationals can move feely among member states, and Britain has seen its population swelled by hundreds of thousands of new EU arrivals in recent years.

Prime Minister Theresa May has been criticised for refusing to guarantee the right of EU citizens to remain in Britain after a British exit — something that is more than two years away. She says she needs to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Britons living in other EU countries get the same right.
Britain’s vote to leave the EU has unleashed political and economic turmoil, as people and markets absorb the uncertainties about the country’s economic future as it leaves the 28-nation single market of 500 million people.
Davis said he believes the UK will be able to retain access to the single market while opting out of the EU’s right to free movement. EU leaders say that’s impossible, that the free movement of people is a key right, but Davis said “everybody is taking starting positions.”
“Of course they are talking tough,” he said.
Meanwhile, the government is seeking to reassure Britons that the UK can build strong and profitable trade ties outside the EU.
May said she spoke yesterday to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who expressed a desire for a free trade deal with Britain as soon as possible.
“It is very encouraging that one of our closest international partners is already seeking to establish just such a deal,” May said — although Britain can’t make any new arrangements until it actually leaves the EU.

THE RUNAWAY FAVOURITE to become Britain’s next prime minister has vowed to push for an EU trade deal that limited immigration, as her most high-profile challenger struggled to brush off claims of treachery.
“The Brexit vote gave us a very clear message that we couldn’t allow free movement (of people) to continue as it had,” interior minister Theresa May said of last week’s stunning decision to leave the European Union.
“It’s important we get the right deal about controlling free movement, but it’s also about ensuring that we get the best deal possible on the trade of goods and services,” May, who campaigned to stay in the bloc, told ITV political show Peston on Sunday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted that a British trade deal would have to include freedom of movement, but French finance minister Michel Sapin later said that all issues were “on the table”.
May said she would seek to “guarantee” that EU nationals already in Britain would be protected by any change in the immigration law, and said there was “no timescale” for leaving the union.
May is polling around 30 points higher than closest challenger Michael Gove among Conservative Party members, who will decide Cameron’s successor, according to an ICM survey published in the Sun on Sunday.
She has the strong backing of the party’s MPs, who will whittle the five candidates down to two, but insisted it was in the best interest of the party that “there should be a contest” rather than a coronation.
However, she once again ruled out holding another general election before 2020.
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Enda Kenny is developing the concept of an all-island forum following Brexit, Health Minister Simon Harris said onRTÉ’s The Week in Politics.
He said that it will see groups from north and south of Ireland working together on issues.

“Boris was not the man and this was not the time”
Stefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
Former education minister Michael Gove was expected to be her stiffest opponent, but appears to have alienated MPs over his last-minute withdrawal of support for close referendum ally Boris Johnson in order to launch his own bid.
“I love my country, I could not recommend that Boris be prime minister,” he told BBC’s Andrew Marr show today, when faced with accusations that he had knifed his friend in the back.
“He was not the man and this was not the time,” he said of Johnson, who decided to pull his bid following Gove’s defection.
Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote in the Mail on Sunday that Gove had “knifed Boris Johnson in the back and in the front, pushed him under a bus, ran over him several times and then declared he was running for the leadership himself,” calling him a “political psychopath”.
Gove’s waning popularity has opened the way for Brexit campaigner Angela Leadsom to become the main challenger, but she also woke up to difficult headlines after it was revealed she had said in 2013 that leaving the EU would be a “disaster”.
Energy minister Leadsom, who has now overtaken Gove with the bookmakers, told the BBC she changed her mind when it became “very clear that the EU is just not reformable”.
She called May “a superb candidate” but argued that the country needed to be led by “someone who fervently believes and understands the opportunities of leaving the EU”, and who would “get on with” the process of leaving the bloc.
Both main parties are gripped by turmoil, and embattled opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn warned rebelling Labour MPs today that his grassroots supporters would oppose any attempts to unseat him.
Corbyn has the crucial backing of the unions and was elected last year in a landslide by ordinary Labour party members, but last week lost a no-confidence vote of party MPs by 172 to 40.
“I am ready to reach out to Labour MPs who didn’t accept my election and oppose my leadership,” he wrote in the Sunday Mirror.

However, we’re still two months away from the UK’s In-Out referendum on EU membership, so what’s all the fuss about?
At its heart, the Dutch people were asked a simple question:
Are you for or against the Approval Act of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine?
Passing of the measure was required for the EU to forge closer links with Ukraine. The measure had been passed by prime minister Mark Rutte’s government in January, but had to be put to the Dutch people.
While only 32% of Dutch people turned out, 61% voted against the measures.
The Netherlands is now the only member in the 28-nation EU not to have ratified the Ukraine accord which has already been given the thumbs up by both the upper and lower houses of the Dutch parliament.
Rutte agreed “the ‘no’ camp won convincingly”.
What happens next?

Nobody really knows.
It remains unclear what will happen next, with Rutte vowing a “step-by-step” approach in full consultation with the government and EU leaders Brussels. Official full results are only due on 12 April.

The other thing to note is that the vote is non-binding. It could, however, mean that the coalition government – already under fire due to the refugee crisis – will seek to opt out of certain provisions of the EU-Ukraine deal to satisfy the voters.
It could also be a boost for the Dutch far-right, with Geert Wilders’s Freedom Party (PVV) which is already riding high in the polls due to his stand against migrants..

The deal is a lot less important to the EU than the membership of Great Britain.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said today that he hopes voters approach the referendums differently as they are “very different issues”.
However, that hasn’t stopped UKIP’s Nigel Farage from jumping on the issue.
Farage said Dutch campaigners could come to Britain to help in the Leave campaign.
“I look forward to working with them,” he said.
Dutch Leave campaigners say that they’ll get involved, urging Britons to vote to leave the EU.
“Nobody could accuse the Dutch of not being good Europeans, but they have no willingness to open their borders to more migrants and pick up the tab for Ukraine’s problems, just like most UK voters,” said Leave.EU spokesman Brian Monteith.
The vote was a signal to the British to follow suit, he said, adding: “The sun is now setting on the European Union.”

Ananalysis by the Economic and Social Research Institute(ESRI) suggests a Brexit could have serious consequences for Irish trade, with a reduction in bilateral trade flows between Ireland and the UK of 20 per cent or more.
Irish companies and those close to the border, which rely on sales to Northern Ireland would, be most affected. According to the ESRI, the reduction in foreign direct investment in the UK as a consequence of the Brexit would be damaging to the Irish economy.

Though there are suggestions that additional projects may relocate to Ireland, the institute said this change would be very small and, in fact, countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland would benefit more.
A Brexit could also mean increased energy costs for Ireland.
If Ireland was forced to build a new interconnecter with mainland Europe, the cost could be upwards of €10 billion.
The British government is committed to holing a referendum on a Brexit following negotiations on key issues of concern for the UK.

Speaking at the Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith commemoration in Glasnevin cemetery he said this would not be achieved ”through assimilation or the crude majoritarianism in a border poll”.
Varadkar said this must be achieved “through respect and consent”.
His statement today comes two months after Taoiseach Enda Kenny raised the possibility of a border poll as part of negotiations over the UK’s departure from the EU.
Since soundings of a united Ireland were voiced by those in Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, who have long called for a border poll, have pounced on the expediting of a poll and push for a united Ireland.

With some in the media, tipping today’s speech as having elements of a “leadership speech”, any stage the minister takes to in the near future will increase speculation.
Today he drew comparisons between what future Collins and Griffith wanted for Ireland and how his party hopes to make it a reality.
He said Fine Gael followed Collins’ idea of taxation, that it should ”encourage rather than discourage industry”.
Pointing to some of his windfall tax system announcements of late, the minister said:
Recently, Varadkar has been making waves in his new portfolio, announcing plans such as a new welfare scheme forsmall loans for people, plans to raise dole payments for those that are newly unemployed on tax and social welfare, and one the raised the most eyebrows, givingIreland’s local councillorstwo options to improve the terms under which they pay tax.
‘Taxation is not the solution to all’
Varadkar said there was a need to “advance and expand the recovering economy so that more people are free to order their own life; they are free to achieve their ambitions and their dreams”.
“It is the role of the government to help make that happen,” he said”
There is one obstacle in Ireland’s way, according to Varadkar.
Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-eu-referendum-tory-vote-905546-May2013/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER David Cameron is bracing for a fresh rebellion from his backbench MPs this week, with close to 100 Conservative MPs set to defy him in a parliamentary vote.
Tory divisions over Britain’s membership of the European Union – which never far below the surface – have burst out into the open once again ahead of the expected vote on Wednesday.
Eurosceptic MP John Baron has tabled a non-binding motion expressing “regret” that last week’s Queen’s Speech, which set out the government priorities for the year, did not include a promise to legislate for a referendum on EU membership.
Cameron has promised to hold a referendum if his party wins a majority at the next general election in 2015. Currently the Tories share power with the smaller pro-EU Liberal Democrats.
Reports suggest 100 MPs are likely to support Baron’s motion – a third of the Conservatives’ parliamentary party, and an increase on the 81 Tory MPs who demanded a referendum in a 2011 vote.
Cameron’s office has said he is “relaxed” about next week’s vote, but it emerged this weekend that ministers have been told they cannot support Baron’s amendment and should abstain.
It would be unprecedented for ministers to vote against their own government’s Queen’s Speech, but many Eurosceptics in the cabinet would also likely refuse to openly condemn a motion which reflects their own views.
Amid front-page newspaper headlines proclaiming “Tory civil war” and “Tories in Europe turmoil”, senior Conservative ministers took to the airwaves on Sunday to try to calm the storm.

“You can’t have a civil war when everyone is on the same side,” said education secretary Michael Gove, who claimed that the “overwhelming majority” of Tory MPs wanted a different relationship with Brussels, and admitted that he believed leaving the EU would be “perfectly tolerable”.
But Gove said the rebels simply “want to let off steam” and insisted Cameron’s promise to renegotiate Britain’s terms of membership with the EU, before putting them to a public vote in 2017, was the right approach.
However,Baron wrote in the Sunday Telegraphthat the prime minister’s pledge “is not yet believable”.
He said legislating for a referendum “would put this right” and vowed in the coming weeks to seek “every means possible to bring legislation to parliament”.
Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also backed the prime minister’s plans in television interviews and confirmed they would abstain in next week’s vote.
May said she had “every sympathy” with the rebels but added: “I don’t think it’s right for ministers to effectively vote against the programme we put forward in the Queen’s Speech.”
Hammond was asked if he shouldn’t therefore vote against Baron’s motion, and for the Queen’s Speech.
“I wouldn’t want to vote against it and allow that to be misinterpreted as in any way questioning our commitment to, our belief in, the idea of a referendum,” he said.

FRESH FIRES BROKE out in the ‘Jungle’ on the second day of operations to dismantle the squalid migrant camp in northern France, sending people fleeing with their few belongings.
Huge clouds of black smoke billowed over the sprawling settlement near the port city of Calais, which the French authorities said they expect to finish clearing by the evening.
PA WirePA Wire
Scores of riot police were massed on the outskirts of the Jungle, where the flames destroyed many of the tents and makeshift shelters that had housed the thousands of migrants and refugees including children.
“We have it within our means to close the waiting lines by this evening. After the last migrants are taken in hand, the lines will close,” senior local official Fabienne Bucco told AFP.
Migrants and officials alike said the fires that blazed through the camp overnight and early today were set deliberately, while exploding gas cylinders caused them to spread.
Police said four migrants had been arrested on suspicion of arson.

An Eritrean teenager named Yones said Afghans had started the fires.
“They are angry because the Jungle is finished and they cannot go to England,” Yones said.
Many migrants could be seen taking selfies with the flames in the background.
“You have to leave,” an aid worker shouted at some migrants.
Scores of people escaped to an area just outside the camp. Police barred them from going back in and they were seen on the road, some carrying backpacks and suitcases.
Around half of the camp’s estimated population of 6,000 to 8,000 migrants have been transferred out since Monday, boarding buses to centres around France.
Nearly 800 unaccompanied minors – whose fate has been a key cause of concern on both sides of the Channel – have been moved to shipping containers converted into temporary shelters in the Jungle, according to the interior ministry.
Meanwhile, workers in orange overalls ramped up demolition operations, tearing down tents and makeshift shelters at the lawless camp that has become a symbol of Europe’s migrant crisis.
Fires broke out on Tuesday within hours of the start of the demolition.

He said London had committed to reviewing all other cases where it was “in the child’s interest” to settle across the Channel.
Earlier this week, British interior minister Amber Rudd pledged to bring eligible children from France to Britain “as quickly and as safely as possible”, without specifying numbers.
The head of Save the Children then called for a smooth process to ensure their safety.
“It’s very scary, I think, for kids particularly… This is where children have been living for weeks and months in some cases,” Carolyn Miles told AFP in New York.
‘There’ll be another Jungle’
Britain took in around 200 teenagers in the week before the clearance began, with the transfers resuming yesterday after a pause on Monday.
Dozens of mainly Eritrean and Ethiopian women, who make up a tiny minority at the Jungle, staged a protest today to demand attention to their own needs.
“Underage, overage, we are the same!” they shouted.

Located next to the port of Calais, the Jungle has for years been a launchpad for migrants attempting to make it to Britain by sneaking onto lorries or jumping onto trains heading across the Channel.
Calais police have battled near-nightly attempts by migrants to reach Britain over the past year.
The authorities have said those who agree to be moved can seek asylum in France. Those who refuse risk deportation.
Many locals fear more settlements will sprout up in the area once the Jungle is razed.
Aid worker Christian Salome said migrants still bent on reaching Britain were looking for places to stay in and around the city of Calais.
“I’m staying here,” said Kanami, a Pakistani. “There will be another Jungle.”

Updated 9.25pm
EU LEADERS WARNED Britain over its “unacceptable” reform demands and urged greater unity on the migrant crisis at a summit marking the end of one of the bloc’s toughest ever years.
David Cameron was told by Francois Hollande and other top officials in the European Union that his calls for limits to benefits for EU workers in Britain threatened the 28-nation club’s core principles.
The British premier vowed to “battle through the night” to make progress towards a deal at the next EU gathering in February, before holding a referendum on Britain’s membership by the end of 2017.
But with Europe already deeply split by a year that has seen a record inflow of nearly one million mainly Syrian refugees, crises in Greece and Ukraine and terror attacks in Paris, his counterparts were in little mood for compromise.
“If it is legitimate to listen to the British prime minister, it is unacceptable to revise founding European commitments,” French president Hollande told reporters as he arrived in Brussels.
European Council President Donald Tusk added that “some parts of the British proposal seem unacceptable,” while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged Cameron to come up with alternatives.
“We want a fair deal with Britain but this fair deal with Britain has to be a fair deal for the other 27 too,” Juncker said.
The first significant discussion of Cameron's plan is likely to take place later today.PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
Cameron has broad support for his goals of greater protection of non-eurozone members, for an exemption from the EU’s goal of “ever closer union” and for greater economic competitiveness.
But the rest of his counterparts, with the exception of Ireland and Denmark, oppose his demand for a four-year limit before EU migrants working in Britain can claim benefits such as social housing or child welfare payments.
Germany’s powerful chancellor and potential deal-broker Angela Merkel said she wanted to avoid a so-called “Brexit”, but would “not limit the fundamental principles of the EU.”

Eastern European countries have benefited hugely from the ability to live and work elsewhere in the EU, especially in Britain, which says it’s on track to overtake Germany as the union’s most populous nation by 2050.
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia said they “will not support any solutions which would be discriminatory or limit free movement.”
The summit — the EU’s 12th this year, a record — is also dealing with the migrant crisis and the threat it poses to the Schengen area, the cherished European passport-free zone that symbolises that ideal of free movement.
Wide rifts have emerged after Merkel opened Germany’s doors to Syrian refugees, causing huge strain on transit countries and prompting several to suspend the Schengen rules and reintroduce border checks.
The EU leaders are debating a plan for a new border and coastguard force that could intervene in member countries — even without their consent — in order to shore up frontiers and stem the tide of migrants.

Yet many states are worried the plan means ceding sovereignty to Brussels, including Poland and Greece, the country that has seen by far the biggest number of migrant arrivals.
With Europe facing its biggest migrant crisis since World War II, Merkel said she “strongly supports” the border guard scheme, while Tusk — a former Polish premier — said any other solution would be “equally painful”.
Merkel also hailed a “very good” meeting between 11 EU states and the Turkish prime minister on the sidelines of the main summit to discuss a plan to resettle thousands of Syrian war refugees directly from camps in Turkey.
But an EU report today said that a three-billion-euro ($3.2-billion) deal with Ankara in November to keep more refugees on Turkish soil had so far had little effect on the number of people crossing to Greece.
Other plans have been bogged down by divisions, with a deal for member states to take in 160,000 refugees from overburdened Greece and Italy resulting in just 208 people being relocated so far, largely due once again to opposition from eastern Europe.
EU leaders meanwhile look set to roll over sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict, despite Italy insisting on delaying the decision from last week so that it could be discussed at the summit.

NORTHERN IRELAND’S HIGH Court has rejected a legal challenge to Brexit – the first judicial ruling on the issue in the UK.
“In respect of all issues, the court dismissed the applications,” judge Paul Maguire said this morning.
With other legal challenges under way elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the verdict will be closely monitored by politicians and financial markets.
A cross-party group of politicians claimed Northern Ireland should have a veto on leaving the European Union, and the Northern Irish Assembly should have a say on whether to trigger exit negotiations with Brussels.

The claim was brought alongside a linked challenge on the impact of Brexit on the Northern Irish peace process.
The claims rested on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace accords, which assumed that Northern Ireland’s constitutional arrangements could only be changed with the consent of its residents.
The verdict comes after three days of hearings earlier this month.
“While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blow cannot yet be determined so there is a level of uncertainty, as evidenced by the discussion about how the Northern Ireland land border with Ireland was affected by withdrawal from the EU,” said Maguire.
In the 23 June referendum on EU membership, 52% voted for the UK to leave the European Union. Within Northern Ireland, 56% voted to stay.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-populist-farce-2834352-Jun2016/,"THIS YEAR’S REFERENDUM campaign has been marked by insults, accusations and counter-accusations.
Spearheaded by the right-wing dominated leave campaign, immigration has become the central focus, with the opposing side becoming known as ‘operation fear’ versus ‘operation bigotry’.
Yet, any old footage from the UK 1975 referendum on EEC membership reveals debates examining potential economic, political, social and cultural implications for entry into the common-market.
Drab, wooden BBC studios showed debates that laid out well-argued positions, save for the occasional outburst by Enoch Powell.
John Moore/ YouTube
These have been replaced by new media driven soundbites where such outbursts have become the norm.
In short, content has been replaced by sensationalism.
The debate has changed
There are many reasons why this sensationalism and negativity has replaced rational debate in 40 years.
TheChrisg00/ YouTube
There has been the obvious change in the way media and politics is presented amidst the technological and digital revolution. There has been a transformation in the delivery of politics into its contemporary form of spin, 24-hour broadcasting and the constantly updated web activity.
The second reason for the change can be attributed to Britain’s own unique way of dealing with EU membership.
Since their entry, the EU has always been understood as a negative necessity and one that politicians gain brownie points for attacking or winning battles against.
Indeed, even Jim Hacker in the fictional ‘Yes Minister’ saw a popular attack on standardising the ‘Euro sausage’ against its British equivalent as the way of winning support for his ascension to 10 Downing Street.
Advertisement
There is a great deal in this explanation and this can certainly go some way towards understanding the negativity behind the current referendum debates. In short, if there is a problem in some way with the British political system, blaming the EU has become a common way of getting out of a cul-de-sac for several governments.
Disillusionment
However there is a deeper reason and one that is not just restricted to Britain. There is a growing cynicism with the political class that has been brought about by a decade of austerity.
This has been coupled with a disillusionment in general society that has gradually occurred as a result of the wider process of globalisation. The failure of all governments to adequately keep up with the speed and volatility of global markets, economic production and technological change has led to a new form of protest politics.
AP / Press Association ImagesAP / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
In the era of austerity it has been the emergence of Occupy, of anti-austerity demonstrations across southern Europe and, closer to home, of water charge protests that have arrived on top of a succession of extra charges and cuts that have been popular.
Politically the growth of far right parties can be attributed to their representing this disillusionment. Despite the emergence of the Irish branch of Pegida, Ireland has escaped this development. In Britain however, which had traditionally prided itself with a lack of a far right party, Pandora’s Box has been opened.
The breakthrough of the BNP in 2001 has seen a whole collection of far-right parties from the aggression of the EDF to the ‘little Englander’ mentality of UKIP. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have taken this to the mainstream, with an anti-immigration campaign that has come straight from the 1930s.
Distorted reality
Untruths, half-truths and blatant bigotry, backed up by a popular press have led –as a report has recently shown– to an understanding of the EU that is totally distorted from reality.
In response, the Remain Campaign has been on the defensive, without seemingly taking much of an interest in correcting such falsities. Instead they are making threats of a post-Brexit doomsday.
The EU referendum in theory presented an opportunity for citizens to debate a possible future for the EU, or look at a change to the international order. Instead it has debated an increasingly narrow agenda that has set a very dangerous precedent through its preoccupation on immigration.
The accusations and claims from its chief protagonists have ensured that it has descended into a modern-day farce, carefully stage-managed through the forces of new media.
Yet whatever happens to the political parties which have been torn apart by the referendum, the long-term effect might be more damaging. The Pandora’s Box that has been opened to unleash a set of reactionary movements and assumptions have now been seemingly accepted into the mainstream. These are indeed worrying times.

BARACK OBAMA WARNED Britain against leaving the European Union today, undercutting a key argument of eurosceptics by saying London would be “at the back of the queue” for a post-Brexit trade deal.
The US president’s detailed comments on the 23 June membership referendum at a press conference with Prime Minister David Cameron drew a furious reaction from campaigners to leave the European Union.
Standing alongside Cameron at the Foreign Office in London, Obama said Britain was “at its best when it is helping to lead a strong Europe”.
The president, whose term ends next January, made an unusually detailed and heartfelt intervention in the politics of another country and repeatedly spoke of the “special relationship” between Britain and the US.
But his most significant remarks in nearly an hour of comments came on trade, reflecting growing concern in Washington at the prospect of Britain leaving the EU.
Asked what would happen if Britain did vote to quit, Obama said that while “maybe at some point” it could seal a trade deal with the US, “it’s not going to happen any time soon.”

“The UK’s going to be at the back of the queue,” Obama added.
Anti-EU campaigners like London Mayor Boris Johnson have made the claim that Britain could cut free trade deals with allies around the world a key plank of their argument for leaving the bloc.
Nigel Farage, leader of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party, immediately dismissed the president’s comments on Twitter.
“President Obama won’t be in office by the time we’re out of the EU post-referendum,” he wrote. “Trade deal of course in both countries’ interests.”
For his part, Cameron restated his case for Britain remaining in the EU, a close fight which will define his political legacy.
“Now I think is a time to stay true to our values and stick together with our friends and allies,” he said.

Micheál Martin brings up how the State treats victims of sexual abuse.
The Fianna Fáil leader says he recently men a man who suffered “horrific abuse at the hands of a Christian Brother”, who was later convicted of abusing him and others.
Martin questions why this man has received “absolutely no compensation”.

Enda Kenny mentions his previous meeting with child sex abuse survivor and campaigner Louise O’Keeffe.
He describes child sexual abuse as a “horrific crime” that victims have to deal with for the rest of their lives.
The Taoiseach adds that it “wouldn’t be appropriate” to comment on a case that he doesn’t have the full facts about, in relation to the man Martin mentioned.
Martin says seven of 210 cases before the courts have been settled, adding that survivors have been to “hell and back”.
Kenny says many more survivors may be yet to come forward.
Kenny notes that the State set up a claims scheme for victims of child sexual abuse in schools.
It was set up after Louise O’Keeffe won her case in the European Court of Human Rights in January 2014 after a two-decade legal battle.

Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams is now bringing up Brexit and the impact this could have on Northern Ireland. Adams says the Irish government should not back away from its responsibilities in this regard.

Kenny says he has asked every minister to engage with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.
He says a North-South Ministerial Council meeting next month will provide an opportunity for ministers to discuss Brexit further.
Adams is now asking if the government has reached agreement with the UK on immigration controls at Irish ports and airports.
He says this is his fourth attempt to get Kenny to answer the question and he has written to the Ceann Comhairle about his “refusal” to respond.
There’s laughter in the chamber when Adams says anything Kenny says “could be written down and used in evidence against you”.
Kenny replies by saying no one wants to see a hard border return in Ireland.
He says it’s not yet clear what will happen in terms of immigration and freedom of movement once Britain officially leaves the EU, describing these as “challenges” that need to be worked out.

Independents 4 Change TD Joan Collins is now calling on the government to close tax loopholes that see certain people and companies pay less tax than they should.
Kenny says Michael Noonan has “closed many loopholes in his time as Minister for Finance”.
He encourages Collins to put forward amendments to the Finance Bill in relation to concerns she has about inheritance tax.

Michael Healy-Rae is now discussing the issue of moving people from congregating settings into independent community living.
The independent TD says that while independent living is suitable for some people, others need to live in centres with special facilities.
He says it is wrong to close centres such as St Mary of the Angels in Beaufort, Co Kerry, noting that some families won’t be able to cope without them.
Kenny says “good progress” has been made in terms of helping people move on from congregated living.
“The focus here has to be on the person concerned,” Kenny says, adding it is important to note “there is no imminent closure” planned for St Mary of the Angels.
He says the HSE is working with families to devise individual plans for people at the centre based on what is best for them.
Healy-Rae says facilities such as St Mary Of The Angels are centres of excellence and need to remain open to help families.
“Where are these people supposed to go to?,” he says, reiterating that independent living is not suitable for many people with profound physical and mental disabilities.
Kenny says he is aware of this, but adds there are other people in these centres who will have a “much better” quality of life if they move out.
He says people who do not fall into this category may still be housed in these facilities and will receive the support they need.
That’s it for Leaders’ Questions this afternoon, join us again tomorrow for another round.

SIX LABOUR SHADOW cabinet ministers in the UK have now quit in a heave against Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.
The BBC reports the move by some of the party’s top players is a bid to force its leader to step down after the shock Brexit vote.
It emerged in the early hours of this morning that Corbyn had sacked a key member of his cabinet – shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, who was rallying party members to resign if the Labour leader refused to stand down.
A Labour spokesman said Corbyn had “lost confidence” in Benn,the BBC reported.
The resignation of the party’s health spokesperson Heidi Alexander followed. She said she was stepping down “with a heavy heart”.
The BBC reports Ian Murray, Gloria de Piero, Lillian Greenwood, Lucy Powell and Kerry McCarthy have now also resigned. Defence spokesperson Vernon Coaker said he is considering his position

The losing camp
Corbyn had joined Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to campaign for Britain to remain part of the European Union.
Cameron was the first casualty of the losing “Remain” camp, stepping down as leader on Friday morning after it emerged that Britain had voted 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the EU.
Two Labour lawmakers have tabled a vote of no confidence against the opposition leader yesterday, reflecting the anger felt by many MPs as the results of Britain’s vote to leave the EU began to sink in.
Corbyn has faced accusations that he lost the referendum by failing to rally his party’s core working-class voter base, more than a third (37%) of whom who defied their party leadership to back a Brexit in Thursday’s historic referendum.
‘We will never be forgiven’
“This is sad news indeed and I cannot understand how Jeremy thinks it will help his worsening position with the PLP,” Labour MP Roberta Blackman-Woods tweeted following the sacking of Benn, using the party’s official acronym.
“The Labour Shadow Cabinet must now act to save the Party and for the sake of the country. Otherwise we will never be forgiven,” tweeted fellow party lawmaker Ben Bradshaw.
Corbyn has dismissed the vote of no confidence, but the issue will likely dominate a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday.
Any challenger would need the support of 20 percent of the party’s 229 MPs and it would then be put to party members, who propelled the veteran socialist to power only last September.

EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE a lot of work to do at a summit in Brussels to reach a deal to prevent Britain becoming the first country to crash out of the bloc, EU president Donald Tusk has warned.
British Prime Minister David Cameron urged his counterparts on day one of the tense two-day meeting to reach a “credible” reform deal that would allow him to hold a referendum on EU membership in June.
But in the face of concerns from France and eastern European countries, Tusk warned that the initial round of talks had left much more to do to reach an agreement to rule out a so-called “Brexit”.
“For now I can only say that we have made some progress but a lot needs to be done,” Tusk told a brief press conference, before rushing off to a fresh round of overnight bilateral talks with key leaders.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared largely supportive of Cameron’s stance as the EU seeks to maintain unity so it can focus on the larger worry of the migration crisis.
“The agreement’s not easy to take for many but good will is there. We are ready to compromise because advantages are higher than disadvantages when there is Brexit,” Merkel told reporters.
Meanwhile Taoiseach Enda Kenny warned: “I think it may be longer than they think.”
‘Live and let live’
Cameron, under pressure from eurosceptics in the Conservative Party and a hostile right-wing press, says he will back a Yes vote in the referendum if he can cut a deal in Brussels.
Failing that, he has said all options are open, refusing to rule out the possibility that Britain could become the first country to leave the EU in its more than 60-year history.
With the clock ticking, Tusk held face-to-face talks with Cameron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker late into the night in a bid to overcome the final hurdles to a deal.
Tusk also met French President Francois Hollande, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka.
Hollande has reservations about Cameron’s demands for safeguards for countries that do not use the euro currency, while sources said Michel was “very determined” in his objections to calls to exclude Britain from the EU’s goal of “ever closer union”.

The Czech premier meanwhile leads a group of four Eastern European countries that object to Cameron’s request for a limit to welfare benefit payments for EU migrants working in Britain for four years.
In an impassioned speech to his colleagues, as the summit began, Cameron called for a “sort of live and let live” approach to reach a deal.
He urged them to secure “a package that is credible with the British people”, adding that the issue of Britain’s place in Europe “has been allowed to fester for too long” and that there was now a chance “to settle this issue for a generation”.
‘No right to veto’
Three years after Cameron announced he wanted to reset Britain’s ties with the European Union, the talks are going down to the wire with highly technical disagreements in all key areas.
But the principle behind them goes to the heart of the EU — the British vision of a loose trade union versus the post-war European federal ideal — and tests the EU as it faces a colossal influx of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East.
Hollande said earlier that he wanted an agreement and that it was “possible” — but warned that “no country can have the right to veto” eurozone states.
The issue raises particularly sensitive questions around banking regulation as Britain is home to the City of London, one of the world’s leading financial centres.
Meanwhile Brussels has offered an “emergency brake” to limit benefits for new migrants for four years, which Britain could invoke if its welfare system is overwhelmed by the inflow of workers, as it believes it has been.
But Poland and other eastern European member states who have hundreds of thousands of citizens in Britain bitterly oppose such a change, saying it would discriminate against them and undermine the EU’s core principle of freedom of movement.
Cameron has staked his political reputation on winning the referendum in the hope of ending a feud over Britain’s place in the EU that has plagued his Conservative Party for decades.
Britons voted overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU in a 1975 referendum, just two years after joining.
Recent opinion polls suggest a narrow lead for those who want to stay in the EU but there does seem to have been a modest increase in the No camp. Many voters are thought to be undecided.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-david-cameron-brexit-referendum-2849524-Jun2016/,"AS THE RESULTS became clear early on Friday morning, several things happened: the markets reacted furiously; my Twitter feed lit up; Nigel Farage cackled; and somewhere in Downing Street, David Cameron, just 13 months on from leading the Conservative Party to their first overall majority since 1992,began writing his resignation speech.
Cameron has been a solid if unspectacular prime minister who has guided the UK out of the financial crisis that met him when he first took office to a position of low unemployment and strong economic growth. But ultimately his downfall was the Europe question: the UK’s position within Europe has divided the Conservative Party since Margaret Thatcher battled European Commission President Jacques Delors in the 1980s over the increasing influence of Brussels, and every leader since Thatcher has struggled as a result.
How the Tories got here
Thatcher was succeeded as prime minister by John Major, a committed pro-European, who fought fierce battles with his backbenchers over the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the Maastricht Treaty which would see a rump of Tory activists set up the UK Independence Party.

Tony Blair’s New Labour swept Major and the Tories from power in 1997 to the soundtrack of D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better. Major was replaced as leader by the new young superstar, William Hague who saw off the prominent pro-European Minister, Ken Clarke. Early on Hague came out strongly against the UK joining the euro. In 1999 he led the Tories to a strong result in a European Parliament election that saw UKIP elect three MEPs for the first time.
However in the 2001 general election, Hague was defeated easily by the popular Blair whose premiership had yet to be tarnished by the decision to invade Iraq. A rare plus for the Tories though in 2001 was the election of a number of new MPs such as Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson. Hague was replaced by the softly spoken Iain Duncan Smith, a committed Eurosceptic but a weak leader who was ousted within two years as he failed to get close to Blair despite the difficult times.
Duncan Smith was replaced by the old war horse Michael Howard, a favourite of the Eurosceptic backbenchers, who railed against immigration and asylum seekers in a bruising but unsuccessful general election campaign in 2005 that would be Blair’s last.

The battle to succeed Howard was fierce with Ken Clarke once more contesting against Eurosceptics Liam Fox and David Davis as well as the shiny new Cameron. Cameron finished ahead of Clarke in the first round of voting, but with Clarke’s withdrawal and tacit endorsement, Cameron held on to take  the leadership.
An appeaser from the outset, Cameron appointed his three leadership rivals to his shadow cabinet alongside former leaders like Hague and Duncan Smith.
Cameron’s battle with the Eurosceptic wing
In order to nullify the very vocal Eurosceptic wing, Cameron pledged as part of his leadership campaign to remove the Tory MEPs from the European People’s Party – European Democrats (EPP-ED Group) in the European Parliament. The centre right EPP-ED Group was the largest Group in the European Parliament, with MEPs from my own party Fine Gael, the German Christian Democrats, Nicolas Sarkozy’s UMP as well from governing parties in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria amongst others.

At the time I was working in the Parliament in Brussels for Gay Mitchell, the Tory offices were in the same tower as ours, occupying the entire 14th floor at the very top. A large group, the Tory MEPs were bitterly divided with a strong Eurosceptic wing led by columnist Dan Hannan, new MEPs like Syed Kamall, and old stagers like Roger Helmer who would ultimately defect to UKIP. On the other hand were a pro-European majority made up of many MEPs who had lost their seats in 1997 having been ministers under John Major,  as well as some traditional pro-European Tories who had been in the parliament since the 80′s.
The acrimony between the MEPs was not hidden and their group meetings were infamous for rows and MEPs often had to be pulled apart. Visiting the 14th floor was never fun even for a supposed neutral outsider. The staffers generally got on, once politics wasn’t discussed, but the atmosphere was icy and trouble could be around any corner.
Cameron’s pledge to leave the EPP-ED was thus a dividing issue. The majority of Tory MEPs reluctantly backed it as a sop to the Eurosceptic wing – all except for Edward MacMillan Scott, a veteran MEP for over 20 years who defected to the Liberals in protest.
Following the 2009 European elections, Cameron sent William Hague, his shadow foreign secretary, to negotiate a withdrawal and to cobble together a new home for the Tories. The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) Group was the product with support from Eurosceptic and Conservative MEPs from Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic.
In 2010, Cameron led his Tories to a partial victory in the general election, forming a coalition government with Nick Clegg’s fiercely pro-European Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems proved a key neutralising impact on the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party who attempted a few revolts but were hampered by numbers. Because of this, support for the European Fiscal Stability Treaty came easily and the UK provided a bilateral loan to Ireland when a bailout was required. Indeed, Cameron was a friend to Ireland and clearly had a good personal as well as professional relationship with Enda Kenny.

Following the 2014 European Elections, Cameron once again was forced to appease the Eurosceptics in his own party and attempt to neutralise UKIP who won big in the European elections, taking many seats from the Tories. With an eye on the 2015 general election, Cameron pledged to hold a straight in or out referendum on the UK’s continued membership of the EU. A big gamble which meant it was game on for the party. Cameron was now seemingly untouchable from either wing, as they campaigned to fight the opposition rather than each other.
Following a defeat of the Scottish independence referendum and with the Tories in a position to govern on their own after the 2015 general election, a confident Cameron sought a series of reforms and concession from his fellow heads of state in the European Council. Receiving what he thought was a good deal, Cameron declared a referendum would be held by 2017 and that he would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU.
Cameron’s legacy
A fairly bland Prime Minister, not dissimilar to Major, Cameron never excited the people. He was young and fresh but didn’t have the charisma of Blair, the depth of Brown or the polarising nature of Thatcher. An appeasing Prime Minister like Neville Chamberlain, he simply didn’t have the personality to carry a referendum campaign. His one-time friend Boris Johnson did –  but Johnson, with one eye on his own future aspirations following a successful term as Mayor of London, opportunistically threw his weight behind the Leave campaign with dissident Cabinet members like Michael Gove and Theresa Villiers.

The Remain campaign benefitted from vast swathes of mainstream support from business leaders, celebrities, academics and the vast majority of MPs, although the Tories split relatively evenly.
In the end the result is written in black and white. There was never a mass desire for a referendum on the EU. A small chunk of the Tory party and UKIP were the only ones leading the charge. Together, these two groups were a serious minority in the wider political scene but a significant thorn in Cameron’s side, Cameron desperately wanted to be prime minister and while he wasn’t found wanting in terms of the effort he put in to the campaign, ultimately it was his desire to appease that brought about the referendum in the first place.
Referendums are horrible things. They are rarely decided based on the matters directly at hand. General unhappiness, mislaid concerns about immigration, outdated nationalism and one lady’s annoyance with her local Council for not removing a tree saw the Leave side victorious and David Cameron’s stint as prime minister come to an unedifying end.
The great appeaser, Cameron’s six years as prime minister will solely be remembered for this referendum defeat. A defeat that ultimately was wholly of his own making.

The motion reads:

The decision to campaign against leaving the EU puts the UUP at odds with the DUP who announced last month that they would be campaigning to leave.
Party leader Arlene Foster made the announcement last month after David Cameron’s EU deal was revealed, saying that “on balance” they will be recommending a vote to leave.
Foster said that her party “has always been Eurosceptic in its outlook” and that,
Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party are all recommending that the UK stay in the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-sun-defends-misleading-queen-headline-2775310-May2016/,"THE SUN NEWSPAPER has defended a headline which was slammed by the UK’s press watchdog as “significantly misleading”.
The paper had published a front page with the headline “Queen Backs Brexit”. That led Buckingham Palace to lodge a complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO).
The Palace alleged the story breached clause one of the press code in that it was inaccurate. IPSO upheld the complaint, ordering The Sun to publish its decision and a remedy.
The IPSO ruling said that the headline was “not supported by the text”.
Despite the ruling and the fact that the complaint was the first by a reigning UK monarch, the paper defended themselves today.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4 this morning, editor Tony Gallagher says the paper didn’t make a mistake.
“Do I accept we made a mistake? In all conscience I don’t.
In an editorial today, the paper doubled down on the claim.
“Does the Queen back Brexit? We’re sure she does.
“A newspaper wouldn’t be a newspaper if it got wind of such views, so clearly in the public’s interest to read, and didn’t publish them.”
The paper published a front-page article under the headline “IPSO rules against Sun’s Queen headline” which continued on page 2.

There were 599 incidents of race hate crime reported to the Met from Friday, 24 June to Saturday, 2 July 2016.
A substantial number of malcontent racists appear emboldened by the United Kingdom’s seemingly imminent withdrawal from the continental system.
The daily average of hate crimes in the UK capital is 67 since Brexit, up from 44 before Brexit.
Last year’s daily average after 24 June was also just 44.
There have been 216 more offences in June of this year, compared to June 2015, a 19% rise.

https://www.thejournal.ie/thejournal-ie-factcheck-donald-trump-brexit-irish-passports-2767102-May2016/,"
TWO OF THE the biggest global news stories of 2016 – the rise of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, and the UK’s forthcoming referendum on its EU membership – have both taken on an odd Irish slant, lately.
Reportsandclaimshave circulated that fears of a Trump presidency after November’s election is causing some Americans to make alternative living arrangements, as it were, and put their ancestry to good use by applying for an Irish passport.
Likewise, there is said to have been a “rush” for Irish passports among British citizens hoping to retain an EU passport in the event of Brexit.
But is there really evidence to back up these claims? Do the numbers stack up? Time to do some digging.
Remember, if you see a claim you’re not sure about, send it tofactcheck@thejournal.ie.
Claim 1:Fears of a Trump presidency are causing a rush for Irish passports in the USVerdict:Cannot be verified. There has been a recent increase which was above average, but there are plausible alternative explanations for this, and no evidence to support the causal link being claimed.
Associated PressAssociated Press
There are two main issues here. First, is it true that Irish passport applications have been rising in the US, and by how much? And secondly, to what extent is fear of Trump’s election to blame?
The numbers
To get a full, detailed picture, we asked the Department of Foreign Affairs for the number of Irish passport applications, both first time and renewals, throughout the entire world, for every month between January 2013 and April 2016.
We got a whole lot of data back, from 59 different Irish embassies and consulates on every continent, and crunched the numbers.
To test the claim, we used the same point of comparison as the news websiteIrish Centraldid earlier this week – the nine months before and since Trump’s candidacy announcement on 16 June 2015.
Here’s what we found:



This would appear to give credence to the claim that Trump’s run for the White House has, at least,accompaniedan increase in the number of Irish-Americans and Irish in America acquiring or renewing an Irish passport.
Finally – what has the trend been like since the start of the year, as Trump established his dominance over Republican rivals, and the prospect of his victory became more realistic and proximate?
We got the number of first-time applications from January to April this year, and compared the trend to the average number of first-time applications in the same period, between 2013 and 2015.

As you can see, the actual number of applications has been significantly higher in the first four months of this year than in the last few years.
But thetrendhas been inconsistent, and not the steady increase you might expect if growing fears of a Trump presidency were, as is claimed, a driving causal factor in changes in demand for Irish passports.
However, this does not show that Trump’s run for the White House isnota contributing factor to the increase. For example, other factors could, theoretically, have caused the numbers to dip between February and MarchdespiteTrump-related anxiety.
But neither does it show that itisa contributory factor, not to mind the leading or even sole factor.
‘Correlation does not imply causation’
Firstly, there is no objective, quantifiable evidence that anyone – whether Irish-American, or Irish in America – is being motivated by fear of a Trump presidency (or fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency, or of a Clinton vs Trump campaign, for that matter) in applying for a new passport.
Applicants submitting paperwork to Irish embassies and consulates around the world are not asked why they are doing so. Anything beyond that is merely anecdotal.
Secondly, there are several alternative explanations for the recent increased interest in an Irish passport.
There is no evidence that these have actually caused or contributed to that increase (just as there is no evidence a political campaign has), but here are just two.
Tourism
Sam Boal / Photocall IrelandSam Boal / Photocall Ireland / Photocall Ireland
In 2015, 185,000 more tourists from the US and Canadavisited Irelandthan in 2014.
If just 438 (0.2%) of them returned to the US, inspired, in the last nine months, and decided to take advantage of their Irish granny and get a passport for their Summer 2016 holidays, that would account for the entire increase in applications seen during the Trump campaign.

Furthermore, US tourism to Europe as a whole has beenincreasing every year since 2011. In 2015, 706,644 more Americans visited Europe than in 2014.
A tiny portion of those rising numbers planning a trip to the continent this summer, and strategically opting for an EU member state passport, would explain the increases attributed to fear of a President Trump.
Jobs

If that trend continued in 2015, and into this year, it could be the case that US citizens wanting to make life easier for themselves by acquiring an Irish passport also contributed to the increase.

Claim 2:Brexit fears are causing an increase in the number of Irish passport applications from BritainVerdict:Cannot be verified. There has been a moderate recent increase, by one measure above average, but there are plausible alternative explanations, and no evidence to support the causal link claimed.
We can take it that the same warnings about causation apply to this claim as applied to the first one.
There is no objective, quantifiable evidence that fear of British exit from the EU is motivating those applying for Irish passports (again, whether first-time or renewal).
And there could be several other explanations and contributory factors (as there always are) for the changing rate of applications.
So let’s turn to the numbers, which is a bit trickier for this one, since there is no single event across which we could compare application rates.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron first promised the referendum in January 2013. But since the data we have only goes back that far, we cannot compare any time period before it.
He announced the date of the referendum in February, which intensified the public debate and news coverage that had been growing over the past two years.
However, our data is only as recent as April, and a two-month margin is too small from which to draw any inferences.
In March,the Guardianclaimed that:
Those figures do not reconcile with the data given to us by the Department of Foreign Affairs this week, but a comparison between 2014 and 2015 seems like a good place to start in gauging the possible link between intensified Brexit fears and first-time passport applications in Britain.

So the demand for Irish passports in Britain has risen in the past year, and it has risen further than it did across the rest of the world.
However, there was actually adecreasein the number of British applications between 2013 and 2014, perhaps providing a lower base for the subsequent 6.5% increase.
So, if we re-frame the data slightly, and in a reasonable way, given the prospect of Brexit was first significantly introduced at the start of 2013, we can see that demand for Irish passports has grown by a much smaller rate in Britain than everywhere else in the world, over the past two years.
Let’s look again at the first four months of this year, as the June referendum draws closer, and public debate and scrutiny intensify.
Again, we took the number of first-time applications from January to April 2016, and compared them to the average numbers for those months, between 2013 and 2015.

As you can see, the actual numbers in 2016 have been significantly higher than the numbers seen in 2013-2015.
However, thetrendhas been virtually identical, indicating that the steady increase in first-time applications so far this year is not out of the ordinary for January to April.
PAPA
This doesn’t prove that Brexit fears arenota contributing factor in demand for Irish passports. Just as that 17.4% increase in the US doesn’t prove that the growing prospect of a President Trumpis, in that case.
Without hard evidence as to the specific motivations behind passport applications, and given the tendency for regular, seasonal fluctuation in demand for Irish passports shown in the data, it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from recent trends.
And it is essentially impossible to attribute those trends to one specific factor, when there are always several at play – employment and tourism in the destination country, and economics and population shifts in the country of origin, for example.
Because of the absence from both these claims of proper evidence that the stated “fear” is actually causing the increased demand for Irish passports, and given the principle that the burden of proof should fall on anyone who makes such a claim, it is tempting to rate them as false.
However, the data does show a recent increase in Irish passport applications in the US and Britain, and by some measures that increase has been above the global average – especially in the American case.
The specificcausesbeing attributed, however, remain neither proven nor disproven.
For this reason, we rate these claims – that fear of a Donald Trump presidency and a British exit from the EU is driving up Irish passport applications –Impossible to Verify.

‘Sun Wot Won It’
The Sun, part of the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, is credited with generally backing the winning side and famously claimed to have swung a general election in 1992.
Its headline “It’s the Sun Wot Won It” claimed credit for the Conservative party’s victory because of the paper’s campaign against the Labour leader Neil Kinnock – and became something of a catchphrase.
The Leave campaign seems to be gaining an edge in polling, meanwhile.
According to a survey published inyesterday’s Guardian, the Leave side is six points ahead when ‘don’t knows’ are excluded, opening up a 53% to 47% lead.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-uk-ireland-2809506-Jun2016/,"WHILE BREXIT HAS been on the radar for some time now, it is only in the last week the campaign on this side of the Irish Sea has kicked up a gear.
In just under two weeks, the people of the UK will vote on whether or not they want to remain part of the European Union. Debate has been raging in the UK media – and the Irish government isn’t shying away from making its voice heard either.
Ireland has been putting work in behind the scenes for over two years, preparing for either outcome in the referendum.One senior government source said it would irresponsible not to.
Why so concerned?
The government’s position is it wants our nearest neighbours to stay. Officials are pretty worried about the ramifications if the UK parts company with the EU.
Ireland’s campaign has intensified with the announcement that Taoiseach Enda Kenny is to meet UK Prime Minister David Cameron in Manchester in the coming week.
Speaking recently, Kenny said a Brexit would likely have an adverse impact on trade between the two countries.
He also suggested a possible return of border or customs controls, saying that such issues would require “some very serious negotiations” between the governments of the two jurisdictions.
The Kenny visit is the culmination of the recent cross-channel charm offensive. A steady conveyor belt of ministers have already been sent across the water to meet with Irish communities.
Diplomatic channels between Ireland and other European countries have also been tended to. Government officials are effectively telling anyone who will listen they think a Brexit would be bad news for Ireland.
In addition to all thatthe government has even thrown its weight behind the social media initiative ‘#phoneafriend’ which encourages people to get in touch with family and friends in the UK and urge them to cast their votes for the ‘Remain’ camp.

Bob Geldof asks Irish to#PhoneAFriend:https://t.co/Zcn8NjHDis. Watch this. Its great and powerful
Meantime, a special inter-departmental taskforce has been established to look at the Irish response in either outcome.
The Northern question
What would a Brexit mean for Northern Ireland?
That’s been the main issue grabbing the headlines on this side of the Irish Sea – and this weekBritish Chancellor George Osborne travelled to the North for a two-day trip to make the case for staying in.
Osborne also raised the issue of a return of border controls if the UK left Europe, and also insisted the move would trigger a “profound economic shock”.
The possible need to reimpose border controls is being taken seriously by the government, which has already examined how many customs officers and border control units would be necessary if Britain leaves the European Union. Revenue is investigating the practical implications – like how much reinstating the border checks would cost.

Trade
Aside from the question of the North, there is also the interdependence of the two economies to consider, with €1.2 billion worth of trade taking place between the UK and Ireland each week. The UK exports more to Ireland than it does to Brazil and China combined.
How the markets react to the initial result is also of concern, with assessments showing Sterling could devalue 10-15% in the short term after a ‘Leave’ vote. It almost goes without saying, that would have a major impact on trade and tourism.
The government is very conscious of the impact a ‘Leave’ vote could have on Irish workers in the UK, with concerns raised at the highest political and official levels.
Other concerns surround the impacts it could have on other industries such as agri-food and fisheries, as well as the financial industry.
Impact on agriculture
Focusing on just one sector, the Irish Farmers’ Association President Joe Healy and the new agriculture minister Michael Creed both warned that a British exit from the EU would be very damaging for the farming and food sector in Ireland.
Healy said the UK is the most important agri-food export market for Ireland, accounting for over 40% of Irish agricultural exports.
Minister Creed said some 800,000 jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on UK trade in the Irish economy.
Michael FitzmauriceRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
The other side
There are some in Leinster House who disagree that a Brexit would be a catastrophe, meanwhile. Former Independent Alliance TD Michael Fitzmaurice, who declined to join his colleagues in the independent grouping in government in the wake of the election, said the UK should leave the EU.
According to the Roscommon-Galway deputy:
He said there are many other countries outside the EU which are “fully functional” and have bilateral agreements with the EU.
The two year ‘cushion’ for an exit would allow for planned procedures to be put in place, according to Fitzmaurice. He added:
What could a Brexit aftermath hold for Ireland?
On another political level, Sinn Féin has been calling for a border poll in the event of a ‘Leave’ vote.
According to Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness:
And while in reality it’s difficult to predict what will happen in the event of a ‘Leave’ vote, the government is continuing to collect inputs from a range of stakeholders in the private and public sector.
It should be stressed – while the government here acknowledges that the UK and Ireland have a special relationship, any negotiations held after the referendum would be between all 28 member states, not just Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hotels-survey-2956846-Aug2016/,"THE COST OF a room in a hotel for one night’s stay rose by €10 last year, according to figures in a new national survey.
The Crowe Horwath Annual Ireland Hotel Survey for 2015 shows that the average room rate for hotels across Ireland now stands at €92.15, up from €82.29 in 2014.
The survey also shows that business is picking up in hotels across the country, with the national average room occupancy level standing at 71.1% last year, up from 67.8% in 2014.
As with other years, Dublin leads the charge in terms of growth and average cost.
Occupancy stood at 80.7% in the capital last year, and the average rate charged for a room in Dublin was almost €112, up from €97 in 2014 and a whopping €20 above the national average.
Hotels in Dublin are significantly more expensive than other areas, with rooms along the western seaboard costing on average €74.20 per night.
Other notable figures from the survey include:
The survey also shows that Dublin hoteliers earn twice as much pre-tax profit per available room as their counterparts along the western seaboard.
Pre-tax profit per room stood at €16,913 in the capital against €8,053 in the western seaboard.

Weddings
The weddings market has also bounced back “in a strong way” for regional areas, especially for hotels in the midlands and the east,Crowe Horwath partner Aiden Murphy toldFora.ie.
“We’ve seen greater spend on weddings in 2015 on the back of higher consumer spending and confidence,” he said.
A lot of hotels priced down their wedding products in 2011 as the sector dwindled, he explained.
Brexit
Commenting on the report in general, Murphy said 2015 had been a good year for the hotel industry and 2016 was set to continue that trend.
“2016 looks very positive and is set to deliver another year of growth for the Irish hotel market as overseas visitor numbers increase, as employment and the economy improve further,” he said.
But Murphy warned that the effect of the UK’s decision to leave the EU could have unforeseen consequences for the industry.
“The effect Brexit and the recent falling Sterling rate will have on the Irish hotel sector in 2016 is relatively unknown,” he said.
“Travel plans are unlikely to be changed for 2016 but future visitor numbers could be affected.

Southeast England was hit by up to 1.75 inches of rain overnight — roughly the average for all of June — and another band of thundery rain swept through this afternoon.
Doug Wilson, a flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, told AP that “torrential downpours across the South East, including London, could lead to further surface water flooding and significant disruption to travel.”

A handful of polling stations in London opened late or had to relocate because of flooding, while signal failures caused by flooding shut down sections of the London Underground subway system and several train lines into the capital.
The Rail Delivery Group said train services would be severely disrupted this evening and people should head home early if they can.
Thousands of people crammed into Waterloo and other London train stations, eyeing signboards full of cancelled and delayed trains.
The disruption could hit the turnout for Britain’s referendum on whether to stay in the 28-nation EU, since many people go to polling booths after work.

THE PRESIDENT OF the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker was deeply unimpressed to be heckled by a UKIP MEP today.
Juncker was addressing a plenary session of the European Parliament in Brussels today, ahead of EU leaders meeting to discuss the UK’s withdrawal from the union.
Juncker called on UK Prime Minister David Cameron to clarify quickly when Britain intends to leave the EU, saying there can be no negotiation on future ties before London formally applies to exit.
“I will see the prime minister later this morning… to ask him to clarify the situation as rapidly as possible. We cannot get into a period of extended uncertainty,” Juncker told the European Parliament, adding: “No notification, no negotiation”.
“It cannot be that people now secretly seek to start negotiations,” he said.

Having received sarcastic applause for saying “we must respect British democracy” from UKIP MEPs, Juncker rounded on them to applause from many in the chamber.
“That’s the last time you will applaud (this speech).
“It’s a pleasure,” replied Farage, who was a leading figure in the campaign to leave.
UKIP is the largest British party in the European Parliament, having 22 members.

Giving his own speech, Farage was widely jeered, prompting Martin Schultz to call on members to be democratic and listen to him.
“When I came here 17 years ago and said I wanted to lead a campaign to leave, you all laughed.
“Well, you’re not laughing now, are you?”
Farage went on to say that the EU as an institution was “in denial”.
“The reason the UK voted the way it did was because you have, by stealth, imposed upon them a political union.
“Last Thursday was a remarkable result. It was a seismic result.
“We now offer a beacon of hope to democrats across Europe.”
Farage added that no deal with the EU would be better than the current deal and that any punitive exit deal would be worse for the EU than the UK.
“We will trade with you, co-operate with you and be your best friend in the world, but let us go and follow our global ambitions.”

Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats called on the UK to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and leave the EU immediately.
He said that only an immediate withdrawal of the UK would end the “uncertainty and toxic climate”.
“We do not need a lot of imagination. We need a healthy memory to get back to the principles of our founding fathers.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-debate-room-leave-versus-remain-2834312-Jun2016/,"TO BREXIT OR not to Brexit?
That is the big question of the week. On Thursday,areferendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union will be held across the water.
The result will bring serious repercussions across Britain, Ireland and the EU.
Is it a good or bad idea?We asked two commentators – on opposite sides of the debate – to give their views on a number of issues:
Why the UK should vote remain

AS THE LARGEST group of non-British voters, Irish emigrants are likely to have an effect in determining whether Britain remains part of the EU or votes to leave. For obvious reasons, there is a certain whiff of hypocrisy against any migrant arguing for Brexit.
Free Movement
A large percentage of my 2009 graduating class left Dublin for the UK with young professionals and many college-educated Irish unable to find jobs during the recession. They have benefitted from easy access to cities such as London, Manchester and Glasgow.
Of course, free movement hasn’t just benefited those from Ireland. The EU has meant that I’ve been able to meet Greek artists, Italian nurses, Romanian computer programmers and Spanish engineers. London can often feel like a unique cultural blend of talented people from all over Europe, and the world.
While certainly some of these migrants would still choose to apply for visas to move to London, plenty of others would likely find it just as easy to move to Paris or Berlin.
While migration is often blamed for scarce resources such as school places and NHS spaces, the reality is that outside of the Irish, the largest migrant group in the UK, EU migrants are less than 5% of the British population and disproportionately contribute to the British economy.
Those concerned with pressures on the NHS should be far more worried about the effects of Jeremy Hunt and the Tories, or the difficulties of replacing the massive number of EU migrants working within the NHS, than the mythical EU patients overrunning A&E.
Northern Ireland
While it is unlikely that a Brexit would have an effect on the residency rights and travel opportunities of Irish citizens, it is certainly concerning to hear David Cameron argue, as he did in this week’s Prime Minister’s Questions, that if Britain left the EU, there would need to be either new border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic or some form of border checks when travelling between Northern Ireland and Britain.
Abortion
As a volunteer for the Abortion Support Network, I am particularly concerned that this will affect women travelling for abortion services. While the majority of women who travel from Ireland are unlikely to suffer any ill effects besides price of airfare, migrant women or women without the resources to hold a passport could greatly struggle to travel on short notice.
It is concerning to think that travelling and residency in the UK could become a socioeconomic issue – allowing those with money and resources to easily move to the UK while young college graduates like myself and my friends struggle. It would be far from the Britain I am proud to currently consider my home.
Stefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
Democracy
In the recent weeks, likely distancing themselves from Nigel Farage’s attempted to copy Nazi propaganda, the Conservative Brexiters have attempted to use talking points regarding sovereignty.  “Leave and take control,” says Michael Gove repeatedly on Question Time.
It is, of course, deeply ironic that a campaign which includes members of the unelected House of Lords can argue for a worry about democracy – a campaign which allowed for an election of Britain’s upper house and head of state would increase British democracy far more directly than opposing the European Parliament (directly elected) and the Council of Ministers (elected by their respective member states).
Advertisement
Funding
There’s also a financial argument, that the funds put into the EU would be better off distributed by the British government. Ignoring the likelihood that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage would begin funding services they have slowly allowed to haemorrhage, Irish voters know better than most the benefit of EU funds for culture and infrastructure.
Regions like Cornwall and areas like the arts and science rely on EU funding to fill the gaps left by the current government. Projects such as developing sustainable energy in Cornwall may not make particularly sexy headlines, but these quiet works do make environmental and financial impacts.
Irish voters in Britain understand better than most British the benefits of EU funding, protection of rural communities, and freedom of movement – all the more reason to support a Remain vote on 23 of June.
Why the UK should vote leave

IN IRELAND, THERE was much talk about the 1916 rising this year. Here in the UK, the debate has been whether the UK should leave the EU. The same fundamental issues underpin both debates: independence, sovereignty and the right of a people to govern itself democratically.
Democracy
I will be voting to leave the EU because my paramount hope is that my children will grow up in a true, functioning democracy.
I love Europe; my English wife is half-Italian, and we have family and friends across the continent. I hope Brexit will trigger referenda elsewhere, giving our European friends a say about the increasingly-centralised EU hegemony rising amongst us. Brexit will set back the EU’s undemocratic drive towards becoming a federal pan-European superstate. If an independent UK prospers, others will follow.
EconomyThe UK, outside the Euro, already prospers – sometimes creating more jobs than the rest of the EU combined. Norway, Switzerland, Canada and Australia also thrive outside the EU.
Yet Project Fear promises world war three and economic devastation. Irish voters have even been threatened with an Iron Curtain in Fermanagh – despite the UK parliament committee which says its “priority” would be “an arrangement that maintains a soft land border”.
Such scaremongering can’t hide the fact that the EU’s core project – the euro – is a disaster. The German-led political control required to sustain it has led to deep resentment and the disturbing rise of far-right politics.
Euro membership took away Ireland’s ability to control interest rates, which poured petrol on the housing boom and exacerbated the 2008 bust. Ireland ended up a vassal state of the troika, with billions in private bank debt and unpopular diktats foisted upon it.
Ireland’s budget was even found being passed around the Bundestag before our TDs saw it. When Ireland does not vote as directed in referenda, we’re told, “vote again”.
PA Wire / Press Association ImagesPA Wire / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
Contempt for ordinary people
We have seen the elected leaders of Italy and Greece deposed. When the French and Dutch people rejected the EU Constitution, it was dressed up as the Lisbon Treaty and implemented anyway, even after the Irish rejected that too.
The EU’s contempt for democracy is astonishing. When I worked in Brussels as a lawyer, I arrived a starry-eyed, pro-EU 20-something but soon witnessed the contempt for democracy and ordinary people held by many in EU circles.
MigrantsKey decisions are now frequently taken outside the EU institutions, largely by Germany. Last year, Angela Merkel threw open Europe’s doors to over a million un-vetted migrants. I admire Germany’s humanitarian motives, but governments need to be accountable.
In the EU, people in Poland or France – who cannot remove Angela Merkel from office – must live with her decisions. Germany threatened its neighbours into taking the migrants it had invited. Sympathy for genuine refugees plummeted. The lack of vetting also meant that terrorists who committed the massacres in Paris last autumn used these uncontrolled migrations to enter Europe. This is how democratic accountability breaks down.
EliteThe EU is an elite project that railroads ordinary people towards its stifling, homogenised utopia. It is the working class who suffer most. The fiscal straitjacket of the euro has inflicted mass unemployment to southern Europe. Is Irish sympathy with the underdogs, or Goldman Sachs and Jean Claude Juncker?
Real economic growth is in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Leaving the stagnant EU and going global could benefit the UK – and therefore Ireland. Yet even if the most fearful economists are right, the UK and Ireland will still be rich countries post-Brexit, just perhaps slightly less so. Being slightly less rich seems a like pathetically small price to pay for democracy, when so many laid down their lives for it in the past century.
Democracy is new to much of Europe. As an East German, Ms Merkel herself only tasted democracy for the first time in 1990. Most EU countries have been dictatorships within living memory; Spain and Portugal were until 1982. Only Britain, Ireland, France, Sweden and a few other nations have a long history of democracy and a visceral urge to defend it.
My hope is that a more democratic Europe of peaceful, prosperous, freely trading independent nation states will emerge. Voting leave seems the best way to achieve that ideal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-protections-in-budget-2017-3021475-Oct2016/,"THE BUDGET FOR next year was announced yesterday by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan.
In his introductory speech before the Dáil, one of the first issues mentioned by Noonan was the issue of Brexit – and how to deal with the threat it poses to the Irish economy.
The Minister’s exact words were:
He said that the Brexit result had encouraged his department to “reduce its forecast for GDP growth for next year to 3.5%” and said it wasn’t “possible to forecast the impact of” Brexit right now.
Noonan also stressed the importance of putting “in place safety nets to protect us against future economic shocks” and announced a list of measures that would do so, including:
For businesses, there are a whole host of other measures:
A number of measures have been introduced to help small business owners - but some say they don't go far enough to protect against Brexit.Shutterstock / mavoShutterstock / mavo / mavo
But Patricia Callan of the Small Firms Association (SFA) said thatBudget 2017 was something of a “missed opportunity”, particularly in the fallout from Brexit.
Callan says that the budget they have seen is“not at all Brexit-proof”.
“Hopefully the measures introduced will bring capital back into the market, but we need more support for small businesses should they fail,” she says.
The Sinn Féin spokesperson for Jobs Maurice Quinlivan agreed, saying that €3 million was “a pathetic sum of money and totally inadequate” for the challenges faced because of Brexit.
“The challenge is to protect cross border trade, the export trade and jobs; the government should be leading this campaign.

Although the Minister said these measures were in direct response to Brexit, it’s difficult to separate what is a Brexit policy and what is a policy to improve already difficult conditions for Irish workers – such as those implemented for struggling farmers.
Maurice Quinlivan went a step further, disagreeing that the VAT rate for the hospitality sector should be maintained, and argued that it was being used as an excuse to avoid reforming the the sector’s approach to pay and work conditions.
“Using Brexit to justify allowing the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector to continue unchanged says much about in whose interests the current government operates.
In terms of cross-border retail competitiveness, Lynn Drumgoole of Retail Excellence Ireland said that the “failure of the government to reduce the 23% VAT in light of Brexit, means we are losing competitiveness and retail jobs will be lost”.
Brexit is a moving target

As Michael Noonan said at the beginning of his speech, it’s unknown what effect Brexit will have on the British or Irish economy, so introducing measures to safeguard Irish workers and businesses is difficult before knowing what exactly needs to be protected.
This is especially difficult as €1 billion is not that much ‘fiscal space’ to play with – especially with a housing crisis, the worsening problem in the healthcare system, and civil servants requesting pay increases.
Liam Lynch of the all-island group Chartered Accountants Ireland put it best when he said that although the indigenous businesses are “helped by Budget 2017, more must be done to prepare for Brexit”.
“The Government now needs to look beyond tax adjustments to tackle areas such as the mobility of Irish and UK citizens between our nations post-Brexit. The services sector needs the Government to look atcross-border accreditation of skills and qualificationsafter the UK has left the EU.
“We need to develop for ourselves what post-Brexit arrangements look like, before others do it for us,” Mr Lynch concluded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-1930899-Feb2015/,"A UK EXIT from the European Union would be a “big blow” to Ireland – and would force the government to make some hard decisions about this country’s own future within the bloc, one expert says.
Economist Colm McCarthy said if the move went ahead after a planned referendum it would likely push the UK and US – Ireland’s two biggest trading partners – closer together, leaving the Republic in a difficult position within the EU.
“If it were to happen I think there would be very serious consequences for Ireland under a number of heads,” he said.
“I think Ireland has more at stake in all of this than any other EU member.”
McCarthy was appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to talk about the implications of the UK turning its back on the EU – a scenario dubbed a “Brexit”.
Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged a referendum on the UK’s EU membership if the Conservatives are re-elected in May.
McCarthy said one of the key issues if a Brexit happened would be travel between the UK and Ireland as the Republic wouldeffectively became the EU’s northern border.
While it was likely Irish and UK citizens would be able to continue the two countries’ long-standing policies of free movement, new border controls would need to be put in place for other European nationalities.

“That could be very awkward for the border counties because you could end up with passport controls, you could end up with customs,” McCarthy said.
Economist Colm McCarthy
UK opinion split
Recent polls have shown Cameron’s ruling Tories areonly likely to win government as part of a coalition, which might cause the referendum to be scuppered.
Public opinion within the UK on leaving the EU has been evenly split over the past year after strong sentiment towards abandoning the union in 2012 and 2013.
More-recent surveys have show UK residents favour staying in the EU but under renegotiated terms.

McCarthy said it would be a “huge blow” if the UK left the EU and the Irish government should get involved in pre-referendum talks with the Conservatives to plan the Republic’s response to a Brexit.
“And the answer is not that bad, necessarily – if you cut the right trade deal and the right deals on free movement of capital and free movement of labour.
“You wouldn’t have much voice at the table when decisions are made, but many people would argue we don’t have much voice anyhow.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-magill-2882652-Jul2016/,"FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin says that he hopes the UK’s Brexit vote will eventually lead to a referendum on a united Ireland.
Delivering the John Hume lecture at the MacGill summer school in Donegal, Martin says that the Brexit vote is a “defining moment in Northern politics”.
A majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU while the UK as a whole voted to leave.
“It may very well be that the decision of Northern Ireland to oppose the English-driven anti-EU UK majority is a defining moment in Northern politics,” Martin said.

“However, at this moment the only evidence we have is that the majority of people in Northern Ireland want to maintain open borders and a single market with this jurisdiction, and beyond that with the rest of Europe,” he added.
The Fianna Fáil leader also said he welcomed the government’s promotion of an “all-island approach to Brexit” before adding that any discussions must be inclusive.
Martin also took aim at the media and the government for a “hands-off detachment” on Northern Ireland issues.
“It is a sad reality that our government and our media have tended to ignore Northern Ireland except when there is a crisis,” he said.
Martin’s comments come as his party overtookFine Gael as the most popular party in the country, according to a poll in the Sunday Business Post.
The poll put Fianna Fáil at a support level of 29% compared to 26% for Fine Gael.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-2-2839267-Jun2016/,"IT’S THE BIG DAY.
This morning Britain goes to the polls to decide whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.
It’s been months of debates, back and forth arguments between the Remain and Leave sides, and relentless campaigning from both camps – but now it’s all set to come to a head.
The next 26 or so hours could change the face of EU and with it the rest of the world.
Here are the times of when everything will play out:
Thursday 7am: Polls open
About 41,000 polling stations across the UK will open and eligible voters will be able to cast their vote.
Thursday 10pm: Polls close
Polls will close at 10 tonight and thousands of ballot boxes will be transported from polling stations to one of 212 counting venues across the UK – where counting will begin.
A sign points towards a referendum polling station in London,Matt DunhamMatt Dunham
Thursday 11.30pm: Local turnout figures start to be announced
There will be 382 individual counts for each council area across Britain, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. It shouldn’t take too long for the local turnout figures for areas to be announced.
Counters will have to verify that all the votes have been accounted for and they can then issue a local turnout figure. The earliest of these is expected at about 12.30am (probably from Sunderland).
Friday 12.30am: First local results begin to be announced
This is when things will start to get interesting.
The first local count results are expected to start coming in around now. There will be a big discrepancy between individual counts – with results for some areas coming in much earlier than others.
The UK Electoral Commission has adownloadable spreadsheet on its websitewith the expected declaration times of all the local counting areas.
The three earliest expected times are:

Friday 3am-4am: Majority of local results announced
The majority of local results will be announced by this point, however there will still be some stragglers.
Friday4am: Regional results will start to be announced
After the local results are totted up, each of the 12 voting regions will start to announce their results – and by now the overall picture may start to become clear.
The first regions to report will be the ones with smallest populations. So Wales, Northern Ireland, London, etc.
Areas like Wales and London are expected to be strongly pro-Remain, so an early lead when these regions declare is to be expected.

Friday 6-7am: Final regional results will be announced
The overall result of the vote should be fully clear after the majority of the regions announce their results.
The Eastern, North West and South Eastern regions will be the final to declare and they should have their results in by7am.
Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes – who outlined key areas to look out for when the results are declared – said that certain “bellwether” areas will give the picture better.
“Watch for ‘bellwether’ areas like England’s eastern and southern coasts, the East Midlands and Cumbria,” he said.
Friday breakfast time: National result announced
Once all the regional results have been announced, Jenny Watson, the chief counting officer (CCO), will declare the national result at Manchester Town Hall.
It is not certain when this result will be but it is expected about breakfast time.
Friday mid-morning: David Cameron announcement
Whatever the result, UK Prime Minister David Cameron will be obliged to give an announcement following the national result declaration.
Only time will tell whether it’s a celebratory speech or an acknowledgement of defeat.
Friday lunchtime: Expected statements of EU leaders
Leaders from across the EU (including Enda Kenny) will give speeches about now. And much like David Cameron’s statements, it what they will say won’t be known until the final results are in.
Expect announcements, speeches and statements from both sides of the referendum and all the groups associated with the campaign as the counting gets underway and the fate of Britain and Europe goes to the polls.

THE UK GOVERNMENT has said that it “doesn’t recognise”a leaked memo suggesting that it has no overall plan for leaving the EU.
A Government sourcetold the BBCthis morning that the document was an unsolicited pitch for work from a consultancy firm.
The Times UK earlier reported thatdivisions in cabinet meant a plan and overall negotiating strategy may not be decided upon for six months, according to the memo.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she hopes to invoke Article 50 – which will set in motion the formal process of the UK leaving the EU – by March of next year.
However, the memo is reported to state that there is still no common exit strategy “because of divisions” between ministers.
The leaked Cabinet Office memo – written by an unnamed consultant – is also critical of May who it says is “acquiring a reputation of drawing in decisions and details to settle matters herself”.

It also states, it’s reported, that the government does not have enough officials to implement Brexit quickly, with individual departments developing individual plans resulting in ”well over 500 projects”.
It states that an additional 30,000 extra civil servants may need to be hired to handle the workload.
Newspaper story
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling denied that it was a Government memo and rejected its contents onBBC Radio 4′s Today programme.
He said that while the upcoming negotiations between Britain and the EU would be “complex”, it would not be “the challenge that is set out in today’s newspaper story.”
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Enda Kenny will meet with Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster today in Dublin, to discuss Brexit.
The DUP leader had previously declined an invitation to the all island Civic Forum to discuss Ireland’s position as the UK prepares to leave the EU.
The two will likely discuss Brexit and the effect it will have on both the North and Republic of Ireland.

May described the talks with First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness this morning as “constructive”.
She said she recognised the “particular circumstance” Northern Ireland finds itself in, as it has a land border with the Republic. She said all parties were keen to find a solution that would be in the best interests of Northern Ireland.

Before travelling to Northern Ireland, May said in a statement that she would lead a government that works for every part of the UK.
“I want to assure the people of Northern Ireland that I will lead a government [that] works for everyone across all parts of the United Kingdom, and that Northern Ireland is a special and valued part of that union,” said May.
Cross-border relations with the Republic of Ireland are a prime concern for Northern Ireland in Britain’s departure from the European Union.
It is the United Kingdom’s only land border and would become its only frontier with the EU when Britain leaves the bloc.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-government-plans-brexit-3009427-Oct2016/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS announced the date for the first meeting of the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit.
It’s part of its plans for dealing with the British exit from the European Union, which it detailed in a statement today.
In the statement, the government said it is intensifying its preparations for Brexit. The news comes  following the UK Prime MinisterTheresa May’s announcement at the weekendthat she would trigger Article 50 to start EU withdrawal before March 2017.
All-island meeting
The meeting will be hosted by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Charlie Flanagan on 2 November in Dublin.
Invitations will be extended to a broad range of civic society groups, trade unions, business groups and non-governmental organisations as well as representatives of the main political parties, both north and south.
TheJournal.ieunderstands that Kennywill invite Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Fosterto the all-Ireland Brexit forum despite her shooting down the idea in June.
Kenny first floated the idea of an all-island forum after Britain voted to leave the European Union that same month.
However, on a visit to Dublin, the DUP leader pointedly told the media that such a cross-border forum would not be happening.
But the Taoiseach pressed on with his plans and announced on the first day of the new Dáil term last week that the forum would be taking place.
The conference programme will assess the implications of Brexit across the main areas of concern for Ireland, including:

“The format would be highly interactive with each area being initially framed in terms of the key challenges, after which a discussion will take place to tease out the issue further,” said the government statement.
Preparations
The Cabinet also discussed today the preparations for the negotiations that will have to take place.
In the coming weeks, preparations will be ramped up, with closer political and official engagement with Northern Ireland, the British Government, and the EU Member States and institutions.
Following the government meeting today, the Taoiseach reaffirmed that Ireland’s priorities were the economy and trade, the peace process and Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself.
“Now that we have clarity from Prime Minister May regarding the timetable, we will intensify our engagement and preparation for the negotiations. Ireland faces unique challenges from Brexit, not least given the all-island issues that arise,” he said.
Kenny said he will continue to engage with Northern Ireland party leaders on the range of issues involved.
He said the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Summit in Armagh in November will  be “hugely significant” in completing a Brexit audit of North/South programmes. How to best protect the peace process and North-South interests in the upcoming negotiations will also be on the agenda.
Budget
Other than the all-island dialogue, the government said next week’s Budget will include measures that will support the overall economic response to Brexit.
Despite criticisms from opposition parties that the government was ill-prepared for a Brexit result, the government said there has been a “contingency plan” in place for over a year.
The government maintains it has been proactive in highighting Ireland’s Brexit concerns “at the highest political level in Europe” through the Taoiseach’s participation in European Council and EU 27 meetings, as well as separate bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, Prime Minister May, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk.
In the statement today, it said it had been working closely with the Northern Executive through the North South Ministerial Council to optimise North/South planning for Brexit.

However, given the UK is one of Ireland’s closest trading partners, the fear remains that any of the negative implications of Brexit are likely to be felt in Ireland to a greater extent than almost anywhere else bar Britain itself.

Britain will go to the polls on whether or not to stay in the EU next year and a new RedC poll finds that in the EU, the UK is the only country where a majority of those with an opinion would elect to leave – 54%.
Across the 14 EU states polled, the average number of those who would leave is 32%. In Ireland, however, that number is just 22%.
The research shows that the youngest and oldest adults in Ireland are more positively disposed to the country’s membership status with both those under 25 (86%) and those over 65 (90%) favouring to stay in the European Union should a vote be cast.
For those currently unemployed, Ireland’s European Union membership is more contentious, with just under 7 in 10 (68%) stating a preference to stay if asked in a referendum.

Greeks, who voted against a European-backed referendum on their bailout last year, are now more in favour of EU membership than this time last year – 62% now want to stay versus 53% one year ago.
Sentiment is dropping, however, for the Euro in some countries.
Almost one in two (47%) would prefer their national currency, an increase from 44% last year. But again the picture is varied between countries.
In those without the Euro there is very little appetite for it – UK 6%, Sweden 12%, Romania 26%, Denmark 13% and Bulgaria 9%.
However of those countries currently using the Euro, support has increased over the last twelve months in France, Germany, Greece, Ireland and Spain.
Italy has seen the greatest shift in opinion where a plurality (47%) would now prefer a return to the Lira.

NIGEL FARAGE CLAIMS there would be “zero threat” to trade between the UK and Ireland if Britain voted to leave the EU.
The leader of the eurosceptic Ukip party’s comments came as Taoiseach Enda Kenny told a London conference of business leaders that the UK leaving the union was a “major strategic risk”.
FaragetoldRTÉ Radio 1′s Morning Irelandhe expected a concerted push from European politicians, the heads of multinational corporations and “unelected commissioners” ahead of a possible UK referendum on a so-called Brexit.
“Indeed, just as Ireland had in the run-up to the Nice referendum, when of course we should remind ourselves that the Irish people said no, only to be told that really isn’t good enough Ireland – you’re a little country you must rethink this and vote again and you were bullied into submission the second time around,” he said.
Economic think-tank the ESRI last week saidbilateral flows in goods and services could be cut more than 20%, putting the potential cost to the Irish economy at €3 billion a year.
Kenny today raised the spectre of job losses in both countries with the re-introduction of trade barriers between Ireland and the UK, adding that Northern Ireland would be the worst-affected region in the event of a Brexit.

“Ireland’s commitment to the European Union is unqualified … I have no doubt that continued British membership of the European Union is good for Ireland and for relationships on these islands,” he said.
An earlier report from the London-based Open Europe think-tank suggested the cost to the Irish economy would beanywhere between 1.1% and 3.1% of GDP by 2030.
Extra costs would also include securing a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to stem the free flow of EU citizens and goods into the UK. A European Movement/Red C pollearlier this year found77% of Irish people wanted to stay in the EU, even if the UK left the union.

‘Zero threat’
But today Farage claimed there would be “absolutely zero threat to Irish trade” in the case of a Brexit.
When asked if Ukip had worked out what would happen to the Irish border, he said the two governments had a deal that predated the EU by “nearly 7 decades” and there was “absolutely no desire” in the UK for that to change.
Farage in Dublin, 2012Laura Hutton / RollingNews.ieLaura Hutton / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“I think what’s really interesting is that there is hardly a eurosceptic voice in Ireland, in politics, or in the media and yet twice in the last 15 years the Irish people have voted no to European treaties,” he said.
Taking back control
Farage pointed toSwitzerland as being a non-EU member which had more free-trade deals than member states and added there wasnothing in international law to stop the UK striking its own agreements.
“What we are going to see in the United Kingdom, if it votes to leaves, it takes back control of its fisheries, whose Supreme Court once again becomes supreme,” he said.
Tomorrow British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to set out in more detailwhat reforms he wants to keep the UK in the EU. They are broadly expected to cover areas including sovereignty issues in the face of an ever-closer union and access to benefits for migrants.
Ukip scored over 12% of the vote in the last UK election, but that was enough to deliver it only one MP in the 650-seat parliament. Farage lost his own bid for election in the Kent seat of South Thanet.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-multicultural-family-reacts-2856064-Jul2016/,"AT MIDNIGHT ON 23 June, the only constituency to have voted Leave was Sunderland. Throughout the night Leave’s lead steadily increased, and six hours later, as the sun showed its face though the trees, David Dimbleby announced that it was now mathematically impossible for Remain to win.
“It is an earthquake that has happened,” he said.
Freedom of Movement
International and multilingual families like ours are among the people who have benefited most from the freedom of movement the EU has given us, and they will be most profoundly affected by the Brexit vote.
There are three of us: I am Scottish; my wife, Victoriţa, is Romanian; and our daughter Catriona shares British and Romanian citizenship.
Ireland is our home. We live here by right as EU citizens, we make an active contribution to community and economic life, and until now our national citizenship has been largely irrelevant because of our shared EU citizenship.
We have built a life on the foundation of free movement, and now the foundation is under threat. With the UK outside the EU, there may soon be nowhere we can live by right as a family – not in Ireland, not in Romania, not in the UK.
Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who are settled in the UK, and UK citizens settled in the EU, are in a similar position. People like us can’t simply “go home” as many Leave voters would wish, because we don’t come from just one place. In any case home we have made our home here – we’re home already.
Growing up in the EU
I remember when the UK and Ireland joined in 1973. I was in my early teens and excited by the world that was opening up beyond the Glasgow tenement where I grew up.
As soon as we were old enough my best friend and I went to discover a continent that not many decades before had been destroying itself in war.
I remember my mother’s being moved by our opportunity to meet people our own age from all over Europe and beyond. She felt that young people making friends was the best way to avoid future wars – not through treaties between states, but by knowing each other so well that to fight would be unthinkable.
Being young in the eighties, it seemed natural that we could not only travel freely anywhere in Western Europe, but fall in love and settle down anywhere we wanted within the borders of the EU.

Finding a home
My first wife was German and when we lived in London she was able to work there on the same terms as myself. When she decided to study in Germany, I could go there to join her, and I was treated in much the same way as any German citizen would be.
I was in Germany at the end of 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down. Millions of people were newly free, borders were becoming meaningless, and a split in our continent was being healed.
After my first marriage ended I moved to Bucharest, under an EU-funded programme as it happens, and met and married Victoriţa. Our daughter, Catriona, was born when Romania was still outside the EU, and normal family life was not so simple and secure as it had been for me in Germany: we needed a visa and I needed a residence permit and work permit too. Victoriţa needed a visa when we visited the UK, and had to experience the intrusive and offensive questioning that is part of the UK visa process.
She also needed a visa and residence permit when we moved to Ireland, and anyone who’s been in that situation will be familiar with the early-morning queueing for hours in the rain at the visa office in Dublin, hundreds of people snaking all round the building, and the casual hostility of a minority of the staff towards those they were “welcoming” to Ireland.
We thought that was all over when Romania joined the EU – we would never again have to ask for permission to live together as a family. We were EU citizens, from two different EU countries, living in Ireland, a third EU country, on broadly the same terms as any citizen of Ireland.
What the future holds
Now that’s all about to change. People like us don’t know what our futures will hold and whether we will continue to have the right to live together in our homes.
It doesn’t only affect our current situation, but makes many future possibilities uncertain. What if elderly parents become ill and need care – can they live with us? When we are old, could we live near younger members of our families? Up to now, we had the right to do any of these things, but in future we may be need the State’s permission.
Restricting freedom of movement was a major issue in the Brexit campaign. It is almost certain that the UK will try to impose limits now, and that UK citizens will face corresponding restrictions in the EU, including Ireland (we may not get our old bilateral arrangements back).
It may not be easy for UK citizens to get citizenship in the countries they are living in: some don’t allow dual citizenship so they’d have to give up UK citizenship; in Ireland, naturalisation is discretionary and often refused for trivial reasons, even minor motoring offences.
Loss
Looking beyond our own lives, we are saddened by the lost opportunities for young people of Catriona’s age in the UK. It will not be so simple for them to explore our continent, live where they want to, have fun, fall in love and make families that cross borders.
We are mourning Britain’s rejection of the internationalist European ideal that for an older generation seemed the best hope for peace on our continent, and did so much good in breaking down barriers between us.
We never thought for a moment that Britain would actually do something so crazy as to vote to leave, but now they’ve done it the momentum’s taken over. Catriona sees it with a theatrical metaphor: now the UK has messily exited stage right the EU seems worryingly keen to usher them out the back door of the theatre: “Quick, go go go, get out – there’s a taxi waiting, jump in before you’re spotted.”
The political commentators have much to keep them busy, excitedly exploring the possible consequences. We’re reminded of the curse that goes, “May you live in interesting times”. We want to go back to when life was boring.
