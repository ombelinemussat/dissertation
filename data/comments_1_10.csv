Precisely the issue that led to Brexit in the first place, since the UK has never wanted to implement basic civic registry. UK nationals in the Netherlands received letters on the Dutch equivalent of settlement ages ago.
Because of that issue, the UK could never implement the basic EU immigration rules, such as that job seekers can be sent home after three months. They simply had no idea who these people were. And consequently David Cameron was sent home in early 2016 after asking for tighter immigration controls, with the implicit message to get his own house sorted out first.

In Ireland alone we have a million tonnes of food waste a year for the larvae to eat. We could do all this on a mega scale in the central bog areas.

You voted for it, you promoted it, you wanted it. You just didn’t understand what you were getting. Sorry but ‘buyer beware’ ‘sold as seen’. Time you just got in with it, put the processes and requirements in place and learn to live with them.
Or, why not use the ‘seemless bordrer technology’ that you suggested using between north and south in the ports. You know the one that would be ‘frictionless’ and we wouldn’t even see it.

Indeed, let’s keep it on a tipping point shall we. Johnson never cared about the GFA; he only came out in favour of Brexit in 2016 because he saw it as a way to further his ambitions to be PM.
All he needed to do to honour the GFA was to keep the UK in the customs union, and if May couldn’t have pulled that off politically, Johnson could have, but he didn’t because he didn’t want to risk his political career.
I think one day the UK will be back in the CU, and looking back all current wrangling will seem like folly, but it’ll take many wasted years before that happens.

Put messaging out recommending that people restrict their movements without enforcing it. Without doubt people are worried and are taking responsibility for themselves.
The negative side of this, of course, is retail and hospitality are further hit but as it is not enforced, the government does not feel the same obligation for protective financial packages which many are upset about.
Personally I think it is the correct way to go. Keeps industry afloat but emphasises the risks. Treating people like grown ups for once.
The mass infections are mirrored all over the place. It’ll be the same everywhere. Just at different times.
I think it is well understood that restrictions slow hospitalisation, not reduce them much.","Dec 18th 2021, 7:26 AM"

Ireland and the EU insist that the Agreement will be undermined if the Northern Ireland Protocol is not implemented.”
And the UK insists it’s being undermined if it is implemented (and the DUP, who never even signed up to the GFA).
It looks as though the wording of the NIP was kept deliberately vague in order to achieve a deal in the first place, and now we’re seeing what a thin deal it really is, with both sides interpreting the terms differently.
Common EU membership was the core assumption underpinning the GFA, and with that gone, there was always going to be trouble. But for one I’m glad that at this crucial point it’s not Trump but Biden as US president.

The protocol is the only way around those red lines (which for completeness also included leaving the single market). And given those lines, it’s either a land border or one down the sea. The sea border is the best manageable choice, or else you’d end up having to police 300 crossings, which is sure to be a recipe for much more trouble.
So there’s basically nothing that can be done unless the UK relaxes its red lines. I think it’ll be a matter of sitting it out until a more realistically oriented UK govt comes into power, that’ll rejoin the customs union.","Mar 11th 2021, 7:38 PM"

Apart from the DUP, no one in Ireland voted for or ask for Brexit, just like a hundred years ago no one in Ireland voted for or asked for Partition, but people from another country forced both upon us.
Changing something for the better democratically and peacefully, which is to the benefit of the majority cannot be dismissed or delayed because it might upset a minority, cannot be allowed to hold sway any longer.

Now it seems as if they are two a penny. They have become an ‘economic’ tool instead of a ‘patriotic’ tool. There will always be exceptions to the rules, like N. Ireland and the Republic but this idea of dual citizenship is ridiculous. If you want to become an Irish citizen, then you should have to give up your rights to being a citizen of another country and vice versa. E.G. Taking out Irish citizenship now, just to reduce your college fees, health bills or other similar entitlements is totally abusing the system and yet there are no safeguards. Similar to U.K. citizens living in Spain/E.U. after Brexit. Voting. Politically, it could be a minefield. ( I exaggerate for the sake of discussion.) Foreign Govts funding their ‘Irish citizens’ to promote their agendas and, possibly in the future their political parties, e.g look at the concentration of given nationalities in the West of Ireland in particular.

All my attention now is on Doug Beatty and his next move. He has an open goal here to become the next leader of unionism, but will he take it and promise to get the executive up and running again and should publicly declare now that if SF captures the greater vote and the UUP comes in second place, that his party will nominate a Deputy First Minister.
He desperately needs now to put a huge distance between his party and the DUP. Unfortunately, he seems to be caught off guard by the DUP stunts of the last two days and wasn’t prepared.

And still, when the waves are up to their zygomatic arches, they’ll be telling them to begone. What they need now is a leader who will talk to carve out the position as part of Irish society that they want for themselves. They were a political minority when they gerrymandered partition. They’re doubly so now. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of Irish people, north and south, want reunification of our country and our people and not to be ruled by the British. As a minority, unionism does not have the right to force British identity or foreign rule on unconsenting Irish people. Certainly, we Irish can, should and will respect their identity. But the constitutional link with the UK has to go, as that option does not command majority support. After negotiations, Orange parades which respectfully celebrate Protestantism [without the usual vile anti-Catholicism and anti-Irishness and the up-to-their-necks-in-fenian-blood hatred for their neighbours] can be a means of carving out their niche in a united Ireland. Perhaps we could get to a stage where Catholics could actually watch these things with no sense of hatred emanating from the marchers and hangers-on. Perhaps Catholics and Protestants here might finally learn to live together in peace, equality and [when permitted by the capitalist economic cycle] prosperity, just like they have done in the rest of the world. There are myriad non-constitutional ways in which their affinity with House Windsor can be facilitated and Charlie can even have her pad in Hillsborough. Imagine how it will be when finally, a person’s religion is an incidental irrelevance and, over time, ceases to be a divisor. But they can no longer keep the blinkers on and think everything’s going their way. It isn’t and won’t be, because of demographic change and democracy.

Thank you.
Also, our debt ratio per capita is higher than Britain.
Finally, we have a unique economic system Leprechaun Economics which gives us a distinct advantage over other European countries.
Hating Britain is so vogue these days but important to remember that our over reliance on corporate tax is a dangerous and illusory system which in real terms puts us in a precarious predicament.
Look at our Housing/Homeless Crisis, our poor Health Service, our Extortionate Energy costs.
We may ridicule Britain currently but in the long term Britain has far greater scope in terms of industry, finance and productivity.

What EU does not want it’s citizens to know is that it is a region that is in rapid decline.
In 1973, when we joined, the existing 27+UK accounted for 36% of global GDP. Just before Brexit 18% and post Brexit just 15%. If we are to believe OECD and PWC projections, by 2060 the EU will only account for 9% and 10% respectively.
Meanwhile, the 11 members of TPP account for 13% now and 16% with UK. By 2060 they will account for 28% or 30+% with UK. Add to that Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, and S Korea also want to join, that would make up more than 40% of Global GDP. Biden also wants US to join TPP in the medium term.

It’ll be the customs checks, not the ECJ.

So to then also trust Westminster with British law overseeing this part of the single market is almost certainly going to be a step to far.

“Nearly 53 percent of voters in Northern Ireland would opt to stay with the UK in a border poll, according to a new survey
The latest Northern Ireland Life and Times (NILT) Survey has revealed that 30 percent of voters here would opt for a united Ireland.
It also found that 17 percent of Catholics want Northern Ireland to remain in the UK.
Meanwhile, nine percent surveyed fell into the “don’t know” category when asked if Northern Ireland should unify with the Republic or remain in the UK.
This means, based on this poll’s results, that even if all those unsure eventually decided to opt for Irish unity the pro united Ireland figure would still be 39 percent.”

Five years to the day since the 2016 referendum took place, a Savanta ComRes survey found 51 per cent of respondents would now vote to remain, whereas 49 per cent would vote leave, based on interviews conducted last week.
Compared to the results of the 2016 referendum, where 51.9 per cent of people voted to Leave and 48.1 voted to Remain, the nation appears to remain as divided as ever.”

The development companies say it outright, there isn’t enough profit in it for them to build.
The fact we have people tripping over themselves to buy houses at 3, 4, 500k is being preyed on.. all stakeholders want their 20, 40k out of each house. It’s a rat race. Like healthcare is going, if you don’t jump to private you’ll be left behind.
We need to jump off this Hollywood train where a coffee is 12 euro and a haircut 60 because everyone is ‘entitled’ to be a business person and buying your own house is a status badge as much as anything else. ‘We’ have created and are maintaining the rod for our own backs, and the gameplayers are using it to full capacity with the backing of FFG.

It is so companies like Cuckoo, Blackrock and other huge investment companies can maintain their asset prices ahead of any potential global financial crash. These companies are already taking a financial hit on all their commercial properties and the fear is that if there is another crash, all those family homes they have been buying out to bulk up their portfolios will also take a hit. It is no surprise that the government is now talking about converting office blocks into residential areas – this ensures that these companies boost the value of their commercial properties. I wonder how much of taxpayer’s money will be handed over in these refurbishments, most of which cost more to convert than if they were simply to build a new block of apartments? How much more of our public funds will be transferred to these private “shadow banks” as they are often referred to and more to the point, who will these apartments be for.
If there is another crash, these companies can no longer rely on quantitive easing, i.e. the central banks flooding the market with extra cash to keep their asset prices up, so how do you keep commercial and residential prices up in a failing economy? Oh, I know convert commercial to residential and simultaneously flood the country with a mass of people from all over the globe thus flooding the market with extra demand for housing. High demand plus low supply equals higher prices, che-ching!
On top of that, these companies won’t just secure high prices for their assets, but undoubtedly, in the interests of housing migrants, apartments and houses will be handed over to “asylum seekers” in the interest of “offering refuge”, whilst public money is used to subsidise or pay entirely for their rental costs, handing over further public funds to the same private interests in a double whammy of theft from the people – che-ching-che-ching!","May 24th 2023, 2:37 PM"

Johnson reasoned as follows: ‘If I back Brexit, then if Leave wins I can be PM, but if it doesn’t I can still wriggle my way into No. 10. But if I back staying in the EU, Remain needs to win for me to be PM, and if it’s Leave I’m done for.’ In other words, backing Brexit left him with both possible worlds to be PM, instead of just one.
So in that sense he was being entirely rational, except that Northern Ireland wasn’t even an afterthought, since he simply didn’t care. He rode on a wave of what was essentially an ‘English independence’ vote, and ended up shafting all of Ireland in the process. Including even the DUP.

This is somewhat reflected in the poll numbers.
The average person in not really that interested in what or where regulations are enforced but rather more interested in being able to buy their usual favourite cheese, or ham or sausages in the same shop, at the same price and from the same selection as before. And always remember that many seed potatoes used by Irish farmers came from Scotland and Wales and there was bemoaning here and back in January there were discussions about allowing exceptions for Irish Framers to bypass Eu rules and import seed potatoes – (not sure the current status but it is an example of how rules are so important until they affect an individual ).
There is no easy solution but for as long as the anti protocol side can say there is a shortage of food and medicine owing to the protocol they will continue to make inroads in the PR stakes and so influence the UK government – this was an interesting poll.
One can look at the nearly 40% of people who think there should be a hard border and about a 50/50 split on whether the protocol is a good idea for NI.
5% of the people of NI trust the UK government – that is a fairly conclusive but I wonder who the 5% are that still trust Boris.

We want control of our country, taxation and laws back. We the people of the UK want to decide our own destiny, we’re not led by nor do we follow others. Judge us and our country by “what you see us do as people”, not by what you wrongly perceive about us. Also to prove we ARE pro immigration and have totally moved on from any colonial ideology, Non-EU migration to the UK is up 20% the highest in Europe. Also the Pope has warned The European Commission about assimilation of EU member states in a way that their cultural identity no longer exists, also warning them about Nazism. A good example the Pro-Eu Youth group, that along with the free EU Rail Passes for me is like the indoctrination of the Hitler Youth; selling and brainwashing the younger EU generation with Pro EU ideologies and not allowing free thought and independent democratic thinking.

This is shear madness, the writing was there in BLACK and WHITE and yet many in the UK and even Ulster Unionists voted FOR the protocol in it’s present format.
If the UK just got on with implementing what they agreed and then proposed alternatives where there were real unexpected issues everyone might be more sympathetic to the unforeseen… but Boris lied to the people when he said no border in the Irish Sea.
Anyone in the UK who fails to abide by the Protocol and actively seeks to prevent it’s implementation may indeed be guilty of the crime of treason which is defined as “Treason is the crime of attacking a state authority to which one owes allegiance.”
It is my view that if the UK continues to fail to implement the protocol then the EU should consider a ban on all imports from Great Britain ( I am not suggesting implementing same but it should be on the table as an option in the event of the UK failing to implement the protocol). I do appreciate that nothing is ever simple but the alternative is a hard UK EU border on this island.","May 12th 2021, 12:15 PM"

That is why this farmed product is so massively able to under cut the likes of our beef and lamb, let alone our remaining wild fish.
The solution is quite clear. All fish farming should be done inland, and the fish fed the larvae of the Black Soldier fly. Likewise the chicken, instead of on soya grown on some area of decimated rain forest. We could be feeding Europe out of the central bogs. SMRs, data centres, then the waste heat to the hydroponics and fly farms, then the fish and the fowl and then the sequestration. Job done.","Jun 23rd 2021, 8:14 AM"

Businesses there apparently have to order a month in advance from the mainland, so if they can’t do that now in light of the grace period expiring at the end of March…in April, there’ll be major shortages and delays.

If you look back at Newsnight last Thursday night. It was programme debate dedicated to review success or lack thereof of Brexit. It was broadcast from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex , it posted the 2nd highest Brexit Vote in the UK after Sunderland . The audience was unusual , as everyone chosen were 100% Brexit YES Voters in June 2016. 7 years on, 20% said they would change their mind today and vote NO , 10% didn’t No anymore , while the majority 70% would still vote YES despite everything again. It is an unusual constituency, and probably NOT fully representative of England, never mind the rest of the UK. On the panel was John Redmond, Tory die heart Brexiteer and also Ben Habib former BREXIT Party member (acolyte of Nigel Farage ) and now leader of UK Reform Party . Habib in his closing statement, stated Brexit had not been successful , because it hadn’t being fully implemented. In his view the big road block was ALL of the UK hadn’t left the EU on equal terms. He totally against NI Protocol, Windsor Framework and as far as he was concerned the border should be and I quote ” located at the internationally recognised border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland “. He went onto say that 1.8 Million British citizens are effectively being held captive within the EU against their will … with this statement nearly 50% of the TV Audience gave him a rapturous applause for his statement. I was disappointed in BBC Fiona Bruce not holding him to account nor did she allow anyone the right reply as the programme was almost over … But sadly that is the mindset shared by many politicians in the Tory Right ( and also some inside the Labour Party ) ,and they supporting the DUP all the way on this . Simply no recognition of the unique historical context , of political situation in NI or the fact that 64% of people in NI voted against Brexit , which meant a reasonable % of NI unionists voters did not support BREXIT. So, as long as the Tories allow DUP this type room to manoeuvre , there will be no serious attempt to pressure the DUP to help re-establish the Northern Ireland Assembly. Hence the DUP are holding out.","Jun 25th 2023, 9:00 PM"

Coveney is absolutely right. There is even room in the protocol to agree on certain specifics without the need for the UK to rejoin the customs union – that’s the 80% he’s refering to.
But there’s a trade-off there, since if the UK agrees to common veterinary practices, and sanitary & phytosanitary standards on food, then in those areas they will be limited with respect to their ‘global Britain’ trade deals.
So that’s the choice. Do the British want to respect that union they claim to want, or do they prefer their global Britain/England fantasy? Because the two are mutually exclusive.
And if Lord Frost wants the EU to be pragmatic about this he really means he wants the EU and Ireland to allow the UK to have their cake and eat it.","May 20th 2021, 11:07 PM"

That’s not an anti-Brexit sign. It’s a loyalist sign that opposes the sea border, and loyalists tend to support Brexit.
And indeed Brexit could still spell a lot of trouble, since the sort of Brexit that Johnson and his Tory party wanted and got is fundamentally incompatible with the situation in Northern Ireland.
But to be fair what they actually wanted was a post-Brexit free trade deal that would make both borders (sea and land) frictionless. This would have turned the GFA into the EU single market’s achilles heel, and led to British presence in Northern Ireland having the effect of requiring a much broader free trade agreement than the EU is able to give to third countries. And subsequently set a precedent for other members to leave and demand the same, potentially spelling the end of the single market.
Which is why the border issue had to be settled before and independent of a trade agreement. I think that was the correct decision, but the price is the potential for serious trouble in the North.","Feb 10th 2021, 1:01 PM"

Sliced pan bread has lower protein, lower carbs and higher fat than wholewheat or sourdough. Maybe we’d be better off changing back to the type of bread we ate before. It was better for us, crisp sandwiches notwithstanding.","Feb 12th 2021, 12:59 AM"

Why the consumption of such a useless unhealthy commodity should be supported by the government or the tax payer, is not really clear to me.
A proper bread, be it soda bread or sour dough bread, is healthier, has a longer shelf life, supports gut flora and due to its complex carbs avoids spikes in blood sugar levels.
It seems Ireland and the UK are the only European countries baking these useless breads and maybe this is a good opportunity to start changing people’s diet for the better. After all, we do have enough people with diabetes and stomach and colon cancer already.

Its not rushed. Also, I do think EU opposers need to ask themselves just what are they willing to compromise on when dealing with other nations on trade deals. CETA was negotiated on Canada’s part by Christy Freeland, Trudeau’s best minister, and part of the most left-leaning progressive govt in Canada since the 1970s (led by Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau). In other words, you bring this back to the table and even if the Canadians are willing to talk, it will possibly be a govt more similar to Stephen Harper’s rightwing conservatives leading the Canadian side as Canada typically swings left and right every few yrs. Trudeau followed Harper, Trudeau’s father’s party was followed by Mulroney (for those unfamiliar with Mulroney, he counted Reagan and Thatcher are his ideological peers and friends which should give you an idea of his politics).
At present, the EU is in the process of losing perhaps its biggest partner (Yes, the Germans and possibly the French are as big or bigger, but unlike them the British like to buy more than it sells). Nit picking a deal with just 37 million Canadians is going to make any deal with other larger nations trickier.

And I do not want some private corporation to be able to sue my government because they are adopting a policy that is good for our country, our people and our environment but that might hurt the profits of that corporation.

As for the British negoatiating style, that can be summarised as follows: it’s their traditional confrontational style of politics spilling over onto the international stage, and that’s not a good thing.
A word on David Cameron: he took a gamble pressured by backbenchers afraid of losing perhaps a handful of seats to Ukip, with potentially disastrous results for this island, and lost. But I also have to say that the previous Labour govt takes part of the blame. It opened the UK to the new eastern European member states in 2004 but could have waited until 2011.

People frequently complain about Germany dominating the EU, but compared to England in the UK, it’s nothing. Germany is larger than France, but someone is always going to be the biggest.

Johnson may think there is some sort of clever compromise that would allow the DUP to climb down. The problem is the DUP doesn’t want to climb down. It opposed the GFA, so would be quite happy to see the institutions set up under it be suspended.
As for Johnson’s previous statements that the lack of cross-community support for the protocol means it breaches the GFA, he is simply legally wrong. 1st, the GFA does not require cross-community support for all measures. 2nd, the protocol specifically requires only majority support in the Assembly – which it effectively secured in the recent elections","May 15th 2022, 9:22 AM"

And there’s an irony to it, as the promised land idea is in part due to lack of civil registry / id cards, making it easier to live in the UK illegitimately compared to many EU countries. It also made it hard for the UK to deport EU nationals without work before Brexit because authorities had no idea who these people were – and it’s why David Cameron was sent home in early 2016 when he tried to get the EU to reform, i.e. allow him to implement tighter immigration controls.","May 6th 2021, 12:31 AM"

But because the British wanted it so badly, it is their side of the deal that’s been rightfully taking the hits, and now they’re complaining, including the DUP which is quite absurd since they never even signed up to it.
I predict Truss will abuse her plans to freeze or subsidise energy costs, since the rules on either side of the border are likely to be different, with the North tied to EU rules, in order to trigger article 16 of the Protocol, citing ‘an emergency’. Within the next few days.
And then if the EU complains she’ll accuse them of being out of touch with the ‘urgent needs of the people’ or some such claptrap. Since the objective is clear: having their cake and eating it while trying to weaken Ireland and the EU.","Sep 7th 2022, 12:13 AM"

After rebates, the UK’s EU membership fee in 2018 was £13.2bn.” Wikipedia
“The Financial Times says such a decline amounts to £100bn in lost output, and £40bn less revenue to the Treasury a year. The UK is now behind all the other G7 nations in the pace of its recovery from the pandemic, with exports by UK small businesses to the EU down significantly.”
“Figures from the Centre for European Reform show that the Brexit vote has already depressed economic growth. The independent thinktank said that by the end of last year the economy was 5% – or £31bn – smaller than if the UK had stayed in the EU.”
One of the main reasons for brexit was that the ERG did not want the EU snooping around the trillions of pounds of British bank offshore anonymous trust funds in UK dominions of the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Bermuda, The Channel Islands.

In addition Poots will make the coming marching season into a last stand of unionism, in the hopes of unifying all NI protestants through sectarianism, regardless of their own position on brexit, the actual value of the union with the UK, or even those with progressive non sectarian views, loyalist groups will escalate violence as a backdrop, for all to stand behind him.","May 30th 2021, 7:35 PM"

The UK could have easily ‘got Brexit done’ in terms of ending free movement, and at the same time avoided the whole Northern Ireland situation by simply staying in the EU’s customs union – after all the Common Travel Area emulates free movement on this Atlantic archipelago.
In fact the UK could get away with even less, it only needs to agree alignment for the most common goods traded between Britain and Ireland, including sausages, without full membership of the CU.
But this implies these commodities have to be left out of their coveted ‘global Britain’ trade deals, and this is what the UK refuses to do. Instead, it is demanding the EU be ‘pragmatic’, which is code for having one’s cake & eating it. It tells you their priorities are not with their so-called union, but with their nostalgic English voter base, and the rest can get stuffed.","Jun 17th 2021, 6:17 PM"

I have done the run to France pre-brexit on many occasions the run Dublin holyhead including loading unloading takes 6.5 hours approx then drive from Holyhead to Folkstone another 8 to 9 hours then the queue for the tunnel journey through the tunnel and out at calais 1.5 hours, time 17 hours approx including trucker break. Rosslare to Cherbourg takes 20 hours including loading unloading. Cork to Rosscoff is even faster loading unloading 16 hours. if you are heading down south France or Spain it is much the fastest route. If you are heading east to Germany direction, the Calais (landbridge) is faster but the benefit of direct ferry is less driver breaks or the need for employing 2 drivers on the run and the difference in time is only 3 or maybe 4 hours …my verdict would be do direct ferry route and avoid the hassle which with Brexit, adds more time to the times above due to the extra bureaucracy","Mar 1st 2021, 11:29 AM"

12 sailings a week from all Irish Ports increased to 6 a day, that’s 6 x 7 = 42 per week, presumably every day has the same sailings.

If the love and devotion was reciprocal you’d understand but it’s hard to overstate just how much of an irrelevance Northern Ireland is to people on ‘the mainland’. They simply don’t care. Worse, they mostly haven’t a clue. And I mean not a bean. Anyone who has lived over there will know just how little knowledge your average person has. They are busy looking outward, globally, often in the hope of being considered a major player like the US or China. Every time you hear a politician speak it’s about being the world’s best, a global leader never just a mid sized country with a lot going for it, doing its best, working along with everyone else. Northern Ireland doesn’t even come into their thinking. Except as a financial drain and usually with a whole lot of vague unflattering stereotypes about anyone who lives there, no matter what side they are on. Complexity, nuance and historical knowledge – dream on. They often don’t even understand who is on what side or why there are so many issues in the first place.

Why on earth would The Journal need to discuss the military connections between Ireland and NATO member Netherlands? I’m sure it’s the last thing on Irish minds at the moment.
The answer of course is that it’s part of the Get Ireland Into NATO agenda of this government, especially FG.
Most of the major news outlets are pushing this, obviously there’s something in it for them.
The politicos would love NATO membership, huge spending on arms with a nice % going indirectly to them. Also nice cushy jobs at the Brussels HQ for Leo, Michael & Co.

This poll was taken after that and based on the following question, I think the DUP are not improving their chances:
“How should MLAs cast their Democratic Consent vote on the Protocol in late
2024?”
“Under the ‘democratic consent’ mechanism in the Protocol, MLAs will decide whether
to approve or not the continued application of core provisions (Articles 5-10) relating to
the movement of goods and operation of the single electricity market on the island of
Ireland. With the Windsor Framework and the changes it introduces, 61% of
respondents want MLAs in 2024 to vote in favour of the continued application of the
Protocol” That’s up from 51%.
There is also this question: “Should the Northern Ireland Assembly be functioning now?
Three in every five voters (60%) agree that the Northern Ireland Executive and
Assembly should now be fully functioning; just under a quarter (23%) disagree”
There isn’t a specific question in this polling relating to “How would you vote” but I can’t imagine they haven’t annoyed a lot of people with their intransigence.","Apr 5th 2023, 9:54 AM"

How important is the Protocol/Windsor Framework for voting intentions?
Opposition to the Protocol remains, with almost a quarter of respondents (23%)

The figure in February 2023 (prior to the Windsor Framework being agreed) was 22%.

He said: ‘Obviously we have not had a formal response yet from the EU, so we need to wait to see that formal response. Some technical conversations are ongoing around that’.”
Ireland seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place while the British are looking to eat as much of the cake while they have it.
I’m cautiously optimistic though, since Lewis says flexible and formal in the same statement. Flexible/pragmatic is their code for cake and eating it, while formal is this word that has little to do with pragmatics but everything with the rules the UK signed up to but which it is hoping it somehow does not need to adhere to.
The other day unionists (Poots) were saying they were promised a victory on the Protocol, while the word within loyalist communities was that the Irish govt was not welcome in NI for the problems they had created (while it was obviously the British with their hard Brexit).
I think Coveney understands the emotional irrationality of Brexit both for unionists and the British Daily Express readership, and that in order to get Westminster and the DUP to agree to the EU terms of an extension, it needs to be able to be sold as victory to both the loyalists and the Daily Express and the like.
