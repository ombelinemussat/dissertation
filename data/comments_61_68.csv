https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-bad-for-ireland-2048629-Apr2015/,"I think a UK exit from the EU is overstated as to the impact it would have on Ireland.
First of all, if it did happen, one of the first things that would result would be the reinstallation of the open travel and trade agreement between Ireland and the UK which existed prior to EU integration. No visa’s would be required to travel between the two countries and there would be no tariffs or barriers to trade between the two countries, primarily because of the North / South border on the island of Ireland and also because of the very strong travel and trade relationship between the two countries, we are an integral part of each others economy.
Secondly, a political decision doesn’t immediately change the requirements of industry and existing trading patterns, so if a UK company has a supplier in Ireland, they aren’t going to suddenly cease trading and look for a new supplier. Often supply chains work on long standing credit agreements and relationship building and one of the biggest factors to success in industry is having reliable suppliers and strong relationship with companies integral to your operations. Also, it’s not like they are leaving the euro currency, we already trade in differing currencies, so whether they are in the E.U. or not, as long as we have an open trade agreement, little should change.
Thirdly, as the only other native English speaking country in Europe, our trade would continue to be strong, but it would also make us the only native English speaking country in the E.U., which could potentially see us being far more competitive in attracting even more US foreign direct investment as there is a high preference for English speaking countries to locate in and the UK would no longer be a base to operate from within the E.U., which could offset any loss in GDP generation that might occur from the UK leaving.
This report mainly bases it’s findings on the absurd scenario that cross border trading between the north and south of Ireland and UK would suddenly become a closed market relationship, which is pie in the sky stuff, the UK and Ireland will always be fully integrated with open trade and travel regardless of the EU existence or not.","Apr 15th 2015, 12:21 PM"

Why make such a broad assumption?","Apr 15th 2015, 12:27 PM"
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-bad-for-ireland-2048629-Apr2015/,"Because it would be absolute stupidity to believe otherwise.
First of all, any citizen born in the North of Ireland is entitled to either Irish nationality, British nationality or both under the Good Friday Agreement, so would everyone in the north who holds an Irish passport but not a UK one suddenly have to apply for a visa to continue working in their job in the North?
There is just under 1,000,000 Irish citizens living and working in the UK according to the 2011 census. Are we to assume that their travel and working conditions would immediately become restricted?
We account for just under 10% of all their exports (3rd biggest trading partner) and from the 1930′s until full EU membership the UK and Ireland had a fully open trade agreement unique to just the two countries following the trade war from the early 1930′s, it was agreed that we were far more profitable being closely integrated trade partners rather than competing, so we paid 0% tariffs on trade between each other and all other countries paid 20% tariff on trade with us. (consider it like a mini-EU).
The historical precedent is there, from the moment we became an independent nation right up until we were both members of a broader open common trading union, we had always maintained a heavily integrated trade partnership.

So i can imagine there are a lot of pissed off Scots this morning!

I wonder if this reflects voter turn out in the different communities or and overall recognition that EU membership has neen good for Northern Ireland.

If you try to say we owe the banks money then that is our own politicians fault, not the EUs (as they were the ones who caused the mess). But the EU gave us a loan to bail out our mistakes at an intrest rate of less than that of inflation, meaning we pay back less than we borrow. While the bailout was terrible, the other option was to close the banks and everyones savings would have disappeared and debts be sold off. (Look at history if thats something you dont believe)
The EU makes trade so easy, something that will drastically affect Britain now that they are out. We will see their exports and imports drop immensly over the next few months.

https://www.thejournal.ie/osborne-brexit-speech-2848070-Jun2016/,"It’s a serious blow for British and international capitalism all right but it’s a great opportunity for the working class.
Hannah Sell, Socialist Party deputy general secretary:
“The referendum result may well go down in history as the pitchfork moment”, declared the Financial Times (FT), wailing the anger and despair of Britain’s elite at the decision by the majority of voters in Britain to leave the European Union.
For the capitalist class in Britain and across the EU as a whole, this is a major blow described by the FT as “the biggest setback in the EU’s history”.
For British capitalism in particular it is a terrible defeat. It could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom if there is another vote for independence in Scotland, and also lead to the collapse of the Tory Party, once among the most successful capitalist parties on the planet.
It is also possible that the Labour Party could split in the aftermath of 23 June as the pro-business right plot to remove Jeremy Corbyn. Politics has been thrown into turmoil.
Many of the seventeen million people who voted for exit, however, will have woken up with a sense of elation that they had been able to express their rage at everything they have suffered as a result of big business making theworking class pay for the economic crisis in recent years: low pay, zero hour contracts, benefit cuts, the lack of affordable housing, and public services cut to the bone.
What is more, by doing so they have forced Cameron – the hated prime minister – to announce his resignation.
Not only in Britain but across Europe many workershave been inspired by this vote against the bosses’ EU. There is no doubt that many workers in Greece, whose living standards have been devastated at the hands of the institutions of the EU, will have been cheering at the result of the referendum…………………………………………….
The political situation would have been transformed if Jeremy Corbyn had stuck by his own historic position of opposition to the EU because, as he said at the time of the Maastricht Treaty: “It takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers.”
A campaign explaining how nationalisation of the railways or the steel industry are illegal under EU law, and standing in solidarity with workers in Greece, Ireland and the rest of the EU, could have increased the majority for exit and forced not just Cameron’s resignation but an immediate general election, with the coming to power of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government being posed.

There are two aspects which I would take issue with, firstly it was written pre BREXIT so with all of the uncertainty around it for the next few years it will certainly affect the conclusions. Secondly, and of more importance, is that it’s conclusions are based on the adoption by NI of the ROI tax system. Now think about that for a moment, Ni adopts the ROI tax system which to me means everyone pays more. If you were to have a vote of unification then every voter would ask themselves how would think affect me financially. Added to that are the increased costs as the NHS would disappear and be replaced by the HSE so you go from an NHS to a system where you pay a lot more privately or wait.
In conclusion, you cannot rely on the conclusion of that report as definitely as certain posters here would allude to. Finally, if a referendum were to take place and people actually sat down and worked out the costs to them personally and as a country I doubt if it would pass.","Aug 11th 2016, 9:15 PM"

Paying tax and being loyal to a Dublin government that puts them in a minority is the model of everything they hate with every cell of their bodies. Understand that and then you can see the impossibility of the task. If you took the depth of feeling in the Republic of people not wanting to be part of the UK and magnify by a hundred then you get an idea of how they feel about a United Ireland. The only other way is enforcement by war or ethic cleansing. That would make the Balkans look like a tea party and result in defeat of the Republic as I can’t see many people here having the conviction of dying for the ambition of bringing them in and maintaining an occupation.

Let me start by saying as someone who is in their 50′s I’d like to see a united Ireland in my time, but not at any price. I don’t believe I will see it in my time but hopefully it will become”genuinely” closer.
Like so many in SF (and other parties too ) you are so heavily tainted by the past you can’t see how you are more of a block to a united Ireland than an aid.
A united Ireland has to mean a united people (before the physical land divide is united)
The Gfa is a settlement for both sides. If you honestly think that a majority in the north would at this time vote for a united Ireland, then you are beyond deluded. It will take generations for trust to build and the start of that has to be a”genuine” approach to the gfa. The acceptance that the unionist communities identity has equal standing, equal genuineness as the republicans hopes and aspirations is not something you can pretend. Why would they vote for a united Ireland when so many see their tradition, their existence as inherently wrong. The rights and wrongs of history are subjective. I would encourage you and others in the Republican movement to get over yourselves. Instead of talking about holding out the hand or talking about genuineness actually practice it. Finally you have to see that to many you are a hero but to many others you’re not (put mildly) a divisive figure like yourself can never be a uniting figure.","Aug 12th 2016, 11:57 AM"

The SF agenda is constant, but fails to admit that they destroyed any prospect of political evolution by their involvement in the 35 years of terrorism, which scars the nation for several generations.
Unification is seen as a likely suppression of the northern culture, so that fear needs to be mollified by a steady reassuring support to that culture.
The southern state has made quite good, even excellent, progress on the social agenda, by the birth control, divorce referanda, educational reform, & the general abandoning of the religious state. “The Prods no longer face a Romanist state”.
The economics of unification will certainly be challenging, will need huge commitment, but I have no doubt that the project could be managed. EU & UN support would be needed, & probably available.
The main block to progress is in fact SF itself, which so far, seems to be ignoring the problem the continued existence & support for this element poses to any move towards unification. This applies north & south, so the redundancy of the movement needs to be factored in as part of the process.
The obvious next step for SF to cultivate a unification process is to dissolve & leave the field to others to build trust & co-operation.","Aug 19th 2016, 8:18 AM"

The British voted for exit by referendum.Although it proved to be an unpopular result,the government accepted the will of the people and have taken up the gauntlet and are prepared to fight tooth and nail to gain the best possible deal for Britain and will do so with every fibre of their collective being.
You and all your gutless spineless colleagues in government rejected the decision of the Irish people.FF,FG and labour bent over backwards to please your European masters and ran a referendum again to get the result required to continue in your favoured subordinate member position happy to take any scraps that were thrown your way.
Who the hell do you think you are commenting on British politics when you yourself are no more no less than a typical Irish politician in a position of authority who caters to the dominant powers in European politics rather than fight for the Irish people.

Geldof is a registered non-domicile, meaning he is free to avoid income and capital gains tax on international earnings.
When questioned by a reporter about his tax affairs, Geldof responded, “I pay all my taxes! My time – is that not a tax?” The bottom line seems to be that if you’re wealthy and doing something charitable with your money, avoiding tax is an entitled perk to Geldof.
Geldof is out of touch with ordinary taxpayers who pay more than they can afford in taxes and don’t have the luxury of expensive accountants to squirrel millions away on other EU countries.

Remember that the EU does not have any military capability of it’s own and was utterly useless during the Balkans war. Useless, and it took NATO to try and straighten things out.
The other factor that has kept peace is democracy. The fear mongers out there continually evoke the wars of the early 20th Century, but they are are being dishonest. Europe of the early 20th Century was composed of democracies, monarchies, and dictatorships. Britain, Italy, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and Russia and all had empires. All states, whether in possession of an empire or not, were aggressively nationalist and subscribed to the For King & Country bollocks.
Europe is not like this anymore and, apart from anything else, we all rather like one another. This talk of war between states is drivel. However, the way the EU is currently being run is likely to bring war to the continent. Because of the way the EU is run, that is in an anti-democratic fashion, we are seeing the rise of far right parties across the continent and the reemergence of assertive nationalism. This is down to the EU and not in spite of it and, sadly, the EU is not reformable because those greedy little pigs in power will not allow it.
What we are likely to see is civil war in certain states as the so-called progressive Left, who has allied itself with Islam, is going to come into violent conflict with groups who absolutely oppose what they are all about.

Compared to the surrounding world it is a relative zone of peace, stability and the rule of law. Which is why so many risk their lives to get here.
Member States have shared competencies and power for a reason. This means that you lose control over some issues. But a great deal of that control is illusionary to begin with as we live in a global world dominated by large powers. One of the core realities is that the EU has more economic clout when negotiating on behalf of its members collectively than if those members dos so individually. But member states retain control of large areas of national life ranging from taxation to education to health.
The EU needs reform not abolition. It is time for consolidation not “ever closer union” which is a conceit which must be dropped. Ireland outside the EU would be weaker and poorer but of course we’d have more “control” for all the good it would do us.

Parliament has always been considered sovereign as the legitimate representative of the people, to do as it pleases (presumably in the best interest of them). Even our own referendums are not nearly as “binding” as people often think. EU treaties are not passed by referendums here. The Dáil still votes on them. We vote on giving the Dáil permission to pass it, if it wants. It could easily turn around and decide not to pass a treaty whose corresponding referendum passed by 99% of voters. The only difference is we’ve never had such a referendum where a majority of TDs were against the change it sought to bring about, just to appease party backbenchers, so such a situation will probably never arise.

The High Court has not cancelled the referendum vote. Parliament should respect the popular vote. Parliament should also be informed of the Executive’s position about the desired outcome of negotiations. UK is not a banana republic where a referendum is treated as a plebiscite to allow the head of the Executive (she who must be obeyed) to do as she pleases. Parliament has duties and those include the sanction of how government matters are conducted. Parliament could legally over-rule any decision or proposal of the the Prime Minister just like the 2013 refusal to bomb Assad in Syria. Parliament could, at a future date, legally refuse to repeal the European communities act 1972 in response to a refusal to consult prior to invoking Article 50. That would create a constitutional crisis.
The real political response to the confusion about Brexit can be resolved by calling an election which could be acheived by having the political will to do so and by revoking the fixed term legislation. Anything Parliament can do, it can undo. Sovereignty resides in parliament. The High Court judgement reflects this basic principle of British constitutional law and is nearly biblical in its simplicity of decision on this point. What were they thinking in cabinet? Not much apparently. Just follow our dear leader who currently follows the Brexit Trio. She expected them to trip up. It is she who has her face in the carpet at the moment.

26
Similarly, the implementation of the policies listed in those Articles shall not affect the application of the procedures and the extent of the powers of the institutions laid down by the Treaties for the exercise of the Union competences under this Chapter.
Article 41
1. Administrative expenditure to which the implementation of this Chapter gives rise for the institutions shall be charged to the Union budget.
2. Operating expenditure to which the implementation of this Chapter gives rise shall also be charged to the Union budget, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise.

SECTION 2
PROVISIONS ON THE COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY
Article 42
1. The common security and defence policy shall be an integral part of the common foreign and security policy. It shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on civilian and military assets. The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using capabilities provided by the Member States.
2. The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
The policy of the Union in accordance with this Section shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.

Such cooperation shall be governed by Article 46. It shall not affect the provisions of Article 43.
7. If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.
Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.
Article 43
1. The tasks referred to in Article 42(1), in the course of which the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace- keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation.

Article 44
1. Within the framework of the decisions adopted in accordance with Article 43, the Council may entrust the implementation of a task to a group of Member States which are willing and have the necessary capability for such a task. Those Member States, in
29
association with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, shall agree among themselves on the management of the task.
2. Member States participating in the task shall keep the Council regularly informed of its progress on their own initiative or at the request of another Member State. Those States shall inform the Council immediately should the completion of the task entail major consequences or require amendment of the objective, scope and conditions determined for the task in the decisions referred to in paragraph 1. In such cases, the Council shall adopt the necessary decisions.
Article 45
1. The European Defence Agency referred to in Article 42(3), subject to the authority of the Council, shall have as its task to:
(a) contribute to identifying the Member States’ military capability objectives and evaluating observance of the capability commitments given by the Member States;
(b) promote harmonisation of operational needs and adoption of effective, compatible procurement methods;
(c) propose multilateral projects to fulfil the objectives in terms of military capabilities, ensure coordination of the programmes implemented by the Member States and management of specific cooperation programmes;

1. Those Member States which wish to participate in the permanent structured cooperation referred to in Article 42(6), which fulfil the criteria and have made the commitments on military capabilities set out in the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation, shall notify their intention to the Council and to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
30
2. Within three months following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 the Council shall adopt a decision establishing permanent structured cooperation and determining the list of participating Member States.

Ordinary revision procedure
2. The Government of any Member State, the European Parliament or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded.

There will be arguments back and forth about what motivation, political or otherwise, was behind the attack. What it does represent to me though is the embodiment of the unchecked and often misdirected anger that has clearly grown over recent years against politicians in general. It can be seen on this site on a daily basis where various people commenting will state, jokingly or otherwise, that ‘x’ politician should be shot/hanged etc.
The fault lies in two places: 1. the bombastic hate fuelled populism which is taking over world politics and influencing vulnerable members of the public as well as
2. The growth and most importantly easy usage, of social media, which has united groups of people previously too sparse or hidden to have any real impact. For every group of downtrodden people this has revolutionised life for, there is a group of extremists, sadists, thugs, and quite frankly idiots, who have found each other, convinced each other of their own correctness, and fuelled each others’ rage.","Jun 16th 2016, 6:03 PM"

Donald Tusk of the European Union (EU) in Brussels, European Council president, has warned that the EU is really in danger of total collapse. He has come out and said that David Cameron’s referendum in Britain will be copied by other members tactics for their own “egotistic goals.” He has said this will unleash the unthinkable democratic right of European people to disagree with the elite in Brussels. He called this a populist political movement that will bring the EU bloc to the brink of “suicide”.
From last week – Donald Tusk is now saying he is clearing his diary next week to concentrate on the “very fragile” talks with Britain to create some “new settlement” at the EU summit next week to keep Britain in the EU and to allow Cameron to declare some victory so he can call off the referendum. That is the agenda in Brussels.

Conversely, I equally wouldn’t mind if the UK were a wholly independent state outside the EU.
What I loathe however is the current half-baked arrangement. It’s almost as though the EU’s inner circle wanted a superstate but were too terrified of nationalists put the idea forward, instead opting for a watered down version which brings plenty of stupid red-tape but little of the benefits. The Euro is a classic example – having a currency union wasn’t a bad idea in itself, but to set it up without any form of fiscal agreement was just asking for trouble. The UK really dodged a bullet on that front.
The US states have something EU member states will never have – a sense of shared destiny and a common identity. Americans are proud of their individual states and will fiercely defend their rights and laws if they feel the federal government is encroaching on them. At the same time however, they recognise each other as equal members of a union.
If Arkansas or Colorado went bankrupt, could you imagine the rest of the USA threatening to cast them adrift or imposing crippling and humiliating austerity measures on them? Contrast with how the EU has treated the Greeks.
EU member states will always see themselves as Belgian/British/Dutch/German/French/Irish/Italian etc. first and Europeans second (if at all). Maybe the EU’s boffins were hoping they could sneak a super-state slowly, piece by piece. Either way, it hasn’t worked.","Feb 3rd 2016, 8:36 PM"

During the week we had issued to us here an early copy of what’s being called ‘The Five Presidents’ Report’ but what is actually far more grandly titled:
‘Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union’ a report by Jean-Claude Juncker in close cooperation with Donald Tusk, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Mario Draghi, and Martin Schulz.
That there ARE five Presidents of the EU should be a clue as to how crazy this place is. Juncker is President of the European Commission, Tusk of the European Council (not to be confused with Council of the European Union – what, ye didn’t know there were two???), Dijsselbloem of the Eurogroup, Draghi of the European Central Bank and Schulz of the European Parliament and in this report are holding hands and agreeing that the way forward is to wade even deeper into the swamp in which we’re already mired – full economic union, full financial union, full fiscal union, leading eventually a full metal straitjacket from which there will be no escape.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-eu-ireland-2910947-Aug2016/,"1. Are you saying people are worse off now than they were when we joined the Union????
2. Emigration has been bad for a few years because too much of our economy, and by extension our workforce, was engaged in construction. The EU didn’t cause a housing bubble, the lack of regulatory and government control exorcised over an over-heating economy did. True, we didn’t have the interest rate tools, but we could have prevented the buy to regret madness, had deposit requirements like we do now, etc, and protected a lot of people from piling into property.
3. Additional taxes are because we can’t pay for the services we are providing. Admittedly we could go back to the punt, convert debt to punts, and devalue, but the rate at which we can borrow on the international markets would skyrocket as a result – it’s difficult to borrow money when you have a reputation for unilateral haircuts. Still, we could balance the books, but that requires taxes.
4. Can we cope on our own?
The EU has *some* influence on where we are, but people seem happy to scapegoat the EU for the real culprits – our own internal vested interests that pumped a property boom when european finance became available.
House prices, rent costs, commercial rent. These are at the root of our wage pressure, at our cost of living pressure, at the amounts we overpay for almost everything.

I have seen many jobs destroyed by the Irish Ministry of scams and its constituent agencies. They do act as sales men, selling their scams but as to building up the technical capacity of the country you can forget it. The scams do finance much of the government apparatus and the pinstriped legions that design and feed off of the scams but it does not develop Ireland. On the contrary it perverts the natural development of the country. The whole Irish “job creation” mafia is in fact based on a deep-seated belief in Irish inferiority. Ireland cannot be like Denmark or Sweden or Germany. Why not? They think that Ireland needs tax scams and grants. Ireland and its people are not good enough to have the standards of these countries. They truly believe this. I do not. You need these people like a hole in the head. They should be encouraged to go and create some honest employment for themselves.","Nov 22nd 2016, 4:38 PM"

Mr Hofer now stands in the vanguard of populist movements which over the next six months are hoping to do nothing less than rock the political foundations of a Europe that is still reeling from the hammer blow of last week’s Brexit vote.
A victory for Mr Hofer in September would lead into a referendum in Italy in October where the centrist figure of Matteo Renzi has staked his prime ministership on winning support for governance and constitutional reforms.
If he loses and resigns it would be a huge blow for centrism, and the portents do not look good. A new Demos poll for La Repubblica shows the Eurosceptic Five Start Movement would win an Italian general election tomorrow, with Mr Renzi’s current approval rating at just 40% – a 34 point slump from its 74% peak in June 2014.
That is not to mention a referendum planned for October in Hungary by Viktor Orban, the anti-immigration prime minister, who wants to deliver a sharp poke in the eye to Brussels with his foregone conclusion rejecting mandatory immigration quotas.
Or as Mr junker likes to call him . The dictator.

In fact, the EU was pretty p*ssed off with us at the start as they were afraid money would flow from other non-guaranteed banks across the EU into Ireland. So the FF government at the time thought they’d pulled a fast one.
When it turned out that it was a solvency crisis, not a liquidity crisis, it was then that the EU basically said, ‘you’ve made your bed, you can go lie in it now’.
That said, although I’d consider myself pro-European, the EU has made it very hard in recent years to be. I do think that making us shoulder the vast majority of European banking debt is grossly unfair, as has been the way they’ve treated Cyprus and Greece. Also, the way they’ve treated the refugees, is horrific- basically letting hundreds of people drown. I think this is why they’re going to lose the vote in the UK.

The ECB demanded that Ireland stop the flow of cash out of its banks, but refused to lift a finger to help. As disastrously as Fianna Fail had run the thing up to that point, what exactly were its other options then? Labour are very proud of having opposed the bank guarantee. What they fail to mention is that they favoured nationalisation instead, which would have ended up with precisely the same sovereign liabilities.
Then there was the deal with the senior bondholders. What deal? The deal that didn’t happen. NTMA had a buy back ready to go. It would have saved us billions. The ECB said no.
Then there was the Prom Note, a deal which required us to take €3B out of the economy every single year, and burn it. A deflationary policy in a deflating economy. Eventually Europe sees how foolish this is, and signs off a trillion euro money-printing exercise. But does it reverse its own policy which is contributing to the problem it is trying to solve? It does not. Sorry Ireland, thanks for the bail out.

Secondly, Labour’s solution of nationalisation wouldn’t have amounted to the same result as the guarantee. When you nationalise something, that doesn’t mean you’re going to pay ALL creditors which is what the guarantee said it would do. You could nationalise the banks, take their shares off the market, which then buys you time to see which ones should be saved and which ones wound up, i.e. Anglo Irish. It’s completely incorrect to say Ireland had “no choice”. We did, and we made a bad one.
It was the guarantee that meant we couldn’t “burn” some of the bondholders. Yes, the EU subsequently wouldn’t let us renege on this but I said that in my initial comment when I said that the EU said ‘you’ve made your bed, you can go lie in it now’.

We have seen repeatedly in referendums that the only choices available to us are “Yes” or “let’s try this again”. There is even talk of a common defence plan, flying in the face of Irish and Swedish neutrality. All the while they claim a United States of Europe is not their aim.

Quote “British taxpayer money is funding ‘anti-racism’ groups which actively campaign against British political parties, Breitbart London can exclusively reveal, and has handed nearly half a million pounds of taxpayer money to one group with far-left links and a strong and overt anti-UKIP agenda.
…UKIP candidate Gawain Towler told Breitbart London: “No-one has a problem with fighting racism on the terraces, and SRTRC has had significant success in its campaign which is to be applauded. However when the taxpayer is funding partisan political activity during an election campaign, then clear rules have been breached. Today, it is clear that the group has gone way beyond its remit, and in doing do undermines the good it has done in the past.”
SRTRC lists a number of governmental bodies, quangos and other groups as “Friends and Sponsors”, including several local councils and trades unions. It also lists among its friends far-left groups such as Hope Not Hate and Unite Against Fascism, whose members have been accused of behaving violently towards UKIP supporters.

I was in Birmingham a few years ago for the first time and I was gobsmacked by the fact that the City CBD was
predominantly Muslim; not recent arrivals mind you, but hard-grained English Muslims with the smock/frock
and sandals & birkas…………..the Full Monty!
There was little evidence of interracial marriage and Arabic/Farsi Pakistani were the predominant languages.
Even the Library, a fabulous building architecturally, has predominantly Middle Eastern/Pakistani employees
and patrons and it wasn’t until I got to the “ancestry” area that I saw caucasians at all.
Muslims who practice their faith also practice apartheid (the ultimate in racism ) by only marrying fellow Muslims,
eating Halal, Sharia Banking , seperate schools and building Muslim enclaves etc. This socially aliemnates them
from mainstream society and some would say that this is not coincidental; that’s the Muslim way.
While I readily admit that a high %age of English caucasians are racist, there is clear evidence that a fair whack England’s Muslim population is racist too.
But I guess the cool-aid test is the incidence of interracial marriages. Lets face it, if one precludes the possibility
of self-perpetuation via soul, heaven and all that jazz, there’s little left except the children and the grandchildren

Regardless, the Fine Gael government has decoded to say without confirmed credibility, to say the citizens it knows what everyone is thinking on the matter.

We of course here by even raising all this, risk REDACTED pulling out the now usual threat of solicitors being showed don throats of those that might even dare question just what the hell is going on in our country and anything he might be connected to. Don’t dare comment or ask questions on anything surrounding REDACTED – the threats come out, trying many to be forced therefore into silence – which is exactly what someone might want!
Meanwhile the spineless Enda Kenny and FG Party that stated six years ago, they would do something about all this – the public is still waiting – instead, is again sucking up to the EU, one sided interfering in another countries referendum – having supposedly read our minds?
Just maybe their pre-holiday time might be better spent on other things instead like the 8th amendment they are ducking as an issue, the homeless crises they are trying to gloss over, the HSE privatisation by back-door agenda going on, the bin weight charges issue they are ducking, the NAMA/IBRC operations that are crying out for investigations and a lot more?
“Hell no!” says Fine Gael. Before we swan off leaving a lot hanging, lets stick our noses un-royally into England affairs!

If people in the UK and in Ireland knew the real truth of the French strikes and unrest, which is being kept out of MSM, no one would want to stay in the EU.
The French government legislated, by railroading through their parliament without a vote, laws that would make it easy for employers to hire cheap migrant labour, and fire the native French workforce. It’s not simply about a 35hr working week, the only issue touted when mentioned in MSM, to give the spin that the strike is about lazy French workers.
This change in legislation was lobbied for by French and multi national corporations, to take advantage of the big pool of migrant workers there, for cheap labour.
This is the reality we all face from the neoliberal governments of the EU, controlled by the undemocratic ECB who now controls the EU. Ireland is going to be facing the same if ever TTIP becomes a reality here.

And because the EU is the veritable HQ of elite liberalism, they cannot hide their disdain and contempt for those who reject it.
The reality is that issues such as free markets, foundational rights and immigration can be addressed bilaterally or multilaterally without the need for a Leviathan such as the EU, if the political will is there. What’s more is that it would give countries the freedom and flexibility to tailor such agreements to their specific needs at specific times.
But the liberal elites don’t want that. They want the neofunctional behemoth of the EU. They know that for the EU to succeed it has to glean more and more power from sovereign states until it becomes the ONLY entity with real power. And then the Liberal elites will have free reign to impose their Brave New World.
So the Brexit really upset them. That’s why they have their lapdogs like the author trying to shame the British people for asserting sovereignty. That’s why they are funding astroturf “pro-eu” groups. Groups, it seems are full of the same simple minded Leftists who two years ago, protested AGAINST the very same union.

If the the reverse was to happen they would not mind increasing the price of their goods arguing that the €uro has got weaker than the Pound.,"Oct 13th 2016, 2:43 PM"
https://www.thejournal.ie/tesco-marmite-row-3024009-Oct2016/,"It’s not as simply as that.
When goods are shipped internationally, there isn’t a cheque handed over there and then, nor is the UK supplier necessarily giving the Irish store stock on tick.
In short, there are two banks in between, who supply a letter of credit (for a fee, like). The Irish bank extends a letter of credit to the UK bank so that the supplier in the UK knows that the recipient in Ireland is ‘good for it’, and they agree to extend at a UK price for goods, which get paid for via the Irish bank and the UK bank when the goods are delivered. In short, trust is delegated to the two banks that trust eachother (or trust eachother via an intermediary if necessary)
So the cost to the retailer of that book, magazine or TV didn’t just drop overnight with the exchange rate. Even if they have agreement not to pay yet for some stock, they will still owe the Irish bank against the letter of credit, who in turn will owe the English bank sterling. The supplier may even have been paid in some cases, with either bank holding onto the promise to pay.
So who might actually benefit from an overnight exchange rate drop? Well, the banks providing trade finance might. They are independent of the goods exchanged, it’s just a financial contract between banks.
Now, in theory, the next shipment might be bought quicker, but trade finance is going to be expensive with fluctuating currency, so the costs (or exchange rate margin) charged by the bank to provide UK goods to a Euro consumer in Ireland won’t swing wildly with the exchange rate, because they have to pad for further volatility. As such, the full effect is unlikely to be seen by Irish retailers.
In summary, if you want to enjoy the exchange rate, go on amazon, there’s no trade finance and you buy on a spot price. I bought stuff this week that I’d been thinking about for a while.
Aside: this is why basket case economies become basket case economies. When your government devalues your peso (Argentina), or threatens to stop sovereign bond replayments, your national banks are immediately suspect, and the bank in UK, USA (or anywhere else) begins demanding hard currency (GBP, CHF, EURO, YEN) for payment. This means the bank cannot provide trade finance for international goods, as they run out of hard currency reserves very quickly with very unfavourable rates being provided to sell the peso, or whatever.
Suddenly your importers cannot import – oil and petrol become difficult to import (dollar denominated) and have to be rationed, and food commodities face inevitable shortage. Foreign currency is often confiscated from dollar-denominated accounts at this point and forcibly converted to local currency.
This is what faced Greece a couple of years ago, without the currency exchange part – an inability to import as their banks (who should provide the guarantee of payment) weren’t good for it, and the euros start to leave the country really quickly. Hence capital controls, to keep funds in greece to allow for fuel and food imports. Import requires internationally trusted banks, and the ECB are providing the cover trust for Greek banks.","Oct 13th 2016, 5:32 PM"

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/boris-johnson-accused-of-dishonest-gymnastics-over-ttip-u-turn
The former mayor of London, a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, wrote in his Daily Telegraph column in October 2014 that TTIP – a deal being negotiated by the EU commission with Washington – was a “great project”. He said: “It is Churchillian in that it builds transatlantic links, it is all about free trade, and it brings Britain and Europe closer to America. The idea is to create a gigantic free-trade zone between the EU and the US … There is absolutely nothing not to like about the TTIP.
“As Churchill might have said, it is altogether unsordid. And yet virtually the only commentary we have been offered is absurdly hostile and misinformed. The debate is dominated by leftwing misery guts anti-globalisation campaigners.”
In his Telegraph piece, Johnson rejected any idea that the free-trade deal could threaten the NHS by leaving it open to competition from US firms, a view now taken by Vote Leave. He wrote: “If we get the TTIP agreed, it will certainly not mean the privatisation of the NHS, and nor will it mean a green light for fracking [in] Sussex. At the very most, it will mean that there is some protection against government deciding – locally, at state level or nationally – to legislate in some arbitrary and unexpected way so as to discriminate against foreign companies.
Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke

“That strikes me as a very useful thing for British companies, both large and small. This new free-trade pact with America is not a threat: it is a sensational opportunity to break down the remaining barriers to trade with … the biggest single export destination for Britain.”
However, in a speech last Monday backing Brexit, Johnson changed his tune, likening the EU’s role in the continuing TTIP talks to a “pantomime horse” in which the 28 member states tried, chaotically, to agree a joint position on a venture that was preventing the UK from striking its own, quicker and more effective bilateral trade deals.
The speech by Johnson, who has written a biography of Churchill, lampooned the TTIP process. “As for the argument that we need the muscle of EU membership if we are to do trade deals – well, as I say, at the results after 42 years of membership, the EU has done trade deals with the Palestinian Authority and San Marino. Bravo. But it has failed to conclude agreements with India, China or even America,” he said. “Why? Because negotiating on behalf of the EU is like trying to ride a vast pantomime horse, with 28 people blindly pulling in different directions.”
He added: “For decades, deals with America have been blocked by the French film industry, and the current TTIP negotiations are stalled at least partly because Greek feta cheese manufacturers object to the concept of American feta. They may be right, aesthetically, but it should not be delaying us in this country.”
Soames told the Observer that Johnson’s change of position was astonishing, but not surprising. “This is typical of Boris’s now regular inconsistencies in praising the TTIP transatlantic deal as Churchillian a mere 18 months ago, and now having jumped ship, apparently changing his mind yet again,” he said. “It is another example of Boris’s complete lack of credibility and coherence on this very important transaction. People will simply not understand this fundamentally dishonest gymnastics.”","May 15th 2016, 8:53 AM"

There were upwards of 70,000 fraudulent signatures (that’s only the ones they could prove) struck off the petition to have a second EU referendum recently. Authorities saw signatures coming from areas such as North Korea, where they obviously don’t have the internet access to sign the petition.

The fact that the vote was Leave is probably awaking a new sense of nationalism in many over in UK and unfortunately some might be taking it to believe this about racial prejudice, and now believe they have a licence to be openly racist. But let’s also recognize that if someone is a racist then they are still a racist regardless of either outcome of the vote. But also we need to respect that people should be able to debate freely on things like immigration, multiculturalism, globalization and other topics without being labelled racist or bigoted. I see so often on these forums any rational debate descends into a shouting match. Let’s try to remain calm and use rational thought and facts. I think the Brexit situation is probably driving a few different things right now. The mainly Left Remain side is infuriated with the result and doing all they can to sway public opinion in the hope of a revote which is very similar to how Ireland was forced to go again to the polls a few years back. So don’t be surprised to see more and more in the mainstream media about how the vote is leaving the UK disadvantaged, when in reality we won’t know for many years to come. But one thing is for sure if the UK does actually leave we will be able to see in great detail with real data on the difference between the UK versus EU on things like immigration, economic policy, social policy etc. So then hopefully we can make more informed decisions on what is the correct path based on facts rather than feels.","Jul 1st 2016, 12:13 PM"

But how you see this as a good thing for post-Brexit trade negotiations is somewhat confusing. Many of the EU economies are struggling, and the EU wishes to remedy this. Why would they grant preferential access to an outsider to supply them with goods (The UK has a surplus in services with the EU) when that can be taken up by a member state (car manufacturing in Spain – a country with massive structural unemployment problems , for instance).
However, if you believe the EU will be happy to agree to “free trade” with the UK they absolutely will have to make concessions on immigration laws with regard to mobility of workers. Every non EU country in the EFTA does. Switzerland, who has a separate agreement with the EU on this voted to change it and the EU severed their participation in the H2020 research programme and that still hasn’t been resolved.

The primary driving factor is fear of immigration. British people don’t want any more immigrants, they have started to feel besieged. I visited London last week and spoke to quite a few ordinary English people, including those who had entered the UK as immigrants 10 to 20 years ago.
The recurring themes was that people were fed up with refugees and migrants coming in, they feel invaded and they don’t want anybody else coming in.
Reasons given were scarcity of housing, even terrorism from people from other EU member states, creeping ethnic dominance from the influx of Muslims, abuse of social welfare and a feeling of lack of control over the affairs of the U.K. It does not matter that on objective grounds these fears and apprehensions are largely misplaced, this is what voters feel and think.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nicola-sturgeon-independence-survey-2960827-Sep2016/,"‘A bigger question would be should Scotland be allowed have another indyref.”
Of course they should.
“Brexit was part of the political landscape two years ago and Scots could have taken into account the possibility of Brexit when they voted.”
How could they? For a start pretty much nobody though it would happen. Even after polling closed Farage as much as admitted he didn’t think it would happen.
“Hence does it really constitute an unexpected material change?”
The UK leaving the EU is pretty much the definition of a material change of circumstances. How can you even ask that with a straight face?
“Plus don’t forget this time two years ago the SNP said the indyref was a ‘once in a generation’ decision by Scots. Why shouldn’t they be held to that promise now?”
They also said in their 2016 Manifesto that The SNP’s 2016 Scottish election manifesto stated that a material change in circumstances would act as the basis for another independence referendum. Brexit clearly is that, why shouldn’t the be held to that promise now? Or do we just have to deal with the ones your limited knowledge/selective quoting/political outlook chooses?
“You cannot have a situation whereby every time something happens that the SNP don’t like they demand a new indyref. So if as expected the Tories win in 2020 is it indyref3 etc.”

Nobody could object to reasonable controls on migration and this is an issue that the EU is going to have to tackle especially in terms of access to social welfare.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-5-2899148-Jul2016/,"“That is because the E.U. tells us who we can trade with”
No. The EU doesn’t tell us anything. We tell the EU what to do. How hard is it for you lot to understand that. The EU can only act on the competencies we have given permission to them to act on. Trade is one of them and the decisions to act at an EU level are made, always, by the collective decision of the constituent member states and enacted by the democratically elected European Parliament. Always.
Trade is one of those competencies. The single market is hugely advantageous to both the UK and Ireland. Trade between the two countries is easier than it ever was before. Remove one from that and things are very different. This was known when it came to the brexit vote, but little England chose to ignore it.
” the U.K. will save us if the E.U. collapses as that is a possibility”
Almost everything is possible, though it’s likelihood is another matter. If the EU collapses, which is massively unlikely, the impact on the global economy will be far beyond what we experienced 8 years ago.
” the E.U. is the only block in the world not seeing any growth, why is that??? AUSTERITY with Q.E.”
You mean the Eurozone, not the EU, right? You know there is a difference? You know the UK is part of the EU, but not part of the Eurozone, right? Also, both the UK and the EU engaged in QE and pursued an austerity policy.
Anyway in the first quarter of 2015 the Eurozone grew at a faster rate than the UK economy. How do you like them apples?

We use the Euro, so we have more strings attached than England had because how we trade effects the Euros worth as in imports and exports, especially exports, where do you think all the manufacturing has gone. More exports, more tax and the less a country has to borrow on the markets, all the Euro / ECB wants is debt, debt is something to trade in. You think Merkel brought in austerity because of her good nature, it was great for Germany when it came to their own exports?
Also great for the Troika with their buy out scenarios and plundering’s.
Q.E. is a joke, it only makes money for those who get it first and for those at the end of the queue it creates inflation for them? The ECB is running out of things to do now as the Euro is dying unless they try a political union but hay the EU is not democratic anyway, so why not, might even bring in a banking hair cut here like they did in Cyprus?

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-poll-2849468-Jun2016/,"One objection I would have to take real issue with is the idea that a border poll would be a ‘sectarian headcount’. Partition exists on this island as a physical manifestation of a ‘sectarian headcount’ and the sole apparent rationale for the British government retaining control over part of Ireland is based on the same ‘sectarian headcount’ and is merely privileging and perpetuating the deeply-held prejudices of a small minority in the north-eastern counties. There appears to be no real economic or social argument for retention of a border within Ireland. The implications of a Brexit vote are the advent of some sort of unionist nirvana of a hard EU-UK border on the island of Ireland is the ultimate sectarian fantasy. Given the preference of the majority of those in the north to remain within the EU (whatever it’s faults) over furthering greater divisions on the island, it is now time for the Irish establishment and its political arms in FG, FF and Labour to step forward. After almost a century of pretty much continuous appeasement and endorsement of the worst unionist excesses, most unionists will accept their bonafides if these parties were to step forward and engage on Irish unity. Currently, most are happy to portray Irish unity as a Sinn Féin project (when ultimately even Sinn Féin, and more so the IRA, would happily admit it is a vehicle for re-establishing an Irish republic along the lines of the 1916 proclamation, not accession to power for either body). Confirming and reinforcing the idea that Irish unity is an ambition greater than the sum of its parts will have a much deeper resonance with unionists if it also comes from within the Irish establishment. Certainly it would pretty much guarantee sufficient support to ensure the success of a border poll. Unfortunately, that same establishment has singularly failed to lead on so many issues that it appears that Sinn Féin are required to push calls for a border poll in the hope of awakening a debate. At a wider level, if FG and FF could, for once, be proactive it might mark a transcendent moment where collectively we take control of our destiny and future rather than allowing to be dictated by others or chance.","Jun 30th 2016, 10:39 AM"

The Commonwealth… right.
The EU is actually an incredibly lean political organisation. For the amount of work they do they spend an incredibly small amount on non-core action. The benefit of some of the spending (CAP for instance) is arguable but overall is huge value for money.

That’s a very simplistic way of viewing it.
Firstly because the UK is one country and the “EU” is a collection of counties. While about 44% of all the UK’s exports go to the EU, only about something between 8-17% (depending on the figures you use) of the EU’s exports go to the UK. So almost half of the UK’s exports are at risk, while less that 20% of the EU’s is. Works out at about 12% of the British economy compared to 3-4% of the EU economy.
Also, the majority of the UK’s trade exports to the EU are in the form of services (, about £90bn a year, 80% of the UK economy is made up trade in services) and much of that financial and most of that depends on EU access and passporting rights.

But ultimately he’s right that it will leave both sides worse off. Soft Brexit – Britain leaves the EU but still accepts most EU legislation over the Single Market….legislation it did not have a say in making. Not exactly the kind of freedom worth having imo. Hard Brexit – Britain takes no EU legislation but is put outside the world’s biggest trading block. Not exactly a great move towards freer trade. In both cases, the EU loses Britain’s valuable ideas and size.
The EU is a big trade off. One the one hand, the single market with strong social protections is the best attempt humanity has made yet at harvesting the benefits of free trade without the costs of a race to the bottom. Moreover, it helps governments take on challenges that they cannot address on their own, be it addressing climate change or protecting personal privacy on the worldwide web. On the other hand, it moves very slowly and once a law is established at EU level it is very difficult to repeal because you need so many governments to agree. This is not good for encouraging democratic participation.
To my mind, though, it’s still a very valuable trade-off because of its extension of personal liberty. In Ireland and all over the world, people have struggled for years to gain certain rights for themselves: the right to work where you want and with whomever you want; the right to study what you want, at the university you want to attend; the right to marry who you want wherever they’re from; the right to travel where you want for as long as you like……all without the government stepping in and saying “no you cannot be here, no you cannot hire this person or work with that person; no, you cannot study here because you have wrong papers; no you’re not allowed marry this person because of your origins”. In the EU, 28 democracies have agreed that their citizens can engage with each other in these private affairs unhindered by the big hand of government. It’s the only place in the world where these personal rights extend beyond your own country of citizenship into a cosmopolitan neighbourhood of nations. And it’s about to get a good bit smaller. Sad.

You would. Firstly, nobody but the French are happy about Strasbourg,
The EUParl costs about €1.795 billion annually. Which is about 1.2% of the EU’s annual budget. So the decamp to Strasbourg for the plenary sessions costs about 0.07% of the entire budget. They have streamlined the costs of the decamp to the bone. Nobody, French aside, agree with the move but it’s almost impossible to change it.
Overall 17% of the EU budget goes on administration costs, which includes paying for admin staff, buildings, running the offices etc. Given the size of the organisation and the breadth of work done it is incredibly lean by any rational standard.
“Services and teleconferencing (unlike the EU’s travelling circus) will bridge trading partners when distance is an obstacle. With modern interconnectedness, Britain’s insular nature should not present a barrier.”
80% of the UK’s economy is services already, if they lose the financial sector owing to loss of passporting there won’t me much else they can do and if there are tariffs with the EU they’re again disadvantaged.
“Britain is largely self sufficient agriculturally (at least it was before the EU).”
How does that even make sense to you enough to type it? Either is now or it isn’t. the UK has been a member of the EU for 43 years so there’s a hell of a long time between now and then.

Nor does the bulk of the EU except where it comes to hate speech because many EU States had direct experience of fascism and saw the outcome of unrestrained hate speech.

Investors choose Ireland because she is a window to EU, thanks to its low corporation tax and English speaking. If she is no longer a window, it will become less attractive to investors. Ireland would probably be back to farming again. This is a big step down. In contrast, if UK pulls out, Ireland will be the only English speaking country in EU (Malta is too far way from Europe). I will see a big opportunity there. Moreover, as the common zone of UKI will still remain, there will be a limited impact to the trade with UK.
As a small country, it has been and will be dominated by big countries, Germany, France, US, UK, or even China. There is no choice because you were born in a small country. The point is we have to choose a right one to maximize our benefit.","Nov 9th 2015, 10:59 AM"

But then we have other problems. I never liked the Euro currency and I think we should have stuck with our punt especially considering the UK wasn’t going with the euro. There’s no going back now really on that. Not only that we have officials in EU dicating fiscal policies to us. OK, fair enough we share the same currency.

Who voted for them to take the lead over Europe and European fiscal policies? More recently Merkel came out and critised Ireland for the issues surrounding the middle East migrants.

Any vote on Eu membership should be extended to irish citizens living in other EU country’s.
Ask yourself how business trading with the EU will fare? I can tell you impost and export across non EU borders is a headache, shipping between EU states is so hassle free compared to this.
Look at Norway, look at Switzerland I hear you say. Theseare both wealthy countrys in their own right, we have become wealthy through trade and open borders with Europe They have free trade, no travel restrictions with the EU. Well Norway believes it pays almost as much to be a non-member to get this access as it would if it was a full member. Of course this also comes with the provisio that Norway must abide by EU regualtions that it has no say in formulating (It complies with about 75% of EU regulations) but still doesn’t get full rights. In fact a Norwegian airline uses an Irish AOC to gain acess to EU aviation bilaterals. Ryanair for example would have to shift out of Ireland. The same story goes for Switzerland.

And if anybody is going to lecture us about being “imbeciles” as we peacefully leave this ossified union and gain our self determination; it is not the nation that tore itself through violence in the name of self determination from another Union 100 years ago whilst the UK was in the middle of a fight for its national survival. That really would be the highest form of stinking hypocrisy.
However since I want the UK to leave the EU I welcome all Irish voices to this debate – especially the patronising ones that live in academia calling us stupid – to pipe up and say we should stay in the EU. A nation that has had its hand in our wallet as an EU Foreign Aid beneficiary for 40 years, a nation that after being bailed out by the Bank Of England when the Tiger Economy went belly up joined with their EPP buddies and voted Mr Junker on us, a nation whose voice reminds us of coded warnings to evacuate our pubs and shopping centres. Write articles, come on our talk shows, appear on TV – please.
And I’m glad you won’t miss the second largest net financial contributor to the EU Mr Lucey. Perhaps Ireland will be generous and put their hands in their own pockets. I believe the Irish are about to become a net contributor for the first time ever. I am curious where Ireland will get the support that will keep those nice corporate tax rates in place since the Germans & French have said they want rid of them once the evil English stop providing diplomatic top cover. Might be some office space going round Grand Canal & SJRQ. Or where those jobs will come from since the UK has created more jobs over the last few years than the rest of the EU combined. Ignore the fact that due to demographics alone Britain will overtake Germany as Europe’s Largest economy in 20 years – Source CEBR – sure that won’t be missed either. I see that Intellectual rigour regarding world finance is why Trinity is right up there with Harvard, Yale, Oxford & Cambridge.
Oh and as for Scotland leaving the UK for the EU. Dream on bearing in mind the current oil price, the attitude of Spain saying that Scotland will not be allowed in the EU under any circumstances, and the fact that they would be putting a border up over 75% of their “Exports” in England to “save” less than 5% that they send to the EU.","Mar 10th 2015, 9:49 PM"

- The list includes Uk, Germany, Spain, France, Russia
- Of course the UK empire mostly existed in backward places where they butchered and murdered effectively defenceless native people that had no armies or modern weaponry.
- WW1 was a war of greed among European empires Austro/hungarian, France, Uk, Germany, Russia.
- WW2 was essentially the same war made inevitable by an crippling treaty forced on Germany by a vengeful France and Uk. That treaty essentially gave the fascists power across Europe.
- Hitler was a fascist supremacist with extraordinary leadership skills who exploited people for his empire building dreams. For the record Churchill was also an empire loving supremacist ( look up his attitude to Gandhi and india).
- European fascism in WW2 was mostly defeated by the Russians with American capitalism. France capitulated and the Uk sat on the sidelines until the Usa got involved, their grand army cowardly retreated back to their island fortress with their tails between their legs at Dunkirk.
- How the worm turns. Fascism in Russia with Putin is the greatest threat to modern day peace. The Eu with or without the Uk who as in WW2 will most likely sit on the sidelines until an easy victory is assured. And then stride in claiming they defeated tyranny!","Mar 11th 2015, 12:12 PM"

The E.U. is run by bankers and is made up from ex Goldman Sachs employees, the E.U. is run by the Troika, the Eurogroup and the ECB.
John Perkins, Former Advisor IMF.
“My job was to identify countries with resources that corporations covert, like oil and then arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or from one of its sister organisations. The money however would not go to the country, it would go to our own corporations who would make huge profits, but the majority of the people would suffer terrible as a result, because money would be diverted from Education, Healthcare and other Social Services to pay interest on the debt.”
What happened when the IMF moved in and the debt couldn’t be repaid?
“We go back into that country and say, since you can’t pay your debt, sell your resource oil or whatever real cheap to our corporations without any environmental restrictions or, or social regulations. Privatise, sell your electric utilities, your water, sewage systems, your schools, your jails, all your public sector businesses to our corporations, and in the few cases where we failed economic hitman, the jackals went in and still do and aah, they either assassinate the leaders of the country or overthrow them in coups.”
Greece has got 84 billion in loans over 3 years BEFORE THE LAST SET OF LOANS and Greece in return has to put 50 billion worth of assets into a segregated account that will later be sold off to the global community and when they are sold off by the Troika to banks and to hedge funds. It is estimated that it will make the Troika under 200 billion minus the 84 billion.
These assets will collateralise the loan but is a LEVERAGE BUYOUT by the global community, banks and Hedge funders.
Yet banks and the E.U. knew everything before loaning the money to these countries especially Greece, Many who were in Goldman Sachs are employed in the E.U. civil service like Dragi and it was Goldman Sachs who cooked the books for Greece joining the E.U. in the first place.
Yet only the Troika are the only ones who can sell Greece’s Income Producing Assets and make a profit from them to the Hedge Fund Community.
In 2010 Merkel protected the European banks and Hedge Funds from Billions in losses by putting the debt onto European tax payers. So PRIVATE DEBT from the loans made to countries like Greece were made knowing that they were bad loans. Yet Merkel knew in 2010 what was going to happen.
Then Merkel stepped in as the saviour of the E.U. and transferred all the bad debt from the banks and put it onto the European tax payer by making private debt sovereign debt issue then and therefore a problem of the whole E.U. falling apart.
Austerity was brought in for this, to look after the financial system using politics to cause LEVERAGE BUYOUT SENARIOS. Remember at the beginning of the Euro that the ECB made countries borrow Euros cheaply at low interest rates to banks that caused a boom and a rise in the value of the Euro and yet the ECB knew the financial make up of every country in the Eurozone in tax intake and debt.
Yet these same people knew that AUSTERITY causes debt to rise, to cause job losses and therefore countries to borrow more as jobs create taxes, imports and less borrowing on the international markets but the Troika forced Austerity as it looks now to create LEVERAGE BUYOUT SCENARIOS.
The TROIKA played us, they fed us, they pretended to look after us and when they are ready they will slaughter us like a butcher and that is what the E.U. is.
After Greece then who else as there is Italy, Portugal, Spain and us before they start on Eastern Europe? We have been fattened like farmyard PIGS for Farmer Merkel and friends.
What is left will be used to make TTIP soup with and the only thing that won’t be used is our squeal as no one is listening. Don’t forget the TiSA Agreement either?

Oh to know
what is right to do
Before we get
Referendum flu
Should we stay
Or should we go
Here is what you need to know
Simply ask what is the score
Who will gain and who has more
Where is equality in this state
Look carefully at what’s not on your plate
Disparity in wealth does often make
An angry population quake
The thing to do is very clear
Demand equal rights not cheaper beer
Tax all those with extreme wealth
Tax the land around their belt
Remove the barriers to education
Educate every child in this nation
Remove all feudal gains from ancient fights
Let your child be privileged with full state rights
Remove the class that keeps you down
Be a citizen of state not a subject clown
So now open up your eyes
See who has eaten all the pies
Where has the wealth that you have made
Gone sequestered on tax free trade
Why do some tories want UK out
It’s not for equality that they shout
They want control over you
To keep profit and wealth for the few
So ask those rich men why they don’t care
When our disabled folk are going spare
And our NHS staff are forced to cry
When all dignity is taken before we die
We need change for this won’t do
Talk to your friends and neighbours too
Ask what politics can really do
To redistribute wealth from the very few","Jun 23rd 2016, 1:39 PM"

They are as you say our biggest export market but that can be offset against the raids that have been carried out on the Irish economy by the UK government through their agents, the RBS and Ulster Bank who were the instigators of a new style of evictions by handing out loans for business expansion and asking for the money back when projects were half completed. Then they appoint receivers and sell the properties to themselves with NAMA ex – employees and RBS and Ulster Bank employees up to their necks in the stripping of major land banks and properties and transferring them into UK owned companies that the UK government control.

Many are unemployed people looking for work just like the immigrants coming in from the Eastern part of the continent and many have serious criminal backgrounds, again just like the UK have accused the Poles/Bulgarians/Romanians who move to their country as having.
Unfortunately because the Irish must as always seek to meekly follow in the UKs wake, the media here has too attempted to create a caricature of the EU as some kind of lofty boogeyman, ruling down from on high and swiping away the sovereignty of nations which wouldn’t have been indebted if it wasn’t for the EU project in the first place. That argument is nil and while it may be populace, the figures bear it out as such.
While thankfully the Irish people aren’t gullible enough to believe the tripe that Ireland would be better off outside the Union it will become a consideration in the future when the commentariat of this state need another strawman to burn in the face of Ireland’s woes.
Until then we’ll unfortunately have to put up with the insightful drivel about Ireland not benefiting from EU membership, although those who state such as if it were fact clearly haven’t accounted for exactly how worse off Ireland would be if we would have never joined the Union at all.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/what-happens-to-ireland-if-the-uk-exits-the-eu-1201725-Dec2013/,"britain joined the common market , not the european union, when it joined it ws for reasons of trade, since then the re vamped common market became the european union, it numbers grew and corruption became rife withi in it . this is NOT the same organisation that both britain and ireland signed up too. it has become little more than a blotted burocatic nightmare run by and on behalf off central european countries like france and germany. it has little interest in the woes of its smaller member states and see them as little more than fodder which at any given time can be overtaken and consummed by the larger states.
As island countries seperate from the european land mass, both britain and ireland and ireland have very few cultural links with the rest of the e.u. and both are seen by the poorer e.u nations as places in which a better lifestyle can be obtained without the need to work or contribute to the state coffers via tax’s or any other means.
while the e.u has no doubt in the past been of financial and political use to ireland we are now being forced to pay a heavy price for the few good thins we got from the eu. our fisheries are plundered by every other eu nation ,yet our fishermen are spending more time on dry land ,unable to go to sea thanks to the eu’s squwed quota system, and when they do bring in a catch, most of it has to be returned dead to the sea in order to maintain the artificially high prices the rest of europe demands, the same can be said of our agricultural sector, we are selling beef, grain and dairy products at a far lower price than other eu countries yet we have to import them at higher prices.
the u.k dodged a bullet when it elected to stay out of the single currency, ireland im sorry to say was not so lucky, maybe one day we will find out what certain politicians gained in order for us joining the euro, the same may be true of the bailout and the bondholder issues also. either way this country that in 2 years time shoud be celibrating it’s centenial of independence is instead shackled without sovourenty and without the very independence that those men fought for . shame on our political classes for not only allowing this to happen but for aiding and abeting it too happen ,all in the pursuit of their own greed and self gratification. finally i dont believe it is a case of IF the uk leave the european union, i think it is a case of WHEN they leave.
as for Ireland , we should at least consider leaving the single currency and returning to the punt , and then think about a referendum that would be about the wishes of the people , and for the good of the people ,not just the political classes.","Dec 9th 2013, 11:43 PM"

Austria is ignoring lectures from Brussels on its daily restrictions of refugee numbers. Eastern Europe is having absolutely none of it. Even France is refusing to obey Merkel’s redistribution plan. Hungary has just called a referendum to show up the antidemocratic EU for what it is.
That’s what we need too. A referendum can enshrine in the constitution that migration policy must be decided at national level only and no international agreements may supercede it. Then we decide who we offer asylum to and on what basis. That’s what the bigger states of Europe are already implementing.

Companies in Ireland that are trading with the UK took advantage of the strong Euro against the weak pound directly after BREXIT. They saw an increase in foreign sales because of this. The UK will take 5-10 years to recover after the Brexit is implemented. The UK companies purchasing their raw materials from the EU have not been affected yet with tariffs they’ve just been affected by their weak currency. It is the case many a company in the UK and Northern Ireland if they have not claimed an EU/Irish vat number will try and do so soon enough to avail of continuing to trade with the EU. Is there any business in Ireland that would like to pay 23% more for their goods from the UK plus they will have to increase costs due to manufacturing difficulties and inflation. Many Irish companies buy from the UK for availability of stock with fast shipping times and they hold the licence for many products because Ireland is such a small market. But that will change. These companies will no longer be able to take products to claim for distribution to Ireland and the UK. Ireland will make savings by buying goods from other EU countries. However, we may not have the capability to buy as the UK will cause an economic collapse in Ireland.

http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/wolfgang-m%C3%BCnchau-ireland-may-have-to-consider-leaving-eu-1.2823535
For those who cannot read it, he basically argues for the concept of National Business Models where countries are built towards certain methods of being competitive in the international market much like companies are. Of course Ireland’s business model is facilitating international tax evasion through our liberal corporate tax.
With moves by the EU towards tax harmonisation and the loss of the UK to fight our corner with us, within the coming decade Ireland may just lose the primary reason for our economic success. Leaving the EU would prevent this from happening obviously as the EU would be unable to dictate what we do with our tax if we’re no longer a part of the bloc.
He basically gives two options, remain within the EU and shift our economic focus away from facilitating tax evasion or leave the EU and maintain that status as a tax haven. We can’t have both.","Oct 21st 2016, 8:56 AM"

The truth is that a large portion of British society is now racist and bigoted. This is largely due to the increased levels of uneducated ignorant people in their society (and globally this is the trend). There is a tolerance in Britain of bad behaviour and many media outlets and papers encourage it. Their attitude to football hooliganism also illustrates how bad it is. They have not and do not want to stamp it out. So I think that everyone needs to recognise this.

When you have a society where poor personal decisions are rewarded by a free house and benefits along with parents who have no interest in rearing their kids; you get these sort of chaps. The real problem is that these feral kids will themselves go on to have more feral kids supported by the teets of the taxpayer. Entire generations are growing up without contributing anything to society but with a superiority complex. Even a man who hasn’t worked a day in his life will tell you that working in a petrol station or as a labourer is below him.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-controls-britain-eu-enda-kenny-2795348-May2016/,"I think there’s two things that we need to be concerned about.
One is the very practical problem that there are farmers who have fields on both sides of the border. They need to cross it several times a day. In situations like that the delay may not be so tolerable. It’s also questionable whether we could afford to keep all the crossings (there are more than 100) open, so in some areas it would become a bit more than an inconvenience.
The other problem is the emotional one for Northern Nationalist. The open border allows them to feel more connected to the rest of the country and reduces tensions. It would certainly benefit the more extreme elements if a closed border was re-established.","May 30th 2016, 9:58 AM"

I don’t think the Brits could afford to or would have the will to enforce borders again in the North. It could potentially lead to many difficulties. But, people have had farms on both sides of the border since partition and it has never really been an issue. I suppose though that they would no longer have the option of moving their livestock from one side to another to avail of double grants.
Like everyone, I have no idea what the impact of a Brexit would be – but it is the choice of the British people and we must not interfere. Could you imagine the PM of Britain coming over here to canvass on a referendum to repeal the eighth!

All you will get, particulary from the anti Brexit side, is lies, spin and scaremongering.
The EU and what it has morphed into is no good for ordinary people in the EU. It’s now a bankers and corporate club. Where secret negotiations take place on trade agreements, where a secret EU army is evolving, where the EU is the lapdog of the American neoliberal warmongers. Democracy has gone out the window, there is not a vestige of it left, save the “vote”. Voting is useless when uturns on manifesto’s are the order of the day.
Dairy farmers have been sold down the swanney by Coveney and Hogan. And the Vultures are circling, ready for the meal that is being handed to them on a plate.
All i can see as benefits from being in the EU is a few roads. Some big farmers gained, many didn’t. The government pick and choose what EU laws they want to enforce, and ignore some that would benefit people. VRT being the prime example. I still have to carry a passport when i travel, and comply with the labour laws in the countries, EU members, where i might want to work. Then you look at the IMF/Trokia sponsored plundering of member states, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal,Italy. The enormous debts forced on the people of many of these states. There’s lots more on the negative side of membership, than there is on the positive side.
Any country that can get out should. The EEC was a very worthwhile project as conceived, with benefits for all sections of society. The EU as it evolved has become a rotten to the core, corrupt elitist club.

There is the other issue of free movement of persons between Ireland and the U.K., which is not restricted to work. This freedom of movement preceded the entry into the Common Market. That is an arrangement which can continue between Ireland and the U.K. Post Brexit (if it happens)?unless the UK decides that it wants to withdraw this bilateral arrangement. If Brexit takes place, it will be outside of the scope of the EU to impose restrictions on movement between Ireland and the U.K.
Trade controls are another issue. Likely the EU will seek to repeat existing trade arrangements but with the U.K. Now as a Third Country. It is difficult to forecast how restrictive or liberal such arrangements will be. It would make sense to have liberal arrangements as this fosters the greater benefit for all concerned. Mutual benefit and advantage wil likely prevail.
Brexit, if it happens, will pose a major crisis for Ireland. The effects will be bad. But Ireland can get through the crisis and manage the consequences.

Imagine a vote on Ireland leaving the EU or a vote on a United Ireland and David Cameron telling British citizens in Ireland to use their vote to get Ireland to leave the EU or to vote against a United Ireland!
The UK vote is for the people of the UK and those eligible to vote to decide and they alone. It is not for the Irish, the EU or anyone else to tell them what way to vote. We can make our views known but to actively encourage people to register to vote and influence the vote of a sovereign nation is wrong.","Jun 4th 2016, 8:09 AM"

The economic and trade cost of Brexit is irrelevant. It’s keep out the Eastern Europeans, keep out Middle East refugees and even some Western Europeans. Rightly or wrongly, the fear of Johnny Foreigner has hugely increased.
Therefore If Brexit is passed, the U.K. will erect very strict border controls and will ensure that Ireland is not used as a back door for immigrants and refugees to enter into the UK. It does not have to be this way, but it will.
Nation states are starting to turn in on themselves, seeking restoration of autonomy, sovereignty and reducing international cooperation.
The euro, which is a failed experiment, has caused huge disenchantment. The U.K. Realised that it made the right choice not to go into the Euro but if the EU could be so wrong about the euro, it can be so wrong on other issues. The EU and its institutions are fundamentally distrusted in the UK.
The U.K. Is an island nation with an insular outlook relative to the rest of Europe. Ireland had a more outward outlook but Ireland is also turning inwards but more slowly.
Irish people are petrified by what theysee as the spectre of immigration and in particular Irish people are scared of Islam. To many if not most Irish people , all immigrants are IS terrorists and they are totally subject to the desired objective of ISIS terrorists. Remember it is not the actuality or the reality of a threat which counts, it is the perception of threat which counts.
If Brexit passes, we will be facing the unraveling of a United, economically integrated Europe.
Cameron gambled on Brexit. Cameron failed to spot that the emerging conflagrations in Syria and Libya, the instabilities in Egypy and Turkey and the aftermath of Iraq and Afghanistan, would create an environment in which the average Brit could only see danger from aboard and blame the EU for what they see as excessively liberal immigration policies.

Such commercial flows, generating one tenth of all Irish jobs, could fall 20pc after Brexit, according to a recent report commissioned by the Irish government. Really? Yes, the UK is the largest overseas market for Ireland’s fast-growing service sector and the second-biggest destination for Irish merchandise exports, for one reason and one only. What is that? Not because of the EU, but because these two countries – and I’m truly honoured to be a citizen of both – are so close, both geographically and culturally.
The reality is that Ireland’s fabled diaspora, and the related range of its cultural and commercial contacts, means that it is a master at drumming up trade with non-EU countries, not least the US, of course. Massive Irish-American trade is facilitated not by the EU, but by mutual investment, bi-lateral trade deals and other commercial, ethnic, cultural and psychological ties which have absolutely nothing to do with Brussels.
Were Britain to quit the EU, this would all still apply. The UK and Ireland would rapidly forge an over-arching trade agreement, with London leading the charge. Why? Because despite the Republic’s consistent overall trade surpluses, and Britain’s equally consistent trade deficits, one of the few nations that regularly sells more to Ireland than it buys from Ireland is the UK. So it stands to reason that the UK will keep the trade gates wide open across the Irish Sea.
The main danger to the Irish economy is not that the UK leaves the EU, but that, with Deutsche Bank looking shaky and bond yields spiking anew among the weaker euro members, the eurozone itself could be in for a battering.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-and-the-falklands-2861602-Jul2016/,"Argentines are ludicrous. The British were first to make a claim to the Falkland Islands, 200 years before Argentina even came to existence. Argentina’s claim comes from a later Franco/Spanish claim that fails first due to it being a latter claim, and second on the preposterous notion that a revolutionary government can take de iuris possession of its predecessor’s claims (so Spain, again, has better claim than Argentina). And while it is true that there was some semblance of government control by 1830, it was destroyed by Americans who saw it as a threat to their whaling operations – thus it can be said that there were people on the islands when the British exercised their rights of property, they were transient fishermen and not an organized government.
Legality aside, in a defensive war Britain is stronger than all of South American put together, and with expanded runways on Ascension, St. Helena and East Falkland, can now deploy overwhelming force in a matter of hours instead of weeks. That’s why it has a seat on the Security Council.
The equivalences with other overseas territories also break down:
Gibraltar was transferred to Britain by treaty, and no one rational cannot acknowledge this fact. Gibraltar would like have joined the family of nations already if Spain wasn’t so petulant for land that has been outside its control for longer than they ever had it. Not to mention their hypocrisy when it comes to their exclaves on the Moroccan coast. And again, Britain has the military advantage – not only by itself, but through the immediate activation of NATO and the guaranteed arming of Catalan and Basque separatists
Hong Kong was to intricate to break apart, and maybe outside Cold War politics, could have been divided with concerted effort, the truth is that the Chinese held all the cards. Not only could the Chinese not be removed if they invaded, the previous government’s had stupidly allowed China to control Hong Kong’s fresh water supply and were more than happy to cut it off. The irony is, that Chinese rule chafes Hong Kong, and an independence movement is developing.
As for Diego Garcia, I feel for the Chagosians. But the fact remains that the only inhabitable island is under American control, and they’re unlikely to ever leave.","Jul 5th 2016, 9:34 AM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-leave-eu-why-stay-2852149-Jun2016/,"As a Leaver and a former worker may I give you some real insights into the rebellion.
I was a semi-retired professional doing a part time job for pocket money. My wife was a middle manager. Both in hospitality. In 2005 I was paid £2/hr over minimum wage doing clerical work on mixed shifts (day and night). The company sold out to overseas investors who asset stripped the company and promptly sold to another overseas investor. During the period 2005 to 2010 we never received any pay increases. We were told that this was because we would be moving to performance related pay. This was a lie. By 2010 we were at minimum wage. When we raised this issue with senior management the answer came very simply; if you don’t like your working conditions or your pay there are 10 East Europeans at the door that will happily take your job and do it as well.
This is called wage compression. The big bosses had no problems rewarding themselves with millions and the owners taking millions of pounds in profits overseas. This little exercise has cost us as a couple £9000/pa.
Here is a simple fact. Economies are driven by supply and demand. Wages are driven by the supply of available labour. An endless supply of low skilled labour is going to suppress the wages of ordinary workers. These are workers that live from hand to mouth the whole of their lives and will never have any hope of ever having what previous generations have had.
Most people have no personal grievance with the people coming in from the poorer European countries. They do have a real problem with the people who are supposedly representing them. The Labour Party, unions etc who supposedly protect the working class who have now abandoned them to protect the immigrants. Are you then surprised that when UKIP recognises the very real threats faced by ordinary working people and vocalises these feelings and people support them.
Ordinary working classes feel abandoned by the very people that say they represent them. The same people that reward bankers who crippled the economy and the workers paid for it with their jobs. Were any of these bankers prosecuted for mismanagement of their businesses. Hell no, they were rewarded with huge golden parachutes.
This is the reality. The ordinary people are rebelling against the system that favours the rich and powerful elites at the expense of the working people.","Jun 29th 2016, 10:40 PM"

The bit that gets to me is that much of what you describe is only partially down to free trade and free movement connected with Europe. A much bigger factor, in my opinion, is a country overwhelmed by an ideological Tory party hell bent on stripping away workers rights, protections, the social safety net and public services.
There are plenty of countries in the EU where these inequalities are not nearly so extreme. Britain is the worst, with Ireland sadly not too far behind (though notably better).

Also there would be a huge dilemma for any Irish government as, since the creation of the border, the stance has always been that it was “temporary” and not permanent and therefore Irish border control posts (Customs) were in prefabs as building permanent structure would have only re-enforced the nature of partition.
Whatever happens the EU and the UK (and Ireland) have a responsibility to ensure that there is free movement of people, goods and services between both parts of this Island and that we do not step back into creating a border, border controls, passport controls, and a restriction on the movement of people, goods or services, or we may end up with with another generation of people who want to unite Ireland by violent means.","Jun 6th 2016, 11:38 AM"

No real logical argument for staying other than money, and how it will negatively effect everyone’s life, is what we hear. For years he UK tried to join the EEC and for years DeGaulle kept them out. The UK managed ok.
But, the EU is a hugely different animal now from what the EEC ever was. It has impacted in a hugely negative fashion on ordinary people’s live all over Europe. Unless you’re one of the elite, or of that circle, ordinary people’s lives have suffered for no other reason than the greed of the rich, be it bankers, corporations, vulture funds, or lending instutions. Our well heeled government politicians have also thrown more than a few kicks in people’s directions.
The EU has morphed into nothing else than a bankers and corporate club. Driven by a neoliberal agenda that puts profit, and the pursuit of profit, before the needs of its people. It has also become secretive and anti democratic. TTIP and the secret EU army being the main issues here. That they follow the warmongering and neoliberal interests of the USA, on both of these issues, is beyond doubt.
The interests of the people’s of Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece have not been served well in any manner by the EU, debt slavery being forced on them being the biggest issue. And now France. Where legislation has been railroaded through its parliament, without a vote, to change the labour laws in favour of big business and multi national corporations. But the French, unlike us Irish, are refusing to bend over and take it.
Border and passport controls reappearing, if there is a Brexit, pales into insignificance while there are real issues with staying in the EU facing ordinary people.
It’s time for the UK to lead the way in leaving this rich man’s club.","Jun 6th 2016, 1:05 PM"

And then it joined and it thrived. The UK’s economy enjoyed a brief post-war boost, but from the 1950s onward the economy began to decline and was on a steady downward trajectory until EU membership, after which it leveled out and remained somewhat stable from then on, aside from the early 2000 financial crisis which had an impact on every economy world wide.

Care to back that up with anything?
This poll suggests that on average 80% of the EU see EU membership as beneficial/
http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Chart/getChart/themeKy/4/groupKy/4
“Driven by a neoliberal agenda that puts profit, and the pursuit of profit, before the needs of its people.”
Again, anything to back this up or just more baseless rhetoric?
Thanks to the EU we’ve got:
- minimum paid annual leave of 28 days a year including bank holidays (Directive 2010/18/EU)
- the Working time, a maximum of a 48-hour week and minimum rest breaks each day (Directive 2003/88/EC
- minimum requirements on parental leave (Directive 2010/18/EU)
- protection discrimination based on age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief in the workplace (Directive 2000/78/EU)
- discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin (Directive 2000/43/EU)
And those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
“TTIP and the secret EU army being the main issues here.”
TTIP – something which pretty much nobody in the European Parliament (the ones who have to approve it) are happy about.
Secret EU army? Again, woudl it be terrible to ask for sources? Or don’t they exist because it’s secret?
“Where legislation has been railroaded through its parliament, without a vote, to change the labour laws in favour of big business and multi national corporations. ”
So it’s the EU’s fault that the French parliament did something (Used clause 49.3 of the French constitution, which was written in 1958 and the clause in question limited to specific areas in 2009).

“O’Leary knows nothing about public service.

Ryan sought political backing to withstand Aer Lingus’s predatory pricing and Charles Haughey obliged, with Ryanair getting a free run at Stansted Airport through a demarcation of the routes between the two airlines. Ryan also secured State subsidies in return for serving provincial airports and in 1992, rent breaks for Ryanair’s headquarters at Dublin Airport.
Another part of the Ryanair history not dwelt on by its champions is how the State-owned Aer Rianta contributed to the saving of the airline in its early days by writing off more than £1 million (€0.9 milliom) in landing charges and other fees and the renegotiating of deals at Cork and Shannon. These layers to the Ryanair story are now banished in favour of the macho O’Leary soundbites, such as “there is no principle that can’t be overturned for competitive reasons”. Likewise, it appears there are no depths to which the unprincipled O’Leary will not reach to excoriate public servants.”

Also their new rosters increased days off per year on top of traditional annual leave. Monsters all right
Wally probably best if the state didn’t right off those debts, I am sure the sole national state run airline would be cheaper and more efficient than Ryanair and employee more people.

As someone who is somewhat Eurosceptic, I don’t think of the EU, as most Eurosceptics do, as being this big, bad, bureaucratic oligarchy, but instead as a bunch of people who think they’re doing good, but often what they do have ramifications. Also, they’re really stubborn.
I thought that Britain leaving would make them wake up and go “OK, this is a problem. We’ve just lost Britain. Let’s listen to why people in the UK wanted to leave, and let’s try and improve upon ourselves.” But, no, of course not.","Aug 27th 2016, 2:01 PM"

The European Union certainly has its shortcomings, but ultimately it is what the Member States want and allow it to be. For those who want Europe to remain at peace (well, most of it anyway) it makes much more sense to reform the EU and its institutions – something that is feasible, however difficult – than to throw the whole thing out and return to the kind of fractious Europe that gave us World War II and eventually prompted some visionaries to try to create a united Europe.
The biggest problem is the wilful ignorance and blindness that every demagogue from Trump to Fartage to Le Pen exploits to fan fears and present scapegoats for real and imagined malaises.

Brexit as Psy op:
1. Boris johnson as controlled opposition : “Look, I’m actually rather pro-European, actually. I certainly want a European community where one can go and scoff croissants, drink delicious coffee, learn foreign languages and generally make love to foreign women.’
January 1997
‘We can’t leave Europe. We’re part of the European Continent. What is the English Channel? It’s a primeval river that got slightly too big … We’re always going to be a part of Europe psychologically.’
August 2015, Der Spiegel
Like Cameron, he is a Bullingdon Boy from Oxford i.e groomed for high office but compromised and easily controlled.
The Ukcolumn have called this one for the last few months… www-ukcolumn-org … rightly predicting the Cameron step down and Johnson elevation.

2: Propaganda : No real mention, by particularly the BBC, and other main stream media of larger issues behind the exit. Fundamental undemocratic processes at the heart of the EU. Bureaucracy gone mad and costing billions to run – the gravy train. Super state maneuvers in the dark i.e TTIP; the European Army; Capital having more weight than members’ democratic institutions; Warmongering and sanctions by EU states against Russia and Iran – neither of which are illegally attacking anyone and the continued aggressive attacks on Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan which have precipitated the ‘Migrant crisis’ – all the while white washed over by MSM; Meddling in the minutia of our everyday lives at the cost of spontaneity and critical thinking through over regulation, which always involves more middle men; Loss of sovereignty when your money supply is controlled and you cannot change it’s value; false flag psy ops around europe designed to demonize the entire Muslim population of the world and further warmongering aims and industry within in the Eu..

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/vincent-browne-brexit-european-union-2851248-Jun2016/,"This is a depressing and negative piece. Inchoate anger, leaving us little room for hope… The author mentions John Bruton. Here is part of JB’s recent thinking on this subject – from a post dated 25th June 2016:
“[The remaining 27 countries of the EU, and the EU institutions] need to respond decisively to the (false) claim that the EU is not democratic.
“All EU legislation has to be passed by a democratically elected European Parliament, and also by a Council of Ministers who represent the democratically elected governments of the 28 EU countries.
“The members of the European Commission must be approved by the democratically elected European Parliament.
“But there is room to further improve EU democracy.
“I would make two suggestions ,
“1) The President of the European Commission should be directly elected by the people of the EU in a two round election, at the same time as the European Parliament Elections every 5 years
“2) To create a closer link between National Parliaments and the EU, a minimum of nine national parliaments agreeing should be sufficient to require the Commission to put forward a proposal on a topic allowed by the EU Treaties . National Parliaments can already delay EU legislation, so they should be free to make positive proposals too.
“That said, the EU should avoid over promising, and should not allow itself to be blamed for all the problems people face in their daily lives.
“The EU is not an all powerful monolith that can solve the problems caused by technological change and globalisation. It is just a loose voluntary confederation of 28 countries, with no tax raising powers of its own. Nor is the EU responsible for debts mistakenly taken on by its members.
“If the losers of globalisation and technological change are to be sheltered from misfortune, it is for the 27 states, not the EU itself, that has the taxing power to redistribute money from the winners from globalisation to the losers.
“The UK has not been particularly generous in this regard. Its welfare system is modest, and its investment in productivity improvement has been poor.”
“In some respects, UK voters have just mistakenly blamed the EU for the effects of the omissions, and under performance, of successive UK governments”.
So, people, let’s get stuck in. Let’s take some responsibility. Let’s remember that we do have representatives – direct or indirect – in all these institutions which the author is labelling ‘undemocratic’. Call or e-mail your TD. Find out what your MEP has been doing for you. We are not helpless. if you don’t like what you are hearing, don’t vote them back in next time…
We are no longer in the Athens of 5th Century BC where every [male] adult citizen had an equal say in all state affairs. We now use a variety of methods to delegate our authority to representatives (TDs, MPs, MEPs etc.). And we give these different flavours of ‘democracy’ [rule by the people] the general label ‘representative democracy’. So the label ‘undemocratic’ has little meaning unless when know what standard it is being measured against. We have representatives. Let us use them – or let us come up with specific proposals re how our representation can be improved.
Similarly the word ‘elite’ – what does it actually mean? Its etymology suggests ‘chosen ones’, so – a group apart. But we need to remember that if our politicians are “an elite” it is WE who have chosen them. We have made them into an ‘elite’ And we can un-choose them again. Feel the power!
We need to be careful of using words like ‘undemocratic’ and ‘elites’ – they give us the illusion that we are describing our problem, but in fact they feed into a false narrative that we are helpless. This piece I am commenting on gives the impression that the EU and everyone connected with it is a vast conspiracy – which can never be unravelled – and of which we are the victims.
Let us open our minds, look at our own experience and see what we can actually do. If the author has more positive proposals – as he hinted at in the last paragraph – let him bring them forth… Enough hand-wringing and doom-and-gloom already.","Jun 29th 2016, 3:15 PM"

The originating argument made in the High Court was that the Irish Government, in its negotiations over the Lisbon Treaty, had handed over the responsibility for protecting Fundamental Rights that the Irish People were particularly concerned about losing to a collection of 27 member states of the EU by way of a Foreign Policy Treaty (the “Guarantees” Decision).
It was contended that this was an alienation of duty by the State and was impermissible under Constitutional Law unless it had been directly approved by a majority of the People. If the Courts agreed with this proposition then the second Lisbon referendum should be declared null and void as the 28th Amendment Bill had not asked the people to approve the “Lisbon Guarantees”. The High Court refused leave for Judicial Review; this refusal was the basis for the appeal in the Supreme Court.
In the six years that passed while Mr Rea waited for a hearing, the “Guarantees” Decision on the concerns of the Irish People on the Treaty of Lisbon was converted into a Protocol.
Europe told the Irish People that by so doing the “Guarantees” became “justiciable” or capable of being decided on legal principles in the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
This in effect condensed the original argument down to one vital question. If the ECJ was the court to decide on issues that might arise between EU Law and Irish Fundamental Rights protected by the Constitution of Ireland but “Guaranteed” by the Protocol, then the ECJ would, in the process, be interpreting the Irish Constitution. This would mean that the power and duty of the Supreme Court to interpret the articles of the Constitution protected by the Protocol had been ceded from the Supreme Court to the ECJ.
The Supreme Court was faced with a choice between two possibilities, either the second Lisbon Referendum had bought about an alienation of Sovereignty that had not been directly approved by the People and therefore must be struck down, as was Mr Rea’s contention, or the Court’s power and duty was undisturbed and must be respected by the European Union and ECJ.
The Supreme Court decided to assert its own authority, and declared in its Judgement delivered on 9th May 2016:
“The Court is satisfied that it is for the Supreme Court of Ireland to interpret the Constitution of Ireland.
The Court understands that the power and duty of the Supreme Court of Ireland to interpret the Constitution of Ireland would be respected by institutions of the European Union, including the European Court of Justice”.
This simple declaration is in fact a great victory for the Sovereignty of the Irish People and the Constitution that they own. During the course of the appeal hearing on April 5th the Court had tried for an hour to get the barrister representing Ireland (The State) and the Attorney General to say these words and assert Irish sovereignty but instead he argued that the interpretation of the Irish Constitution was now in the control of the ECJ. The Supreme Court’s decision has unequivocally corrected the State’s erroneous opinion and position.
This declaration has a deep and far reaching effect. It goes beyond the ECJ into every EU institution.
This whole issue was sparked off in the first place by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union being given legal effect by the Treaty of Lisbon when, in effect, it would actually have unquestionably weakened our existing Fundamental Rights already established under the Irish Constitution. Other people and Governments across Europe rightly feared that legislation and rulings under the Charter would supersede and interfere with national and constitutional fundamental rights. Britain, Poland and Ireland all obtained Protocols to Lisbon in an attempt to protect their own laws but this Supreme Court decision has ensured that the Irish People will remain in control of their own destiny as a Sovereign People in a Nation among Nations.
The fears of the European nations were confirmed in the Melloni and Ministro Fiscal Case decision by the ECJ. The European Commission revealed its ‘supremacy agenda’ in its report on this case. It had been decided by the European Court of Justice that the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights supersedes national constitutions as does all other EU law. Constitutional rights at national level must therefore be ignored if they should clash with the European Courts interpretation of the same rights. A member State cannot rely on a provision in its national constitution that purports to provide a higher level of protection of a fundamental right than in the Charter as a reason for not applying a clear provision in an EU law. This is stated in the commission’s annual report for 2013.
Prior to the referendum in 2009, the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Martin had advised the nation through a letter to a citizen who had expressed concern as follows:
“I note your concern that Ireland will lose our control over right to life and family law issues, but these areas remain in the competence of the Member States and thus it is clear that nothing in EU law can or will affect the protection of the unborn and the family in the Irish Constitution. This is reaffirmed in the legal guarantee on the right to life, family and education which the Government secured at the European Council in June 2009”.
This Judgement by the Supreme Court could not have been timelier. The European Commission is one of the institutions of the European Union referred to by the Supreme Court. In 2013 it produced a Report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. A search through the report will reveal that the Commission has been very busy developing areas of the Charter, with a view to introducing legislation in many instances.
A search of the headings shows that many of the topics discussed, if enacted, would directly affect the freedoms of Irish people which were specifically mentioned in the Irish Protocol on the “Guarantees” to the Lisbon Treaty; Religion, Right to Life, Education, and the Family.
At this point the Irish “Guarantees” had to be honoured to arrest the activities of a delinquent European Commission. These activities are clearly well outside the stated competences of the European Union. The failure of the European Commission to have obtained preliminary advice in a full public hearing before the Irish People’s Supreme Court confirms the invalidity of their actions when they should have been properly informed by the Irish Court that they had in fact committed themselves to not getting involved in matters relating to Religion, Right to Life, Education, and the Family.
The report mentions that the Commission sent recommendations to the European Parliament on Matrimonial Property Regimes. The European Parliament in turn produced its own resolutions on this matter.
Matrimonial property, in particular the Family Home, has been the subject of several Supreme Court of Ireland judgements in the not too distant past. Attempts by the Oireachtas to introduce legislation regulating the ownership of the Family Home have been firmly struck down by the Court where it has reaffirmed that it is beyond the power of the State to interfere in the private affairs of the institution of the Family founded on Marriage.
This is how our Constitution protects the Family. The Constitution confers powers to the Government, but these are limited to protecting the Family unit and its members and the Government cannot involve itself in the private affairs of the Family founded on Marriage.
The People are free in their Families; the State is controlled by the People and is strictly limited to the powers that the People have decided to give it. The State’s actions in the Lisbon Treaty if it had gone unchecked would have circumvented the Irish people’s authority over the State.
The European Commission and the European Parliament are a long way down the road to producing legislation on the issue of Matrimonial Property Regimes and other matters connected to Family affairs. Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty with Ireland they have to comply with the Irish Protocol. This means that from the very first day of developing policy on the Charter of Fundamental Rights they had to check every item on the agenda against that Protocol and build it into every report that could impact in any way on the Irish Rights they have “Guaranteed” to protect.
To have knowledge of what the Articles of the Irish Constitution mean and how the policy areas they were developing might impact on the protected rights, every matter would have to be referred to the Supreme Court of Ireland for its views. Plainly this has never happened; there is no process to do so. The only proper proposition for a route would have been to ask the President of Ireland to refer matters to the Irish Supreme Court.
An examination of the European Commission report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Parliament reports and resolutions reveals that the Irish Protocol – the “Guarantees” has never been mentioned anywhere.
This is plain evidence that the institutions involved have indeed broken the Treaty of Lisbon with Ireland. This boils down to one simple fact; if the Irish “Guarantees” are not taken into account and respected by the EU and by each and every one of its Institutions then there can be no Treaty of Lisbon. No “Guarantees” – no Treaty of Lisbon.
Further to this, the European Court of Justice, as an institution of the EU itself, cannot now remedy the situation; it cannot be a judge in its own cause as any ruling it would make would directly affect that court and would be impermissible as it would contravene the fundamental principles of Justice.
In fact, when the nations of Europe signed and ratified the Irish Protocol on the “Irish Guarantees” they had no knowledge of what they were committing to because they had not asked the only body that had the power to explain it to them – the Supreme Court of Ireland.
The decision of the Irish Supreme Court has now put an end to that confusion and raised the drawbridge against all foreign interference with our Nation and our Peoples Sovereignty.
Today the Irish people can stand tall; despite the failure of our State to honour the “Guarantees” that they promoted to secure their second “Yes” vote in the Lisbon Treaty we are in a position to once again declare and assert the unique Sovereignty of the Irish People to the world.
The Applicant intends to continue to raise matters on the betrayal of the Irish People by the Irish representatives with the European Institutions concerned.","Aug 3rd 2016, 9:24 PM"

Not much in the media about Merkels’ attempt to silence Facebook, “She had mark Zuckerberg lunch” recently and told him to keep the refugee crisis and anti refugee posts to a minimum. Merkel and Zuckerberg were caught with the microphone accidentally left on.
.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was overheard confronting Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over incendiary posts on the social network, Bloomberg reported on Sunday, amid complaints from her government about anti-immigrant posts in the midst of Europe’s refugee crisis.
On the sidelines of a United Nations luncheon on Saturday, Merkel was caught on a hot mic pressing Zuckerberg about social media posts about the wave of Syrian refugees entering Germany, the publication reported.
The Facebook CEO was overheard responding that “we need to do some work” on curtailing anti-immigrant posts about the refugee crisis. “Are you working on this?” Merkel asked in English, to which Zuckerberg replied in the affirmative before the transmission was disrupted.

But in the future we be living in Europe and people will say go to Ireland for tec jobs, UK for banking, each sate will depending on were it is will be known for this kinda of employment/trade like the way different sates in the US are known for different employment other parts will just die up be returned to nature, like, our small rural villages and others in the EU.
In time time there will be blanket EU law, were every thing will be regulated and kept the same, look the same, where English we become the common language, where there be one over all president (ruler) then each sate have it own manager, who will work on behalf of the over all ruler.
This is why Germany & other EU countries is allowing so many refugees in, Is to build bonds with the middle east when we need their resources they will have some thing to bargain with, then when those countries need other revenues there will be some deal done were they will join the EU or some trade and travel deal will be made.
This is why TTIP is been formed we be then link with the US, which for the ordinary folk in bad way, but gives great opportunity for the rich to buy up cheap & sell back to us at huge mark up. In the US there is huge new money with nothing to do but with the EU, and trade deals to be in Africa they can change every thing, and help the EU leaders (rulers) who want full power of all of Europe achieve this.
This could bring greatness to people all over the world, but they wont choose this path it be the one with threats, wars, crime, poverty and greed. Where we will all just be slaves to there ways with no way out.
We should not be asking the UK to stay or leave, With their power they and we should be asking for change we forget that we own a share in our world yet doing nothing to make a change to better our life’s, If we got our facts right with the UK we could work for better all.

I also believe that every human being has the Right to make the best of their lives so long as it doesn’t negatively on another’s life.
It seems to me that people like Farage, and he is a very charismatc man. And a very powerful public speaker. Is that he speaks truth to power for a huge swath of poor people.Those people who are and have been marginalised by the elites. The fact is that most immigrants are not taking those jobs done by the middle classes. The jobs they are taking are menial jobs usually done by the poor, the poorly educated and the lower working classes. And on top of that you have someone like IDS treating these people like vermin.

Exactly. The EU died for Ireland in 2010. And last year when the ECB used it’s control of the money supply to force Greece to capitulate to EU demands by deliberately shutting down their banks and causing a bank run it showed it’s true extremely ugly face to the world. In the all night EU summit of shame a senior EU official described Tsipras as being subjected behind closed door meetings to “extensive mental waterboarding” and where two officials who observed Tsipras independently described him as a “beaten dog”. That is what the EU is now and I don’t believe it can be changed from the inside.
It needs to be torn down and I hope the Brits vote to leave but unfortunately I don’t believe they will. Obama will be over shortly to tell them how to vote with plenty of flattery and scaremongering to convince the undecided to go for the safest option. It’s a pity as they have nothing to lose really because they are not in the Euro prison but the longer they stay in the more sovereignty they will lose. As someone above said “The EU is a conspiracy of 28 governments whose purpose is to avoid giving their voters what they promised when elected.” It’s a way for elites to throw their hands up and say we can’t do anything because of the EU while they continue to do what their real job is which is manage the decline.

Aaron, once more I find myself in some agreement with what you say, unlike you, I shall have a vote in June and, while not inclined to vote in foreign elections, I shall except myself for this one.
The reason I have drawn from what you say is, the original ‘free trade area’ the EEC, was a brilliant idea, I can recall, at the time of the last UK referendum, when IRA or UVF were the normal motif upon walls where I lived there appeared on a gable wall ‘EEC NO’, intrigued, as we passed it several times per week heading south I asked my mother just what it meant, she explained the whole idea of free trade, a concept I was supportive of, having been regularly detained by Irish and UK customs between both jurisdictions in Ireland.
The real problem with free trade was contained, but unexplained then, in the Treaty of Rome, ‘ever closer union’ is the driver for the federalist agenda and, despite dreadfully different peoples across a continent with multiplicity of languages and cultures the drive is to unite us all under an idea of european to keep these idealists happy, there’s as much hope of uniting such persons as there is of landing on 01KOI 736 01 within the next decade, but telling these federalist dreamers that time travel is impossible is equally impossible.
Without doubt, they are already making plans to spin the potential exit of Britain from their beloved ‘union’ to ensure others, including some of it’s founders do not go the same way too.
Another matter, unreported, is, they do indeed live in a bubble, as you point out but, it is a very comfortable bubble, paid for by you and I through VAT payments (if the Brit’s go so will VAT for them, ’til replaced by some GST) but, upon their excellent Brussels incomes they pay, only, 16% income tax, now, I know I, even in those heady day’s of blossoming economy and low tax here paid substantially more, ad do even more substantially now.
The lies of it being bad for Ireland can be easily rebutted, why, yes there would be a return to ‘border’ checks but, is that such a bad thing, particularly from a security perspective, free movement of persons has recently been shown to have nasty consequences for Paris and Brussels, Irish citizens, and I should qualify this with, indigenous Irish citizens, will retain their Constitutional and CTA right to go wherever they wish in our country without identity card, it’s only others who will have to prove their identitys, trade will continue, as it has since the twenties ’til, soon thereafter, the UK is ushered into the FTA on better grounds than Norway or Switzerland, border checks will remain then but, again, security is better than being blown up or the import of unwanted nationals.
I shall be voting to leave the EU in June, as I’ve stated before, I should prefer to live in a United Kingdom than in a United States of Europe, I can only hope my fellow Irish citizens follow their main trading partner.
One final note, the best reason to vote ‘leave’, Romanians!","Apr 16th 2016, 10:04 AM"

We can already see the effects of sterling on our exports to the UK with the mushroom industry already wiped out.

Under WTO country of origin rules this could not continue. £1.5 billion of milk crosses border a year. 70% of Tesco chickens are Irish. Brazil the worlds largest producer of chickens is already negotiating with the WTO to enable it to move in there.

Talking up the growth in jobs, and ignoring the unemployment and underemployment. Growth in jobs comes from numerous factors, not least plain old population increases and working age demographic changes.
Adding back in those on Job Activation schemes brings the ‘official’ figure of unemployed back over 10%.
From his own figures, 100,000 workers – 5% of the workforce, or 1 in 20 – are part time but seeking full time work.
If we add them back in, plus those seeking work but not eligible to claim due to spousal income (what family can afford to live on one wage these days?), a truer figure for the shortage of jobs – because that’s what it is – is likely at least 15%, possibly even 20%, or 1 in 5.
Which is broadly similar to the Eurozone as a whole, and for the reason that the Euro currency system is a Neoliberal fraud by design, and still destined to fail unless it undergoes very serious reforms. Courtesy, naturally, of Mr Duggan and friends’ incompetence or vested interest fraud.
Yet all this is seemingly of no interest to Mr Duggan, who’s only purpose in his myopic posting is to support the ‘everything’s fine’ propaganda of his friends among the wealthy and privileged ruling elites.
What I think about Mr Duggan and his intellectually fraudulent, or simply incompetent, mainstream economist friends is not printable.

In other words, Kenny & Co should realise that while the majority in NI voted “remain” in the EU, a majority also wishes to remain in the UK, and that if it comes to a conflict between the two, the latter will prevail – even if it means economic hardship for the people of NI.
Kenny now needs to reboot and abandon the United Ireland grandstanding and meet Foster without a pre-determined agenda.

One British job was lost for every four non-EU workers arriving here between 2005 and 2010.
The study by the GOVERNMENT’S MIGRATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE revealed that the total number of foreigners working in the UK has soared by 2.1million in the past 15 years.
The startling findings come with 2.6 million Britons now jobless and youth unemployment crashing through the one million barrier.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brendan-cox-killing-jo-cox-2838320-Jun2016/,"Capitalism is a system which is based on the exploitation of the majority working class in order to enrich the minority capitalist class. This model results in a chasm of inequality with abject poverty on one side and obscene wealth on the other. Our politics, media and education systems are designed to obscure this harsh reality while our governments fully support this exploitative socioeconomic system.
This results in large numbers of people living in varying degrees of poverty and misery and not understanding fully why that is the case. This gap in understanding is what the right wing populists (e.g. UKIP and Trump) and quasi fascists (e.g. Britain First) exploit to drag themselves to power. They too lie to the working class and blame easy scapegoats like immigrants or Muslims for the poverty in which the majority working class finds itself. This is the road to oppression, violence and war.
We have the resources to provide everyone with a decent home, healthcare, education and a job. It is an ideological choice not to do so. The options facing humanity are socialism or barbarism.
P.S The evidence clearly shows that the E.U. is pro capital and anti working class to its very DNA and the British people should vote to leave on a socialist basis.","Jun 22nd 2016, 9:04 AM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/cameron-corbyn-labour-2852545-Jun2016/,"Cameron has some nerve lecturing about the ‘national interest’ when it’s he and the Tories who have brought the country into crisis. His odious attack on Corbyn is only to deflect from what an utter failure his premiership has been. The last thing Corbyn should do is take career advice from a man who has destroyed his political career through deception and incompetence.
Corbyn deserves to stay, the conduct of the Labour MPs who have stabbed him in the back should not be rewarded. They have displayed utter contempt not just for the party but for many of its members who elected Corbyn with the strongest mandate of any Labour leader ever. With the Tories in disarray this was the moment for Labour to take the offensive and for the party to unite behind Corbyn. The fact they’ve chosen to undermine his leadership without having any strategy for an alternative with effective leadership shows they’re more like the leading Brexit proponents than they’d care to admit.
Instead of New Labour members coming to terms with the fact they’re despised by much of the British public as evidenced by their electoral defeats in 2010, 2014 and 2015 and there’s no appetite for a return to a party led by neoliberals who are heavily influenced by the politics of Tony Blair, they instead decided to sabotage the party in an act of pure infantile vindictiveness. The Chilcot report is due to be released in the coming weeks, and many of the MPs involved in the attempt at ousting Corbyn voted to invade Iraq, the pretext was the EU referendum but this is the key event motivating the sabotage of Corbyn’s leadership. They do not want someone like Corbyn leading the party when that report is released because Corbyn will likely characterise Blair as a war criminal, may call for an investigation into war crimes and will probably apologise on behalf of the Labour party for their role in the illegal war.
Corbyn can build a party that can lead the country, but it’s near impossible when it’s plagued by MPs constantly undermining your leadership and plotting your demise. The fact Corbyn has resisted this despite all that, and maintained the support of many people across Britain is a testament to his resilience and his passion to fight for the people.","Jun 29th 2016, 3:00 PM"

Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of remoulding Labour have been boosted by a detailed Guardian survey into the party at grassroots level that shows overwhelming support for him, a decisive shift to the left and unhappiness with squabbling among MPs.
Reflecting increased interest among the young, university cities and towns recorded some of the biggest rises, with Bath jumping from 300 to 1,322 members (911 full members, 120 affiliated supporters and 291 registered supporters) and Colchester from 200-250 to almost 1,000. Neither are traditional Labour seats.
The survey findings are borne out by Labour’s national figures, released to the Guardian in a break with party tradition of keeping them secret. Membership jumped from 201,293 on 6 May last year, the day before the general election, to 388,407 on 10 January.

Everybody and their dog now recognises that the EU, and its Euro project, are in serious trouble in virtually every country in Europe.
Not least for its utter lack of, and contempt for, democracy. And people -especially ordinary citizens – have had enough of the intellectually fraudulent, neoliberal Austerity junk economics, which they see simply enriches the already rich, and at their expense. (Albeit some also swallow the UKIP line that its ‘immigrants’ to blame for ‘stealing jobs’, conveniently ignoring that its pretty much a zero sum swap among EU countries…) Corbyn knows this, and has fought against this EU neoliberal agenda.
So, with any honesty or integrity, Corbyn could not say the EU was wonderful…. but his position was that UK, tactically, was better off trying to reform it from inside than trying to do that from outside, having also suffered at least some short term economic damage from a bruising exit.
Perfectly reasonable position.. and one that might have won the day, had not the sheer arrogance of the entire US, UK and Euro establishment simply insulted the intelligence of the electorate by trying to tell them all was EU wonderful, Austerity was necessary and working, and they were all stupid.
Key mainstream media, Sun, Express, Mail, Sky etc., all still smearing Corbyn, well, just for being Corbyn, hammered for exit with the most fearmongering drivel they could muster, notably on the purely emotive nonsense of immigration… (We know propaganda works, why do we continue to accept such concentrated narrow control and ownership of media, whilst there are perfectly good alternatives????)
In the face of that onslaught, Corbyn’s honest position, for a more nuanced tactical approach to EU’s obvious failures, failed to win enough votes by a few percent.

Every country then outside of Britain within tje EU then send their freight to Ireland and we turn it around and send it on. At 12.5 percent we glean from the member states.

Corbyn, by numerous polls, has only increased his support from the Labour members and general electorate both, since his landslide victory winning the leadership. Yet Benn and his red Tory (war criminal) Blair chums believe they should run the Labour party?

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-how-it-happened-2842953-Jun2016/,"Perhaps now is the time to redraw the Border with Northern Ireland. The Brexit result shows that the parts of Northern Ireland that want to leave the EU approximate (and by implication to remain with Britain) to the Unionist majority areas and the parts that want to remain in the EU approximate to the Nationalist majority areas (which by implication want to join the Republic of Ireland). It is the Border that the Boundary Commission should have determined upon in 1925. The paradox is that the British would be only too happy to have Northern Ireland exit the UK. In effect the Unionists are up the creek without a paddle. The worst of all worlds. The Nationalists need only bide their time. The biggest obstacle to a Unified Ireland will be the reluctance of the Southern Ireland Government to take in the millstone financially that is Northern Ireland. Perhaps a federal state can emerge with Provincial Devolved Governments in Ulster, Connacht, Munster and Leinster with the State Parliament in Dublin. The Queen must be mortified at the outcome of this referendum. Her only truly loyal subjects are the Unionists of Northern Ireland. She can only parrot what her government instructs her to say.

- Co-operate and converge economic policy, legislation, and regulation across a number of areas;
- Set in motion steps towards visa-free movement of people between Ukraine and EU;

When yer man got shot last week there was hardly a peep out of politicians on all sides and certainly no response like when the ex-Provo got shot last year. It just goes to show how one sided a view Unionists and their fellow travellers in FG see NI politics.
The fact is that when the Provos stood down there were a few that continued on a criminal path but they would have done that anyway whether they had a cause to hide behind or not. While the border is in place there will always be smuggling. If there was a United Ireland in the morning then the need for any type of a paramilitary organisation on the Republican side would cease which would leave anyone pursuing a criminal career out in the cold.
the same can not be said for Loyalists in the UDA/UVF/UFF seeing as they have no cause per se seeing as they have “their” security forces to fight their corner. It is recognised by academics and indeed the British Army that the Provos in their day were “a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force”, while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups are described as “little more than a collection of gangsters”. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6276416.stm

It is the logical extension of Brexit and you surely cannot have one rule for one part of the EU when it comes to free movement and another for God other 26 member states !
The economic and social fallout of Brexit for both north and south plus the cross state trade with the rest of the U.K., needs to be handled very sensitively and wisely if both parts of the current EU are not to be disadvantaged . Surely the CTA can continue in place of the free movement of persons at least but have border customs posts from those non-Irish and Non-British travellers and the goods and services of anyone who wishes to cross the border .

“Soros’s agenda is fundamentally about the destruction of national borders. This has recently been shown very clearly with his funding of the European refugee crisis.
The refugee crisis has been blamed on the civil war currently raging in Syria. But did you ever wonder how all these people suddenly knew Europe would open its gates and let them in?
The refugee crisis is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. It coincided with OSF donating money to the US-based Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants, both Soros-sponsored organizations. Both groups advocate the resettlement of third-world Muslims into Europe.
In 2015, a Sky News reporter found “Migrant Handbooks” on the Greek island of Lesbos. It was later revealed that the handbooks, which are written in Arabic, had been given to refugees before crossing the Mediterranean by a group called “Welcome to the EU.”
Welcome to the EU is funded by—you guessed it—the Open Society Foundations.
Soros has not only backed groups that advocate the resettlement of third-world migrants into Europe, he in fact is the architect of the “Merkel Plan.”
The Merkel Plan was created by the European Stability Initiative whose chairman Gerald Knaus is a senior fellow at none other than the Open Society Foundations.
The plan proposes that Germany should grant asylum to 500,000 Syrian refugees. It also states that Germany, along with other European nations, should agree to help Turkey, a country that’s 98% Muslim, gain visa-free travel within the EU starting in 2016.”

The 2015 figure for net migration was the highest ever (333,000) but not because many more people migrated to the UK. The high net figure was due to emigration from the UK being unusually low.
The leave side are mixing up the rules over EU and non-EU migration. They are governed differently and the UK already has more “control” over non-EU migration.
The leave side were asked what they would do about the skills shortage in the NHS, services etc. if they block migration from the EU and they said they would go to Asia, China etc for people. So the reality is that Brexit will not lead to less migration but will lead to increases of non-EU migration.

Which is ironic because the EU pumps a lot of money into Northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland while Westminster looks after London, more or less.
Both sides are dishonest (Farage’s poster hardly highlights EU migration) but you can’t call people who have concerns about migration (either legitimate or farcical) bigots without actually talking to them.
There also seems to be confusion over controlling immigration and no immigration with some believing that having controls means no immigrants while others see having an open system as “everyone can come”.

John Perkins, Former Advisor IMF.
“My job was to identify countries with resources that corporations covert, like oil and then arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or from one of its sister organisations. The money however would not go to the country, it would go to our own corporations who would make huge profits, but the majority of the people would suffer terrible as a result, because money would be diverted from Education, Healthcare and other Social Services to pay interest on the debt.”
What happened when the IMF moved in and the debt couldn’t be repaid?
“We go back into that country and say, since you can’t pay your debt, sell your resource oil or whatever real cheap to our corporations without any environmental restrictions or, or social regulations. Privatise, sell your electric utilities, your water, sewage systems, your schools, your jails, all your public sector businesses to our corporations, and in the few cases where we failed economic hitman, the jackals went in and still do and aah, they either assassinate the leaders of the country or overthrow them in coups.”
Greece has got 84 billion in loans over 3 years BEFORE THE LAST SET OF LOANS and Greece in return has to put 50 billion worth of assets into a segregated account that will later be sold off to the global community and when they are sold off by the Troika to banks and to hedge funds. It is estimated that it will make the Troika under 200 billion minus the 84 billion.
These assets will collateralise the loan but is a LEVERAGE BUYOUT by the global community, banks and Hedge funders.
Yet banks and the E.U. knew everything before loaning the money to these countries especially Greece, Many who were in Goldman Sachs are employed in the E.U. civil service like Dragi and it was Goldman Sachs who cooked the books for Greece joining the E.U. in the first place.
Yet only the Troika are the only ones who can sell Greece’s Income Producing Assets and make a profit from them to the Hedge Fund Community.
In 2010 Merkel protected the European banks and Hedge Funds from Billions in losses by putting the debt onto European tax payers. So PRIVATE DEBT from the loans made to countries like Greece were made knowing that they were bad loans. Yet Merkel knew in 2010 what was going to happen.
Then Merkel stepped in as the saviour of the E.U. and transferred all the bad debt from the banks and put it onto the European tax payer by making private debt sovereign debt issue then and therefore a problem of the whole E.U. falling apart.
Austerity was brought in for this, to look after the financial system using politics to cause LEVERAGE BUYOUT SENARIOS. Remember at the beginning of the Euro that the ECB made countries borrow Euros cheaply at low interest rates to banks that caused a boom and a rise in the value of the Euro and yet the ECB knew the financial make up of every country in the Eurozone in tax intake and debt.
Yet these same people knew that AUSTERITY causes debt to rise, to cause job losses and therefore countries to borrow more as jobs create taxes, imports and less borrowing on the international markets but the Troika forced Austerity as it looks now to create LEVERAGE BUYOUT SCENARIOS.
The TROIKA played us, they fed us, they pretended to look after us and when they are ready they will slaughter us like a butcher and that is what the E.U. is.
After Greece then who else as there is Italy, Portugal, Spain and us before they start on Eastern Europe? We have been fattened like farmyard PIGS for Farmer Merkel and friends.
What is left will be used to make TTIP soup with and the only thing that won’t be used is our squeal as no one is listening. Don’t forget the TiSA Agreement either?

It would have been far worse for the Tories had Britain voted, by a slight margin, to remain in the European Union; this would have meant a surge in support and seats in parliament for the United Kingdom Independence Party (in much the same way as the fall-out from the defeated Scottish Independence referendum in 2014 resulted in a sustained surge in support for the Scottish National Party) on the part of disaffected Conservative Party and Labour Party voters who voted leave in the referendum and were turned-off by the behaviour of their former parties. The result of this would have been continued debates within the Conservative Party over the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union and, undoubtedly, attempts by the many Conservative eurosceptics to build support for another referendum on EU membership down the road (similar to what has been happening in Scotland by proponents of Scottish independence ever since the independence referendum was defeated there in 2014).
It is actually a blessed time for whoever is going to be the next Conservative Party leader (and the leader after that), because after Britain completes its departure from the institutions of the European Union (it will never actually be leaving “Europe”, as Britain has always been part of it) in a few years time, there will be no more issue of the European Union dividing the Conservative Party and the Tories would be more united as a result. The United Kingdom Independence Party (which up until now has been an electoral threat to the Conservatives in key marginal constituencies) – with its raison d’être having been achieved when the UK completes its exit from the EU – will be redundant.","Jun 28th 2016, 6:11 PM"

A c.17%+ jump is extremely statistically significant and would imply a once off event to cause it, if it turns out that this isn’t part of an annual trend. I don’t think either alternative theory presented are any more plausible than the “election” theory however and if anything are less plausible as neither is a unique event and would have data backing up the assertion that this doesn’t happen because of tourism and foreign direct investment if it never occurred before.","May 15th 2016, 8:00 PM"

Remember it was the ECB that got banks to take all this cheap Euro debt in order to increate the international value of the Euro, then went after them when thing went wrong making private debt into tax payers debt then?
John Perkins, Former Advisor IMF.
“My job was to identify countries with resources that corporations covert, like oil and then arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or from one of its sister organisations. The money however would not go to the country, it would go to our own corporations who would make huge profits, but the majority of the people would suffer terrible as a result, because money would be diverted from Education, Healthcare and other Social Services to pay interest on the debt.”
What happened when the IMF moved in and the debt couldn’t be repaid?
“We go back into that country and say, since you can’t pay your debt, sell your resource oil or whatever real cheap to our corporations without any environmental restrictions or, or social regulations. Privatise, sell your electric utilities, your water, sewage systems, your schools, your jails, all your public sector businesses to our corporations, and in the few cases where we failed economic hitman, the jackals went in and still do and aah, they either assassinate the leaders of the country or overthrow them in coups.”","Jun 12th 2016, 1:53 PM"

It is estimated that it will make the Troika under 200 billion minus the 84 billion.
These assets will collateralise the loan but is a LEVERAGE BUYOUT by the global community, banks and Hedge funders.
Yet banks and the E.U. knew everything before loaning the money to these countries especially Greece, Many who were in Goldman Sachs are employed in the E.U. civil service like Dragi and it was Goldman Sachs who cooked the books for Greece joining the E.U. in the first place.
Yet only the Troika are the only ones who can sell Greece’s Income Producing Assets and make a profit from them to the Hedge Fund Community.
In 2010 Merkel protected the European banks and Hedge Funds from Billions in losses by putting the debt onto European tax payers. So PRIVATE DEBT from the loans made to countries like Greece were made knowing that they were bad loans. Yet Merkel knew in 2010 what was going to happen.
Then Merkel stepped in as the saviour of the E.U. and transferred all the bad debt from the banks and put it onto the European tax payer by making private debt sovereign debt issue then and therefore a problem of the whole E.U. falling apart.
Austerity was brought in for this, to look after the financial system using politics to cause LEVERAGE BUYOUT SENARIOS. Remember at the beginning of the Euro that the ECB made countries borrow Euros cheaply at low interest rates to banks that caused a boom and a rise in the value of the Euro and yet the ECB knew the financial make up of every country in the Eurozone in tax intake and debt.
Yet these same people knew that AUSTERITY causes debt to rise, to cause job losses and therefore countries to borrow more as jobs create taxes, imports and less borrowing on the international markets but the Troika forced Austerity as it looks now to create LEVERAGE BUYOUT SCENARIOS.
The TROIKA played us, they fed us, they pretended to look after us and when they are ready they will slaughter us like a butcher and that is what the E.U. is.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ukip-row-plenary-session-2850326-Jun2016/,"The Brexit is a working class revolt against the neoliberal E.U and the domestic British capitalist class.
Hannah Sell, Socialist Party deputy general secretary:
“The referendum result may well go down in history as the pitchfork moment”, declared the Financial Times (FT), wailing the anger and despair of Britain’s elite at the decision by the majority of voters in Britain to leave the European Union.
For the capitalist class in Britain and across the EU as a whole, this is a major blow described by the FT as “the biggest setback in the EU’s history”.
For British capitalism in particular it is a terrible defeat. It could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom if there is another vote for independence in Scotland, and also lead to the collapse of the Tory Party, once among the most successful capitalist parties on the planet.
It is also possible that the Labour Party could split in the aftermath of 23 June as the pro-business right plot to remove Jeremy Corbyn. Politics has been thrown into turmoil.
Many of the seventeen million people who voted for exit, however, will have woken up with a sense of elation that they had been able to express their rage at everything they have suffered as a result of big business making theworking class pay for the economic crisis in recent years: low pay, zero hour contracts, benefit cuts, the lack of affordable housing, and public services cut to the bone.
What is more, by doing so they have forced Cameron – the hated prime minister – to announce his resignation.
Not only in Britain but across Europe many workershave been inspired by this vote against the bosses’ EU. There is no doubt that many workers in Greece, whose living standards have been devastated at the hands of the institutions of the EU, will have been cheering at the result of the referendum…………………………………………….
During the referendum ‘project fear’ reached gigantic proportions. Economic catastrophe, third world war and the fear of an increase in racism and intolerance were all used to try and browbeat voters into supporting ‘Remain’. Legitimate fears around these issues were major factors in why 48% of people did decide to vote for Remain. In particular it appears that a majority of young people voted Remain partly because of fears that racism would grow if there was a vote for exit.
Nonetheless, it is incredible the number of people who voted for ‘Leave’ and used the referendum as an opportunity to oppose the undemocratic, remote EU and to protest; ignoring threats from the leaders of all of Britain’s establishment parties, plus every world leader from Obama to Merkel.
Incredibly cynically, even the terrible murder of Labour MP and Remain campaigner Jo Cox was used to try and increase the vote for Remain.
Without doubt the dangerous atmosphere whipped up by right-wing politicians during the referendum debate has increased the danger of racist and far-right attacks. But it was not only the racism of the official Leave side, but also the constant attacks on migrants by Cameron, with the Labour right wing even demanding that he went further in the final days of the campaign! Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, it would have been equally necessary for the workers’ movement to stand clearly for unity, against racism and in defence of the rights of migrant workers in Britain.
At the same time, it is completely false to suggest that the exit vote had – in the main – a right wing or racist character. Of course, some of those who voted for exit will have done so for racist or nationalist reasons, but the fundamental character of the exit vote was it was a working class revolt.

So did Spain etc. The U.K. is now doing relatively well economically although it suffers from low worker income growth and income inequality but these are domestic policies and not EU ones. I suppose the fact that the UK has grown so significantly post its EU membership has nothing to do with the EU? But all its woes prior to joining are the fault of the EU? Remarkable logic. Well done on your complete ignorance of 20th century history.","Jun 21st 2016, 12:27 PM"

“the experience in the last months should definitively answer the question as to whether any “good euro” strategy is possible – whether it is possible to implement anti-austerity measures, while sticking to the euro at all costs and not decisively challenging capitalism. It is not.
The rules of the Economic and Monetary Union and the EU itself are a neo-liberal straitjacket – designed to ensure adherence to right-wing economic policies, through the power given to the unelected ECB and through restrictions like the Stablility & Growth Targets, the Fiscal Treaty and the six-pack and two-pack. Therefore, any genuinely Left government must be prepared to pursue its demands of debt repudiation and an end to austerity to the end, even if it means being kicked out of the euro. It must prepare people generally for the need for a confrontation with the interests of capital in Europe, in order to set out to restructure the economy and society on a democratic socialist basis – organised for the interests of people, rather than for profit- maximisation.”

Brexit will be a long drawn out process which will at times turn bitter in negotiations between the EU and UK, If the EU give the UK a good deal then what is the point in being in the EU, and would lead to an EU break up, there is a huge amount at stake here. It seems no side knows what to do as a country leaving has never happened before, and those in favor of Brexit had no plan what so ever put in place, so this will be made up as it goes along over a period of years that will often be bitter and confrontational.
This is not good for us as there will be collateral damage for us as our links are deeper in every respect than any other EU country, from trade, people movement, boarders, peace process ect.

I know all the stereotypical stuff, and certainly have no time for entitlement culture stuff, but feel something must be done to break the cycle. I think we should elect a minister for traveller issues, could be elected through Senate to try to begin the discussion.

The idea of a minister for the purpose seems like a logical course of action, however I would be of the opinion that it is too wide reaching of a issue for such a singular approach, and should be something that the entire government and various departments should be looking at in cooperation, rather than passing it of to another Minister. Also the primary focus of what is an appropriate course of action for Ireland needs to be, what is going to be in the best interest of Ireland and its people. Not what is going to be in the best interest of Ireland while remaining in the EU, the alternative of leaving the EU and forming closer direct trade links with the Uk and anyone else should also be fully explored. Otherwise once the EU begins to inflict punative trade restrictions against the post brexit UK, we are likely to be viewed as the frontline intransigent face of the EU as far as the UK is concerned, in which case the primary losers will be us.","Aug 9th 2016, 11:39 AM"

It was well enough known to be mentioned in “The Marching Morons”, a 1951 short story by Cyril M. Kornbluth. In 1955, Disney Studio illustrator Carl Barks drew an Uncle Scrooge adventure comic with the title “The Lemming with the Locket”. This comic, which was inspired by a 1953 American Mercury article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs.[7][8] Even more influential was the 1958 Disney film White Wilderness, which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature, in which staged footage was shown with lemmings jumping into certain death after faked scenes of mass migration.[9] A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, Cruel Camera, found the lemmings used for White Wilderness were flown from Hudson Bay to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where they did not jump off the cliff, but were in fact forced off the cliff by the camera crew.[10][11] Because of the limited number of lemmings at their disposal, which in any case were the wrong sub-species, the migration scenes were simulated using tight camera angles and a large, snow-covered turntable.

U.K. workers can not compete with people from Eastern Europe. The average price of a house in London is half a million and in Romania one could buy the whole of Bucharest for that.
