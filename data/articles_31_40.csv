https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-meltdown-4540958-Mar2019/,"LAST NIGHT, THE House of Commons voted against a no-deal Brexit.
But the vote wasn’t straightforward as Prime Minister Theresa Maylost control over her own partyas MPs voted on a series of amendments before the main vote.
After last night’s chaos, today will see yet another vote in Westminster as parliament now votes on whether to delay Brexit until the end of June.
And, as if back from the dead, May has signalled her intentions to bring back her withdrawal agreement and put it to a vote AGAIN – after it was soundly defeated twice already.
This morning’s papers in the UK took largely similar takes on the latest Brexit debacle.
No fewer than three newspapers opted for the word meltdown in their front page headlines.
The Times of London described a “Brexit meltdown” where “May’s deal [is] back from the dead”. The paper also says May will have secret talks with the DUP and Brexiteers to secure some compromise.

The I leads simply with “meltdown”, with 13 pages of coverage of last night’s events inside.

The Daily Mirror also goes with “meltdown” and says rebel ministers inflicted another “humiliating defeat” on the prime minister.

In its headline, the Daily Mail said that “chaos reigns”, and adds that May lost control after “ministers’ mass revolt to rule out no deal”.

The Guardian go with “May’s final warning to Tory rebels: back me or lose Brexit”.

In the Daily Telegraph, it says: “Brexit delayed until further notice after gang of four rebels.”

The Daily Express, meanwhile, describes a “defiant May” and headlines the front page with “don’t let EU bullies win the day”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-coveney-4556726-Mar2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said there have been no formal discussions with the European Commission about how to prevent a hard border in Ireland, though he said they have “thought about” it.
The only way to avoid it would be to have regulatory alignment, but he said the they are still advocating for the backstop.
Pressure has been racketing up in the last week with a strict deadline of dates being given to UK Prime Minister Theresa May to get a deal done.
As the clock ticks on, the big questions about border infrastructure in a no-deal scenario are still largely unanswered.
Asked whether the EU Commission has thought about such a scenario, Coveney answered that there have certainly been “conversations around this, but there has been no formal discussion or negotiation as to how it would work”.
He went on to state that whether there is a deal or no-deal, the way to resolve the border issues will be some form of regulatory alignment.
No-deal
The Tánaiste went further in stating that “in fact arguably I would say the British Government has the prime responsibility here, because of course it is British government policy that has led to this challenge in the first place, insisting on leaving the customs union and the single market, which of course shaped the design of the backstop in the first place, which is as much a British creation as it is an EU one”.

In a no-deal scenario, discussions with Britain, Ireland and the EU will have to take place.
“There will need to be a solution on the border question, we know that a backstop is the only solution that works, so there will be an onus on all three parties to work together to find a way of preventing a physical border infrastructure which causes unnecessary tension between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland,” he said.
“We have clear commitments that go back to December 2017 and I think all parties will have an obligation to work intensively to come up solutions that can work. It’s possible to do that, we have shown that in the context of the back stop, but there will have to three willing partners.”
The Tánaiste would not be drawn on the issue of a special taskforce being set up to deal with the possibility of a hard border. This follows reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to examine backup plan to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in a no-deal situation.
The Taoiseach has insisted a specialist taskforce has not been set up to address the issue of the border.
Coveney said the questions are the same even in a no-deal scenario.
“We still have to protect a functioning all-island economy that reinforces a peace process. Northern Ireland is part of the UK and that’s not changing but we have to find a way of protecting the EU single market and a the same time preventing physical border infrastructure,” said Coveney.
“We have a proposal that has been agreed between the British Government and the EU, it’s called the backstop.”

Maysuggests she will seek either an “alternative” to the backstop, or a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism to allow the UK to leave the backstop.

The EU has already rejected a renegotiation of the agreed deal and Ireland has stated that a time-limited backstop would be useless because it would not ensure a hard border is avoided in the long run.
Despite this, if the Irish government prioritises avoiding a no-deal Brexit, it may come under pressure to make concessions on the backstop to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But should they?

MPS HAVE HELD a crucial vote on whether to back a no-deal Brexit.
They voted against it in the end, but it was a confusing path to get there.
It’s important to remember that even though they’ve voted against a no-deal Brexit, that that isn’t a legally binding decision.
Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons yesterday that without a deal, the default position is still leaving on the 29 March without a deal.
Here are the highlights from today:

First, let’s catch you up with what’s been happening already today…
After the latest crushing defeat for Theresa May last night, the UK government publishedits plans for trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit early this morning.
It says there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
However, tariffs will apply to goods on the way into mainland UK.
And it is these tariffs on the likes of beef, lamb and poultry that have caused dismay in Ireland.
Irish Farmers’ Association Joe Healy said the beef industry, in particular, “will not survive the kind of tariffs being talked about”.
“We export over 50% of our beef to the UK.  If this is subject to tariffs, it will be a ‘direct hit’ of almost €800m on the sector,” he said.
From midday, Brexit was the topic of debate in both the House of Commons and in the Dáil when leaders questions got under way.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin asked about the tariff proposals from the UK government, saying it would be devastating for the Irish economy.
With the Taoiseach in Washington, Tánaiste Simon Coveney acknowledged that tariffs would be ”damaging to businesses, farmers and consumers, whether in Ireland or the UK”.
He added the government will study any proposals carefully.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-passport-european-union-4580013-Apr2019/,"UK PASSPORT OFFICIALS have begun to issue passports without the words “European Union”, despite the country still remaining part of the bloc.
The UK was scheduled to leave the European Union last week on 29 March but the departure has been delayed, leaving passport officials in somewhat of a limbo.
Passport officials had been planning based on the 29 March date and so the following day was when the change was to be implemented.
“Burgundy passports that no longer include the words ‘European Union’ on the front cover will be introduced from 30 March 2019,” HM Passport Office said inguidance on its website.
The short period in which both may be issued is due to cost-saving measures, a spokesperson added.
“In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value for the taxpayer, passports that include the words ‘European Union’ will continue to be issued for a short period,” the spokesperson said.

In a series of tweets, Barone said she was “truly appalled” at the change andtold The Guardianthat it was “the first tangible sign of us leaving the EU”.
HM Passport Office has also been dealing with numerous queries from passport holders about what the presence or absence of the words “European Union” will mean.
The officials said the words being on the passport does not make a difference.
“There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not include the words European Union. Both designs will be equally valid for travel,” the passport office said.
The issue of passports has been an ongoing one in the Brexit debate with HM Passport Office confirming in late 2017that UK passports would be changing to a blue design.
The blue passports are to begin being issued from late 2019.

THREE CONSERVATIVE MPS have quit Theresa May’s party to join the newly formed Independent Group.
Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry have confirmed their departure from Theresa May’s party this morning, dealing a serious blow to the Prime Minister.
The Independent Group was formed by seven breakaway Labour politicians on Monday, who had said they wouldtry to tempt Conservatives to the new parliamentary grouping.
Confirming her decision this morning, Soubry said that her party had “shifted to the right”.
“We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP,” Soubry said in a letter to May.

Soubry wrote the MPs intedend to continue to support the government on some matters.
“We intend to sit as independents alongside The Independent Group of MPs in the centre ground of British politics. There will be times when we will support the government, for example, on measures to strengthen our economy, security and improve our public services,” she said.

Responding to the departing MPs in a series of tweets, May expressed disappointment at their decision.
“I am saddened by this decision – these are people who have given dedicated service to our party over many years, and I thank them for it,” May said.
“But by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country. And in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future.”
Earlier today, Joan Ryan became the eighth former Labour MP to leave the party to join The Independent Group.
Ina Times/YouGov poll, weighted by likelihood to vote, 38% said they would vote for the Tory party, 26% said that they would vote for Labour, and The Independent Group has already gathered 14%.
As politicians took their seats in the House of Commons at noon today for Prime Minister’s Questions, the former Tory MPs sat beside DUP MP Ian Paisley Junior.

Responding to questions, May responded to Jeremy Corbyn’s request to rule out a no-deal Brexit by saying there were two ways of doing that: to agree to a Brexit deal or to remain in the European Union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-brexit-impasse-4453083-Jan2019/,"MARY LOU MCDONALD has said that the Brexit impasse is a “specifically English” issue and that the return of Stormont would not solve it.
The Sinn Féin leader also said this afternoon that the Irish government must not blink in the face of “pressure tactics” from London.
McDonald was speaking in the wake of the failure of the UK parliament to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal last week and the poorreaction from Europe to the proposalsshe made yesterday.
“I think it is very concerning that Mrs May hasn’t removed the option of a no-deal from the table. I think that as each week passes, we come perilously closer to the prospect of a crash Brexit,” McDonald told reported.
McDonald also criticised the government’s planning for a no-deal Brexit, calling it “pretty threadbare”.
“It’s imperative that there is sufficient contingency planning, that there should be a state of readiness should there be a crash, a hard Brexit.”

McDonald was also asked whether having Stormont up and running, even temporarily, would be helpful in demonstrating opposition in Northern Ireland to the DUP’s Brexit position.
McDonald said that while she supports a return of the executive, doing it without resolving the wider issues between her party and the DUP would not be helpful.
“This is a much bigger political play that is in the first instance is specifically English, this is about English politics in the first instance and then British politics more generally,” she said.
McDonald added that the backstop issue, which has proved  to be the biggest stumbling block among Westminster MPs, was designed in part by the British government.
“The backstop is already positioned as ’unless or until’, that’s hardwired into it. Bear in mind this Irish protocol of the backstop was very much crafted to the pallet of the British political system, they haven’t had this foisted on them. This is something that they have been very much involved in creating,” she said.
“That is why we have the backstop, and I think the challenge for the British system is to accept that.”
McDonald also said that British politicians have already been afforded reassurances from the EU that backstop will only come into force if no other arrangement can be made.

https://www.thejournal.ie/meps-brexit-seats-ireland-4661575-May2019/,"MEPS ELECTED TO the ‘cold storage’ European Parliament seats will have no status assigned to them and will have no salary, expenses or facilities given to them until the UK leaves the EU, the European Parliament Liaison Office in Dublin has confirmed.
This impacts the fourth candidate elected in Dublin, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews as well as the last person elected in Ireland South. Three seats are yet to be filled in Ireland South.
Ireland was allotted the additional two seats as part of the redistribution of seats due to the UK’s vote to leave the European Union.
An additional seat was granted to the Dublin constituency, bringing it to a four seater. Meanwhile, the Ireland South constituency was increased to a five seater. The Midlands North-West constituency remained a four seater.
Ahead of the elections, questions arose about what the MEPs would be entitled to before being allowed take their seats.
Whether the two elected candidates are entitled to a salary and expenses while their seats are in limbo due to Brexit is a matter “for the European Commission to clarify and decide on”, a government spokesperson said in February.
Questions about what MEPs elected in the “cold storage” would be entitled to arose again after Andrews won the fourth seat on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters, Andrews said he wasn’t sure what “interim arrangements” would be made, but said he would “get on with life” until he could take his seat post-Brexit.

He said 50 MEPs across the EU are in the same position, adding that the situation is “unprecedented”.
On Tuesday, he said the European Commission would have to make “some kind of decision on what the status of the people in that position” might be until Brexit actually happens.
Today, the European Parliament Liaison Office in Dublin clarified its position saying in a statement that the “legal basis for the European election this weekend in both Irish and EU law is that 751 MEPs will be returned, including eleven from Ireland”.
It confirmed that the MEPs in the Brexit ‘cold storage’ seats will have no status, salary, facilities or expenses.
It added:
A spokesperson for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy said the department “awaits direction from the Commission” on the matter.

He went on to say that he wanted Brexit to be delivered and the result of the referendum respected, but added that it “can’t be at the risk of separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK”.
The DUP’s 10 MPs voted against Theresa May’s deal this afternoon. It lost by a majority of 58 votes.
After the vote and before MPs left the chamber, Nigel Dodds urged Theresa May to look at the Irish backstop again. “She knows that that remains a problem.”
“She knows that the EU and Leo Varadkar has said that there will be no hard border… Use the time constructively to get that matter sorted out,” he said.
The EU, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have all repeatedly said that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for renegotiation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-4574321-Apr2019/,"A UK MINISTER has quit Theresa May’s government, claiming the Prime Minister is “legitimising” Jeremy Corbyn by seeking his help in avoiding a no-deal Brexit.
Assistant government whip Nigel Adams announced his resignation this morning with speculation that his departure could be the first of more to come.
Speaking yesterday aftera marathon day of talks with her Cabinet colleagues, May said she wanted an extension to the Brexit deadline in order to pass her Withdrawal Agreement through parliament.
May said she would seek talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in order to facilitate this and there were suggestions that May could pursue a softer Brexit, such as the inclusion of a customs union arrangement, as part of these talks.
Boris Johnson said last night that this development was “very disappointing” and Adams has echoed these words while resigning from government.
“I believe we have two great challenges. We must deliver the Brexit that the people voted for. And we must prevent the calamity of a Corbyn government. Sadly, I fear that we are now at risk of simultaneously failing in both,” Adams wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister.
Following yesterday’s cabinet, this morning I’ve been to Downing Street & resigned my position as UK Govt Minister for Wales & Govt Whip. I’m grateful to the PM for the opportunity to serve as a Minister since 2017 & will continue to serve my constituents from the backbenches.pic.twitter.com/W15xS4cOBP— Nigel Adams (@nadams)April 3, 2019Nigel Adams MP/ Twitter

During last night’s statement in Downing Street, May said that although she believed the UK could “make a success” of no-deal in the long run, leaving with a deal would be preferable.

In response to this position, Adams said that May was abandoning the option of no deal.
“I and many others agreed with your previous position that no deal is better than a bad deal,” he wrote.
“It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal – cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life, put British interests first – is better than no deal.”
Guardian News/ YouTube
Afront page story in today’s Daily Telegraph reportedthat May was “ignoring the will of her Cabinet” by seeking Corbyn’s help instead of pursuing no deal and that “a full-scale Tory rebellion” could follow.
May’s director of communicationsdenied the story this morning.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that May working with Corbyn was “the best way” forward.
He said that Ireland would be in favour of granting May’s the extension she spoke about.
Coveney added that he felt a no-deal Brexit was still “unlikely” but that people should be prepared for it nonetheless.
“We would not be being honest with people if we did not encourage businesses in particular that aren’t as prepared as they should be, to continue to be prepared for all eventualities,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/article-50-brexit-date-extension-4542521-Mar2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted to back a short extension to Article 50, to push the UK’s date to exit the EU out by three months.
MPs voted to extend the exit date until 30 June.
The final vote was413in favour and202against – a majority of211for the government.
Several other motions, including one calling for an extension to be sought in order to hold a second referendum, were defeated.
Theresa May will now make a third attempt to get the EU withdrawal deal through parliament next week, ahead of an EU summit getting underway next Thursday.
If the deal May has been recommending since last November (and which MPs have already rejected twice) does not pass next week then the UK faces the prospect of a much longer extension of the Brexit date or leaving the EU without a deal.
A longer extension would require the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, a prospect the prime minister has said she does not support.
The UK will have to ask the EU if it can extend the exit date beyond 29 March and the leaders of the remaining 27 nations will have to sign off on any extension unanimously.
Deal or no deal
Tonight’s motion proposed seeking to extend the period covered by Article 50 until the end of June, noting thatif the House passes the withdrawal agreementby next Wednesday then the three month extension will be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
The motion also noted thatif the deal is not passedby next Wednesday “then it his highly likely” EU leaders will decide at their summit that they will require “a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019″.

Strangest 2 things of the night - Steve Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, voted against the plan he had been arguing for minutes before, and the chief whip who is in charge of getting MP s to back the govt, abstained
Seven cabinet ministers voted against the government’s own motion to push out the Brexit date, including Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay who had earlier spoken in favour of the motion during the afternoon’s debate.
Many Brexiteers fear any extension to the exit date will make Brexit more unlikely (with the prospect of Brexit not taking place at all becoming more likely the longer that extension goes on).
Even the government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote this evening.
Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (a former Brexit secretary) also voted against the extension. The original former Brexit secretary David Davis backed May’s motion and voted to delay Brexit.
The Conservative MPs who voted against the government motion tonight will not face punishment, as a free vote had been offered by May.

Other motions
Earlier this evening, MPs rejected a motion calling for an extension to Article 50 in order to hold a second referendum on Brexit.
Most Labour MPs sat out the vote, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell explaining that today was “not the day to press the public vote issue”.
Anti-Brexit campaign Best for Britain said today’s votes needed to focus on “the pressing need for an extension to Article 50″ to confirm the rejection of a cliff-edge exit in two weeks’ time.
Labour’s party policy is to try and get its own Brexit plan through first, and failing that it would back a second referendum.
The result was334against and only85in favour.

A motion put forward by Labour’s Hilary Benn calling for the House to put aside time next Wednesday for indicative votes on the way forward was defeated by a razor thin majority oftwo(314to312).
A separate vote was also held on a similar proposal, putting a deadline of 30 June on any process involving indicative votes. That was rejected by314votes to311.
A Labour frontbench motion calling for an extension of Article 50 to allow time to find a different approach was also defeated by318votes to302.
Now what?
EU Council chief Donald Tusk said earlier that a long postponement could be approved “if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.
His comments reflected Brussels’ long-standing position that a closer relationship is possible if May is willing to compromise, notably by abandoning her opposition to joining an EU customs union.
Other European leaders have warned that London must define a clear purpose to any extension.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney spoke of a possible Brexit postponement of 21 months, saying: “It would give a long reflection period for the British political system to look at how they want to approach Brexit again.”

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, speaking in the US, said tonight that he welcomed the vote for the extension “as it reduces the likelihood of a cliff edge, no-deal Brexit on March 29th”.
“But we now need to hear from London about what purpose an extension would serve and how long it would last. There seem to be two emerging options: ratification of the withdrawal agreement followed by a short extension into the summer, or a much longer extension that would give the UK time and space to decide what they want to do, including considering options that had been taken off the table like participation in the customs union and single market.
“I think we need to be open to any request they make, listen attentively and be generous in our response. This matter will be now discussed further at next week’s European Council meeting and hopefully we will have more clarity from London in the meantime about their intentions. Unanimity by the 27 will be required for any extension.”

Four options were voted on by MPs yesterday, with the motion on staying in a customs unions only three votes shy of passing.
Here’show they voted:
The votes, like the eight motions rejected by MPs last Wednesday, were indicative rather than legally binding.

May is set to hold a five-hour Cabinet meeting today to discuss how to move forward.
After receiving a short extension, Britain now has 10 days to either request more time or leave the European Union without a deal.
An extraordinary meeting of the European Council is due to be held on 10 April, two days before the UK must indicate a way forward.

The Withdrawal Agreement struck between May’s government and the EU may now be voted on for a fourth time. An amendment could be added to it to make it different from previous versions that were voted on, in a bid to appease Speaker of the House John Bercow.
If MPs are asked to vote on the deal once more, this would likely happen tomorrow. If it’s rejected again, there is speculation that a general election could be called in a bid to break the political deadlock.
Given the uncertainty of the coming weeks and months, preparations for a no-deal Brexit are continuing.

Responding to last night’s votes, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said a hard Brexit is becoming “nearly inevitable”.
Speaking in Brussels this morning, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier echoed this sentiment, saying a no-deal scenario “becomes day after day more likely”. However, he said he hopes such an outcome can still be avoided.
‘No one should underestimate the difficulties’
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris today to discuss Brexit.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Varadkar thanked France for its “ongoing solidarity” and “the clear commitment that the Withdrawal Agreement must include an operational backstop to avoid a hard border” on the island of Ireland.
“I am keen to discuss the possible scenarios arising from this week, particularly how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension, should there be one, and ongoing efforts to secure ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement.”
Varadkar said “it is now up to the UK to show how it plans to proceed and avoid a no-deal scenario”, adding:
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to travel to Dublin on Thursday to discuss Brexit with Varadkar.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-deal-4437552-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Jan 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has warned MPs that failing to back her Brexit deal would be a “catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy”.
May’s comments are part of a last-ditch effort to get support for the draft Withdrawal Agreement her government has struck with the European Union.
The House of Commons is set to vote on the deal on Tuesday.
Writing inthe Sunday Express, May said: “The verdict of the referendum was clear – the people of the UK want our future to be outside the European Union.
“But behind the record number of votes cast lie many different views about exactly what that future should look like.
“The same is true of Parliament. The vast majority of MPs want to respect the result of the referendum, which is why nearly all of us voted to trigger Article 50 two years ago. But there is far less of a consensus about the manner of our departure from the EU.”
May said the result of the 2016 referendum must be respected and said MPs should “forget the games and do what is right for our country”.
‘Catastrophic no-deal’
Speaking this morning, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party “will do everything we can to prevent a no-deal exit”.
Corbyn toldBBC One’s The Andrew Marr Showthe long-term effects of a no-deal scenario “would be huge” and “catastrophic for industry, catastrophic for trade”.

He said the Labour Party isready for a general election, and will call a no-confidence motion if May’s deal is rejected.
“We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing, but it’s going to be soon, don’t worry about it,” Corbyn stated.
Coup
Meanwhile,according to the Sunday Times, senior MPs are plotting to “seize control of Brexit negotiations and sideline the prime minister”.
At least two groups of rebel MPs are reportedly making plans to change House of Commons rules so motions proposed by backbenchers take precedence over government business.
This may enable MPs to suspend Article 50 and potentially lead to the referendum result being overturned — “a move that would plunge the country into a constitutional crisis”.
In the same newspaper, former British prime minister John Major says revoking Article 50 would be “politically uncomfortable” but is the “only sensible course”.
Backstop
In December, Maypostponed a voteon the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the deal.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the deal cannot be renegotiated. During the week, Varadkar said a proposal for Stormont to have a veto over conditions attached to the backstopwould not be acceptable.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of the official withdrawal date of 29 March.

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE have taken to the streets of London this afternoon calling for another referendum on Brexit.
Opponents of Britain’s departure from the EU gathered near Hyde Park at 12pm, before moving towards Westminster in what organisers, the People’s Vote group, are calling the “put it to the people march”.
Speakers including Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition Labour deputy leader Tom Watson are expected to address the crowds at a mass rally outside parliament.
Speaking last night, Khan said: Brexit is a complete and utter mess. I’ll be marching … with people from every part of our country – from every walk of life – to demand that the British people get the final say.”
Protestors march in London calling for a second Brexit referendumAaron ChownAaron Chown
The protest – set to be one of the largest in the capital in decades – comes after EU leaders this week granted a delay to Brexit, prompting British Prime Minister Theresa May to make a renewed bid to win MPs’ backing for her divorce deal.
However, May has said a third vote on her Brexit dealmay not happen next weekif there is insufficient support to approve it.
It was agreed on Thursday that date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if the deal was passed. However, if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
Today’s protest follows a similar demonstration in October that drew an estimated half a million people to the streets of London.
Organisers of today’s protest have arranged hundreds of coaches and a chartered train to bring protestors from across the country to the capital.
May has repeatedly ruled out holding another referendum on the issue, claiming it would be divisive and renege on promises to honour the 2016 result.

Petition
Meanwhile, more than four million people have signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched yesterday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
As of 1.45pm this afternoon, the petition had just over 4,275,800 signatures.
It was started by Margaret Anne Georgiadou, whotold the BBC: “I became like every other Remainer – very frustrated that we’ve been silenced and ignored for so long.
She said the petition “didn’t do very well for a week”.
“I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,” she added.
Since the launch of the petition, the British Parliament’s petitions committee tweeted that the rate of signings is the “highest the site has ever had to deal with”, after the website briefly crashed earlier. A House of Commons spokesman said the technical difficulties on parliament’s e-petition website were caused by “a large and sustained load on the system”.
Since then, the committee has also attemptedto tackle claimsthat the huge interest in the petition is not fraud, and has claimed that 96% of the signatures to the petition are from the UK.
If a petition on the website gets more than 100,000 signatures, the Parliament is meant to consider it for debate.
The government is expected to respond to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures.
It is one of the most popular e-petition since parliament launched the website in 2011.
A 2016 petition calling for a second EU referendum should the winning vote and turnout not reach a certain threshold received the most signatories at almost 4.2 million.
A petition to prevent US President Donald Trump from making a state visit to Britain reached 1.9 million signatures.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bercow-brexit-vote-4548946-Mar2019/,"THE SPEAKER OF the House of Commons has said Prime Minister Theresa May cannot have another meaningful vote on the Brexit deal without changes.
John Bercow said MPs from both sides of the house had expressed concern to him about the house being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.
He said the parliament’s rules state that a motion or amendment that is the same in substance as one that has already been decided by the House can not be brought forward again in that same session.
Bercow told the House of Commons that he is of the opinion that the second meaningful vote on the deal, which took place on 12 March, was not in breach of this rule.

He said it could be “credibly argued” that it was a different proposition as it contained a number of legal changes that the government considered to be binding and that were agreed with the European Union.
However he added that the government can not now submit “the same proposition or substantially the same proposition” as was rejected on 12 March by 149 votes.
He said it must be “fundamentally different”.
Theresa May had been expected to call a third meaningful vote this week but this is now unlikely to happen.
Bercow said this was not his final word on the matter. He said it was designed to signal to the government what will be required.

The UK Environment Secretary joins an already crowded pack of Tories aiming to become the next leader of the country.
Yesterday, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Health Secretary Matt Hancock joined the long list of contenders.
Gove, Leadsom, Raab and Hancock join front runner Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey who are all vying for the leadership.
Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has ruled herself out of the leadership contest.
May announced this week that she would stand down as Conservative leader on 7 June.

The contest is being held against the backdrop of European Parliament elections that the new Brexit Party of the anti-EU populist Nigel Farage is expected to win with about a third of the vote.
Polls show the Conservatives getting punished for their bickering over Brexit and finishing as low as fifth – their worst result in a national election.
The contenders are also mindful of a party revolt over May’s fateful decision to court the pro-EU opposition with the promise of a second Brexit referendum.
The concession was designed to help ram her withdrawal agreement through parliament on the fourth attempt.
But it won her no converts and sparked a party coup attempt that forced May to walk away before she was pushed out.
Parliamentary party members will begin whittling down the field of Tory party contenders to a final two on 10 June.
The finalists will go up for a vote in a ballot held across Britain by around 100,000 party members (who have three months’ standing) in July.

https://www.thejournal.ie/landbridge-brexit-4562087-Mar2019/,"IRISH TRUCKS CAN keep accessing the continent through the landbridge in the event of a hard Brexit, Cabinet was told today.
Access by the landbridge – the UK transit route linking Ireland and mainland Europe – has been agreed between the Irish and British government under the Common Transit Convention.
The Convention covers the European Union, European Free Trade Association, as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Switzerland Macedonia and Serbia.
The agreement will ensure that traders only have to make customs declarations and pay import duties when they arrive at their final destination.
Irish trucks
Around 150,000 Irish trucks travel through the UK for export to the EU every year,  that’s three million tonnes of Irish traffic a year.
It takes less than 20 hours to go from Ireland through Great Britain to the EU by road, according to a report by the Irish Maritime Development Office.
It takes 40 hours for direct roll-on, roll-off services (so, trucks that then go on ferries) and 60 hours for load-on load-off services (no trucks, just ferries).
Agrifood trade relies heavily on the landbridge, while two-thirds of Irish goods exporters make use of the UK landbridge to access continental markets.https://soundcloud.com/the-explainer-podcast/how-will-brexit-affect-the-food-that-you-buy
Earlier this month, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys urged businesses to make sure they are ready to avail of the customs transit procedure for moving goods through the UK landbridge post-Brexit.
Businesses who wish to continue to use the landbridge will need to have a Revenue-approved comprehensive financial guarantee in place.
This comprehensive guarantee is required as financial security to cover all potential and actual customs debts such as customs and taxes, said the minister, who called on traders to contact Revenue about their customs arrangements
“Businesses that move their goods to or from mainland Europe using the UK landbridge need to be aware that customs procedures will apply to them post-Brexit.
“If a business moves goods through the UK, or sources their supplies or components from mainland Europe via the UK landbridge, they need to put in place a financial guarantee to be in a position to avail of the ‘Transit’ procedure to lessen customs delays and costs,” she said.
“It takes time to put the necessary financial guarantee in place to be able to avail of this procedure though, so whether you’re a cement manufacturer exporting to Germany or a florist whose flowers come from Holland through the UK, I would urge businesses to start consulting with their bank or financial providers and Revenue straight away. Alternatively, businesses can engage a customs agent or logistics company to do so, but either way they need to start the process now,” Humphreys said recently.

Border discussions
Brexit preparations was also raised at Leaders’ Questions, with Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin asking about the level of discussions going on between the European Commission around the border issues in a no-deal scenario.
It was reported over the weekend that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was anxious for discussions about what would happen to the border in the no-deal scenario be escalated.
Speaking about it today, Varadkar said:
“It is not right nor is it possible for the Deputy to come in here and say that Chancellor Merkel said that or President Macron said this. It is not how the European Council works nor is it how it should work. If it has been reported that Chancellor Merkel said, ‘Get on with it’, I can say that is not the case.
“On a no-deal Brexit, the fact that I neither confirm nor affirm something that somebody is alleged to have said at a European Council meeting does not mean that I did not did not deny it,” he said, adding that he is not at liberty to say who said what at a European Council meeting.
Who knows?
The Taoiseach told the Dáil today that no one is sure what will happen if the UK crashes out of Europe.
“I have been asked a few times what would happen in the hypothetical scenario of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union without a deal. Of course, I do not know for sure – nobody knows for sure – what would happen in that scenario. It will depend on various factors other than that.”
He reiterated to the opposition that no preparations for a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland have begun and no preparations for physical infrastructure, checks or customs controls between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
“Even in the event of no deal, we believe the United Kingdom continues to have obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. We have obligations under the Good Friday Agreement as co-guarantors. We also recognise that the UK will have obligations under WTO rules and we will have obligations to protect our Single Market and our customs union, which obviously creates a problem. It creates a dilemma. Those are the conversations we have to have as to what might be done in different hypothetical scenarios,” he added.
Varadkar confirmed that discussions have taken place at an “official” level
“Talks with the Commission have been happening at official level on exploring what contingencies could exist. What they will be nobody can say for sure because a lot of that will depend on what approach the UK Government takes if it maintains full regulatory alignment,” said Varadkar.
Martin asked the Taoiseach to share the details with the House, but he replied:
Separately today, Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald said there are “no circumstances, no excuses, no scenario in which anybody would have a justifiable cause to take up arms”.
She said Irish people, in Northern Ireland and the Republic, have embraced a “new reality of relative stability”.

A number of votes on Brexit will take place in the House of Commons this week, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbynannounced yesterdaythat the party will support an amendment on a public vote.

However, it’s been suggested that the length of time it would take to arrange a second referendum would mean that the UK’s scheduled departure from the bloc on 29 March would have to be delayed.
And an extension of Article 50 would have to be approved by the other 27 countries in the European Union.
Many of these may simply want the whole process to be done with – especially as there’s no guarantee another referendum on Britain’s EU membership would pass.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-backstop-bray-4464251-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan 2019
DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said her party is giving its endorsement to a proposal dubbed as a compromise in British political circles which would see the backstop replaced by “alternative arrangements” and the transition period extended to 2021.
In a statement Foster said the DUP believes this proposal can “unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate” and provides a “feasible alternative” to the backstop.
The first part of the so-called compromise is Conservative MP Graham Brady’s amendment, which deals with redrafting the backstop  is now expected to be backed by his party – if speaker John Bercow selects that amendment for debate and a vote later tonight.
Brady said if the motion was approved by Parliament, it would give May “enormous firepower” to go back to Brussels and renegotiate the Brexit divorce deal.
Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to agree, urging Conservative lawmakers to back Brady’s amendment in order to send a clear message to the EU. She made the comments at a meeting with backbench Conservatives, according to several attendees.
Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG (European Research Group) were against it from the off, however. Since, they have said they are open to the ‘Malthouse’ agreement which is based on protocol drafted by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker. It is so named because housing minister Kit Malthouse brought the remain and Brexiteer sides together for talks in the past few days.

Arlene Foster said today that this Malthouse proposal would offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
“If the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on.
She said this confusion at been displayed both by “contradictory EU statements” and what she described as “the panic stricken behaviour of the Irish government”.

‘The negotiation is finished’
The stance of the European Union in relation to the backstop has not changed, however.
Sabine Weyand, deputy to EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said: “There’s no negotiation between the EU and the UK. That negotiation is finished.
“It does feel like Groundhog Day.”
She warned that Britain risked crashed out of the EU without a deal “by accident” because London cannot decide what it wants.
A source in French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said today: “The withdrawal agreement and the backstop are not renegotiable. The EU has been clear on this point many times: this route is an impasse. We must move on.”
Ireland’s Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee also called for “realism” from London.
“There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK,” she said.
‘To take control’
Brady’s backstop proposal is one of more than a dozen amendments proposed by UK lawmakers that aim to alter the course of Britain’s departure. Some others seek to rule out a no-deal Brexit so Britain can’t tumble out of the bloc on 29 March without an agreement in place to cushion the shock.
Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow will announce today which amendments have been selected for debate and vote.
Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles, who is backing an amendment designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit and seek a delay to Britain’s EU departure, said that today “is probably the only opportunity that Parliament is going to have to intervene in this process, to take control.”
“If we don’t seize the moment tomorrow afternoon, then we are at grave risk of just driving off the edge on March 29 without really wanting to and when there might be a compromise we could achieve, if we just had a few more months,” he told the BBC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-labour-split-4498913-Feb2019/,"A NUMBER OF UK Labour MPs are to quit the party, citing disaffection with the party’s leadership, its position on Brexit and its response to anti-semitism.
The seven breakaway MPs confirmed their split from the party this morning, speaking under the banner of The Independent Group.
The MPs leaving are Luciana Berger, Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey.
There had been speculation they were to set up a new party but today said they would sit in parliament as an independent grouping.
The group spoke to the media after saying they would be making an announcement “relating to the future of British politics” at 10am.
Speaking first, Berger said that she had become “embarrassed and ashamed to be in the Labour Party”.
Berger is parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement and said that the party had become “institutionally anti-semitic”.
She said that the decision taken by all the departing members was “a very difficult, painful but necessary decision.”

Chris Leslie MP echoed that the decision was “not an easy one for any of us” but that said that the party is no longer representative of his views.
“We did everything we could to save it, but it has now been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left”, he said, adding that “British politics is now well and truly broken”.

On Brexit, Leslie said that: “the evidence of Labour’s betrayal on Europe is no visible for all to see”.
“The past three years have confirmed how irresponsible it would be to allow this leader of the opposition to take the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,” he added.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.PA ImagesPA Images
SinceJeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leaderin 2015, there have been near-constant rumours that some MPs were planning to split from the party.
Despite support from grassroots Labour member that saw himcomfortably survive a leadership challenge from in 2016, he has struggled to maintain authority among MPs.
His perceived lack of leadership during the Brexit referendum, when Labour was campaigning for Remain, was sharply criticised by some MPs and Brexit has now proved the catalyst for this latest departure.
Labour’s performance in the 2017 general election, when Corbyn’s party increased its vote share and number of seats, had quelled rebellion against him.
In a series of tweets this morning after the members confirmed their departure, Corbyn made reference to that vote.
“I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945,” he said.
“The Tories are bungling Brexit while Labour has set out a unifying and credible alternative plan. When millions face the misery of Universal Credit, rising crime, homelessness and poverty, now more than ever is the time to bring people together to build a better future for us all.”
Corbyn has long been critical of the EU and under his leadership the party’s position is to honour the June 2016 vote to leave.
Some within his party had urged Corbyn to throw his support behind the push for a second referendum but he instead he remained focus was on forcing an election.
Earlier this month, Corbyn accepted an offer from Prime Minister Theresa May to talks about Brexit, stating that some elements of herproposed Withdrawal Agreement must changefor Labour to support it.
May ultimately dismissed Corbyn’s call for the UK to formsome form of customs union with the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/media-interest-border-brexit-4483133-Feb2019/,"ANTI-BREXIT CAMPAIGNERS along the border have been dealing with a surge of interest in recent weeks as media outlets around the world dispatch crews and reporters to speak to locals on either side of the 500km boundary.
TheJournal.iespoke to local residents about their fears of a hard border at Dromintee GAA club in South Armagh on Wednesday night, alongside a reporter from a German daily newspaper and a camera crew from Reuters (you can read the full story here).
Damien McGinty, a local organiser for Border Communities Against Brexit, said he’d arranged the event as a way of meeting all the media requests they’d been getting in the wake of Theresa May’s failure to get the EU-UK withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons last month.
Fears of a no-deal exit increased further in recent weeks amid continuing disarray in London, leading to an inevitable rise in interest from news organisations in what’s likely to happen on 29 March, and what it might lead to.
“It’s crazy,” McGinty, who runs a local post office and a small farm, said.
“We had the Chinese last week, we have South Koreans, we have an Australian, we had four UK-based crews, we have an American crew interested. It’s nuts.”
Another organiser had met with reporters from Euronews earlier that day and was due to meet with a Spanish crew the next day. They’d also just finished their contributions to a documentary following the group to Strasbourg to lobby EU politicians, McGinty said.

He’s not complaining, he emphasises – they have a serious message to get out, and it’s important to communicate it, particularly to Europe.
Formed in the wake of the 2016 referendum vote, which saw a majority of voters in the North vote to Remain in the EU, campaigners from the group have lobbied extensively in Belfast, Brussels, Dublin and Westminster in recent years.
They’ve also organised large-scale demonstrations and stunts to emphasise their message – including a protest two weeks ago that saw organisers build a wall and eight foot watchtower, manned by actors in military fatigues.

In Clones, Co Monaghan, another stop on what has now become a ‘Brexit Camino’ for international reporters, local businessman Eamon Fitzpatrick toldTheJournal.ieit was essential to get the anti-border message out.
“It’s important to get out what the border means. The average person in London hasn’t a clue what the border means.”
Fitzpatrick, whose fuel and hardware business on the outskirts of Clones is bisected by the border, had also hosted the Chinese media crew in recent weeks.
Sinn Féin councillor for Clones Pat Treanor said locals hoped they were “doing a little good by getting the message out to MEPs in other countries and governments in other countries”.
“It might bring that wee bit of extra pressure on their MEP and educate them on what it would be like if a border came back.”

THE FORMER BREXIT secretary David Davis has said Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal is “dreadful” and, in a way, worse than the UK’s current EU membership.
“Frankly this deal is worse than current membership in one sense because we can’t get out of it,” he told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
He said that it was “a dreadful deal on many many counts”, but added that if the UK could leave the backstop whenever it chooses, that it might be “rescuable”.

“I would love to be able to vote for it, if she gets the ability to pull out,” he said.
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
The backstop locks the UK, including Northern Ireland, into a customs deal and other regulations in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It’s been a bone of contention in the Brexit debate.
Speaking on the Marr Show, Davis said that EU leaders were “shocked” after the deal was rejected, and “that the language changed”:
“The tenor of the language changed. Mr Varadkar’s language changed, Mr Juncker’s language changed, Mr Tusk’s… and then all of a sudden, three Cabinet ministers said ‘You’ve got to take no-deal off the table’, ‘You’ve got to have an extension’, and then it went back to being hard again.”
Davis also said that he’s not hoping for a no-deal Brexit, but that it needs to be kept as a viable option “because it’s what keeps bringing the European Union back”.

Opening Prime Minister’s Questions this afternoon, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked:
“In view of the amazing performance from Liverpool last night, perhaps the Prime Minister could take some tips from Jurgen Klopp [Liverpool's manager] on how to get a good result in Europe?”
In response, Theresa May said:
The English club lost the first leg of the semi-final clash against Barcelona 3-0, and seemed headed for certain defeat after their injured stars Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were ruled for last night’s match at Anfield.
But Liverpool staged one of the greatest comebacks in their history by winning 4-0 at home and getting through to their second successive Champions League final.
Liverpool is a historically liberal port city that likes to buck convention and was the home of Labour’s annual party conference last year.

Earlier today, May resisted demands from within her party to give a clear timetable for stepping down, with her spokesman insisting she would stay until Britain’s exit from the EU is finalised.
“She is here to deliver Brexit in phase one and then she will leave to make way for new leadership for phase two,” the Downing Street spokesman said.
The Conservative leader is under increasing pressure from MPs and activists unhappy over her handling of Brexit, which was meant to have taken place on 29 March but has been delayed twice.
As it stands, the UK will leave the EU by 31 October at the very latest, or if Theresa May’s thrice-defeated draft Withdrawal Agreement defies all odds and is passed by MPs in another vote, then they will leave the EU several weeks after that result.
It’s also possible another extension will be given on 31 October; Brexiteers fear that if this happens, Brexit might not happen at all.
May’s Cabinet is currently in talks with the Labour party to try to win its MPs’ support for a Brexit deal, after failing to win over her own Tory rebels or the DUP.
Talks between the Conservative government and Labour will continue next week.

The elections will take place across the EU over a four-day period this month – between 23 and 26 May.
Each Member State sets its own election day and Ireland will be going to the polls on Friday, 24 May.
There are 751 outgoing MEPs who served in the 2014-2019 term, but fewer MEPs will be elected this time around: 705. The reduction is due to Brexit – Britain was due to leave the EU in March but obviously this didn’t happen.
A decision was previously made to fill 27 of the UK’s 73 MEP places, and keep 46 vacant for possible future enlargement of the EU. This meant that Ireland got an additional two MEPs, bringing ourtotal from 11 to 13.
An additional seat is going to the Dublin constituency, bringing it to a four-seater; and Ireland South, which will become a five-seater; while Midlands North West will remain a four-seater.
However, the delay in Brexit could impact thosetwo extra seats.

HONDA HAS ANNOUNCED that it will close a major plant in Britain, putting 3,500 jobs at risk as the company became the latest firm to downsize operations as Brexit looms.
The factory in Swindon is Honda’s only EU plant and has produced the manufacturer’s Civic model for more than 24 years, with 150,000 units rolling off the line annually.
The plant will shut in 2021, Honda announced “at the end of the current model’s production lifecycle”.
The decision “has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling today’s announcement will be for our people”, Katsushi Inoue, the company’s chief officer for European regional operations, said in a statement.
The firm blamed “unprecedented changes in the global automotive industry” for the decision but it comes amid investment uncertainty in Britain ahead of the country’s exit from the EU.
Speaking to reporters in Tokyo, Honda president Takahiro Hachigo said: “I’d like you to understand this is not related to Brexit.”
He said it was “very regrettable” to have to close the plant but said it was the “best choice” given the need to reduce production capacity and reform its global facilities.

The firm also announced it would stop manufacturing the Civic model in Turkey in 2021.
Free-trade agreement
Honda joins fellow car giant Nissan as well as Japanese firms Sony, Panasonic and Hitachi in scaling back operations in Britain ahead of Brexit.
Analysts say that while Brexit was almost certainly a factor for Honda, other reasons were likely to have played a part, including a massive EU-Japan free-trade agreement recently signed and the wider struggles of the car industry.
“Honda seems to have been preparing for this for a long time. Then Brexit happened, which might have pushed the company to make the decision now,” Seiji Sugiura, analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, told AFP.
Speaking ahead of the formal decision, local finance worker Sue Davis, 49, told AFP the move would be “devastating” for the area.
“I think Swindon’s finished without Honda. My ex-husband works there, has done for 20 years. He’s going to be without a job, so I just think it’s really, really bad news.”
Local MP Justin Tomlinson tweeted ahead of the announcement that the decision had been made “based on global trends and not Brexit as all European market production will consolidate in Japan in 2021″.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-challenges-2019-4429234-Jan2019/,"THE DÁIL RETURNS after the Christmas break on Tuesday, and as the Taoiseach faces into 2019, he has a number of major issues to grapple with.
Discussions about what lies ahead are likely to feature at Fine Gael’s first parliamentary party meeting of the new year which is being held today.
In what could be Leo Varadkar’s toughest year yet, there are a number of huge issues barrelling towards him from day one.
So, what’s on the cards?
Brexit
On top of the agenda for the Taoiseach and his government is Brexit.
If there was any hope that things might have shifted over the Christmas break, that has now dissipated. UK Prime Minister Theresa May says she still intends to hold a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal on Tuesday, the numbers are still questionable and the Irish government continues to maintain that it has no contingency plans for a hard border.
The main issue for all sides? The backstop. With the new year just begun the Taoiseach will have to continue to push for little or no changes to the withdrawal agreement, while also walking a steady line in a bid to avoid a crash out by the UK.
With all the back and forth negotiations aside, the date is still set for 29 March (unless the UK pushes to extend Article 50).
The Irish government has stepped up contingency plans for a hard Brexit, with more contingency plans for transport and medicines to be published tomorrow. On day one of heading back to work, all eyes will be on the legislative programme and whether the raft of legislation Varadkar says will be needed might hold up the show.
At least 45 legislative changes will be needed, including over 20 pieces of primary legislation, in light of Brexit.
With such a logjam of legislation, the Taoiseach has hinted theold guillotine methodmight be re-introduced, and that will not go down well with those in opposition. He has also put all his TDs on notice that they must turn up for votes on Wednesdays and Thursdays this year. No excuses.
Housing
Back in 2017, Varadkar was bold enough to suggest that the homelessness crisis will be solved by 2019, when he said more houses will be built than are needed.
2019 is upon us and the situation is the worst it has ever been. While housing is being built, it is in no way at the pace that is needed, with many criticising Fine Gael having anideological issueagainst building social housing.
Emergency accommodation figuresfor November, the latest available figures, show that there were 9,968 people living in homeless accommodation that month, an increase of 244 people on October’s figures.
Meanwhile, the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin has increased to 156, according to the latestRough Sleeper Count, which was published last month.
House prices rose by€1,000 per monthin 2018, with predictions that priceswill rise by 5% this year, the Taoiseach will need to move fast to get affordable housing on the agenda.
Renting in Ireland has also spiralled with prices superseding that of the boom times.Renting is becoming more expensiveby the month, but the rate of increase is slowing thanks to rent pressure zones, which the government is quick to highlight.
With talk of areshuffle in the summer, and speculation that Varadkar has fallen out with his buddy Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy (which has been vehemently denied) the Taoiseach might be tempted to put someone new in the job. But will it make any difference? Probably not.
As the public becomes more desensitised to the homeless on the streets, what might make the Taoiseach get moving is the threat at the ballot box.
While an election date has been set for next year, the Taoiseach would be wise to listen to the voices of those that can’t afford to rent, let alone buy a home. The concerns raised by mums and dads around the country, who have found their 30-something-year-old back home are also not to be brushed aside. This is one issue that has crossed all sects of society, and one that TDs will be all to keen to see addressed before a general election kicks off. This issue will be – or should be – high on Varadkar’s agenda for 2019.
Advertisement
The Health Service
Another year, another massive overspend in the health budget. With this year’s flu season delayed and only kicking in now, Varadkar is facing into a winter of trolley number headlines greeting him over his morning Wheetabix.
Not only that, but a strike of all things has been set for 30 January over a nurses dispute about pay. Psychiatric nurses have also backed these plans. Then there’s the capacity issues facing hospitals up and down the country, as well as the waiting lists that last months, if not years. The government says it has a plan, and it’s called Sláintecare. It’s got cross-party approval, but the progress in rolling it out has been slow.
There’s also the children’s hospital overspend to deal with. That headache is set to rumble on, with the Taoiseach admitting that the overspend could increase, adding that he is now concerned about the operational costs of the hospital once it is built and open.
Another huge change to the health service this year is the roll out of abortion services at GPs and clinics. The success of the referendum last year was something the government could rest its hat on, but the reality of introducing the services is not without its difficulties, with protests already taking place outside some hospitals. The government is likely to face criticism over not ensuring legislation for exclusion zones was rolled out in parallel with the abortion services.
Local and European elections /referendums
It is going to be a busy year in 2019. In May, the local andEuropean electionsare being held, as well as anumber of referendumsincluding the voting rights of citizens abroad in presidential elections, women in the home, as well as a referendum on reducing the wait time for adivorce to two years.
The gender quota issues during the locals is already appearing to be a difficulty, something the Taoiseach has already stated.
The local and European elections are really important for Fine Gael,said Tánaiste Simon Coveneywho added that the party want to be the biggest party in the country, “locally as well as nationally”. Pressure will be on Varadkar to deliver.
Avoiding bouncing the country into election
Not one to shy away from controversy, Varadkar does have a tendency to rock the boat with some of his comments, particularly when it comes to Fianna Fáil.
That would be fine of course, if Fine Gael were not relying on Fianna Fáil’s support to keep them in government.
Before Christmas, the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin agreed that an election would not be held until 2020. Why? The uncertainty of Brexit was the reason given. However, the Taoiseach has since said, while he has no intentions of calling an election, he cannot guarantee that an election will not happen this year, due to the life that is politics.
Varadkar will have to strike a balance with the main party in opposition, keeping them sweet with some concessions, while avoiding getting to carried away and putting his foot in it. This could prove difficult to the Taoiseach in the months ahead.
Keeping up the numbers
The numbers supporting the government are tight for the Taoiseach, and in the months ahead he will have to ensure he works those communication channels to ensure there are not more dissenters like that of Peter Fitzpatrick. Threats to leave Fine Gael were also mooted by junior minister Catherine Murphy last year.
Then there are the partners in government – the Independent Alliance – who he will also have to keep satisfied. One of the first tests for this relationship will be at the end of the month when theOccupied Territories Bill comes before the Dáil.
The Bill, which was passed in the Seanad in December, aims to prohibit Ireland from trading in goods and services from Israeli-occupied territories by prohibiting the import and sales of goods, services and natural resources originating in illegal settlements in occupied territories.
It has cross-party support, but Fine Gael are against it. Independent Alliance ministers Shane Ross, Finian McGrath and John Halligan are seeking a free vote on the Bill. Will Varadkar concede in order to keep the peace?
Climate change
Varadkar has described Ireland as a “laggard” on the issue as it will miss emission reduction targets and faces significant EU fines. There is another climate change action plan, but the main issue up for debate is theroll out of a carbon tax.
The Taoiseach said no such charge will be introduced in 2019, but he has to come up with some reasonable plan in order to be seen to do something on the issue.
Varadkar’s answer so far is to roll out the tax, but at the same time give a rebate cheque to households. With protests over similar issues in France, Varadkar will have to get this right. Remember water charges? Varadkar should definitely learn lessons from that debacle.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-10-4533012-Mar2019/,"AFTER WEEKS, and months, and years of political wrangling, this week will see the most crucial set of decisions made by British politicians to determine the course of Brexit.
As outlined here, there could be as many as three vital votes in the House of Commons this week with a number of options on the table.

The first option MPs will vote on is set for Tuesday on Theresa May’s much-maligned withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop provision that is so loathed by the DUP and hardline Brexiteers.
If they vote against Theresa May’s deal, MPs will be asked to vote on if they want a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday.
And, if they vote against a no deal, then they’ll be voting again on Thursday on whether to extend Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeremy-corbyn-labour-brexit-4446029-Jan2019/,"LABOUR LEADER JEREMY Corbyn has warned his MPs that they shouldn’t engage with Theresa May’s government until a no-deal has been ruled out.
In the letter to his parliamentary party colleagues, Corbyn congratulated them on “inflicting the biggest ever loss on any sitting government”, and said that they were on a path to sparking a general election, or, if that failed, campaigning for a People’s Vote (that means a second referendum on EU membership).
A document obtained by The Telegraph todayhas indicated that it would take a year for the UK government to prepare for a second referendum, although this has been contested by the British electoral commission, saying it would only take half that time.
May’s Brexit dealfailed to get the House of Commons approval this week, losing by a record-breaking 230 votes (May needed 320 votes to pass the deal, she got 203).
Theletter from Corbyncontinues:
“The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous no-deal outcome is ruled out. This is a position that has now been adopted by First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon.

The letter was sent around the same time that two senior Labour figures – Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper – were seen emerging from talks with the government. Other Labour MPs have indicated publicly in the UK media that they wouldn’t be heeding Corbyn’s orders.
In a letter to the Prime Minister today, Corbyn said: “on behalf of the Labour Party, I ask you to rule out ‘no deal’ and to immediately end the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds of public money preparing for a ‘no deal’ outcome. The £4.2 billion currently allocated to ‘no deal’ planning could significantly improve many of our cash-starved public services on which people rely.”

May will miss next week’s annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos to focus on Brexit negotiations, sending ministers in her place, Downing Street said today.
“She will not be going to Davos. She will be focused on matters here,” May’s spokeswoman said, adding that “there will be government ministers attending”.
The embattled Prime Minister has until Monday to come up with her alternative plan for Brexit; the EU has said it won’t renegotiate with the UK, and will not drop the contentious backstop.
It was announced today that MPs will debate that plan in the House of Commons on Monday 29 January. Legally, the UK must leave the Eu by 29 March, unless an extension to Article 50 is requested, and granted by the EU’s 27 member states.

The latest plan follows the collapse of talks with the Labour party on Friday. For weeks, May’s Cabinet and Labour have tried to find a Brexit both sides want in order to get some type of Brexit deal through the UK parliament.
The current draft Brexit deal, negotiated between Theresa May’s officials and the EU, has been rejected by MPs three times in three months.
So, let’s see what spin the UK’s newspapers have put on May’s “new deal” which has already been heavily criticised by MPs on both side of the house.
The Daily Mail has run with “Theresa’s gamble too far”.

The Daily Express runs with the dramatic “Besieged May’s last hurrah”.

The Guardian runs with “May’s final effort to win backing falls flat as MPs reject ‘new deal’”.

TONIGHT, THE UK parliament had the chance to vote on seven proposed amendments to Theresa May’s defeated Withdrawal Agreement.
British Prime Minister’s Brexit deal wasrejected by 230 votestwo weeks ago; MPs are now trying to take over the Brexit process from May’s government, and dictate what happens next.
Some of the amendments – such asthe Brady amendmentand theMalthouse amendment– proposed changes to the Irish backstop, which the Irish government previously described as a watertight guarantee from the British government that a hard border would not reappear on the island of Ireland because of Brexit.
We covered the developments from before the crucial votes began 7pm, and as reaction came in to the decision from MPs to back the Brady amendment.
Here’s how it unfolded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-eurotunnel-ferry-contracts-4519009-Mar2019/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has agreed to pay £33m to Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel to settle a lawsuit the company took over a post-Brexit ferry contract.
The case was taken after the UK’s Department for Transportspent more than £100m on contracts to three firms- including Irish-backed company Seaborne Freight – to provide additional capacity for lorries in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Controversy arose after it was discovered that Seaborne Freight did not own any ships and had never run a ferry service, and the company has since had its deal cancelled after its Irish backer pulled out of the contract.

In January, Eurotunnel wrote to Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to complain that it had not been considered when the contracts were awarded, accusing the government of doing so in a “secretive way”.
The company argued that, unlike Seaborne, it had actually run a ferry service across the English Channel before, and should there have been approached by the government.
Today, the government announced it would pay the company £33m to settle a lawsuit it took over the awarding of the contracts, according to the BBC.
As part of the agreement, Eurotunnel has agreed to make improvements to its terminal.
The ferry services are expected to provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity, which it is hoped will mitigate the extra time needed to perform customs checks on freight if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/green-card-brexit-4526528-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Mar 2019
TRANSPORT MINISTER SHANE Ross has said his department has asked the European Commission to set a date for when motorists travelling to Northern Ireland will not need a green card.
He said the government is currently in talks with the EC about reaching an arrangement on the cards, stating that this is not something Ireland wants to be in place.
In January, motorists were told they would require aninsurance Green Cardto drive in Northern Ireland and the UK in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
Last month, green card forms and electronic application templates have been issued to insurance providers by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.
The MIBI has advised motorists who plan on driving in Northern Ireland and the UK immediately after 29 March to begin applying for their green cards in case a no-deal scenario materialises.
Those who plan on travelling after that period have been advised to contact their insurance company or broker one month in advance of their expected travel date.
Currently, Irish-registered vehicles that travel within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU Motor Insurance Directive. However, a no-deal Brexit would see the UK withdraw from this directive, meaning Irish motorists will require a Green Card to travel there.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed today that those based in the North but travelling by car over the border to the south will not need a green card.
He told the Dáil that understands that there are concerns around the issue of green cards, adding that the vast majority of those with motor insurance will be covered if they driving over the border.
However, he added that drivers will need to prove they have insurance in the form of a green card.
Speaking about drivers from the North who are travelling to the south, he clarified there will be a “grace period” in effect post-Brexit.
Transport Minister Shane Ross, stated “this is not something that the government wants to see, rather it is another consequence of a decision by the UK people”.
“As part of its contingency planning, the Government has raised this matter directly with the European Commission seeking agreement from it to set a date from which green cards would not be required as is possible under the EU’s Motor Insurance Directive.
“The Commission has not given agreement to date and the Government continues to pursue the matter with it,” said Ross.
Ross went on to say that the preparation by MIBI and insurers is an example of ‘prudent advance planning “in preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit”.
The department has requested, and continues to do so, that the EU Commission set a date where green cards would not be required, he said.
‘Asleep at the wheel’
Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty today called on the Taoiseach to directly intervene in the situation, accusing Transport Minister Shane Ross of being “asleep at the wheel” in relation to drivers needing green cards to travel over the border after Brexit.
Advertisement
Doherty said confusions continue to reign as people are unaware of the consequences of not applying for the card, stating that people are concerned about their insurance not being recognised in the North, and cars being impounded if stopped.
The Donegal deputy questioned how the transport minister allowed the situation to get where it is today just a couple of weeks away from 29 March.
He added that some countries outside of the EU, have arrangements in place where such green cards are not required.
Doherty asked why such a deal wasn’t already in place for Northern Ireland, stating that due diligence on the issue should have been done months ago, and not left to the last minute.
Bilateral arrangement needed
Varadkar said the government is continuing in its work in a bid to get an arrangement bilaterally between the EU and the UK, but that has yet to be agreed.
Fianna Fáil’s Lisa Chambers said the government needs to provide assurances to people as to what might happen and what drivers need after the drive over the border post 29 March.
Ross “needs to get his act together,” said Chambers, who said the transport minister should be less concerned about the passage of his judicial appointments Bill and more concerned with the “bread and butter” work of his own department.
Speaking about whether her party had been briefed about what will happen to the border if there is a no-deal scenario, Chambers said the government have been far from transparent on the issue.
Chambers said the Tánaiste has said the government is not planning for a hard border, adding that the most Simon Coveney has stretched to is suggesting the border would be somewhere in the sea.
“He really hasn’t provided more detail than that,” she added.
The “best insight” given by government on the border issue was when a private conversation was recorded between Ross and Coveney at a press briefing.
The Tánaiste was recorded as telling the transport minister “we don’t want to be the government that introduce a border on this island” and Ross replied, “well, I just didn’t know what to say”.
She said that suggests there is a “Cabinet within the Cabinet” where not all ministers are being briefed on the contingency plans for the border.
However, she said it is not credible to suggest that the Tánaiste and the Taosieach have not had the conversation about what would happen in a no-deal scenario, though she doubts there are any discoverable notes written down on paper.

THIS WEEK, THE UK secured a Brexit extension until the 31 October, giving everyone caught up in the Brexit storm a much needed breather.
British Prime Minister Theresa May now has six months to get her Brexit deal passed, with a ‘check-in’ on the process on 30 June.
This ‘flextension’ means the leaders of the EU’s 27 member states avoid meeting every time the House of Commons rejects the Withdrawal Agreement, or rejects all other options.
So far, the House of Commons has rejected Theresa May’s deal three times in three months, and has also rejected 12 alternative arrangements in two sets of indicative votes.
The UK parliament is on an Easter break now until 23 April; this gives MPs a chance to rest and reset before trying to solve the impasse in the House of Commons, and May time to try to find some compromise with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The British PM has been engaged in talks with Corbyn to try to secure his party’s support for her thrice-defeated Brexit deal. If she can strike a deal with Labour in the next few weeks – a customs union is the most common suggestion, not to be confused withtheCustoms Union – then she could get her deal passed quickly and possibly avoid the European elections.

The longer extension also means the EU can focus on issues other than Brexit, like the ongoing migration crisis, the rise of far-right parties across Europe as a new European Parliament is elected, and the rollout and ownership of the 5G network.
What’s up next -local elections
The UK’s local elections are due to be held on 2 May, with the Tories predicted to suffer a blow from both Brexiteers, who are unhappy that the UK is still in the EU; and Remainers, who are unhappy at the government policy to deliver Brexit.
The elections will be seen as an indication of the mood of the electorate against the two main parties which are increasingly fractured over the Brexit issue.
There are 8,374 council seats available in England, 462 in Northern Ireland. Tories hold 4,600 seats, while there is no party majority in Northern Ireland.
According to the Financial Times,more than 100 Conservative councillorswrote to May warning that activists “are refusing to campaign and party donations have ‘dried up’ due to what they see as a betrayal of Brexit”.

There’s already an anger brewing at the money squandered in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, which civil servants were ordered to wind-down in the aftermath of a long extension being granted.
What’s up next – European elections
Stefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
Between 23 and 26 May, European Parliament elections will be held across 27 member states; in Ireland, the election will be held on 24 May.
If Theresa May doesn’t get her deal approved before 22 May, then the UK will have to take part in European elections in the subsequent days, or risk legal action from voters who wish to exercise their right to vote.
The new parliament will sit for the first time on 1 July. The term is for five years.
Ironically, if the UK does take part in the European elections, it’s expected that there will be a surge in pro-Brexit MEPs, as Eurosceptic British citizens who previously didn’t vote, will now vote for Brexit candidates as a form of protest.
EU leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, used this point to argue in favour of a shorter extension, fearing the ructions anti-EU MEPs could cause in the European Parliament in getting legislation passed.
The UK’s participation in European elections could alsocause problems for Ireland; it would mean that Ireland would elect 13 MEPs but that only 11 would take their seats in Parliament until the UK leaves.
Orifthe UK leaves: as has been argued before, a long extension could be the path towards no Brexit at all. If 31 October comes and the UK still hasn’t managed to pass the Withdrawal Agreement, and there’s still no majority for what type of Brexit it does want, will the UK call the whole thing off?

https://www.thejournal.ie/angela-merkel-dublin-4577265-Apr2019/,"ANGELA MERKEL has said a solution to avoid a hard border in Ireland must be found in the scenario of a no-deal Brexit.
Meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Farmleigh House in Dublin today to discuss Brexit, the German Chancellor said “we are more than aware of what is at stake and what must be solved”.
She said she understood the “sort of assurances we have to give” but added that European leaders have trust in those negotiating Brexit with the UK.
When asked is it possible to protect the integrity of the single market and make a commitment that anything resembling a border can be ruled out on the island of Ireland, Merkel said:
Merkel said everything is being put into finding a solution, together.
”We will find a sensible solution,” she said.
“We will simply have to be able to do this, we hope for a solution that we can agree together with Britain,” she said.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
“We want to stand together as 27. Until the very last hour – I can say this from the German side – we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit: Britain crashing out of the European Union.
‘Moving’ meeting with those living on the border
Ahead of their formal meeting the two leaders participated in a roundtable discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the border area.
Members of the public who live along the border area shared their personal experiences and perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on border communities and businesses.

These included a peace worker in Belfast who lost close family members in a bomb attack, a Unionist farmer and haulier from Inishowen in Donegal and a GP from Inishowen who now lives in Derry.
Some of the people had direct personal experience of the conflict before the Good Friday Agreement.
Merkel said meeting with those that live along the border was a very “important experience”. She described it as “moving”, mentioning her experience of a divided Germany.
“I personally come, after all, from a country that for many years was divided by a wall,” the Chancellor said.
After all a heavy death toll has been taken here throughout the Troubles.
She said she learnt about what it “means for their life” living on the border, adding that it will “encourage me to ensure this peaceful agreement” is upheld.

Varadkar paid tribute to those that shared their stories, stating that it made it clear why the issue of the border “transcends” economic issues.
Speaking about Westminster, she said there has been “quite a lot of movement”, although she said she was not in a position to answer speculative questions about what will happen if the deal is not ratified.
“There is vast majority that want to avoid a disorderly Brexit and this is my starting point,” said Merkel, who said the debate that are ongoing in the UK parliament must be respected.
“Both Ireland and Germany want to have a future relationship with the UK which is close and comprehensive and as deep as possible, and we would like to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratified so that we can begin the negotiations on a new economic and security partnership without further delay,” said Varadkar.
He added: “There is very little time left and we have to prepare ourselves for all outcomes.”
Speaking about what will happen in a no-deal scenario, Varadkar said “it is not possible quite frankly to have a clear plan… a lot of it will depend on what Britain decides to do”.
“With so many unknowables it is not possible to have a clear plan,” but he reiterated that Ireland remains committed to its objectives – to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-dublin-4433883-Jan2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON TOLD an audience at a pricey, business-friendly “self-empowerment” conference in Dublin today that “nobody will implement” a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The former UK foreign secretary spoke for about 25 minutes at the Pendulum Summit in the Convention Centre Dublin before a question and answer session with RTÉ’s Bryan Dobson.
During his speech, Johnson argued that politicians are too wary of taking risks and claimed that the media has a tendency to exaggerate them.
Ahead of his on-stage appearance, Johnson had held a meet and greet with some holders of ‘Diamond’ tickets for the event.
The summit has a number ofdifferent ticketing levels, ranging from €795-€950, with prices for the Diamond tickets kept under wraps, depending on the applicant.
Johnson repeatedly told the audience that he did not see infrastructure being established on the Irish border regardless of the manner of the UK’s exit from the EU.

Johnson said that there are technological solutions to the border issue that have not being explored.
”Nobody will implement it. We should not abandon attempts to find a technological solution to the border without even trying,” he said during his speech.

Johnson comes on stage to 'The Final Countown'. He says he will talk about Brexit, but not yet.Instead, he's talking about Jaws. Seriously. He says the mayor of Amity Island was right to be sceptical about the shark, even though he turned out to be wrong.
In his conversation with Dobson, which frequently consisted of both parties speaking over one another, Johnson denied that all goods coming to Ireland from the UK would have to be checked.
“That is entirely a matter for Ireland and if you choose to insist on every lorry and orders coming from the UK to be checked in that way, that’s a matter for you,” he said.
“And that by the way is not what your prime minister has indicated that he wants, that may the the policy of RTÉ but that is not what you wanted, I don’t believe that is in the interests of Ireland. And more importantly, I don’t believe for one second that that is what will happen.”
Johnson also denied that he wanted to see the UK exit the EU without a deal, saying that he wanted a “worked out Canada-style trade deal”.
He described the option proposed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May as a “terrible deal” and reiterated that he would vote against it on Tuesday.

Before Brexit, Irish citizens living in the UK could vote in the EU elections in their British constituencies – to vote in their Irish constituency they would have still needed to travel home.
Because of Brexit, Irish citizens will now need to travel home to vote.
The ‘home-to-vote’ right also expires after 18 months of non-residency, after which Irish citizens living abroad can’t take part in any elections in Ireland.
However, post-Brexit Irish citizens will still retain the right to vote in Westminster and local elections the same way British citizens may vote in Dáil and county council elections but are excluded from constitutional referenda here.
Political commentators and analysts have speculated that if there is an extension of Article 50, that the UK could take part in the European elections. Ukip founder Nigel Farage has already said that he will run as a Brexit Party MEP candidate if this were to happen.

If Article 50 is extended, the maximum date they could extend it to would be 1 July, as this is the time by which MEPs take their seats for the new European Parliament term.
The European Parliament is encouraging citizens in its 27 remaining EU member states to get involved in its elections and increase voter participation in the wake of Brexit.
In the 2014 European elections, 52.4% of the Irish electorate voted, compared with the EU average of 42.6%. Just 21.4% of young Irish electorate voted however, which is lower than the EU average of 27.8%.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, the Department of Housing, Government and Local Elections said that every Irish adult citizen resident in an EU state and registered to vote is entitled to vote in the European Parliament elections in Ireland.
Irish citizens living in an EU can also vote in the European elections in that country; but cannot vote in more than one constituency or country.
“In general, Irish citizens resident outside the State do not have an entitlement to vote in the European Parliament elections held in Ireland.”
The Department of Housing and Local Government has said that while the Department would encourage people to vote in the European elections, “no specific campaign proposals are envisaged”.
The Department has an annual voter registration week in November when people are encouraged to check the register to ensure that they can vote in all elections for which they are eligible, it said in a statement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/geoffrey-cox-codpiece-4529643-Mar2019/,"BRITISH ATTORNEY GENERAL Geoffrey Cox has reportedly claimed that the Irish backstop posed a threat to the human rights of citizens in Northern Ireland.
He’s faced a bit of backlash for his remarks,reports The Guardian, including from a woman who is challenging the UK Home Office over its treatment of Northern Irish citizens.
“Hearing Geoffrey Cox attempt to argue the backstop would breach human rights in Northern Ireland has me speechless,” Emma DeSouza saidon Twitter.
“What the UK puts Northern-Irish born Irish citizens through is a breach of rights and the Good Friday Agreement.”
It’s been argued that the backstop breaches the Good Friday Agreement, as if checks were placed along the Irish Sea, it would mean changing the relationship between Northern Ireland and the UK. On that same basis, however, Brexit itself could be argued as a breach of the Good Friday Agreement, as the relationship between Northern Ireland and Ireland will probably change.
In this case, it’s reported that Cox argued the backstop contravened Northern Irish citizens’ human rights, as it would leave them within the European Union but with no representation in the European Parliament.

Cox’s codpiece
Earlier today in the House of Commons, Cox answered questions on the progress that had been made during negotiations with the EU. He was asked if it was still the plan to change the backstop, and add a codicil, or additional note, to the Irish backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement.
“It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop which will cause me to review and change my advice. That is government policy, that is the discussions we are having.”
Cox’s advice on the backstop in its current form caused quite a stir. MPs spent days in December calling for it to be published, which it eventually was, and made quite a splash when it landed.
The Attorney General’s legal advice confirmed that the backstop would “endure indefinitely” and would mean that there will be more customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain than there are currently.
Cox says that there are parts of the deal that contradict each other, meaning that it’s not clear whether the backstop is temporary.
It’s this advice that has led Brexiteer MPs to criticise the backstop, and call for changes such as placing a time-limit on it or allowing the UK to withdraw from it without needing the approval of the EU.
Cox has been attending talks in Brussels this week in the hope of finding this codicil, that would mean he can change his legal advice without changing the essence of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Speaking to the House of Commons about the codicil, Cox playfully said:
During a separate bout of questioning, Cox also committed to publishing his next bout of legal advice, too: “I shall publish my legal opinion on any document that is produced and negotiated with the EU.”

BREXITEERS BORIS JOHNSON, Jacob Rees Mogg, and the DUP’s Sammy Wilson have all clarified their positions on Brexit in three separate opinion pieces today.
Johnson and Rees Mogg published pieces this evening stating their positions, with Rees Mogg saying he could be persuaded to vote for Theresa May’s twice-defeated deal if the DUP opted for it.
Wilson wrote this morning that he won’t support Theresa May’s Brexit deal, preferring instead a year-long extension to the Brexit process.
He later clarified that he wasn’t giving the party’s stance.
Johnson, meanwhile, was speaking at an event organised by the Daily Telegraph. In a subsequent opinion piece, he advocated for a no-deal Brexit, saying that “there will be Mars bars, and there will be drinking water”.
During a Q&A session at the same event, the Telegraph’s chief political correspondent tweeted out thatJohnson stated, “There is nothing anti-European about Brexit”.

The DUP and Rees-Mogg
In an opinion piece forthe Daily Telegraph, Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesperson,  wrote that “the Withdrawal Agreement itself means no Brexit”.
“It ensures that the EU has the legal power to prevent us ever leaving except on their draconian terms, which would include a Customs Union and adherence to EU regulations,” he wrote.
Despite representing his party’s views on Brexit, the party later clarified to British media organisations that this was not the party’s view.
Wilson went on to say that he’d prefer an extension:
“Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of Michel Barnier.”
Earlier, ERG member and Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg softened his stance. Although he previously said that he would support May’s deal if the DUP approved of it, he moved even closer to the Withdrawal Agreement again today.
Speaking on the Conservative home podcast, Rees-Mogg said that “Mrs May’s deal is better than not leaving at all”.
Writing inthe Mail Online this evening, he then elaborated on those comments, saying what he had stated earlier, that he is “now willing to support it if the Democratic Unionist Party does”, and apologising for “changing his mind”.
Speculation is rife that May will hold a third Meaningful Vote on Friday; indicative votes on what parliament thinks should happen next with the Brexit process is due to take place tomorrow, though the details aren’t finalised.

https://www.thejournal.ie/president-michael-d-higgins-european-union-criticism-4566463-Mar2019/,"PRESIDENT MICHAEL D HIGGINS criticised the European Union for a lack of “social cohesion” and “narrow version of an economic union” in a speech delivered at UCD last night.
His comments came on the eve of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s third attempt to secure the backing of MPs in the House of Commons for her deal to remove Britain from the European Union.
Higgins called for “a new mind for Europe… to strike a unique balance between social cohesion, economic competition and freedom” and to remove the divide he said existed between the “lucky” and the “left out”.
“We have entered a period when, I would say – and not for the first time in many years – the future shape of the European Union has become a matter of dispute and often ill-tempered debate,” he said.
“In the ongoing and lingering shadow of Brexit and of social forces which have given rise to so much doubt across Europe, the challenges of the next decade simply cannot be met with a re-issuing of an invitation to a new generation of, and revamped version, of the old orthodoxies.”
In his speech at the launch of the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at UCD, the president said a social, economic and class divide was palpable across Europe.

“A new mind for Europe is required, which requires a casting aside of failing assumptions within inadequate models. It requires new symmetries between the social, the economic, the cultural and the ethical,” he added.
“These symmetries, if they are to be achieved, will require changes in the institutional architecture of the Union.
“Yet, if the intellectual and political contribution of the union’s members is simply one of reaction and adjustment to a wild unregulated globalisation, the prospects for such are poor.
Jean Monnet is considered one of the founding fathers of the European Union and the various centres of excellence across the EU are designed to foster integration and cooperation between member states.
Higgins said a return to the founding values of the union – mainly peace and economic prosperity among member states – was needed, and called for a fresh approach to reinforce those pillars.
“Too often, as we look to the future, we fail to adequately appreciate the rich but diverse roots of the European project,” he said.
“As we seek to find a new mind for Europe, out of the ashes of our present threatening fragmentation, there is now a pressing need to recall the rich infusion of ideas and ideals upon which our Union was sought to be built.”

MPS HAVE VOTED against eight motions in the House of Commons in an attempt to indicate a majority for what type of Brexit they want, if they want one at all.
Among the suggestions that were rejected were leaving the EU without a deal, and revoking Article 50 to avoid a no deal.
At a glance, here’s how they voted (you can find more details about them further down):
The results are not binding – hence the indicative in ‘indicative votes’.
Speaker John Bercowpicked a wide range of motions to be votedand announced them this afternoon as the debate continued in Westminster.
MPs used ballot papers today, rather than the usual walking through the ‘aye’ or ‘no’ lobbies. It’s the first time Westminster has taken back control of proceedings from the British government in 140 years.
The Speaker has provisionally selected these options for#IndicativeVotes:(B)#NoDeal(D) Common market 2.0(H) EFTA and EEA(J) Customs Union(K) Labour's alternative plan(L) Revocation to avoid#NoDeal(M) Confirmatory public vote(O) Contingent preferential arrangementspic.twitter.com/xvXO4efsGg— UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons)March 27, 2019UK House of Commons/ Twitter

Speaking after the vote, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons that there was “no easy way forward” and it was “necessary to back the Withdrawal Agreement”.
1. No Deal
Option (B) was proposed by John Baron, a Conservative MP.
It reads:
Explaining the motion, Baron said:
“Exiting the EU, with or without a deal, is the default outcome of the Article 50 process. The Commons voted by a majority of 384 to trigger Article 50 in February 2017, so this is the one Brexit option Parliament has definitely chosen.”

2. Common Market 2.0
Option (D) was proposed by Nick Boles, also a Conservative MP.
It proposes joining the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and European Economic Area (EEA) and creating a ‘comprehensive customs arrangement’ which would continue until alternative arrangements could be made to ensure there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland.
3. Efta and EEA
Option (H) was proposed by George Eustice, again a Conservative MP.
It differs from Option (D) because it doesnotinclude a customs union. Part (d) of the motion reads:
Eustice, a Brexiteer, was the agriculture minister until earlier this month.
4. Customs Union
Option (J) was proposed by Ken Clarke, a Conservative but also an EU supporter.
It reads:
It has cross-party support having been backed by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, among others.
5. Labour’s alternative plan
Option (K) has been proposed by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader.
The motion, if passed, would require the government to negotiate changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. It wants ministers to secure a permanent customs union, as well as close alignment with the single market. It also looks for “commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation”.
The EU has said that the Withdrawal Agreement is not going to be re-drafted.

6. Revoking Article 50 to avoid a no-deal
Option (L) was proposed by Joanna Cherry of the Scottish National Party.

It reads:
“If, on the day before the end of the penultimate House of Commons sitting day before exit day, no Act of Parliament has been passed for the purposes of section 13(1)(d) of the Withdrawal Act, Her Majesty’s Government must immediately put a motion to the House asking it to approve ‘No Deal’ and, if the House does not give its approval, Her Majesty’s Government must ensure that the notice given to the European Council under Article 50, of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the European Union, is revoked in accordance with United Kingdom and European Union law.”
This motion also has cross-party support with signatures from prominent Conservative Dominic Grieve, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and all 11 members of the Independent Group.
7. Confirmatory public vote
Option (M) was proposed by Margaret Beckett, former foreign secretary and Labour MP.
It reads:
It calls for a referendum on any deal that is passed in the House of Commons.
8. Contingent Preferential Arrangements
Option (O) was proposed by Marcus Fyst, a Conservative Party Brexiteer.
Its first part reads:
It also recommends a two-year “standstill” from the leave date for any possible changes to standards to ensure compliance by the UK to EU legislation it had agreed to while a member.
What next then?
If there is an obvious answer to what parliament wants to do about Brexit come 10pm, it is important to remember that parliament remains in control of its agenda on Monday.
On that day – 1 April – MPs could force the government to adopt its proposal.
If May’s Withdrawal Agreement has not been voted on and passed by that day, there is then 11 days until the UK leaves the European Union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-brexit-extension-4550531-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Mar 2019
TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said there is a lot is concern among EU member states about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50, as the British Prime Minister Theresa May is on the cusp of asking to delay the date by which Brexit must happen, currently set for 29 March.
His comments come after the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that EU member states should prepare for a no-deal Brexit.
If MPs vote for Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal this week, May said that she would ask for an extension to Article 50, and delay the Brexit date by three months until 30 June.
But to do this, the UK must get the permission of the EU’s 27 countries. EU leaders have said previously that without a clear reason for leaving, the request to push that date out wouldn’t be likely to be accepted by the EU.
Speaking after Cabinet this evening, Coveney said that “there is a lot of concern among EU member states and partners about the prospect of a long extension to Article 50″.
“The disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months or another whatever period of time is something that I think people will need convincing on,” Coveney said.
He said that if there is a request for a long extension, “there will need to be a very persuasive plan” to go with that which would explain why that’s needed and how the UK will use the time to “conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been able to be agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process”.
Coveney also said it has been “very clear” that there is “absolutely no appetite” to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement” from the EU.
Making similar comments ata press conference today, Barnier said: “EU leaders will need a concrete plan from the UK in order to be able to make an informed decision.”
He added that the “key questions” for the EU would be:

He added that the political declaration could be made “more ambitious” if a majority in the House of Commons wanted that.
If the reason for an extension is neither of the above, Barnier asked what the purpose would be: “…How can we ensure that, at the end of a possible extension, we are not back in the same situation as today?”
Coveney also warned that “it’s important that the British government gets the message from EU countries that while … there is an openness to an extension of Article 50 that EU leaders will be demanding in the context of a persuasive plan to accompany that extension”.
He said this is to ensure “we can all move forward with some confidence that the outstanding issues relating to the Brexit process can be resolved”.
Barnier said that the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of the EU’s 27 countries and is due to convene this Thursday and Friday, will need to assess what is in the best interest of the EU.
“Voting against a no-deal does not prevent it from happening,” he continued, adding that it was “for the British government to decide what the UK wants to do next”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with European Council President Donald Tusk at Government Buildings in Dublin this morning; meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney is in Brussels and has held meetings with UK Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Michel Barnier, among others.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nhs-hit-in-all-brexit-scenarios-4512133-Feb2019/,"NO MATTER WHAT Brexit we get, the UK’s health service – the NHS – will be negatively affected, according to a health policy review published in The Lancet.
The review says that a no-deal Brexit is the worst scenario for the health service, impacting the workforce, financing, availability of medicines and vaccines, sharing of information and medical research.
The authors also warned that there’s “little evidence” that the UK is prepared for any of the eventualities set out in their analysis, which include a no-deal Brexit and British PM Theresa May’s rejected Withdrawal Agreement.
For instance, the recently published NHS 10-year plan is 136-pages long, with only two mentions of Brexit, neither of which offered any detail on how any threats would be handled.
The four scenarios analysed are ano-deal Brexit; the Withdrawal Agreement; the Irish backstop; and the political declaration, which outlines what a future UK-EU trade agreement could look like.
While the review says that Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement offers “a more positive” scenario compared to a no-deal Brexit, there are still concerns about the longterm negative impact any Brexit could have on the NHS.
Under either the backstop or political-declaration scenarios, the impact of Brexit on the NHS is onlyslightly lessharmful than a no-deal, though the exact impacts vary and are based on current UK and EU documents available to the study’s authors.
What are the problems?
In this new analysis, leading experts in public health and law assessed the likely impact on 15 specific aspects of the UK health service to try to predict the effect Brexit would have on those crucial services.
A caveat for this lies with every Brexit analysis: this that is based on what is the current situation – which, as we know by know, is subject to change from day to day.
Among the problems exacerbated by Brexit is therecruitment and retentionof healthcare workers, according to the review. The Withdrawal Agreement provides for mutual recognition of professional qualifications up to 2020, the end of the transition period.
But no provisions for healthcare workers have been made in the backstop or political declaration, which could follow after that (the transition period would run from 29 March until 31 December 2020, although it can be extended beyond that).
Under a no-deal Brexit, the Immigration White Paper proposes a minimum salary threshold of £30,000 per year which could seriously limit immigration of many health workers to the UK.
Under the Withdrawal Agreement, reciprocalhealthcare arrangements(eg, via the European Health Insurance Card) would remain but only until 2020 as there is no mechanism to continue them subsequently, although some limited bilateral agreements may be possible eventually.

For example last week, the Irish government provided legislation in itsomnibus Brexit bill, will allow for Common Travel Area healthcare arrangements so that patients in the North can access healthcare services in Dublin, and vice versa.
But in continental Europe, all reciprocal health care arrangements would cease in 2019 under a no-deal scenario. This would be particularly harmful to older UK residents and people with pre-existing conditions for whom health insurance cover in the EU would be particularly expensive.
As one of the largest areas of public expenditure, any negative impact in the UK economy will put additional pressure on NHSfinancing, and the UK has already seen a slower rate of economic growth than if it had remained in the EU.
In the build up to the 2016 Brexit vote, it was claimed that if the UK left the EU, that fees being paid into the European Union pot would be redirected to the NHS. A slogan on the side of a bus claimed that an extra £350 million a year would go to the NHS; Ukip founder and Brexiteer NIgel Farage clarified that this wasn’t possible after the referendum result was announced.
The review emphasised that the suggestion that Brexit will bring a “deal dividend” was described as not credible by the Treasury Select Committee. Given looming crises in several other sectors, including welfare and the criminal justice system, the authors note that concerns about whether the government can maintain its funding commitments for the NHS are warranted.
Under the Withdrawal Agreement, the continuity oflegal provisionswill secure supply chains for medicines, vaccines, medical devices and equipment until 2020. Under a no-deal Brexit, the absence of a legal framework for imports and exports would have an immediate and drastic effect on supply chains.
Despite government reassurance of contingency plans in place,shortages are likelybecause stockpiling arrangements can’t last more than a few weeks, proposals that doctors offer “best alternative medication” can be distressing for patients, and some products can’t be stockpiled.
Brexit has also drained the energy of theBritish civil service, as government and the House of Commons is required to pass several major pieces of legislation and up to 600 statutory instruments within a month. Meanwhile important legislation, such as social care, has suffered prolonged delays.
Under any form of Brexit, the UK will no longer be part of theEuropean Medicines Agency, and while the UK’s Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency will continue to licence medicines, without laws in place to secure regulatory alignment, the UK would become less attractive for global pharma to launch new medicines, potentially meaning launch dates up to 24 months later.
Additionally, UK laws on air pollution, workplace health and safety, and tobacco trade derive from EU law. With the UK having failed to meet standards on air quality, there is concern that the UK might use Brexit toroll backsome of these measures.
Author’s analysis
Professor Martin McKee, co-author from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that some people “will dismiss our analysis as Project Fear”.
“But with just over a month to go to Brexit, we need to move beyond slogans. We have set out the problems in detail, based on the best available evidence.
Professor Tamara Hervey, co-author from the School of Law, University of Sheffield said that it was “critical to be clear about the practical effects of disentangling over 40 years of legal integration”.
Dr Nick Fahy, co-author from the Department of Primary Care, University of Oxford, said that the “NHS is at the heart of our national life; it is vital to understand the impact Brexit will have on it”.
The authors note that their analysis is based on the most up-to-date available legal texts, but is inherently limited by the lack of transparency about the British government’s preparations, the lack of detail in the political declaration, and the unprecedented nature of a member state leaving the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/independent-group-commons-4499533-Feb2019/,"Chuka Umunna MP made that plea this morning as he and six other MPsconfirmed they were leaving the Labour partyto form a new political grouping.
Not a political party mind, but a parliamentary grouping that will be known as The Independent Group.
Smaller independent party groupings may be the norm in the Dáil, includingthe one that’s part of the government, but in the UK’s parliamentary system they’re rare and today’s move was a big deal.
Not least because the threat of a split in the Labour party has been in the offing since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015.
Now though, with Brexit less than six weeks ago, the move has finally been made.
Teasing the media before the announcement, the group of seven said they were planning an event “relating to the future of British politics”.
But will they have any impact beyond today? And what will it mean for Brexit?
In their words, the MPs say their main motivation in leaving Labour was because their party has changed radically from the one they joined.
Luciana Berger said that she had become“embarrassed and ashamed” to be in the party.
But each said the new group is about more than just Labour and that the entire British political system needs overhauling. Umanna said what is being witnessed is “the dysfunctional state of British politics”.
Angela Smith MP said that there were “millions of people who are politically homeless” and who are “begging for an alternative.”

So as part of that conclusion, The Independent Group has said that it will work with disillusioned supporters and members from both Labour and other parties.
“We’ve taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too. You might come from a Labour background, but you might come from other political traditions,” Umanna told reporters.
Asked whether they were seeking to create a wider movement, the MPs were reluctant to put that label on it, pointing only to aset of values on the group’s website.
Some in the Labour leadership have said that if the MPs wish to leave the party they should also quit their seats and run in a by-election, giving voters the chance to judge them as independents.
Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said they should do the “honourable thing” and resign as MPs.
The Independent Group members have resisted this, with Chris Leslie arguing that his views have not changed, only that of his party, and that a result a by-election would be “a total distraction”.
“What happened, as in my case, is my views has stayed the same but my party has veered off in a hard left ideological direction,” Leslie told Sky News.
Speaking later in that same interview about how he will vote in the Commons, Leslie said he would not vote to facilitate any Brexit he feels would be harmful to the British economy.
This, is not necessarily the view of the The Independent Group as a whole with Umanna telling reporters that they will not always be voting collectively.
“We will see how we will vote on a variety of things depending on our values and we are independent by the way, so it might be that we have different views on different things,” he said.
Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May suffered another defeat in the House of Commons, losing a symbolic vote on her government’s plans to secure a new withdrawal deal.
Themargin in that vote was 303 to 258, displaying the numerical problems faced by May in parliament.
The new Independent Group won’t make too much of a difference to those figures, but if there is a general election Labour may just have got some more ground to make up.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-confidence-what-happens-4443008-Jan2019/,"CONFIDENCE MOTIONS IN the government roll along every few years in Ireland – but across the water they’re a little rarer.
The last time a UK Prime Minister faced one was back in the 1990s. John Major was triumphant that time, and Theresa May’s expected to battle through this evening too – although, as one Westminster political commentator noted this morning, it would only take a handful of Tory MPs to decide to go for an early dinner to put the result at risk.
In the wake of last night's defeat May was back on her feet this afternoon for Prime Minister's Questions.House of Commons / PA Wire/PA ImagesHouse of Commons / PA Wire/PA Images / PA Wire/PA Images
So how will it play out?
Today’s vote was called by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and had been widely expected following the government’sthumping defeaton Brexit last night.
The main vote happens at 7pm and the rest of the day’s proceedings at the House of Commons are being given over to the debate on the motion.
Brexiteer MPs in the Conservative Party – the group who used to be known, a little optimistically as ‘Eurosceptics’ – may not be too keen on Theresa May but it almost goes without saying they’re even less keen on Jeremy Corbyn and Labour so the Prime Minister should be able to rely on their support tonight.
Similarly the DUP were forceful in their opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement struck between May’s government and the EU – but the unionist party’s 10 MPs have also signalled they will support her tonight.
As DUP leader Arlene Foster put it last night:
Currently the Conservatives have 316 votes in the chamber, with 320 needed for a majority – meaning the support of the DUP is needed to nudge them over the line.

But what if May lost?
Under the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, losing a confidence motion begins a two-week process that could end in fresh elections.
If the vote is lost, the government has 14 days to regain the confidence of the House of Commons – majority support – confirmed by the passing of a motion to that effect.
If it cannot regain that confidence, then theoretically, Corbyn himself could seek to build a coalition with other opposition parties like the SNP and the Liberal Democrats to take office.
In the event that no alternative government can be formed from the current composition of the house, parliament is automatically dissolved and elections called.

What’s Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy?
The Labour leader has stepped up his calls for a general election in recent weeks, saying it’s necessary to “break the deadlock” over Brexit.
In interviews and contributions to the House of Commons, he’s been insisting a new government would have a fresh mandate to negotiate a better deal with the EU.
But because his no confidence bid is, as things stand, looking unlikely to succeed campaigners looking for a second referendum are likely to step up pressure on the Labour leadership.

Delegates at the Labour conference voted last September to support “all options remaining on the table” on Brexit, including campaigning for a second vote if Theresa May’s government was unable to get a final deal through parliament.
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell, a Corbyn ally, and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer had both publicly pressured Corbyn on whether or not to rule out another referendum on Britain’s EU membership.
Corbyn had said he would respect the decision of members at the conference.

How does May plan to proceed?
Reading a prepared statement in the wake of last night’s hammering, May told MPs they had registered what they were opposed to, but that they now needed to set out what they were for.
She said she would begin cross-party talks on what should happen next, although she’s already facing criticism this morning for not including Corbyn in that effort.
Without a withdrawal agreement, Britain leaves the European Union in under 1,750 hours, at midnight on 29 March.
There’s now consensus in Brussels that the deadline will now be extended, but not beyond the end of June, when a new European parliament will take its seats.
As for how the EU will respond to further entreaties from the embattled British leader – Peter Kellner, visiting scholar at Carnegie Brussels and former head of polling firm YouGov, told AFP that EU negotiators should adopt “tough love tactics”.
“The issue next week or the one after will be what happens when it becomes clear that Theresa May cannot get anything like what she wants through parliament.
“One of two things will happen: Either she will change her position radically or, if she doesn’t, parliament will take control and parliament will impose a radical change.
Last night's result left the EU ""fearing more than ever that there is a risk"" of a cliff-edge departure, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said today in Strasbourg.Jean-Francois BadiasJean-Francois Badias
How long has it been since a UK government lost a confidence vote?
Since 1900 there have been only three occasions when a government has lost a vote of confidence – twice in 1924 and once in 1979.
In the last such vote, the Labour government of Jim Callaghan lost the opposition motion by just one vote.
Margaret Thatcher swept to power in the ensuing general election and the Conservatives remained in office for 18 years.
Callaghan immediately called an election that time. This time around, due to the Fixed Term Parliament Act, May wouldn’t have the power to do that by herself – she’d need the support of two-thirds of MPs.
The last time a confidence motion was formally tabled in the Commons was in 1993. Then, too, it was due to a row over Europe.
John Major’s government tabled the motion of confidence following its defeat in a vote on the Maastricht Treaty which turned the European Economic Community into the European Community.
He won the motion by 339 to 299, shoring up his position.

AFTER LOSING A vote in parliament on Monday, Theresa May’s hopes to get her withdrawal agreement somehow passed by the House of Commons suffered another blow.
In a Tory meeting this afternoon, she tried to do this by offering to quit if MPs agreed to pass her deal on Friday, saying that ”she would not remain in post for the next phase of the negotiations,” according to one MP at the meeting.
She made the offer an hour before MPs were due to debate a series of options as to how the UK should progress with Brexit – including entering a customs’ union, crashing out without a deal or holding a second referendum.
Join us throughout the day as we cover all the goings on in Westminster as MPs “take control” of the Brexit process.

So, just to set the scene.
On Monday, MPs votedto give themselves greater control of the Brexit process, as it enters its potential endgame.
Indicative votes differ from Theresa May’s previous meaningful votes on Brexit.
In those cases, there were two options on the table – to accept or reject the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement.
This time there’ll be plenty of options for MPs to decide upon.
While Prime Minister May is not obliged to follow the will of parliament today, the pressure on her to do so if MPs finally agree onsomethingwill be intense.
MPs will today have the chance to vote on various options such as revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit, holding another referendum, a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leaving the European Union without a deal.
Of course, there remains the possibility that there won’t be a majority for any one option.
May herself has said she is “sceptical” about the process and that similar efforts in the past “produced contradictory outcomes or no outcomes at all”.
Time is of the essence though, with the UK running out of time to decide on what kind of Brexit it wants, whether it wants to delay it or ditch it altogether.
At last week’s European summit, EU leaders agreed to delay the day of Britain’s departure from the bloc by three weeks until 12 April, while Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to ratify her withdrawal agreement.
May still believes she has a chance of getting her withdrawal agreement through – at the third time of asking –with a softening in stance from hardened Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogga positive for the Prime Minister.
Despite that, the DUP has so far remained steadfast in its opposition to May’s deal.
The outcome of today’s votes could potentially have a huge say in what happens over the coming weeks.

Before the debate, we had Prime Minister’s Questions with May from midday.
On the important issue of the indicative votes later today, she said… a whole load of nothing.
Trading barbs with Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn and the Scottish National Party’s Ian Blackford, May repeated the mantra that her deal would deliver on the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.
One notable point, however, was put to her by Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen.
He said most of his constituents voted for Brexit, and would “never trust the Prime Minister again” after she reneged on her promise for the UK to leave the EU on the original set date of 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tony-blair-brexit-northern-ireland-4486645-Feb2019/,"TONY BLAIR HAS said a no-deal Brexit could lead to “devastating” consequences for the peace process in Northern Ireland.
In an interview Sky News’Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the former British prime minister and Labour leader said a no-deal Brexit would see the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.

“No one could responsibly propose [a no-deal Brexit]. It would be economically very, very dangerous for Britain and for the peace process in Northern Ireland, it would potentially be devastating.
Blair, who helped negotiate the Good Friday Agreement in the 1990s, accused some politicians of “playing fast and loose” with the peace process.
“There are people who cheerfully say you can put the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in a completely different relationship with Europe, in trading terms, and it makes no difference to the economy of Northern Ireland – I don’t know on what basis they would possibly say that,” he said.
Second referendum
Blair has called for a second Brexit referendum to be held now voters are aware of the deal on the table.
He said people must decide which type of Brexit they want – the “soft” option being proposed by current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn or the “hard” alternative being put forward by Brexiteers such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
“You’ve got to decide which of those Brexits you want before we leave. Otherwise, we’re going to leave without clarity.”
Blair said leaving the European Union without clarity would mean “no closure” for Britain, leading to prolonged arguments over the issue long after the official withdrawal.

“By then you’ll have left paid your money up front and you’ll have given up your negotiating leverage.
“For the country to do that, as Theresa May wants to do – to leave without knowing what Brexit you get – this would be, in my view, an incredibly foolish thing for the country to do,” he stated.
‘An absolute horror’
Speaking in Belfastlast week, May said undoing any of the progress made in Northern Ireland in recent years would be “an absolute horror”.
She said the British government remains committed to the Good Friday Agreement and against a hard border returning between the North and the Republic.
May noted that people living in Northern Ireland and the Republic are understandably “anxious” about Brexit as it is there many of the effects will be most keenly felt.
She is struggling to get a Brexit deal over the line. The draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the EU was rejected by the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 last month.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deak, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of 29 March.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said the British government may seek an extension to Article 50 in a bid to secure a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/facebook-fake-news-uk-government-4498818-Feb2019/,"FACEBOOK INTENTIONALLY AND knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws, according to a new report from the UK government.
The social media giant and its executives were referred to as “digital gangsters” in the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee’s report.
The documentwas released today after an 18-month investigation into fake news and Facebook’s privacy practices.
“Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,” the report states.
The investigation was launched in 2017 amid growing concerns about the influence of false information and its ability to spread on social media, potentially impacting elections.
In March 2018, the Observer, the New York Times and Channel 4 revealed that Cambridge Analytica had secretly acquired data harvested fromtens of millionsof Facebook users’ profiles.
The firm, best known for its work on Donald Trump’s US presidential election campaign, sold the data to political clients and used it design software to predict and influence voters’ choices at the ballot box.
Up to87 million peoplewere affected by the data breach, the largest in Facebook’s history. Cambridge Analytica has since collapsed into administration.
The report has called for the following:
‘Democracy is at risk’
Speaking about the investigation, Damian Collins, MP and chair of the DCMS committee, said “three big threats to our society” were identified.
“Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised ‘dark adverts’ from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use everyday. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.
“The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.
“These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the ‘move fast and break things’ culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission.”
Collins said “a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people” is needed, adding: “The age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.”
He said the inquiry also found that electoral regulations in the UK are “hopelessly out of date for the internet age” and need to be reformed.

Zuckerberg still ‘ducking questions’
Collins stated that if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg “doesn’t believe he is accountable to the UK Parliament, he is to the billions of Facebook users across the world”.
Zuckerberg “still has questions to answer yet he’s continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don’t have the right information”.
“[He] continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world’s biggest companies,” Collins added.
Russian disinformation and Brexit
The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook in written correspondence and oral evidence about Russian activity on Facebook and knowledge of Russian advertisements that ran during the presidential election in America in 2016.
The New York Times reported in November 2018 that Facebook had discovered Russian-linked activity on its site in 2016, attempting to disrupt the US election.
MPs have concluded that two senior executives from Facebook who appeared as witnesses left them with the impression they had “deliberately misled the committee or they were deliberately not briefed by senior executives at Facebook, about the extent of Russian interference in foreign elections”.
The report calls on the UK government to make a statement about how many investigations are currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics. It notes that MPs want to find out what impact this may have had on previous British elections and the Brexit referendum in 2016.
Hefty fines
The report repeats a number of recommendations from the committee interim report published last summer. It calls for the government to reconsider a number of recommendations to which it did not respond and to include concrete proposals for action in its forthcoming White Paper on online harms.
The document recommends that clear legal liabilities be established for tech companies to act against harmful or illegal content on their sites, and calls for a compulsory Code of Ethics defining what constitutes harmful content.
An independent regulator should be responsible for monitoring tech companies, backed by statutory powers to launch legal action against companies in breach of the code. Companies failing obligations on harmful or illegal content should face hefty fines, the report states.
It repeats its recommendation for new independent regulation to be funded by a levy on tech companies operating in the UK.
Abusive content
Responding to the report, Facebook said it was “pleased to have made a significant contribution” to the committee’s investigation by answering over 700 questions.
“We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform,” said Karim Palant, the company’s UK public policy manager, said in a statement.
Palant said Facebook supports privacy legislation and has made recent changes in this regard, stating: “While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago.”
He added that Facebook has increased its team working on abusive content to 30,000 people and “invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse”.

Video by Nicky Ryan
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he has no objection to the prospect of Irish farmers diversifying and growing cannabis in the future.
In a wide-ranging interview withTheJournal.ie, where Varadkardiscussed John Delaney, Brexit, Peter Casey and the European elections, the Taoiseach said in light of Brexit, supports for the exposed beef sector are needed, in order to reorientate them towards new markets and new businesses.
Health Minister Simon Harrisacknowledgedthat the “lack of availability of cannabis products in Ireland remains the most critical barrier to full implementation” of themedicinal access scheme.
The health minister supported the idea of Irish farmers growing the drug, stating that it ”could be an opportunity for Irish farmers in due course”.
In December, theIrish Farmer’s Association toldTheJournal.iethat it is open to meeting the health minister to discuss the possibility of farmers growing cannabis for medicinal use.
Medicinal cannabis market
Today, beef farmers and those in the sector will attend the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee. Could cannabis be that market?
“I am not an expert in the cultivation of cannabis – medicinal or otherwise – so I am not sure how well it would grow in Ireland,” said the Taoiseach.
“It is the case in Ireland that medicinal cannabis is legal. Now getting a licence from the minister is complicated and we are trying to improve that, but at the moment it is not possible to grow it so it has to be imported. Many have to go to the Netherlands to pharmacies to get it there,” he added.
After two years of delays, the Department of Health has identified a supplier in Denmark, confirmed Varadkar.
“From a whole common sense point of view if something is legal in Ireland – and it is, with a prescription – why import from the Netherlands or Denmark when we could grow it here? So it is nothing that I have an objection to, but I am not sure if it is a viable alternative for many farmers. I am not sure how much would actually be needed because there is only a relatively small number of patients who currently have a licence or would benefit from it,” he added.
Everyone has abit of a breather from Brexit, with the exit date being kicked out six months.
A second Brexit referendum?
But talk of a second Brexit referendum has resurfaced.
A second referendum is needed, according to former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who both made a case for it in ajoint op-ed at the weekend.
Would Taoiseach support such a move?
He toldTheJournal.iethat it would be most “unhelpful” for him to talk about such a move, stating that it would only spur on the “extreme Brexiteer elements” into saying that Ireland was just another European country trying to tell the British people what to do.
“‘Isn’t this why we’re leaving?’” – that’s what they would say, according to Varadkar.
However, in the same breath he said, if Westminster wanted to, it could hold another referendum, stating that parliament is “supreme”.

“They do have the authority to have a second referendum if they so wish,” he said.
“I’m pro-European, I would love to see the United Kingdom stay in the European Union. Europe is their home, and Europe is stronger with Britain in it, and if they made the decision to stay then I’d welcome them with open arms, it would be the prodigal son returning.”
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
While Bertie and Blair felt“duty-bound” to write the op-ed on their thoughts on the current Brexit situation, Varadkar is careful not to rock the boat, but he is a bit more optimistic.
“I suppose I am more optimistic – you go through different periods of optimism and pessimism – one thing I am optimistic about is I think is no-deal, even though I do think it is a possibility and could happen by accident, is increasingly unlikely,” he said.
Some form of a customs union could be the answer to everyone’s problems, he added.
When asked if it is a realistic proposition, he said:
I do. But I think it is something the British government have to want and ask for. If you reduce it to some very simple terms. What is a customs union? It means that the UK will still have free trade with all of the European Union including Ireland without any tariffs, without any quotas, without the need for any rules or regulations around rules of origin, that would be very good for us, because it helps solve some of the border issues, makes sections of the backstop unnecessary and then you would have something that is very valuable for our farmers, who would continue to have access to the British market.
So I think it would be a good thing if they were to stay in the EU customs union or negotiate a new customs union with the EU, but again that is something they would have to want.
‘If only the House of Commons could do the same’
Despite France’s Emmanuel Macron’s objections to a long extension, one was granted to the UK. Did Varadkar help convince him to change his mind.
“No, quite frankly there was a difference of opinion. Macron favouring a shorter extension, us favouring a longer one and we came up with a compromise, that is how the EU works, it is also why it works. It is interesting that 27 countries can come to a compromise in a few hours. If only the House of Commons could do the same in a few months,” he said with a smile on his face.
Before German Chancellor Angela Merkelpaid a visit to Ireland, there was rumours the time-limited backstop was back on the table. The Taoiseach said it is not.
While Varadkar is careful to be sensitive to matters across the water when it comes for calls for a second referendum, he also doesn’t think now is the time for discussions about a united Ireland.
He believes it would come down to sectarian lines of “Catholics versus Protestants, nationalists versus unionists”, and in his opinion, a border poll would be lost if held now.
“To do something that would be divisive and then have it defeated I don’t see what would be achieved by it,” he said. He denied that Fine Gael was distancing itself from its slogan: “the united Ireland party”.
“We do believe in a united Ireland, but we want that to be done by consent.”
A vote for Mick and Clare?
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
One vote that will be taking place this year is the European elections. The candidates submitted their papers today, and it is an interesting bunch. It includes former presidential candidate, Peter Casey, who had strong words for the Taoiseach during the campaign, and vice versa.
What does the Taoiseach make of Casey’s bid for Europe?
I see Peter Casey is interested in joining the EPP group, which is Fine Gael’s group in the European Parliament, and it is the biggest most influential group, so it does make sense to be in it, although I had thought he wanted to be the leader of Fianna Fáil a few weeks ago…
Would Casey be welcome in the EPP? Varadkar had reservations:
He would have to sign up to the values of the EPP which I am not sure he would be able to. But like I say,having wanted to be leader of Fianna Fáil a few months ago, I am not sure, he might change his mind in a few months time.
There are a couple who might get a vote from Leo, and they are not in his own party – Independents 4 Change Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.
“They are serious politicians. I don’t agree with them on everything but I agree with them on more things than people may believe,” said Varadkar, adding:
“We don’t necessarily agree, but both he [Mick Wallace] and Clare [Daly] have well-considered and well-informed views and I have always found them to be respectful. They are not the type of people to score points. They are serious people. Needless to say, while I am sure I would be giving them a preference, they will be well down the list after the Fine Gael candidates.”

The latest CSO numbers put GDP growth for 2018 at 6.7%, that is faster than China, and enough to make Ireland the fastest growing EU country for the fifth year running.
Nearly 1,000 jobs a week were added during 2018 to take the total number in work close to 2.3 million for the first time, while the number unemployed fell to its lowest level in a decade.
Workers are starting to feel it in their back pockets as the annual rate of growth in hourly earnings reached 3.8% in the final three months of 2018, the fastest since early 2009.
At the same time, consumer prices continue to increase at an annual rate of less than 1%, the lowest rate in the EU, so that higher incomes aren’t eaten up by higher cost goods and services.
Moreover, the number of people outside the labour force that could look for work again in the right conditions is still over 100,000, suggesting it still has room to run if factors beyond our control don’t get in the way.
But some indicators are flashing orange:The number of jobs being created slowed significantly from about 2,000 per week in the last three months of 2017 to about 640 per week in the same period last year.
The long-term trend in falling unemployment rates ended in August 2018, since when it has hovered around 5.6%.
House prices fell for three months in a row through January 2019, the first such hat-trick since prices bottomed out in early 2013.
In January 2018, consumer confidence hit its highest level since early 2001 but has since dropped like a stone, and last month hit its lowest level since 2014.
None of this is anything to panic about yet.

A slowdown in job growth and house prices was probably inevitable after years of break-neck growth. On the face of it, it is hard to explain why consumer confidence has fallen through the floor just as real wage growth picked up strongly.
But, one only needs to glance across the Irish Sea to see why people may fear the worst. Rising fears of a devastating hard Brexit towards the end of this month could help explain falls in both consumer confidence and house prices, with the latter reinforcing the former as homeowners feel less flush.
This week is the latest in a series of seemingly momentous weeks in the Brexit soap opera. Only a fool would predict with any confidence how it will all end.
It is always darkest before dawn, as the proverb goes, and it is the way of high-stakes negotiations to go to the wire.
That the current U.K. government stumbles into a nasty accident can’t be ruled out, but good sense must surely prevail at the last minute.
Agreement on a soft Brexit with a lengthy transition period, whether this month or later, would at least remove some uncertainty for Ireland and take the worst-case scenario off the table.
This alone could give Irish consumer confidence a shot in the arm and help stabilize house prices.
Businesses in the most Brexit-exposed sectors would be able to breathe a sigh of relief, and take another look at hiring and investment plans.
The U.S. is the most important export destination for Irish goods, and its economy is decelerating with fears rising of an outright recession in the next 18 months.
The Eurozone economy is back at crawl speed, with a few of its larger economies in, or close to, recession.
China is becoming an increasingly important export destination: it recorded its weakest year of economic growth in three decades in 2018 and is expected to slow further.
For an economy as open as Ireland’s, it is never good news when economic growth is slowing in your trade partners.
But, so long as they remain in ‘soft landing’ territory, and a ‘soft Brexit’ is eventually agreed, our glass should remain half full.

https://www.thejournal.ie/talks-brussels-malthouse-compromise-4478274-Feb2019/,"THERESA MAY HEADS back to Brussels tomorrow for yet more Brexit talks.
That’s after Leo Varadkar holds another round of meetings with EU leaders today.
As those Brussels meetings with the Taoiseach take place, the British prime minister will spend a second day in the North meeting representatives of the five main Stormont parties.
This latest round of meetings comes after May was given a mandate by the House of Commons last week to pursue an eleventh hour deal with the EU on the basis of the so-called ‘Malthouse Compromise’.
Attempting to build support for the strategy,May told business leadersin Belfast yesterday that she intended to secure a deal that “commands broad support” as well as backing from a majority of MPs.
So what is the Malthouse Compromise? Can it provide the basis of a Brexit breakthrough? And is anyone in Europe sounding optimistic about the latest incarnation of Britain’s Brexit plan?
Stefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
It becameapparent earlier this monththat the current incarnation of the border backstop had no chance of commanding a majority in the House of Commons, as the prime minister’s attempt to get her Withdrawal Agreement through was defeated by 230 votes.
Last November her cabinet had backed a revised version of the backstop that would see Northern Ireland aligned to some rules of the single market if alternative solutions could not be found by the end of the Brexit transition period in 2020.
That revised backstop plan, which would also effectively keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU until both parties no longer deemed it necessary, was roundly rejected by Brexiteer MPs and the DUP.
Critics of the plan feared it could leave the UK trapped in the arrangement for a prolonged period, leaving London unable to agree new trade deals with the rest of the world.
Protesters outside the House of Commons last week.David CliffDavid Cliff
Last week those Brexiteer MPs lent their support to a new amendment proposing replacing the Irish backstop with unspecified “alternative arrangements”, as the proposal gained the support of a majority of the House of Commons.
May said she would take this mandate back to Brussels and use it as a crowbar to try to reopen the sealed Withdrawal Agreement, which the EU has repeatedly said it would not do.
The prime minister has said she is now “engaging positively” with a series of proposals known as the Malthouse Compromise (we’ll get to the name later).
In simple terms, it would see the UK offer either the Plan A variation of a deal or a Plan B version.
The rights of EU citizens resident in the UK would be guaranteed in all circumstances, according to the plan.

Theresa May has said she wants to pursue a number of issues with the EU with a view to attaining progress on what to do about the border, including a “trusted trader” scheme to avoid physical checks on goods and “technological” solutions.
That’s because it is. Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis were touting a version of this labelled ‘max-fac’ last year.
As the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuennbergwrites:
The Malthouse Compromise is named after UK housing minister Kit Malthouse, the man responsible for getting high profile remainers and Brexiteers together in recent weeks to come up with the latest strategy.

An Alternative Arrangements Working Group of Tory MPs was formed after significant support emerged for the compromise deal.
A government spokesperson described the first meeting with that group,held earlier this week, as “detailed and constructive”.
The EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyandsaid last weekit seemed like ‘Groundhog Day’.
“We looked at every border on this earth, every border EU has with a third country – there’s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls.
Tánaiste Simon Coveneysaid at the weekendthat alternatives to the backstop remain “wishful thinking”.
“What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking and I think that’s a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish Government to be flexible on.

On Monday one of the European Union’s most senior officials warned that a no deal Brexit looked ever more likely after a meeting with members of the House of Commons Brexit steering committee.
“The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017,” Martin Selmayr, EU president Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, tweeted afterwards.
Selmayr cast doubt on whether a revised deal would pass the Commons even if May asks for and receives concessions.
“Asked whether any assurance would help to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were … inconclusive,” he tweeted.
On the EU side, nobody is considering this. Asked whether any assurance would help to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive ....

Earlier, the chairman of the Brexit committee, Labour’s Hilary Benn, had described the meeting as “useful”, but said there was no breakthrough.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced some optimism this week. Speaking in Japan she said: “From a political point of view, there is still time. Two months is not a long time but there is still time, and this should be used by all sides.”
The issue with the backstop, she said, was a “problem that is precisely defined and therefore one should be able to find a precisely defined solution”.
“But this solution depends on the question of what the future relationship between Britain and the EU will be like and what type of trade deal we sign with each other.”
Throwing the ball into London’s court, she stressed: “It will be very important for us to know what exactly the British side sees as its future relationship with the EU.”

Theresa May is set to meet with Stormont’s five main parties today as part of the latest bid to break the two year old impasse there.
Leo Varadkar will be in Brussels for meetings with Juncker, President of the European Council Donald Tusk, and other high-ranking officials.
“The Withdrawal Agreement is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal by the UK. We want the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible, so that the backstop will never be needed,” Varadkar said in a statement ahead of the talks.
“However, given the ongoing uncertainty in London, we are intensifying our planning for all scenarios, including a no-deal exit.

If there is no agreement made with the EU, the UK will be left vulnerable to “crucial delays” in receiving information on unsafe products.
Analysis from Which?found that there has been 34% more product safety alerts in 2018 compared to a decade ago, and said urgent reform is needed to regulations in the UK to equip itself to deal with unsafe products.

Recent examples it’s highlighted include dodgy carbon monoxide alarms, unsafe car seats and toxic toy slime, it said.
Other recall notices issued include a flammable children’s Star Wars stormtrooper outfit and a fire risk from certain HP laptop batteries.
Data shows that the highest number of alerts were issued about toys and motor vehicles last year, at 655 and 419 respectively.
Its director of advocacy Caroline Normand said: “With more products than ever before being declared unsafe, it’s clear that an already failing consumer enforcement system needs a major shake up to ensure that people aren’t left at risk from dangerous products in their homes.
Which? added that the UK government must be proactive now to ensure it is equipped to appropriately deal with safety standards by the time it leaves the EU.

TRANSPORT MINISTER SHANE has apologised this evening for saying Sinn Féin’s Imelda Munster was “like a donkey in the last race at the last fence” unlike her “thoroughbred” party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Aengus O Snodaigh.
The minister said he was “sorry for any offence caused by my analogy” adding that he was “caught up in the heat of the debate”.
During a debate on thegreen card for motoristsissue in the Dáil today, Munster said other ministers had managed to resolve Brexit issues for their own department, but criticised Ross for not sorting out the issue of green cards, which drivers travelling to the North will be required to have post-Brexit.
Responding, Ross said he had “a very sensible discussion” about green cards with two of Munster’s colleagues, Pearse Doherty and Aengus O Snodaigh.
He added:
The Leas-Ceann Comhairle Pat the Cope Gallagher interjected, stating: “Minister”.
He called on him to use parliamentary language.
Ross said: “She upset the whole apple cart.”
At this point, Fianna Fáil’s transport spokesperson, Robert Troy said: “That is disgraceful.”

Munster accused Ross of getting personal, and accused him of being incompetent.
“If he wants to get personal to mask his incompetence that is fine. I can take it,” she said, adding:
The debate continued, with the Leas Ceann Comhairle telling the minister to “forget about the word donkey”.
‘An analogy’
The minister explained that “it was just an analogy… made by her colleagues and, as is so typical, she came in and ruined the debate”.
While the Leas Ceann Comhairle acknowledged that, he added that “it does not sound good”.
Munster said the minister did not make any effort at all on the green card issue. However, Ross said that accusation was “simply untrue”.
He said his department and the government have represented the case that the green card is unwelcome and “we do not want it”.
“Of course we do not want it but it is an EU decision,” he added, stating:
In a statement following today’s debate, Munster accused the minister of resorting to name-calling in the chamber.
She called on the minister to apologise, stating:
“I don’t think that this is an appropriate way for the minister to conduct himself. What message does this send out to other women who may have an interest in getting involved in politics? I believe that Minister Ross should apologise for his distasteful remarks.”

BRITAIN RISKS CRASHING out of the European Union without a Brexit deal “by accident” because London cannot decide what it wants, a senior EU negotiator warned today.
In some of her toughest remarks to date, Sabine Weyand, deputy to EU Brexit pointman Michel Barnier, criticised Prime Minister Theresa May’s handling of divorce talks.
“There is a very real risk of crash out. Not by design but by accident,” Weyand told an expert audience invited by the European Policy Centre think tank.
Weyand complained that May had kept her own cabinet and MPs in the dark during 18 months of intense negotiations.
As a result, she argued, many Westminster lawmakers were surprised by the content of the withdrawal deal May signed with EU leaders in November – and rejected it.
May is now seeking tweaks to the accord and to a parallel political declaration on future EU-British relations in the hope of belatedly winning domestic support.
But the prospect of Brexit Day, 29 March, coming round without an agreement is becoming ever more likely.
“The crash out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or any decisions, and that is why the risk of a crash out is so high,” Weyand said.

On Tuesday, British MPs will vote on a raft of amendments that could end up forcing May to either seek a delay in the Brexit date or a revising withdrawal agreement.
‘Groundhog day’
But Weyand warned that negotiations are over, and that this would not have been a surprise if May had kept her sceptical cabinet up to date on the state of talks.
“There are now ideas floating around again, and it does feel like Groundhog Day, about a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause,” she said.
“Let me just reassure you: None of this is new.”
May is expected back in Brussels to ask that the so-called Irish backstop, meant to guarantee no return of a border in Ireland, be stripped from the deal.
Weyand said this had been rejected by all 27 EU leaders:
“This negotiation is in London. There’s no negotiation between the EU and the UK. That negotiation is finished. We are not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.”
Weyand praised May for accepting “ownership” of the deal, but warned she had lost her cabinet and party’s support: “You cannot lead a negotiation like that in secrecy.
“On the UK side, the fact this was handled within a very small circle and there was no information about all the things that were tried in the negotiations, is now a big handicap.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/backbenchers-warn-may-will-have-to-accept-her-share-of-responsibility-if-any-harm-comes-to-mps-2-4554125-Mar2019/,"SOME LABOUR MPS in the UK have warned that Theresa May’s speech last night could incite hatred against members of parliament.
The British Prime Minister’s address to the nation last nightreceived a poor receptionfrom politicians across the political spectrum.
As she attempts to bring her twice-rejected Brexit divorce deal before the Commons for a third time next week May insisted she was on the side of the public and that voters wanted politicians to get on with Brexit and stop in-fighting.
“It is high time we made a decision. So far parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,” she said in her TV address.
May said she will continue to work “night and day” to get MPs to vote for her deal so the UK can leave the EU by 30 June at the latest.
“You’re tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows,” May said, appealing directly to voters. “Tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children’s schools, our National Health Service, knife crime.”
“You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide.”
Conservative Sam Gyimah said May “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.

Others, however, went further in their criticism, warning that if MPs came to any harm May would be partly to blame.
Labour MP for Ilford Wes Streetingsaid on Twitter: “I’ve thought long and hard before saying this, but@theresa_mayknows that MPs across the House are subjected to death threats – some very credible. Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible. If any harm comes to any of us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.”
His parliamentary party colleague Luke Pollard agreed with the sentiment: “I agree Wes. It’s not just MPs but all those who work tirelessly for MPs who are now at greater risk because of the dangerous words chosen by the PM tonight.”
Roberta Blackman-Woods, a Labour shadow minister, wrote that many of her colleagues were facing “real and serious threats” and that May was “being irresponsible and misleading as most of the delay has been due to her running down the clock”.

One MPwho spoke to The Guardian recentlysaid she still received death threats every day.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-farage-eu-election-4639429-May2019/,"WITH ONLY DAYS to go until the European elections, pollsters in the UK are predicting that Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is on course for a huge victory.
Having only being formallyestablished inFebruary, the party hascome from nowhereto position itself as the chief representative of Brexit voters, with some polls suggesting that the party couldreceive 34% of the vote, which would be greater than the Labour and Conservative vote combined.
Even if the party falls short of these projections, the Brexit Party’s campaign has still defined an election that the UK never expected to have.
The story of the Brexit Party begins with the decline of UKIP. The right-wing, Eurosceptic party that led the charge for an in-out referendum on the UK’s EU membership foundered following the June 2016 vote and the departure of Farage as leader.
The UKIP of 2019 scarcely resembles the party that rode a wave of immigration fears and austerity weariness to top the polls in the 2014 European election by securing 27% of the vote and returning 24 MEPs.
The day that Farage called ‘independence day’ – June 24, 2016 – marked a new chapter in the history of UKIP that saw it mill through several leaders (one of Farage’s successorslasted only 18 days), shifting dramatically to the fringes of the far-right and embracing members like activist Tommy Robinson, a former leader of the English Defence League.
To a large degree, it was assumed by its supporters that UKIP had served its purpose: a Brexit vote had been achieved and the UK was parting company with the European Union.
In the 2017 general election, the party’s vote share fell by 10.8% to 1.8%, while in the aftermath of this month’s local election the party has been left with only a few dozen councillors. Today, after a series ofresignations and defectionsto the Brexit Party, only four UKIP MEPs remain.
Farage has not been unwilling to criticise the party since his departureand in April he saidthat UKIP has “allowed the far right to join it and effectively taken over and I’m afraid the brand is now tarnished”.
Farage, who is still an MEP, swifty moved on following the Brexit vote – rubbing shoulders with US President Donald Trump, appearing on Fox News, and continuing to court controversy (and promote Brexit) on his LBC radio talk show.
Briefly, it appeared that Farage may have quit frontline politics for good. In 2017,he told The Daily Mailthat he was “53, separated and skint” and insisted “there’s no money in politics”.
In recent interviews, Farage has pitched the Brexit Party as representing a reluctant return to the political frontline precipitated by Theresa May’s bungling of negotiations with the EU and a “betrayal” by the political elite.

The early days of the party did not suggest promising things to come. Leader Catherine Blaiklock was one oftwo senior figures forced outafter previous offensive social media messages came to light.
However, the roster of candidates secured by the party and unveiled to significant fanfare in April no doubt contributed to its success. Former Conservative MP (and Strictly Come Dancing star) Anne Widdecombe and journalist Annunziata Rees-Mogg (sister of Jacob Rees-Mogg) attracted media attention when they wereannounced.

But the party has also stressed that many of its candidates are just “ordinary” people angered by the stalled Brexit process (and indeed it has recruited former nurses and soldiers, as well as musicians and statisticians, to run in the upcoming election).
Members of the Brexit Party credit Farage himself with the organisation’s rise. One candidate for the European elections in Kent, Stuart Piper,toldThe Guardian: “Whether you love him or loathe him, Nigel Farage had an enormous personal following down here.”
“He’s always been a great speaker, he’s always been very charismatic. And that’s a very difficult act for anybody to follow.”
The party has focused solely on pushing for a no-deal Brexit and Farage has declined to publish a manifesto ahead of the elections, telling theBBC’s Andrew Marr Showthat it had “a word association with ‘lie’”.
Interestingly, the Brexit Party has basically no members in the way a traditional party does, giving Farage nearly total control of the new party in a way he never had in UKIP. Theparty’s constitution givesFarage the power to appoint four to eight board members, as well as the chairman, and with paying “supporters” instead of members he has been able to avoid much of the bureaucracy and accountability that typically constrains leaders in the early days of a new party. Put simply, Farage has been able to turn the party into a vehicle for one single policy: a no-deal Brexit.
Of course, a seemingly deep well of funding doesn’t hurt. Alongside 100,000 supporters, a string of wealthy Eurosceptics have followed Farage into the new party. While Farage has denied that close friend and Leave.EU founder Arron Banks is funding his new party, there is still no shortage of multi-millionaires involved, including property developer Richard Tice – another long-time Farage supporter.
Yet perhaps the greatest boon to Farage and his new party is the chaotic playing field of British politics in 2019. The failure to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 raised the hackles of hard Brexiteers and added further fuel to the idea that Theresa May’s premiership was in disarray.
The extension to 31 October, agreed with the EU in April, left open the possibility of the UK leaving before the European parliament elections. The failure to do so, as well as the collapse this week of talks between Labour and the Conservatives, has all helped Farage and the Brexit Party make the case for the idea that the 2016 referendum result has been “betrayed” and the only solution is a no-deal Brexit.
For the Tory Party, the fact these elections are taking place is a testament to the party’s woes in government, while for Labour they’re another electoral minefield to navigate as Jeremy Corbyn’s party tries to please both the leave-voting and remain-backing elements of his party’s support base.
With both main parties set to shed support, Farage is hoping that on 23 May he can both conquer his former party UKIP and garner the votes of people still holding out hope for Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trade-exports-grow-despite-brexit-4594461-Apr2019/,"IRISH GOODS EXPORTS have increased by over €2 billion – including a 16% increase in exports to the UK – despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, latest CSO figures show.
The data released by the Central Statistics Office for February 2019 shows goods exports to the UK, which is Ireland’s largest trading partner within the EU, increased by €166 million in February – representing a 16% increase on the same month last year.
Total goods exports to the UK amounted to €1.2 billion, driven largely by mineral fuels such as peat and natural gases, along with lubricants and related materials.
Exports to Britain account for 10% of total goods exported from the Republic of Ireland.
Meanwhile, imports from the UK also increased by €265 million to €1.6 billion – an increase of 19% compared to February 2018.
A spokesperson for the Irish Exporters Association said businesses were acutely aware of the need to grow their exports in other markets outside the UK in light of Brexit, despite the latest increases.

“Companies are already massively diversifying and looking for new markets, it just takes a while before that will show in statistics,” he said.
“The UK is a significant market but a lot of companies are looking at other countries in the EU – Germany, France, Spain – to that extent because of Brexit.
They also said they would “expect a decrease” in exports to the UK this time next year with “other countries’ exports to increase”.
Worldwide
Overall, the seasonally adjusted figure for exports decreased by €604 million – or 4% – to €13.2 billion, while seasonally adjusted figures for imports increased by 4% to €6.9 billion.
Ireland continues to operate a trade surplus – exporting more than it imports – to a value of €6.2 billion.
Europe remained the largest trading partner for the month of February 2019, accounting for €6.1 billion worth of total goods exports, with Belgium and Germany being the main countries of destination after the UK – worth €1.6 billion and €939 million respectively.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-deal-2-4559110-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|25 Mar 2019

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is continuing in her last-ditch attempt to get a Brexit deal over the line as speculation about her future mounts.
May is due to hold a Cabinet meeting today to discuss holding a third House of Commons vote on the Withdrawal Agreement.
Meanwhile, the European Commission said it has completed preparations for a no-deal Brexit, noting “it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April”.
The Commission warned that such a scenario could lead to delays at borders, ports and airports.
MPs will this afternoon start debating the government’s motion on the Withdrawal Agreement as well asseven amendmentsthat have been tabled, including one that could see a series of indicative votes on how to move Brexit forward.
If this amendment is passed, the Guardian reports that MPs may vote on Wednesday on anumber of issuesincluding May’s current deal, departure from the customs union, Brexit with both a customs union and single market, a Canada-style free-trade deal, leaving with no deal, a second referendum or revoking Article 50 altogether.
The votes would not be legally binding and may not be acted on.
The European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if British MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement – a deal it has already overwhelmingly rejected twice – the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU this week, on 29 March. May had wanted to delay Brexit until 30 June but welcomed the extension, insisting Brexitwill still happen.
Some Brexiteers have suggested the delay is part of a wider attempt to stop Britain from leaving the EU.
Delays
In a statement issued this morning, the European Commission said: “In a ‘no-deal’ scenario, the UK will become a third country without any transitionary arrangements.
“While the European Union 🇪🇺 continues to hope that it will not be the case, if the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified by Friday 29 March, a “no-deal” scenario may occur on 12 April.”Read more here:https://t.co/8F93UGsjKa#Brexitpic.twitter.com/8ExjvFXLQb— Daniel Ferrie (@DanielFerrie)March 25, 2019Daniel Ferrie 🇪🇺/ Twitter

“All EU primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the UK from that moment onwards. There will be no transition period, as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement. This will obviously cause significant disruption for citizens and businesses.
The statement added that despite the “considerable preparations” of the Member States’ customs authorities, these controls “could cause significant delays at the border”.
Similarly, UK citizens would be subject to additional checks when crossing borders into the EU – which could also cause delays at ports and airports.
Five million sign petition
An anti-Brexit march in London drew an estimated crown of more than one million people on Saturday.
The Put it to the People protest, one of the biggest demonstrations in recent British history, demanded a second Brexit referendum.

More than five million people have signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50. May has repeatedly said she won’t do this.
The petition states that a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
Cabinet coup
As negotiations to get more MPs onside continue, May’s own future as prime minister appears to hang in the balance.
The Sunday Timesyesterday reportedshe was “at the mercy of a full-blown cabinet coup”, with plans afoot for her de facto deputy David Lidington to take over in a caretaker capacity.
The newspaper said it had spoken to 11 senior ministers who “confirmed that they wanted the prime minister to make way for someone else” and planned to confront her at today’s Cabinet meeting.
May worsened relations with many MPs last week after she hit out at them in a speech.
“MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, we will not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me,” May said in a televised speech on Wednesday night.
Her address was sharply criticised by many MPs, from across the political divide, who viewed it as an attempt to shift blame for the ongoing crisis from herself to others.
Conservative Sam Gyimah said “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.
Describing her speech as “incendiary and irresponsible”, Labour MP Wes Streeting said May would be partly responsible “if any harm comes to us”, noting that MPs have been subjected “credible” death threats.
When later asked if she would apologise for her comments, May said she understands that MPs are frustrated, saying so is she.
“There are passionately held views on all sides of the argument,” she noted, adding that the House of Commons now has a “clear choice” between an “orderly” Brexit and a no-deal scenario.
Backstop
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
European leaders including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have repeatedly said the deal cannot be renegotiated.
Doubt was last week cast on over whether or not the House of Commons would actually vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland claimed the UK was facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-heart-attacks-strokes-scientist-warn-4463077-Jan2019/,"NEW RESEARCH HAS found that Britain’s departure from the EU could contribute to thousands more deaths from heart disease and strokes by 2030.
Researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Liverpool looked at how different Brexit scenarios would lead to increased costs of imported fruit and vegetables, resulting in people potentially eating less and increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The study, published in theBritish Medical Journal Open, found that all trade scenarios they looked at would reduce fruit and vegetable intake in the UK.
A no-deal Brexit was deemed as the scenario most damaging to public health, with researchers estimating that there will be 12,400 additional deaths from CVD in England between 2021 and 2030.
Yesterday, bosses at supermarkets and food chains wrote toMPs urging them to avoid a no-deal Brexitand warned of the risks that it could reduce the availability of many products.
Almost one-third of the food consumed in the UK comes from the European Union, they stressed.
“As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores,” they said in a letter to MPs.
Beyond the economy
“The UK government must consider the public health implications of Brexit trade policy options, including changes to the price of key food groups,” Professor Christopher Millett, from the School of Public Health at Imperial said.
In 2017, 84% of fruit and 43% of vegetables eaten in the UK in were imported from the European Union and non-EU countries.
Paraskevi Seferidi, a PhD researcher at Imperial and first author of the study, said:

Deal or no-deal
Some of the scenarios tested by researchers included a free-trading agreement with the EU and third-party countries, a free-trading agreement with the EU, and a no-deal Brexit without a new trade agreement. Under all scenarios, the price of fruit and veg imported would increase substantially due to additional import tariffs and trade costs.
According to the study under a no-deal Brexit the cost of bananas would rise by approximately 17%, citrus fruits by 14%, and tomatoes by 15%.
The findings suggest that these price hikes would lead to the British public eating between 3% and 11% less fruit or vegetables, depending on the agreed deal.
When these changes were translated to CVD risk, they found that a new trade agreement with the EU and third-party countries would contribute to approximately 1, 360 extra coronary heart disease deaths and 2,740 stroke deaths between 2021 and 2030.
The no-deal Brexit scenario had by far the biggest impact, attributing the drop in fruit and veg intake to an average of 4,110 additional deaths from coronary heart disease and 8,290 stroke deaths between 2021-2030.
Best option to protect public health?
According to the authors, a limitation of this study is that the scenarios modelled are not exhaustive and do not reflect all Brexit scenarios currently being debated.
The research also looks solely at England, but the authors claim that similar impacts are likely in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The authors also emphasised that the outcomes of their research are consistent with previous research on Brexit which estimated the cost of eating five portions of fruit and vegetables per day is likely to increase for the average family in Britain – with estimates of an average increase of about £2.20 per week for a family of four.
Professor Martin O’Flaherty, from the University of Liverpool, who jointly led the study, added:
After British MPs overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal earlier this month, they will vote again today on what they want her to do next as the 29 March departure deadline looms.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-raab-brexit-2-4472170-Feb2019/,"SENIOR TORY MP Dominic Raab made headlines in Ireland and in the UK this week over comments he made about the Good Friday Agreement and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
During an appearance before aHouse of Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee– scheduled for the day after317 MPs votedin favour of removing the backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement – the former Brexit Secretary answered questions about Brexit negotiations, relations with the Irish government and the backstop.
He alleged that the Leo Varadkar inaccurately leaked secret details of a private meeting between Raab and Tánaiste Simon Coveney to the media, referring to reports whichappeared in the Telegraph.
Those reports, which were picked up byother news outlets, claimed that Raab had asked Coveney during the meeting whether the backstop could be limited to just three months. This was in stark contrast with Irish and EU desires for an “all-weather” backstop.
“The Irish position remains consistent and very clear⁩ that a ‘time-limited backstop’ or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by Ireland or the EU,”Coveney responded at the time. “These ideas are not backstops at all and don’t deliver on previous UK commitments.”

Raab also came under fire, shortly after he resigned as Brexit Secretary in November, for admitting that he “hadn’t quite understood” how reliant UK trade is on the Dover-Calais crossing, which is the land bridge between England and France.
During the Northern Ireland committee appearance, he was also asked “what is next for Dominic Raab?” – a question aimed at revealing what are suspected to be Tory leadership ambitions.
“I don’t think in fairness, I matter very much,” he replied.
Raab, MP
The son of a Czech-born Jewish father (who came to Britain as a refugee) Raab was first elected as an MP in 2010.
During his first bout in parliament, the then-35-year-old voiced support for more visible policing in his local constituency; fought for a review of ‘positive discrimination’ rules being applied in work experience schemes, and won Newcomer of the year at The Spectator magazine’s Parliamentary Awards (2011).
He served as parliamentary under-secretary to the then-Secretary of State for Justice Michael Gove in 2015, and played a prominent role in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum.
After the 2017 election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority and began a coalition with the DUP, Raab was made Minister of State for Courts and Justice.
Raab succeeded David Davis asBrexit Secretaryon 9 July 2018. Davis had resigned in protest over the direction British Prime Minister Theresa May was taking Brexit negotiations.
He said he was opposed to a common rulebook to allow free trade in goods, saying this “hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.
Four months later in November 2018,Raab resignedas Brexit Secretary along with three other ministers.

His resignation came after the Chequers meeting, which was an attempt by Theresa May to discipline her increasingly dissenting Cabinet ministers.
In the aftermath of his resignation, he was criticised for resigning over the final Brexit deal, which he was in charge of negotiating on behalf of the UK government.
Raab and the backstop
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
In a Financial Times article, Raab was described as“one of the strongest voices against an indefinite backstop”. He has claimed that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told him that it was possible to renegotiate the backstop but that it was a question of political will to do so: it became a case of finding “a ladder for the Irish government to climb down”.
This week, during a session of voting for amendments to Theresa May’s deal, Raab voted in favour of the Brady amendment, which looks for the backstop to be replaced with “alternative arrangements” that aren’t specified or agreed.
He told the Commons committee that although he was Brexit Secretary, certain parts of the deal had been agreed when he took up the post, and he couldn’t start from scratch.
Speaking about the backstop, Raab said that he thought ‘the sunset clause’, or an exit clause was “an eminently sensible proposal” and said that these were the ways of finding a compromise on the border issue:
“And what was clear to me, was that in Dublin – I don’t want to get into their domestic politics – but politically, they’re taking a very firm line on a deadline.”
Raab went on to say that the Irish government took “a trenchant line on the backstop”, and that it was in “a very difficult position now” blaming it on the “particularly strong political position taken by the Taoiseach”.
He went on to claim that the Taoiseach had leaked a private meeting between Raab and Coveney to the media:
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Coveney’s advisor described Raab’s comment’s as“pure spoof”, saying that the Daily Telegraph would hardly be the first port for call for the Irish government.
In a bizarre exchange on Twitter, Raab’s account responded to a comment from Irish Times journalist Harry McGee and asked:
Another journalist, Virgin Media One’s political correspondent Gavan Reilly,responded to Raabto say he was the reporter who asked Varadkar about the three-month time limit.
“I was the reporter that morning that asked Varadkar to comment on the reports. He didn’t himself say the UK had proposed a ‘three-month’ expiry. The reports did, prompting my question.”
Having been the Brexit Secretary for a time, and having strong views on the backstop, Raab was also criticised for not having read the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in full, saying that he’s used it as “a reference tool” during Brexit negotiations, but that it isn’t “a cracking read”.
The Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement is 35 pages long,and can be found here.

https://www.thejournal.ie/extradition-post-brexit-4507594-Feb2019/,"EXTRADITION CASES BETWEEN the UK and Ireland in a post-Brexit no-deal scenario will be slower and a lot more cumbersome.
One of the aspects of theBrexit onmibus Bill published this weekrelates to extradition between the two countries.
If Brexit crashes out of the EU, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system – which allows for the extradition of suspects between EU countries for trial or imprisonment – will cease to operate between the UK and Ireland.
Prior to the EU extradition set up, there was a bilateral arrangement between the UK and Ireland.
While the EU extradition warrant has been described as a lot more efficient, in order to  solve this problem the Brexit ‘mega’ Bill sets out to amend a previous extradition Act that dates back to 1965.
It will allow for the extradition of Irish citizens to another State, such as the UK, which in turn, could extradite their citizens to Ireland for trial.
Delays
There are concerns about reverting to those rules – albeit with updates – particularly around the delays it could bring about.
Chief Justice Mr Frank Clarke has previously said the current EU warrant is “harder to find holes in” that previous iterations, stating that any new system would be tested.
The legislation that will oversee extraditions relates to the Council of Europe Convention on Extradition 1957 and is understood to have a lot more grounds to allow for appeals and more space for objections to be put down.
Talking toCork’s 96FMlast week, Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said he hoped the UK would maintain extradition arrangements with the European Union post-Brexit in order combat international crime.
“I would be concerned to ensure, for example, that we would continue to have a robust extradition process.
“I would hope that Britain would continue to sign in, for example, to the very important and necessary European Arrest Warrant… that we could ensure there is no delay in fighting crime on either side of the Border and, of course, east and west between Britain and Ireland,” he said.

Reassurances
Tánaiste Simon Coveney moved to give reassurances this week that the much heralded no-deal Brexit omnibus Bill would protect the rights of Irish citizens and businesses.
However, he added that he hopes it is one piece of legislation he has helped draft that will “sit on the shelf” and never have to be used.
It has taken over a year to put together, and it looks ahead at what possible issues could arise should there be a no-deal, some of which Coveney has written about today forTheJournal.ie.
However, the Tánaiste also admitted this week that there will be scenarios that no one will have foreseen, and that the situation for the UK, Ireland and Europe is “lose, lose, lose”.
While you can have all the will in the world to have preparations in place, the Tánaiste said there is no doubt that Ireland is facing into an emergency situation.
The Bill looks at issues across nine different departments. New items contained include additional powers for Enterprise Ireland to lend to businesses without breakin EU state aid rules. There are also new VAT rules for businesses, which will allow firms to defer the payments.
Assurances have been given that ‘the lights won’t go out’ post 29 March – the day the UK is due to leave the EU – as the changes in law will facilitate the current all-island electricity services.
Bus services
Bus services, such as tours and school buses, operating over the border between the North and the Republic will not be disrupted due to new provisions providing for a new licensing system operating in a ‘third’ country such as the UK.
The licences known as third-country authorisations or as third-country journey forms will be granted by the National Transport Authority – but the government hopes such provisions will not need to be activated.
In terms of education, some 1,500 Irish students studying in the UK will still be able to access their grants, as will the 200 or so UK students studying here in Ireland.
The 132,000 people living in Ireland who get UK pensions will also be able to draw it down post-Brexit, as will the 28,000 Irish citizens who live in Britain but receive an Irish pension.
Child Benefit will also be unaffected due to the new legislation, with 1,000 British people living in Ireland still being able to receive their payments post 29 March, and the same for the 840 Irish citizens living in the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-westminster-brexit-seats-4572944-Apr2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has defended Sinn Féin’s continued abstention from Westminster in light of last night’s Brexit votes in the House of Commons.
British MPs last night again rejectedall of the alternative optionsput before them in the latest round of indicative Brexit votes – with one option backing a customs union losing by just three votes.
There were only four non-binding options before MPs last night. A similar effort to reach a consensus on Brexit last Wednesday – when eight options were tabled – also failed.
Sinn Féin has seven MPs elected to Westminster from constituencies in Northern Ireland but has long operated an abstentionist policy whereby it refuses to sit in the parliament.
Following the votes, Minister for Health Simon Harris tweeted that “with a margin of only three votes in the House of Commons” last night, it was “hard to see how Sinn Féin contend that taking their seats would not change the outcome of Brexit”.

McDonald addressed the tweet while speaking to reporters outside Leinster House earlier today.
She said that as a matter of policy and principle, Sinn Féin “will not swear an oath to a foreign power”.

“I would be really astonished if it is the case that Simon Harris … or anyone else who is elected to the Oireachtas, any party of the Oireachtas would come out and say that they would be prepared to take such an oath,” McDonald told reporters.
Touching on the idea of having Sinn Féin MPs in Westminster, McDonald said:
“I would suggest to you that it would have the practical effect of making things perhaps even more confused and more chaotic,” McDonald said.
She noted that her party’s MPs were elected “explicitly on an abstentionist mandate”.
“It’s a matter of principle, we are a party that is for a United Ireland, for Irish independence. We’re also a party that understood and understands that Irish interest in this Brexit debacle are not best advanced at Westminster,” McDonald said, adding that the purpose of the UK Parliament is to “advance British interests”.
“Irish interests in this scenario were always going to be advanced and protected, or not, by the government in Dublin whose duty it is to defend Irish interests in conjunction with our European partners,” she said.
A poll carried out for RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live /TheJournal.ieby Amarách Researchin Decemberfound that 57% of people think Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats in Westminster so they can vote for May’s Brexit deal.
Of the 1,000+ Irish adults surveyed for the poll, 20% said the MPs shouldn’t, while 23% said they didn’t know either way.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passport-history-travel-uk-4446193-Jan2019/,"EARLIER THIS WEEK, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland announced that it is preparing to issue ‘Green Cards’ to drivers in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.
The card would give motorists clearance to travel to the UK by providing proof that they have the minimum level of car insurance required to drive outside the European Union.
While the Government expects the Common Travel Area to remain, whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not, the cards are a throwback to similar documents that were required to travel between the two countries before 1952.
Prior to that, Irish citizens who wanted to travel to the UK had to use a Travel Identity Card like this one:
Twitter / sweetoblivion26Twitter / sweetoblivion26/ sweetoblivion26
The card permitted travel between the Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and had to be carried by bearers at all times, acting as a kind of internal passport.
It was introduced following the outbreak of World War in September 1939, when travel restrictions were implemented between Great Britain and the entire island of Ireland.
After the UK extended its border controls to the border with Northern Ireland in 1940, the government brought in the Travel Identity Card.
According to instructions inside, the card had to be presented by its holder to the Immigration Officer, alongside their national registration identity card and ration book, when they arrived at port UK or in Northern Ireland.
It wasn’t until travel restrictions between the Republic of Ireland and the UK were lifted in 1952 that the card fell out of use.

Free State passport
Before the war, UK law had considered the Irish Free State part of the UK for immigration purposes, a move that was implemented in 1925 when the Common Travel Area was established.
When the Irish Free State was founded three years beforehand, the state began to issue passports for the first time, which looked like this:
Peter Clarke / WikimediaPeter Clarke / Wikimedia/ Wikimedia
These passports were issued by the Governor General in the name of King George V, and followed the model of passports being issued in other British dominions, such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
However, there was disagreements between the Irish and British governments of the day about the passports from early on, particularly over how the nationality of the passport-owner was described.
The British government believed that the “British Subject” should feature on the passport, and said they would refuse to recognise it around the world if it didn’t, but the new Irish government refused.
Eventually, a compromise was reached in 1929, when it was decided that the Irish Minister for External Affairs would issue the passports instead of the Governor General.
The passports were still issued in the name of King George V, and the British government accepted the description “Citizen of the Irish Free State”.
These passports were eventually abolished when the Irish Free State became a fully independent Ireland in 1937, with the use of the King’s name eliminated from the passport.
Since then, the Irish government has issued passports by itself, where holders are described only as “citizens of Ireland”.

It’s still all about May’s deal
Photojoiner / PA ImagesPhotojoiner / PA Images / PA Images
First up, is the Tory government’s talks with Labour are still ongoing. British Prime Minister Theresa May is to officially resume those talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today, to try to convince him to support her Withdrawal Agreement.
In the last House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal, May lost by 58 votes. She’s given up on trying to draw the support of her own Tory rebel MPs, so she’s now trying to get Labour to help her approve it – but they want changes first. Among those changes is a possible customs deal with the European Union, which would be a closer arrangement than what’s already been negotiated in the current Withdrawal Agreement.
The EU has already said that the contents of the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated, but are happy to clarify what’s already in it through legal documents.
The European Council is also prepared to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship if necessary.
May is hoping to have the Withdrawal Agreement passed before the European elections, so we could be in for another dramatic Westminster vote before 22 May.

If the UK is still a member of the EU between 23 and 26 May it will have to hold European Parliament elections. If the UK doesn’t hold those elections, it will leave on 1 June 2019.
The European Council will review the progress of the negotiations at its meeting on 20-21 June, ahead of another meeting with the UK on 30 June.

Therecently launchedBrexit Party is not only running candidates in the European elections, but polls are predicting they will do quite well.A YouGov pollplaced them with 27% support, Labour with 22% and the Conservatives on 15% support.
But before the European elections, there’s the local elections on 2 May. There are 8,374 council seats available in England, 462 in Northern Ireland. Tories hold over 4,600 of those seats, while there is no party majority in Northern Ireland.
The elections will be closely watched as a barometer of the political good or bad will towards the government after Brexit.
As it stands, the Tories are predicted to lose heavily, as both pro- and anti-Brexit voters show their displeasure to Theresa May’s middle-of-the-road Brexit deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-impact-on-business-4440225-Jan2019/,"THE LEADING BUSINESS groups in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have warned that a ‘no deal’ Brexit would jeopardise jobs and “have devastating economic consequences for the all-island economy”.
MPs will gather in the House of Commons chamber this evening to vote on whether or not to approve the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May faces an uphill battle to secure the 320 votes she needs in order for her deal to pass. If MPs don’t back the deal, she hasa few optionsincluding a no-deal Brexit — something people from across the political spectrum agree is not a desirable outcome.
In advance of the vote, the Ibec/CBI Northern Ireland Joint Business Council has said a no-deal outcome must be avoided to prevent “an immediate and unprecedented economic shock”.
The Withdrawal Agreement includes provisions to limit disruption to the all-island economy post-Brexit, including a transition period and the contentious backstop which could see Northern Ireland stay aligned to the regulations of the single market and the customs union.

An Ibec/CBI spokesperson said ratification of the deal is “vital to allow trade talks to progress”.
‘An affront to rational thinking’
Speaking ahead of today’s vote, Ibec Director of Policy and Public Affairs Fergal O’Brien said the withdrawal deal includes important provisions to minimise economic disruption and avoid a hard border.
CBI NI Director Angela McGowan said many firms across Northern Ireland “simply could not cope with a no-deal Brexit”.
“Not only would it do significant harm to jobs, investment and living standards but it would put at risk the all-island economic model that has been an important factor in driving local prosperity.”
McGowan added that a ‘no deal’ scenario “brings with it unnecessary risk to the Good Friday Agreement”,
“The assurances that business have been crying out for are broadly provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement – ignoring that in pursuit of no-deal isn’t just economic recklessness, it’s an affront to rational thinking,” she stated.

THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT is using a giant costumed creature to warn of the consequences Brexit could have on businesses.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Stef Blok shared a picture of a blue, hairy muppet-like mascot casually stretched across an office desk.
Blok himself is also in the picture, gesturing in mock-frustration at the creature.
“Have you already checked the consequences Brexit has for you or your company?” the message on Twitter says, directing usersto a websitewith information for businesses, British citizens living in the Netherlands, and other reference points.

“Make sure Brexit, or lies, doesn’t get in your way,” the Foreign Minister said.
Last week, the Dutch government announced that 40 companies last year moved their operations from the UK to the Netherlands in response to Brexit uncertainties.
The combined moves of 42 companies will translate into the shift of just under 2,000 jobs and of €291 million in investments, the Dutch agency for foreign investment said.
The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis calculated the influence of Brexit on the Dutch economy could amount to a drop of 1.2% in GDP by 2030, the equivalent of €10 billion euros.
Less trade may also lead to less innovation in different sectors, the governmentsaid.

Anna Soubry was heckled as she conducted a number of interviews at the Palace of Westminster, stopping to address them as she spoke with both BBC and Sky News.
During her interview with BBC, Soubry was forced to pause mid-sentence after a number of protesters chanted “Soubry is a Nazi”, telling interviewer Simon McCoy “I do object to being called a Nazi, actually”.
“I just think this is astonishing, this is what has happened to our country,” she added, after receiving an apology from McCoy.
“But let’s try and move on and be positive about things.”

Similar chants were also directed at Soubry, who supports a second Brexit referendum, as she carried outa live interview on Sky News.
On that occasion, she also stopped to address the chants, saying she was not fazed by them.
“[I'm] a lass from Worksop, so I don’t get scared by these people or intimidated,” she said.

“I was a reporter during the miners’ strike, so I don’t feel physically intimidated. My difficulty is I want to respond and you mustn’t, so I’m really behaving myself.”
Soubry was later confronted and followed by several protesters as she entered the Palace of Westminster, when she was called a “fascist” and asked why she was unwilling to be confronted by members of the public.

“Apparently MPs and politicians are meant to accept it as part of the democratic process,” she said.
“I fail to see why journalists and technicians should be subjected to the same abuse and intimidation as the police stand by and do nothing. They tried to stop me getting into Parliament.”

She also told BBC Newsthat the police needed to “do their job” and prevent such incidents from happening in future.
According to the same source, the Metropolitan Police are investigating reports of a public order offence in the area, but no arrests have been made.
A Downing Street spokesperson criticised the incident as “unacceptable” and said MPs “should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-brexit-march-4546874-Mar2019/,"BRITISH MEP NIGEL Farage has begun a 435-kilometre march to London to demand that Britain leaves the EU this month.
Around 100 Brexit supporters have joined the Eurosceptic politician on the journey from Sunderland to the House of Commons, which is expected to conclude on 29 March.
Speaking at the start of the march today, Farage explained to reporters that the march was beginning from the northeastern city because it was a “symbolic” location.
“It was the Sunderland result on the night of the [Brexit] referendum that made us think — wow, this is going to happen,” he said before setting off.
“I believe we are witnessing a betrayal. I think we are witnessing, in terms of our nation’s democratic history, one of the saddest chapters.”
However, Farage also admitted that he intends to cover just a third of the trek to London.
“Unfortunately, I have a European summit to go to, one or two things like that,” he told the BBC.
It comes as British Prime Minister Theresa May attempts to push her EU withdrawal deal through the House of Commons for a third time.
If it is approved, the prime minister will ask the remaining 27 EU leaders to sign off on a Brexit deadline extension through June to allow parliament to pass the necessary legislation.
If the deal is rejected again, May will have to seek a longer delay that some EU leaders have said could last through the end of next year.

However, many on the mach felt that an extension would go against the will of those who voted to leave the EU.
“We are a little forgotten by the politicians,” retired banker Christopher Treggelis said.
“My democratic vote has been ignored,” pensioner Steve Coward added as the group set off along their North Sea route for the town of Hartlepool some 20 miles to the south.
“I’m taking to my second right, which is to protest peacefully about the parliament ignoring my democratic vote,” he added.
Other marchers brandished Union Jacks and signs reading “Democracy” and “Liberty”.
Some said that any economic pain caused by the breakup would be short-lived and worth the benefits of greater independence.
Sunderland store owner Janice McBeth said she was sure “this country will thrive” down the line.
“I’m not naive – it might be difficult, a few shortages, trade barriers,” she said. “But it will be sorted out.”
The march is designed to echo similar processions witnessed in England’s northeastern coalfields in the 1930s that saw workers protest poverty and the closure of a big shipyard.
The Jarrow March of 1936 was the most famous, with a few hundred people reaching London and treated as heroes once they returned home.

https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-did-donald-trump-predict-brexit-at-his-scottish-golf-course-the-day-before-the-vote-4554440-Mar2019/,"
DONALD TRUMP LAST week repeated his assertion that he correctly predicted the result of the Brexit referendum a day before the vote on a 2016 visit to Scotland.
Speaking alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the White House, Trump told reporters that he correctly predicted the result during a press conference at his Turnberry golf course on Scotland’s west coast.
Various journalists took to Twitter to take issue with Trump’s comments, stating that he couldn’t have made the prediction from the golf course a day ahead of the referendum as he didn’t arrive there until the dayafterthe vote.
Is Trump’s claim true? Let’s take a look.
Hosting Leo Varadkar for the traditional St Patrick’s visit to Washington, Trump answered various questions on issues of the day including Brexit.
This was on Thursday 14 March – two days after the withdrawal agreement had been rejected yet again by the House of Commons and hours before another major vote on extending Article 50.
In comments to one reporter, Trump said:
“It wasn’t that I was a supporter I predicted it was going to happen and I was right. And people laughed when I predicted it.
Our political correspondent Christina Finn, who was at the Oval Office event, captured the footage below of Trump making the remarks:
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
It’s not the first time he’s made the claim. Speakingin July of last yearhe also said he was “opening Turnberry the day before Brexit”, adding:
Specifically we’re looking into Trump’s claim thathe correctly predicted the Brexit result during a press conference at his Turnberry golf club in Scotland the day before the vote (so, specifically, on 22 June 2016).
As part of our factchecking process here atTheJournal.iewe always contact the person or organisation making the claims that are being examined.
Without much hope of a response we emailed both the White House press office and the Trump-Pence 2020 campaign asking for links to any footage or press coverage of Trump making these claims at Turnberry on 22 June 2016.
We also asked if the President stood by his remarks.
We haven’t received a response.
Searching for comments that might back up this claim from anyone connected to either the Trump 2016 campaign or the current administration we came across this tweet from First Lady Melania Trump’s Director of Communications (below) in July 2018 when he made an almost identical claim.

However, Stephanie Grisham claims that Trump made the comments on 23 June (which was the actual day of the vote).
He did. It actually is true. I was there. June 23.https://t.co/5xrbSks1Xd— Stephanie Grisham 45 Archived (@StephGrisham45)July 13, 2018Stephanie Grisham/ Twitter

Remember we’re factchecking Trump’s claim thathe correctly predicted the Brexit result during a press conference at his Turnberry golf club in Scotland the day before the vote (so, specifically, on Wednesday 22 June 2016).
News coverage of the Trump campaign from Wednesday 22 June shows he was in New York for events including a major speechin which he branded rival Hillary Clinton a ‘world class liar’, citing her previous claims about arriving in Bosnia under sniper fire (which, as an aside, Clintonwas forced to admitshe exaggerated during the 2008 campaign).
A full transcript of the speech was postedonline by Politico here. It contains no mention of the Brexit vote.
A Google News search for the terms ‘Trump’ and ‘Brexit’for that datedid not generate any results covering comments by Trump on that subject at other events that day.

Trump’s visit to Turnberry took place on 24 June, the day after the vote, as multiple news reports and tweets from outlets who had reporters present show.
Here’sthe BBC’s report. Here’s onefrom ABC News. Here’sTheJournal.ie’smain reporton his cliff-side press conference at Turnberry.
Below is a tweet from our assistant news editor (and author of this FactCheck) who was also there.

According to our tweets from the day Trump landed at the course at 8.13am on the morning of 24 June, shortly after David Cameron had announced his resignation and long after the result of the vote had become clear.
The official campaign schedule (below) shows he was due to leave New York on 23 June, the day of the referendum, en route to Prestwick Airport. You may recall he had also beenexpected to stop off in Irelandbut that leg of the route was called off.
Hemade a number of commentsabout Brexit at the Turnberry press conference (where he did, indeed,cut a ribbon) including hailing the result as “fantastic”.
Trump campaignTrump campaign
Trump claimed he predicted the Brexit result at Turnberry the day before the referendum.
He didn’t arrive in Turnberry until the day after the referendum. As the result was clear at that stage, it obviously would have been impossible to predict it.
We rate his claim as:FALSE
As per ourverdict guide, this means the claim is inaccurate.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-what-is-going-on-4576947-Apr2019/,"IN A WEEK’S time, the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal. So where do we stand now, what is due to happen next week, and will the EU grant an extension?
Here’s a quick recap: British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal has been rejected by the UK parliament three times, first by 230 votes in January, then by 149 votes in February, and then again by 58 votes in March.
The UK parliament then voted on a range of alternatives, drafted by MPs. It failed to reach a majority on eight different options in the first series of indicative votes, and failed to reach a majority on four other options in the second round.
When asked this week whether they should hold more indicative votes on Monday, MPs were evenly split – House Speaker John Bercow decided against it.
So since the parliament didn’t get far by “taking back control” from the government, May then held a seven-hour Cabinet meeting where phones were confiscated, to discuss with her Ministers what should happen next.
After this meeting, she said that she would be seeking another extension to Article 50, which is basically delaying Brexit, and would work with the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to secure Labour’s support for her Brexit deal. This statement means she is done trying to shift opinions within her own party, and now is working on getting her deal passed in the House of Commons by any means necessary.
May then met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday for a reported 100 minutes of talks – both sides described the meeting as “cordial” but inconclusive.
Speaking on Sky News, DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said that this strategy was dangerous, because if Corbyn were to shift Labour’s position on the Brexit deal, he could weaken his clout with his own MPs and fall short of providing the voting-support that May is asking for.
Yesterday, 25 Labour MPs send Jeremy Corbyn a letter urging him to strike a deal with Theresa May and not request a second referendum.

NEW: Here's the letter 25 Labour MPs (including frontbenchers) have sent to Jeremy Corbyn urging him to agree a deal with Theresa May - and NOT request a second referendum:pic.twitter.com/q6Zr8dClth
“Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum, will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business. A second referendum would be exploited by the far right, damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election.”
On Wednesday, MPs backed a bill which would force the Prime Minister to seek a delay to Brexit to avoid a no deal.
Next Wednesday 10 April, the European Council will meet in Brussels to discuss the proposals put forward by the UK government. Theresa May will be asking for an extension, and hoping that the support of Labour, which isn’t secured as of yet, will be enough of a reason for the EU to grant it.
If the 27 leaders don’t grant an extension, the UK will leave the EU on 12 April without a deal.

No-deal warnings
This week, the Irish government have been ramping up their no-deal preparations, as per the advice from the European Commission earlier this week.

Among the no-deal Brexit information that has been issued by the Irish government this week, is advice:
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe also advised that only half of businesses that trade with the UK have obtained an EORI customs number, which they would need to continue to trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Will the EU grant an extension?
EU leaders have become more vocal in how they’ve become fed up of Brexit sucking up all their time, press coverage, and legislative energy.
This week, Leo Varadkar met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin. The aim of this was to secure their support in not giving ground on the backstop in order to secure a Brexit deal.
Macron said that France would never let Ireland or the Irish people down, while Merkel said that they would walk every step with Ireland.
SIPA USA / PA ImagesSIPA USA / PA Images / PA Images
Meanwhile, on the continent, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: “If the United Kingdom is able to approve the withdrawal agreement with a viable majority by 12 April, then the European Union should accept an extension until 22 May.
It doesn’t look like a fourth meaningful vote will be held next week, there simply won’t be time, but that pledge could represent some willingness from the EU to give the UK more time to secure a deal.
But if talks between May and Corbyn collapse, as they’re likely to, May has indicated that she will then hold her own set of indicative votes of possible options (remember it was UK backbenchers that were proposing amendments in the last set of votes).
May will then choose a proposal for the extension that will be proposed to the European Council summit on Wednesday for 27 EU leaders to consider.
The 22 May is a day before EU elections across Europe begin; the 18 April is the final date by which the UK can begin to organise itself in order to take part in the European elections.
This phrase has a slightly too-positive undertone to it, but it’s the best answer to the question of what is next: anything can happen.

Yesterday, the Taoiseach wasforced to delay his travel plansafter moves were afoot with Brexit. However, it is understood that his plans had always been flexible and he will be heading to the States today.
As is tradition, Varadkar will meet with US President Donald Trump, with their meeting due to be held in the White House Oval Office on Thursday.
On that day, the Taoiseach will first be hosted for breakfast by Vice President Mike Pence.
Controversy surrounded this meeting last year, after the media were shut out from the meeting, which is usually open to the press.
It is not yet clear what the arrangements will be this year, or whether Varadkar’s partner Matt Barrett will attend. Last year, Pence told the Taoiseach that both he and Barrett, would be welcome in Pence’s home if he decides to attend this year.
After breakfast, Varadkar will attend the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, and meet with senior members of Congress.
The bowl of shamrock
That evening, the Taoiseach will join Trump and his wife Melania, for the traditional Shamrock Ceremony at the White House, in advance of attending the Ambassador’s St Patrick’s Day Reception.
In his meetings he will also emphasise the strength of Irish-US relations, and will recall the important role of the US in supporting peace and the Good Friday Agreement, and outline Ireland’s position on Brexit.
He will also press the case for resolving the situation facing the undocumented Irish in America.

The Taoiseach has said this year’s visit is an opportunity to deepen Ireland’s strong bilateral relations with the US, and to build even stronger transatlantic relations between the US and the EU.
During his stay in Washington, Varadkar will also focus on economic links, with a series of meetings to promote trade and investment between the US and Ireland.
The Taoiseach will also meet representatives of Irish companies successfully expanding their operations in the US.
Irish businesses
He will also meet the US Chamber of Commerce and IDA client companies, highlighting Ireland’s strengths as a location for international business and investment.
Varadkar will also attend the annual Ireland Funds Gala Dinner, and visit the exhibition ‘Blazing a Trail: Irish Women in America’.
After four days in Washington DC, the Taoiseach will travel to Chicago. He is due to meet with a number of emigrant support groups that receive Irish Government funding, and will attend a St Patrick’s Day dinner hosted by the Irish Fellowship Club of Chicago.
On Saturday, the Taoiseach will march in the Chicago St Patrick’s Day Parade, before concluding his programme by marking the launch of Tourism Ireland’s new book, ‘Ireland’s Greening of the World’, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Global Greening Initiative.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, who is staying in Europe due to the unpredictability of Brexit, said yesterday that the traditional pilgrimage by ministers abroad for St Patrick’s Day is somewhat different this year due to Brexit.
He said St Patrick’s Day is a really important time of year for the Irish government to get their message across abroad, however, he said this year they have ensured that “key decision-makers” are where they need to be in order to deal with any Brexit-related decision or fallout.

IN A MUCH-ANTICIPATEDpiece of advice this morning, the Attorney General for England and Wales has said that the latest Brexit deal still presents a ‘legal risk’ of the UK being trapped in the backstop protocol.
In his officiallegal opinionto the Prime Minister, Geoffrey Cox said that much of what was agreed between Theresa May and negotiators in Strasbourg last night bolstered the legal standing of the assurances given by the EU to the UK.
“I now consider that the legally binding provisions of the Joint Instrument and the content of the Unilateral Declaration reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the Protocol’s provisions at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU,” he told May.
However, he also noted that the legal risk “remains unchanged” in relation to the UK being able to leave the backstop protocol arrangements if there was no act of ‘bad faith’ on either side.
Addressing the House of Commons to give more detail on his legal advice he told MPs that what was agreed last night improves the withdrawal agreement and that the House had to make a political judgement about whether the deal was justified.
He said the provisions of the joint instrument announced in Strasbourg “extend beyond mere interpretation of the withdrawal agreement and represents materially new legal obligations and commitments”.

“There is no doubt in my view that the clarifications in the joint statement and unilateral declaration make substantive and binding reinforcements of the legal rights available to the UK.”
He added: “Matters of law can only inform the political decision each of us must make.”
A large number of MPs and the DUP had earlier said they would not decide on their intentions for this evening’s vote on the deal until they had heard from Cox.
As Cox was speaking this afternoon, the Financial Times reported that it was unlikely the Northern Ireland party would back the agreement this evening.
“A DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) source has told the FT ‘no’, they cannot see how the party can back the PM’s deal,”the paper reported.
Elsewhere, political reporters in London said there were indications some Tory MPs who voted against the deal last time around may now back it.

DUP MP Sammy Wilson said earlier this morning that he believes the new arrangements appear to “fall short” of what May has promised, but added that his party would reserve judgement until they heard the Attorney General’s advice.
That advice would now indicate that they will remain opposed to May’s deal. Labour had already announced that it would vote against the deal.

Last night, May hailed the ‘legally binding changes’ to the Withdrawal Agreement that she had secured during talks with the EU.
The House of Commons is due to vote on the deal at around 7pm after a debate this evening. Last time there was a meaningful vote on a deal, it was voted down by a majority of 230 votes.
If it fails again, parliament will vote on a no-deal Brexit or an extension to Article 50 which could delay Brexit if the EU is amenable.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last night reiterated that there would be no changes to the Withdrawal Agreement and no further chances to renegotiate.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-merkel-macron-4566708-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR will have two very important meetings with French President, Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel next week.
The Taoiseach will travel to Paris on Tuesday to meet Macron, while on Thursday, Merkel will travel to Dublin.
The two meetings come at a key point in Brexit, where questions hang over what route Westminster will choose to take. Today, the House of Commons will debate and vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal for a third time.
Varadkar’s meetings with Macron and Merkel will focus on current EU issues in particular latest developments on Brexit, with the Irish government stating that such important bilateral meetings being held at this time is “reassuring from an Irish perspective” and “shows solidarity with Ireland during these uncertain times”.
It is understood the discussions will centre on Brexit, with Ireland standing firm that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.
No-deal scenario
The Taoiseach is also expected to give his views on both a deal and no-deal outcomes, with a particular focus during the discussions on a post-Brexit scenario.
There will also be talks on the Single Market, the EU Commission and the European budget.
In a statement announcing the meetings, the Department of An Taoiseach said:
Speaking ahead of the meetings, the Taoiseach said:
“I look forward to travelling to Paris to meet President Macron, and to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to Dublin.

“Both leaders have been strong and consistent allies of Ireland in responding to the unique challenges we face from Brexit. I will again express the Government’s gratitude for their continuing solidarity. We will take stock of the latest developments on Brexit when we meet, efforts to secure ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and No Deal planning.
‘Strengthening relations’
While the Taoiseach said he meets with both the President and Chancellor at the European Council in Brussels, these bilateral meetings are an “important opportunity for an in-depth and one-to-one exchange on how to further strengthen our relations away from the bustle of the European Council”.
Pressure mounting?
While the Irish government maintains these meetings are about showing solidarity, there have been reports that Merkel is piling on the pressure over Ireland’s no-deal Brexit plans.
The Taoiseach has denied this, but has admitted there will have to be “difficult discussions” with the European Commission in the event of a disorderly Brexit.
Varadkar said that he was “not under any pressure from Chancellor Merkel or anybody else from this issue”.
“What Chancellor Merkel or President Macron would do is ask reasonable questions.”
The protection of the Single Market has been flagged as one of the talking points during the bilateral meetings next week.
Speaking about the issue last week, Varadkar said the idea of protecting the single market “isn’t some nasty EU regulation”.
“It’s our single market. We do need to protect it,” he said, adding:
When asked about the speculation that Merkel is mounting pressure on the Irish government, and could use next week’s visit to state that the danger that the backstop insistence could result in hard border, a government spokesperson said they “wouldn’t take that seriously”, adding that such notions are largely coming from British voices.
As Brexit uncertainty ticks on, all eyes will be on the Taoiseach to reiterate the Irish government’s standpoint that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, cannot be reopened.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-greenlands-exit-from-the-eec-took-years-so-the-brexit-timeline-was-always-unrealistic-4479574-Feb2019/,"THE BRITISH PRIME Minister Theresa May will be returning to Brussels in her audacious bid to secure “alternatives” to the much maligned and divisive issue of the Irish backstop.
Her attempts to reopen negotiations on the 585-page withdrawal agreement as previously agreed between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, seems an impossible task.
Particularly, if one is to listen to the commentary coming from Brussels and the Irish government. They have articulated in unison their diplomatic disdain and contempt at the thought of having to reopen the painstakingly negotiated agreement that had safeguarded the continuation of the Irish border in its current state.
Nevertheless, such imminent EU talks will soon unfold and in the interim, certain UK political figures and media will continue to condemn and blame the Irish backstop for all their Brexit woes.
No doubt, such rhetoric is inherently unjust but will remain a useful distraction from the self-serving nature and disarray of modern-day British politics.
If one is to point the proverbial finger of blame, however, the premature triggering of the deadline placed on Brexit by the British government appears to be a far more apt target.
The well documented and foreseen complexities existent within Brexit, in the first instance, demanded there be a far more realistic timeframe set to achieve such a monumental task.
In hindsight, it is fair to argue that Theresa May was grossly unrealistic in her ambitions, when she set in motion Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, on 29 March 2017, leaving an automatic deadline of two years as the exit date.
On the day of the announcement, the former SNP leader Alex Salmond pointed to disunity across the UK and had urged the government to delay the triggering of Article 50.
“After nine months of this prime minister’s approach to Brexit, Northern Ireland is deadlocked, the Welsh are alienated, Scotland is going for a referendum, the English are split down the middle,” he said.
Prior to May making that decision, one would have assumed her trusted advisors would have verified whether triggering a two-year timeline at that point was realistic.

Despite the internal pressures from her own party, or externally from the EU to announce a date, a mere perusal of Greenland’s exit should have set alarm bells ringing.
In 1982, Greenland voted to leave the EEC and it took until 1985 to complete its contentious exit negotiations. Greenland itself is the largest island in the world and a former colony of Denmark. Although it still remains part of the Danish kingdom, it has its own devolved government in a similar manner to Scotland within the UK.
When Greenland voted to leave the EEC, one of the key policy reasons was its concern over fishing rights – the country’s primary source of income.
With a population of approximately 56,000 in comparison to the UK’s 66 million, Greenland’s exit would have been deemed rather simplistic by comparison.
Despite this the negotiations were drawn-out and politically fraught, taking nearly three years and requiring over 100 meetings between diplomats and officials.
Greenland’s lengthy departure, albeit different, clearly demonstrated that any subsequent exit from the European Union would be latent with bureaucratic, diplomatic and legal challenges.
Even more so if one acknowledges the considerable increase in policy, social and legal complexities, including the EU’s greater expansion and influence in the intervening years since 1982. Taking into account these economic, political and societal intricacies existent within Brexit, time was always going to be a critical issue in achieving an orderly exit.
It is still anyone’s guess how the Brexit conundrum will eventually conclude with the deadline of 29 March 2019 looming. 14 February is the next date the members of the House of Commons could conceivably revisit the debate on the extension of time and potentially avoid a “no-deal” scenario.
At this late stage, given the deep factions amongst opposing sides, the most prudent policy for the UK to implement would be to request the extension and for the EU to grant it.
This request would then be formally considered by the European Council at its next scheduled meeting on 21 March, requiring the unanimous consent of its 27 members. If granted, it would give all sides some breathing space and time to find a compromise that may hopefully avoid a future “no-deal”.
If an Article 50 extension is not invoked or requested, and a “no-deal” Brexit ensues on 29 March as feared, some level of blame should be apportioned to those who failed to heed the lessons learned from Greenland’s exit from the EEC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-vote-front-pages-4566242-Mar2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons will today debate and vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal for a third time.
It had been unsure whether House Speaker John Bercow would allow another vote on May’s deal, after stating that substantial changes would have to be made to what MPs were voting on.
A workaround was found as the two previous votes were on the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration on the Future Relationship; today’s vote will only be on the former.
“The motion is new, substantially different,” Bercow told parliament, adding that he would accept amendments to the Brexit deal.
However, there was confusion in the parliament after Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom said this wouldn’t be a ‘Meaningful Vote’.
MPs were unsure as to whether it was legally acceptable to split the two documents; Bercow said it wasn’t a matter for him to decide whether it was legal, only whether it was orderly.
One MP pointed out that the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration were “two horns on a goat’s head” and cannot be separated. Bercow replied that it was a political issue, but not an issue for him as chair.
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the motion was “perfectly reasonable and perfectly lawful”, adding that “we could not let the time to expire tomorrow” without giving a chance for MPs to vote whether to allow May’s deal and avoid a no-deal Brexit.
The vote will take place on the original date that the UK was due to leave the EU, 29 March. This has been pushed back to 12 April if the deal is rejected, and 22 May if the deal is passed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mps-backstop-alternative-4466150-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan 2019
THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted to back an amendment seeking to replace the Irish backstop with unspecific “alternative arrangements”.
The amendment passed by 317 votes to 301.
Although the EU has repeatedly ruled out renegotiating the withdrawal agreement already agreed with Theresa May’s government, MPs this evening backed supporting new alternatives to avoid a hard border in Ireland which would ditch the backstop altogether.
It is not immediately clear what these arrangements would be, and how something that isn’t the backstop would ensure no hard border.
This vote represents a major boost for the Prime Minister, and gives her the backing of parliament to go back to the EU to try to renegotiate on the issue of the backstop – but it is a renegotiation the EU has repeatedly said won’t happen.
Speaking immediately after the vote, Theresa May said there was now a clear route towards getting some form of a Brexit deal passed in the House of Commons, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he’d be willing to meet the prime minister on how to move forward in talks.
European Council President Donald Tusk also responded to the vote, with a spokesperson saying the withdrawal agreement – including backstop – is not up for renegotiation.
The Irish government was also adamant there would be no renegotiation in its reaction.
“The EU position on the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council,” it said. “It has not changed.
Brady Amendment
The amendment managed to unite MPs from opposing views on the matter, with supporters including arch-Brexiteers within the Conservatives such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, and remainers such as Nicky Morgan.
It would seek a redrafting of the plans for the backstop, with the plan also to seek an extension to the transition period – the time where the trade and other matters operates the same as it did prior to the UK leaving the EU – until 2021.

The proposal also received the support of the DUP and its 10 MPs.
The amendment put forward by Sir Graham Brady, who said if the motion was approved by Parliament, it would give May “enormous firepower” to go back to Brussels and renegotiate the Brexit divorce deal.
Prime Minister May also backed the Brady amendment, and urged MPs to follow suit earlier today.
She told the House of Commons today it would send a message to the EU that she could win support for her withdrawal plans if the backstop was dropped from the deal.
“We have the chance to show the European Union what it will take to get a deal through this House of Commons. What it will take to move beyond the confusion, division and uncertainty that now hangs over us,” she said.
However, May also accepted there was “limited appetite among our European partners” to changing the Brexit deal, which took almost two years to negotiate.
Speaking in the Commons following the vote, Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford said that by rejecting the backstop, “the Conservative party has effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement” and “ripped apart a treaty that has secured peace on the island of Ireland”.
DUP MP Nigel Dodds rejected this assertion and said it was “utterly reckless” to speak in those terms.
‘Groundhog day’
Speaking yesterday, Sabine Weyand, deputy to EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said: “There’s no negotiation between the EU and the UK. That negotiation is finished.
She added Britain risked crashing out of the EU without a deal “by accident” because London cannot decide what it wants.
French President Emmanuel Macron also said this evening that the current Brexit deal on the table is the best agreement possible and is not renegotiable”, as the UK plots re-entering talks.
MPs rejected all of the other amendments earlier, with one exception.
The Spelman amendment was passed – with 318 vs 310 voting in favour of stating the UK cannot leave the EU without a deal. That vote however, is not legally binding and is largely symbolic.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cross-border-cooperation-brexit-4564775-Mar2019/,"COMMUNITY GROUPS FROM across the island of Ireland and the United Kingdom are devising an agreement that aims to improve cooperation between grassroots organisations.
The plan, entitled Towards a New Common Chapter (NCC), is the culmination of more than four years of work.
Community organisations from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales have been involved in developing the agreement.
The project started in late 2014 and, as such, predates Brexit and the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly by some time.
One of the driving forces behind the initiative is the Centre for Cross Border Studies in Armagh.

@antsoares67explaining the next steps which will take place in production of the#NewCommonChapterafter today’s Evaluation seminar.pic.twitter.com/rPdLYSr866
Dr Anthony Soares, the centre’s deputy director, said the chapter was not created in response to the political situation in the North or Britain leaving the European Union but obviously has to take both into consideration.
“Extensive work had been done before Brexit became a thing. This is not a reaction to Brexit, but we do refer to it in the chapter.
Soares said Brexit and the Stormont collapse have highlighted the importance of “maintaining relations between communities on a North-South and East-West basis” and repairing “any damage to relations” that has been done.
Another issue highlighted by Brexit is the lack of knowledge many politicians, some in high-ranking posts, appear to have in relation to Northern Ireland and its history.
Soares said comments made during the long-running Brexit debate have shown that certain politicians have “a lack of knowledge of what we consider to be some really basic aspects of life here and how the Good Friday Agreement is structured”.
He added that some people in the Republic also fall into this category, stating:
Soares noted thatStrand Three of the GFAsets out how governments in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales should work together to promote cooperation for the benefit of all citizens.

Soares stressed that the NCC project is not political – the chapter’s wording clearly sets out that it “must not be used for party-political purposes” – but noted that representatives will enage with politicians in a bid to ensure policies don’t obstruct the type of cooperation they’re trying to create.
The organisations involved include several women’s groups such as the Northern Ireland Rural Women’s Network and Women’s Manifesto as well as community organisations including Irish in Britain (England), the Wales Council for Voluntary Action, Irish Community Care Merseyside (England) and Engender (Scotland).
An evaluation seminar was held in Belfast on Thursday and the final wording of the agreement is set to published in the coming weeks.
“At the end of really intense discussions among representatives of community groups from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, who showed huge commitment to the New Common Chapter, it was agreed that the final version was almost ready,” Soares toldTheJournal.ie.
He said certain elements of the agreement are being redrafted “to ensure they are applicable beyond the island of Ireland context”.

Soares added that the notion of cooperating across borders “may sometimes be seen in Great Britain as something of importance to communities on the island of Ireland and not something of relevance to those in Great Britain”.
He said this approach fails to take maritime borders into consideration.
Good Friday Agreement
An original Common Chapter was devised following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The initiative was included in the Northern Ireland Structural Funds Plan 2000-2006 and the Republic of Ireland’s National Development Plan 2000-2006.
It set out the two governments’ priorities for cooperation and how funds, particularly EU funds, would be used to support it.
Within the 2000-2006 period for which these plans were designed devolution in Northern Ireland was suspended, and following the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007 the Common Chapter was not revived.
The NCC, more than a decade later, aims to rectify this.
“It was problematic that it kind of disappeared. We thought, ‘What about creating a new version?’ Instead of between the two governments, we decided to try it from a bottom-up approach,” Soares said.
He added that a North-South consultative forum was proposed in the GFA but never came about, stating: “There is the British-Irish Council but no equivalent for civil interests.”
Fear about North-South cooperation
Soares said one of the first things organisers of the NCC had to do was look into whether or not grassroots groups “had the same desire to cooperate”.
“Do community groups believe in the idea of cooperation? Do they actually think it is a good thing?”
Soares said these were basic but essential questions, noting there are “differing approaches towards the idea of cooperation”.
The chapter notes that the organisations taking part in the project must acknowledge and respect “the differences that make these islands what they are, while also recognising and cherishing the relations between the communities that live in its different nations and regions”.
Its wording states that the initiative aims to promote social justice and equality, but do so:
‘Forgetting there is a border’
Soares said the next stage of the process “will be harder”; community groups in every jurisdiction will engage with political representatives in a bid to impact relevant policy.
Soares said the issue may not be a priority for some politicians, giving the UK Shared Prosperity Fund as an example. The British government aims to use this fund to replace EU Structural and Investment Funds.
“As it’s designed, there is no space for cross-border cooperation between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
“The border is mentioned every five seconds whenever Brexit is being discussed, the backstop is mentioned every two seconds. Despite this it’s as though when designing this new policy they’re forgetting that there is a border,” he said, noting that the NCC aims to change this.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-laws-4457509-Jan2019/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT has published a list of some of the laws that will need to be changed here to ensure continuity of various services and rights between Ireland and the UK in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
In a statement released this afternoon, the Department of Foreign Affairs said that it has published the general scheme of the proposed primary laws that will need to be introduced in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
TheGeneral Scheme of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Billis what’s known as an Omnibus Bill.
It is made up of 17 different parts and is prepared by nine ministers across different government departments.
The government said that the plans are part of its Brexit Contingency Action Plan, which will be brought into effect in the case of the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March if no deal is reached and approved by all sides involved in negotiations.
The proposed laws deal with many different areas of Irish society and how it connects with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, including citizens’ rights, transport, taxation and security cooperation, among others.
Ireland is distinct from the other EU countries in terms of its relationship with Britain.
The two share the Common Travel Area, which allows for the free movement of people across countries and affords rights to Irish and UK citizens separate from broader EU rights.
As well as this, both Ireland and the UK are committed to ensuring  the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Peace Process are fully maintained no matter what the outcome of Brexit is.
The legislation being brought forward relates to many areas of Irish life.
Healthcare
The proposed laws will allow for the provision of healthcare between Ireland the UK to continue as it has before.
This means that the HSE will be able to cover the cost of healthcare provided in the UK under the same conditions as currently, meaning where treatments are not provided under Ireland’s own healthcare system or for an Irish person who becomes ill while on a visit to the UK and needs immediate health care there.
It will also cover people from the UK living or visiting here as before.
Advertisement
Education
Under the proposed new laws the Susi student maintenance grant will still be payable to eligible Irish students going to study in the UK and visa versa.
Social Protection
The laws will allow for the continued payment of 21 social protection benefits, including payments such as old age pensions, illness benefits and child benefit. Workers whose UK-based employer becomes insolvent will also be protected under this legislation.
Consumer Protection
The DFA said that the laws would be to ensure an adequate degree of consumer protection would be in place for consumers who have already bought financial service products before the date of Brexit.
In terms of the other sectors of Irish society, the legislation coversTransport,Energy,TaxationandJustice and Security.
Transport
The bill will provide a statutory basis for cross border rail services (the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise) and bus services, in order to ensure continued service provision for passengers and commuters on the island of Ireland.
Energy
The proposals are designed to allow for the continued operation of the all-island Single Electricity Market in the context of a no-deal Brexit, pending longer term provisions in this area.
Justice and Security
The Bbll will allow for measures to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK and to facilitate ongoing immigration cooperation arrangements when the UK leaves the EU.
The government has said that it hopes to have the Bill passed through the Oireachtas before 29 March – the date on which the UK would crash out of the EU in the case of a no-deal outcome.
The bill is not due to be introduced into the Dáil until February and will be debated on the floor there.
The DFA said that instead of proceeding to Committee Stage after the first round of debates in the Dáil, the bill may be debated on the floor of the House instead of a t committee level. This is due to the sizable scope and nature of the legislation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-window-4466798-Jan2019/,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has compared the British government’s latest negotiating tactic to saying ”unless you give me what I want I’m jumping out the window”.
Last night, 317 MPs voted in favour of an amendment that proposes to remove the backstop and replace it was unspecified “alternative arrangements”, in what was the first indication that the House of Commons had a majority for some kind of Brexit deal.
The EU and Irish government responded by saying that the Withdrawal Agreement wouldn’t be renegotiated. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maasalso tweeted outto say that “on the backstop, Germany and the entire Union are firmly on Ireland’s side. We will not allow Ireland to be isolated on this issue”.
Meanwhile, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told aBritish committee on Northern Irelandthis morning that it would be possible to renegotiate the backstop if they found “a ladder for the Irish government to climb down”.
Raab also accused the Taoiseach of leaking inaccurate information to the media about a meeting he and Coveney had about the backstop. Raab said that he and Coveney had agreed to keep the meeting private, and that he never proposed a three-month expiry to the backstop.

Speaking to the committee about his time as Brexit Secretary, he said:
There is less than 60 days to go before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March.
Last night, Theresa May told the House of Commons that the vote to replace the backstop would be put to the EU, to try to get a Brexit agreement before that date. If that doesn’t happen, the UK will leave with no deal, which is the worst case scenario for the UK, the EU and Ireland.
(The) state of the Union
In an impassioned speech given today at the Institute of International and European Affairs, Coveney said that the idea of alternative arrangements had already been considered as part of the two-year Brexit negotiations.

“…there are currently no alternative arrangements, which anyone has put forward, which achieve what both sides are determined to achieve – to avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, and to protect the all-island economy, North-South cooperation and the Good Friday Agreement.”
He added that it was “highly unfortunate” that there was only one party from Northern Ireland that represents a minority view on Brexit taking its seats in Westminster.
He added that although he respects the DUP, which is in government with Theresa May’s Tories and who oppose the backstop, that any outcome for Northern Ireland that has “winners and losers” would negatively impact the Peace Process.
What would this new backstop look like?

Speaking about the backstop, Raab said that he thought ‘the sunset clause’, or an exit clause was “an eminently sensible proposal”.
“And what was clear to me, was that in Dublin – I don’t want to get into their domestic politics – but politically, they’re taking a very firm line on a deadline. And therefore it seemed to me, in terms of coming to a solution that worked for all sides, a more pragmatic approach was an exit mechanism. And that was discussed at great length with all the relative Cabinet members particularly the Attorney General.
He said that as late as October, based on his discussions with the Irish government, that option of an exit mechanism was “probably still in play”.
“I think the crucial thing to change the backstop is to change from the high legistered alignment paradigm of avoiding a hard border, to moving to a technologically decentralised, process-driven approach.
“I think, not only does that makes sense in commerce, but in sovereignty. Whether it’s in relation to the backstop as a whole, or whether its finite so it allows us to transition to a technologically driven approach, either of those two options would be acceptable.”
DUP member Jim Shannon then asked this of Raab:
“It can be done, the question now is whether there is a political choice,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passport-applications-2-4546305-Mar2019/,"MORE THAN 230,000 applications for Irish passports have been made to date in 2019.
This marks a 30% increase compared to the same period last year.
There were more than 860,000 Irish passports issued in 2018 – the highest number ever issued in one year.
The Passport Office said there are a number of reasons for this increase in demand, including a tendency towards early renewal and an increase in the number of Irish people travelling.
Over 70% of all passport applications last year came from the island of Ireland.

Brexit is also playing a role, as British citizens are unsure of how leaving the EU may impact future travel plans.
One in five(22%) of all passport application in 2018 were made by people from Northern Ireland and the UK.
To meet the increased demand, the online passport renewal service was expanded in late 2018 to allow both children and adults to renew online. Seven in 10 applications are now made online.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney urged people to check that their passports are in date in advance of planning a holiday.
Coveney said “significant extra resources” have been given to the Passport Office to meet the increased demand, including hundreds of extra employees for processing and customer service.
During St Patrick’s weekend in 2018, over 2,500 people applied using the online service. This figure is expected to be double that number this year.

THERESA MAY HAS asked that Brexit be delayed until 30 June amid ongoing negotiations aimed at getting British MPs to agree a way forward.
The Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union has been rejected by the House of Commons three times in recent months.
“It is frustrating that we have not yet brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion,” the British Prime Minister wrote ina letter to Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, today.
In the letter, May stated that should MPs agree a deal before 30 June, the proposed extension would be “terminated early”.
However, she added that the UK will continue to prepare to take part in the European Parliament elections in May as a precaution.

“The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible.”
May said the British government “remains strongly committed” to an orderly Brexit and “will continue to act as a constructive and responsible member state of the European Union in according with the duty of sincere cooperation throughout this unique period”.
‘Flexible’ extension
It’s understood Tusk will suggest to member states that they offer Britain a flexible 12-month Brexit delay to allow it time to prepare an orderly withdrawal.
“This is Tusk’s idea,” a senior EU official told AFP, confirming news reports. “It will be presented to member states today.”
The European Council last month agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if MPs backed May’s deal. As the deal was again rejected in the House of Commons, a new deadline of next week was set.
As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday, 12 April. An extraordinary EU summit is set to be held on Wednesday, 10 April.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-6-4451348-Jan2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has announced her much-anticipated “plan B” on Brexit, after her original deal was roundly defeated last week.
May said she plans to return to Brussels to discuss changes to the deal she agreed with EU leaders last month, despite an overwhelming rejection of the draft text by MPs last week.
“I believe we can make progress” on the so-called Irish backstop, she told parliament, adding that she would be consulting with MPs about possible changes and “then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU”.
Addressing the House of Commons, she said after last week’s vote it became “clear the government’s approach had to change”.
The UK prime minister ruled out holding a second referendum, as it would create a concerning precedent.
May added that it could “damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy”.
She said everyone had to work together to find a solution, adding that there is widespread concerns around Britain leaving the EU with no deal.
“The right way to rule out no-deal is for this House to approve a deal with the European Union,” she said.
The other way to rule out a no-deal would be to revoke Article 50, but she ruled this out as it would go against the referendum result.

No reopening of Good Friday Agreement
On reports that the Good Friday Agreement might be reopened, she said she wanted to be absolutely clear that she will not reopen the Belfast Agreement. She said this was never considered.
Addressing the issue of the controversial backstop, she said there is a fear the UK could be “trapped” in the backstop.
She promised to hold further conversations on this issue, and will then take the feedback from these talks back to the EU.
May said will now meet with the DUP, members of the opposition, trade unions, and members of civil society so as to be more “open and inclusive”.

In her speech today, May said she will scrap fees for EU citizens who want to stay in Britain.
Having listened to concerns from members and organisations, she confirmed that when the new scheme is rolled out the British government “will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals who wish to stay and anyone who has or will apply during the pilot fee will have their fee reimbursed”.
While May hopes to win over Tory Brexiteer MPs and the DUP, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said nothing had changed and said the prime minister had offered nothing new.
Britain will leave the European Union on March 29 without any new arrangements in place unless MPs can agree to an alternative or modified plan that the bloc can also accept.
London and Brussels have spent the best part of two years working on May’s agreement, but MPs in parliament’s lower House of Commons comprehensively rejected it last week.
DUP and SDLP response
Following Theresa May’s statement, the DUP’s Westminster Leader Nigel Dodds MP said:
“We welcome the commitment by the Prime Minister to rule out an extension to Article 50, the waiving of the £65 fee for EU nationals residing in the United Kingdom and the recognition that the necessary legal changes to the withdrawal agreement must be secured from Brussels.
But he focused on the sticking point of the backstop, saying: “We want to see a consensus in the House of Commons around a deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom but also the European Union and our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. The backstop is the problem and that is where the focus must lie.”
Meanwhile, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MLA hit out at May following her statement, saying her commitment to the Good Friday Agreement was “superficial”.
He said that “it is not possible to fluff the backstop” and urged politicians in the North of Ireland to “yield power” to stop the Brexit chaos as “London panders to the DUP against Northern Ireland’s interests.”
Eastwood commented:
“It is crystal clear that the British Government’s commitment to the Good Friday Agreement is superficial. Theresa May can’t have it both ways. She cannot drag Northern Ireland out of the EU without agreeing the Backstop and expect to avoid a hard border. We have been through this time and time again – but Theresa May either doesn’t get it or doesn’t care. However the SDLP, the EU and the Irish Government are clear that the Backstop is non-negotiable.”
He said that the statement today “proves only one point – that the British State is in chaos”.
“We have reached a critical point and with that politicians here cannot simply point the finger,” said Eastwood.
“Sinn Féin, despite being gifted power to sit in Westminster, have abdicated their responsibilities. They have let the DUP take back control and silence the voice of Irish nationalism. Politicians now need to yield the power given to them to stop this Brexit chaos, that’s both in Westminster and in Stormont. Time is up and compromising our peace and our freedoms on this island is not an option. The SDLP want to go back to Stormont, we want Irish voices fighting against the DUP and Tories.”

BRITISH MPS HAVE voted to force Prime Minister Theresa May to quickly set out an alternative plan for Brexit if she loses a crucial vote on her EU withdrawal deal next week, in a second parliamentary defeat in 24 hours.
The House of Commons voted to reduce the time the government has to outline a Plan B from 21 days to three if, as expected, lawmakers reject the Brexit agreement in a vote next Tuesday.
The amendment, written and tabled by Dominic Grieve, passed with a majority of 308 to 297 this afternoon.

Members of May’s own Conservative party led the revolt amid fears that the current timetable takes Britain too close to crashing out of the European Union on 29 March with no deal at all.
It was the second setback in as many days for the prime minister, after MPs voted late last night to deny the government certain taxation powers in a no-deal scenario – another attempt to avoid such an outcome.
Speaking to MPs earlier, May said: “The only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal.”
But her spokesman added: “If that were not to take place… we would respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward.”
Opposition Labour spokesman Keir Starmer said MPs could then start debating alternatives to her plan – and raised the prospect of delaying Brexit.
“I actually genuinely think we can’t do it on 29 March this year. It’s simply not viable, for so many practical reasons,” he told the Commons.
‘Cosmetic’ changes
The parliamentary manoeuvres came at the start of five days of debate on the deal May struck with the EU last November, which has been strongly opposed from lawmakers on all sides.
She set out further clarifications she hopes will win over her own Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her government in parliament.
The most controversial element of the agreement is the “backstop” arrangement, which could see Northern Ireland continue to follow certain EU trade rules after Brexit to avoid border checks with Ireland.
The government has now offered guarantees to devolved politicians in the province over the operation of the backstop, and on the free flow of trade between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.

But DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the proposals were “meaningless and cosmetic”.
May is also seeking assurances on the operation of the backstop from European leaders, which she hopes to deliver before the vote next week, although they say they will not reopen the deal.
The prime minister has already postponed the vote once – in December – to avoid defeat by MPs, but has insisted next week’s will go ahead.
No deal fears
May has warned that if MPs reject her deal, Britain would still leave the EU on 29 March, with or without any new arrangements.
Britain triggered two-year legal withdrawal process in March 2017 that will run its course unless London actively seeks to delay or revoke it.
One of her own ministers this week raised the idea of a delay, which has been the source of speculation for weeks in Brussels, but May has rejected the idea.
Both this week’s revolts were driven by Conservative MPs seeking to prevent a “no deal” scenario, which they fear would cause huge economic disruption.
Late last night, 303 MPs – including more than a dozen former Conservative ministers – voted to restrict the government’s taxation powers in a “no deal” scenario, against 296 who backed May.
The government said it was an “inconvenience” but would not stop its preparations for leaving the EU.
Today’s amendment, which passed by 308 votes to 297, has more weight. It states that if May loses the vote next week, she must explain her next steps within three parliamentary sitting days – by the latest, Monday 21 January.
She would then have a further seven days to put a motion to the House of Commons, which MPs could amend to try to direct the government’s strategy.
There was a major row in the Commons over whether today’s amendment could even be put to a vote, with Speaker John Bercow apparently disregarding the advice of his own clerk that it could not.
Several Conservative MPs accused Bercow of being biased, and there was speculation of an attempt to remove him from his post.
Labour has said it will seek a confidence vote in the government if it loses next week, and is also likely to press for a general election.

“So far the government isn’t proposing any changes to the deal,” Labour MP Keir Starmer told SkyNews.
“In particular, it’s not countenancing any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration, obviously, that’s disappointing. Compromise requires change.”
Starmer added that the party want the talks to continue but that it needs to see a change to the deal if it’s going to compromise.
However, a Downing Street spokesperson has claimed that the government has “made serious proposals”.
“We have made serious proposals in talks this week and are prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides.
“We are ready to hold further detailed discussions this weekend in order to seek any such changes in the run up to European Council on Wednesday. The government is determined to work constructively to deliver the Brexit people voted for, and avoid participation in the European Parliamentary elections.”
Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the bloc that includes its participation in a customs union.
May had previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States.

Brextension
Earlier today, Theresa May asked that Brexit be delayed until 30 June amid ongoing negotiations aimed at getting British MPs to agree a way forward.
DUP leader Arlene Foster slammed May’s plea to Brussels for an extension to Article 50 calling it “unsurprising but unsatisfactory”.

In a letter to Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, the British Prime Minister stated that should MPs agree a deal before 30 June, the proposed extension would be “terminated early” but said that the UK will continue to prepare to take part in the European Parliament elections in May as a precaution.
“It should not have been like this,” Arlene Foster said in a statement, adding that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU has become “chaotic because of intransigence in Brussels and ineffectiveness in London”.
Foster was also critical of May’s talks with the Labour party, saying she “should not waste any extension by subcontracting the UK’s future to Jeremy Corbyn”.
“This time should be used to get a better deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom so the entire nation can leave the European Union together,” Foster said.
‘Flexible’ extension
It’s understood Tusk will suggest to member states that they offer Britain a flexible 12-month Brexit delay to allow it time to prepare an orderly withdrawal.
“This is Tusk’s idea,” a senior EU official told AFP, confirming news reports. “It will be presented to member states today.”
The European Council last month agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if MPs backed May’s deal. As the deal was again rejected in the House of Commons, a new deadline of next week was set.
Early today, France’s European Affairs Minister said the country opposes giving Britain an additional extension to its exit from the EU unless it produces a “clear” plan with “credible political backing”.
In a statement sent to AFP, Amelie de Montchalin said President Emmanuel Macron’s government had “read with interest” British Prime Minister Theresa May’s letter to the EU asking for an extension until June 30.
“As the Prime Minister rightly wrote, the current impasse is not in the best interest of neither the UK nor the EU. It cannot be allowed to continue,” Montchalin said.
But EU leaders had taken a “clear decision” at their last summit on March 21, she said.
“Another extension requires that the UK puts forward a plan with a clear and credible political backing,” she said.
As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday, 12 April. An extraordinary EU summit is set to be held on Wednesday, 10 April.

His comments come ahead of a visit from a Congressional Delegation from the US House of Representatives, which today begins a two-day fact-finding visit to Ireland.
The delegation will be led by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and will include several members of the Friends of Ireland caucus.
The delegation will meet with the Taoiseach at Government Buildings this afternoon, following a lunch hosted by the Tánaiste.
Tomorrow, the Taoiseach will host a dinner at Dublin Castle in honour of the delegation.
Visas for Irish people
Speaking toTheJournal.ieahead of the visit, he said he plans to discuss a range of issues including trade, visas, immigration and Brexit.
However, he said he would never make the US choose between Ireland and the UK when it comes to Brexit.
In relation to getting more visas for Irish people to work in America, the Taoiseach said he is determined to get the E3 visa deal “over the line”.
Varadkar hinted that the visit is part of a fresh push to get the E3 Visa Bill passed in the US.
Congressman Richard Neal, who is a supporter of the E3 visa Bill, is among the US delegation. The Taoiseach said the plan is to get the Bill reintroduced and passed by Congress and the Senate.

“We want to get this thing called the E3 visa over the line allow more young Irish people, generally graduates, to work in America. America is largely closed off,” said Varadkar.
The Taoiseach said he would also like to see more American students coming to Ireland, as well as retirees and skilled workers.
“So, it would go both ways,” he added.
The undocumented Irish in America is also on the agenda, though the Taoiseach said “it is a very difficult issue”.
“It is a bigger issue than just an Irish issue, because it applies to so many Latinos as well, but I do want to talk about that and find a comprehensive solution to that.”

In an interview with the 60 Minutes TV programme over the weekend, Pelosi hit out at US President Donald Trump, stating that he should not be the president.
Political opponents
When asked if he agreed with Pelosi, the Taoiseach said Pelosi is a liberal Democrat.
“Donald Trump is not, though he was a Democrat at one stage, though he is not at the moment, nowhere close to it. So they are political opponents. Though it was interesting to see on St Patrick’s Day they were at least willing to cooperate on certain issues, so I think there is maturity in that relationship maybe that perhaps doesn’t exist in some of the other relationships,” he said.
Varadkar was perhaps unaware of the scathing tweets that US President Donald Trump sent about Pelosi following her TV interview, in which he called the interview a “puff piece” and said Pelosi had “lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done”.
The scathing tweets directed at Pelosi are seen as a departure for Trump. Despite their differences, the pair rarely engage in Twitter spats with one another.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said those that advocated for Brexit “have been chasing unicorns for a very long time”.
Speaking for the first time since yesterday’s Brexit Westminster vote, Varadkar said there is a “rich irony” that theUK’s tariff proposalsintend to treat Northern Ireland differently to Great Britain.
Addressing the media at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington DC today where he is kicking of the St Patrick’s Day celebrations, Varadkar was asked about the letter sent by a little girl to Donald Tusk saying Britain and the EU “should be friends”. The letter was finished with a drawing of a unicorn.
‘Chasing unicorns’
“I think a lot of people that advocated unicorns have been chasing unicorns for a very long time and as we head into the next few weeks it should be patently obvious to everyone that unicorns only exist in fairytales,” said Varadkar.
He added:
“I would say to people that advocate Brexit, is this really what you want?
“Protectionism, tariffs, borders, restrictions on trade, is this what Brexit was really all about?”
He said for those who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement on the basis that they feared Northern Ireland might be treated differently as a result of the backstop, “it must be evident to them now that it’s the UK Government’s intention to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom and to do so within the next few months”.
Varadkar added:
He said “inevitably Northern Ireland would become a back door to the single market”.
Varadkar said this would result in checks being needed at Northern Ireland’s ports in a matter of months.

Tariffs
Today, the UK government announced that there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
While there will be no tariffs imposed by the UK on goods moving across the land border into Northern Ireland, tariffs will also not be applied to around 87% – up from 80% at present – of imports in a no-deal Brexit to the rest of the UK under a temporary scheme.
The tariffs on various goods where they will be applied are presented by the UK government as a percentage of the “most favoured nation” (MFN) – this is the tariff imposed by the EU on imports from countries that they do not have a free trade agreement with.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will become one of these countries. Currently, no tariffs are paid on the import of goods from Ireland into mainland UK, for example, but that would change in a no-deal.
The Taoiseach was also asked if the proposals on tariffs will effectively create a smugglers paradise in Northern Ireland.

In his response, Varadkar said what will happen is European Law and European Customs code will apply so the common external tariff will apply to any goods exported from the United Kingdom to the European Union.

“And obviously that will have a severe impact on the British economy and on the Northern Ireland economy in particular. That’s why you’ve seen the reaction today from British business, from British farmers, Northern Ireland business, Northern Ireland farmers very concerned about what the UK is proposing and the impact that it’s going to have on their economy,” he said.
As more votes go on this evening, does the Taoiseach think the deal is dead?
“That’s still a matter for Westminster. It’s possible that there will be a future vote, and possible that they may yet ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.
“But from the point of Ireland, and the point of view of the European Union, we really went the extra mile in the last couple of days to try to get the withdrawal agreement over the line – to try to give the British government and the British parliament the assurances that they needed. That failed, that didn’t work, and we have no confidence now that any further assurances would work either,” he said, adding:
“So there is no point in the British government asking for changes or further concessions – because they have demonstrated twice now that they are unable to get an agreement, once made, over the line. So there is no point in asking for further concessions.”
Extending Article 50
While the Irish government has always been open to an extension to Article 50 which would push out Brexit, the Taoiseach said today there has to be a reason for drawing it out.
“I think an extension has to have a purpose. That’s really what we need to hear from London in the next couple of days after they have their various votes today and tomorrow and perhaps if there are more votes too.
“If there is an extension, what’s the point to it. We don’t want a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions that they have to make get put off until the end of June, the end of July or September. That is not going to work for anyone,” he said.
When asked what his preference would be, he said it would depend what the purpose of the extension is.
St Patrick’s Day
While Brexit is dominating the news back home, the Taoiseach has a jam-packed week of events in the US.
Varadkar said there “is a real understanding of the unique nature of Northern Ireland, the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the need to protect the peace in Northern Ireland and how that is so much more important than any economic considerations. That is well understood.
“People mightn’t understand the details of withdrawal agreements and backstop and European law and all of those things, but they do understand the Good Friday Agreement is paramount. That we must have on the island of Ireland, free movement of people and free trade and protection of the peace process”
Will he be asking US President Donald trump for any help with Brexit.
“Certainly if the president is open to wanting a Special Envoy to Northern Ireland that would be very welcome. We know historically that when the United States has taken an interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland it has helped bring peace to conclusion so that will certainly be welcome.
“We’re not asking anyone here in America to take sides between the UK and the European Union and Ireland. We know they will want to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK into the future and we also want to negotiate a free trade agreement between the US and the EU and would like to do that before there is any agreement with the UK, but we will be saying to them of course that the Good Friday Agreement has to be paramount, that the peace process has to be paramount.
He said the US was so involved in making the Good Friday agreement possible and in helping to bring about peace in Northern Ireland.
“What we’ll be saying to them of course that we would ask that no trade deal that is done with the UK should ever undermine the peace process,” he concluded.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has arrived in Dublin this evening for talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as she continues to try to seek concessions on the Irish backstop.
Varadkar greeted May at Farmleigh and they will both attend dinner together.
May’s visit comes after both leaders held talks in Brussels earlier in the week, with both Ireland and the EU refusing to entertain dropping the backstop from the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This backstop that would ensure no hard border in Ireland was agreed in the withdrawal agreement between May’s government and the EU before Christmas, but that was voted down heavily in the House of Commons last month.
Since then, May has changed tack and, with the support of her party, has gone back to try to convince Brussels and Dublin to drop the requirement of the backstop.
All this has heightened the threat of a no-deal Brexit, with the UK’s set leaving date from the EU of 29 March now looming large on the horizon.

Varadkar and May both visited Northern Ireland earlier today for talks with local political parties.

Speaking during the visit, Varadkar said: “Today is an opportunity for me, really, to listen to different perspectives, to hear what people have to say, and maybe just to collect some suggestions as to how we might move forward.
“The withdrawal agreement and the backstop are not up for negotiation.”
He repeated that the EU could discuss changes to a statement on future ties that accompanies the Brexit deal, and “what assurances may be given that would assist this agreement being ratified”.

In London, May’s spokeswoman repeated that she was seeking “legally binding changes” to the deal.
And May’s Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said after meeting Varadkar that they could not support anything less.
“Interpretations, guarantees, assurances won’t cut it. The backstop is the problem in the withdrawal agreement and it is that that has got to be addressed,” DUP lawmaker Nigel Dodds said.
Given their entrenched positions, Varadkar was asked what the point was of his talks with May.
“Everybody wants to avoid no deal, everybody wants to avoid a hard border and everyone wants to continue to have a very close political and economic relationship between Britain and Ireland,” he said.
“So there’s much more that unites us than divides us, I think. Time is running short and we need to get to an agreement as soon as possible.”

THE SPEAKER OF the House of Commons, John Bercow, has confirmed that MPs will vote on seven motions to amend Theresa May’s EU withdrawal deal this evening.
The British Prime Minister is seeking “legal changes” to the agreement she negotiated with EU leaders last month, in a bid to try to secure the support of MPs for the deal.
The current agreement was rejected by 230 votes by MPs earlier this month, a move that could see the UK leave the EU without a deal on 29 March.
This afternoon, Bercow confirmed that a vote would take place on a motion tabled by Sir Graham Brady to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border in Ireland.
Conservative MP Graham Brady put forward his amendment yesterday, which is now expected to be backed by his party.
Brady said that if the motion was approved by Parliament, it would give May “enormous firepower” to go back to Brussels and renegotiate the Brexit divorce deal.
‘No negotiation’
The EU’s position in relation to the backstop has not changed, however, with Brussels insisting it will not re-open the deal.

Sabine Weyand, deputy to EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that negotiations are over.
She warned that Britain risked crashed out of the EU without a deal “by accident” because London cannot decide what it wants.
May spokesperson, however, said that the Prime Minister told her cabinet that “to win the support of the House of Commons, legal changes to the backstop will be required” and that EU leaders had made it clear that they want Britain to leave the EU on 29 March with a deal.
This, he said, “is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.”

Earlier today, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that her party is giving its endorsement to a proposal from a backbench MP which would see the backstop replaced by “alternative arrangements”.
Not binding
The other six amendments to be debated this evening include motions Labour MPs Yvette Cooper,  Jeremy Corbyn, and Rachel Reeves, Conservative MPs Dominic Grieve and Caroline Spelman, and Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party.
Cooper’s motion calls for a vote on a Bill that would allow Parliament to take control of the Brexit process if Theresa May does not secure a deal by 26 February, and would give MPs a vote to extend Article 50 to the end of the year and prevent a no-deal Brexit.
Meanwhile, Grieve’s motion hopes to similarly avoid a no-deal Brexit by taking control of Commons business for six days ahead of March 29 to allow MPs to reach a consensus on the withdrawal process.
Any motions which pass will not be legally binding, but are hoped to carry enough political weight to show Brussels the type of Brexit that MPs will most likely approve.
According to BBC, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that today was “a London day”, adding: “We have the vote tonight and then we’ll take it from there.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-quotes-2-4472966-Feb2019/,"IT WAS ANOTHER week of votes, spats and misinformation as the Brexit saga continues.
This week the British Parliament voted in favour of a proposal to go back to the EU to seek ‘alternative arrangements’ to replace the Irish backstop.
Here are some of the stand-out quotes from the week:
Boris Johnsonwas confidenton Monday that Theresa May would fight for a “freedom clause” from the EU.
“There is a very real risk of crash out. Not by design but by accident,”senior EU negotiator Sabine Weyandsaid that same day. She told reporters that the negotiation is finished and discussions about the backstop were “like Groundhog day”.
Weyand: 'We’re not going to reopen the Agreement. The result of the negotiation has been very much shaped by the UK negotiators, much more than they actually get credit for. This is a bit like snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The backstop was very much shaped by UK.'— Nick Gutteridge (@nickgutteridge)January 28, 2019Nick Gutteridge/ Twitter

On Tuesday DUP leaderArlene Fosterconfirmed her partywas endorsing a proposalwhich would see the backstop replaced by ‘alternative arrangements’.
And in doing so she took a pop at our government:
Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen had soundbites at the ready when he spoke to Channel 4′s Jon Snow:

The proposal received the backing of a majority of MPs when they voted in the House of Commons. Theresa Maytold the parliamentthat this would send a message to the European Union that she could win support for her plans if the backstop is removed:

“We have the chance to show the European Union what it will take to get a deal through this House of Commons. What it will take to move beyond the confusion, division and uncertainty that now hangs over us.”
On Thursday Tory MP John Whittingdale attempted to argue that there were officials in Europe who supported the UK’s position. He had trouble remembering who they were though…
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
It was dubbed‘Theresa’s Triumph’by the UK media but Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was not so complimentary the day after the vote:
He compared the British government’s latest negotiating tactic to saying“unless you give me what I want I’m jumping out the window”.
We also heard on Wednesday from former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab who told a British committee on Northern Ireland that it would be possible to renegotiate the backstop if they found “a ladder for the Irish government to climb down”. And he accused the Taoiseach of leaking inaccurate information to the media about a meeting he and Coveney had about the backstop.

The government rubbished these claims about Leo Varadkar leaking inaccurate information. Simon Coveney’s advisor said this was “pure spoof”.

And the week ended yesterdaywith a row over a footnotein a European Council document.
The document, laying out proposals to give British nationals short-stay, visa-free access to the EU’s borderless Schengen area after Brexit, described Gibraltar as “a colony of the British crown”.

Theresa May’s spokesperson said it was “completely unacceptable to describe Gibraltar in this way”.
“Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family and this will not change due to our exit from the EU.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-plan-4462652-Jan2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS suggested that British Prime Minister Theresa May is planning to fight for a “freedom clause” from the EU over Brexit.
Writing inThe Telegraph, the ex-foreign secretary said he has heard “from the lips of very senior sources” that May is planning to go to Brussels and renegotiate the Northern Ireland backstop.
Johnston said that winning a “freedom clause” would be “unadulterated good Brexit news” and that an exit mechanism will “defuse the booby trap” and give the UK a “way out” to negotiate a Canada-style trade deal with the EU.
However, Tánaiste Simon Coveney yesterday said attempts by Brexit supporters to remove or set a time-limit on a controversial “backstop” clause on the Irish border would never be accepted by Brussels.
“Listen to what people are saying in Europe,” he told BBC television, saying May’s Brexit deal was “a balanced package that isn’t going to change”.
“The European Parliament will not ratify a withdrawal agreement that doesn’t have a backstop in it, it’s as simple as that,” he added.
Johnson, however, said: “That backstop is dead, rejected by the biggest ever parliamentary majority; and that is why I hope and pray that I am right about the intentions of Number 10.
“If we mean it, if we really try, I have no doubt that the EU will give us the freedom clause we need. So now is the time to stiffen the sinews and summon up the blood and get on that trusty BAE 146 and go back to Brussels and get it.
Brexit showdown
Both Johnson and Coveney were speaking ahead of another showdown between May and the House of Commons over Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, which is scheduled for 29 March.

MPs this month rejected the divorce agreement she struck with the bloc last year.
On Tuesday night, in a series of votes on parliamentary amendments, they will set out what they want her to do next.
Some MPs want to delay Brexit or adopt a whole new strategy, but others are demanding changes to May’s deal that they suggest could allow them to support it.
These focus on the backstop, an arrangement intended to keep open the border between the UK and Ireland by temporarily tying London to the EU’s trade rules.
May has already spent months trying to amend the backstop with no success, but has promised to return to Brussels if that is what her MPs want.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied Coveney’s comments meant she could not succeed, telling the same BBC programme that he was taking a “negotiating position”.
He said Dublin did not want Britain to leave the EU without a deal, which is the default position if MPs cannot reach agreement.
The European Commission this week conceded that without a deal, controls would be reimposed on the Irish border, which all sides have warned could undermine the Northern Irish peace process.
“The idea the EU and the Irish government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen,” Hancock said.
Coveney repeated that Dublin would be open to amending an accompanying political declaration on future trading ties, to emphasise that the backstop may never be used.

https://www.thejournal.ie/central-bank-mortgage-rates-2-4516104-Feb2019/,"THOSE AGED BETWEEN 35 and 45, who bought their homes at the peak before the recession, will be the most impacted group of society if mortgage interest rates rise.
Mark Cassidy, Director of Economics and Statistics for the Central Bank of Ireland said this group of people who bought prior to the recession, are one of the most indebted and the “most vulnerable” to any income, house price or interest rate shocks.
Speaking to the Oireachtas Budgetry Oversight Committee today on on economic and fiscal risks, particularly in light of Brexit, Cassidy said while variable mortgage interest rates are higher than in many other EU countries, there is a high number of this vulnerable group on tracker mortgages.
The tracker mortgage rate has stayed relatively low, he said, as it is linked to the European Central Bank rate.
Cassidy said those that bought before the crisis have been largely “protected” due to the affordability of the tracker rate. However, he added that once the tracker rate increases “that cohort will see an increase in their payments” adding that there is a “potential financial risk there”.
While most are paying down their debt, he said the 35-45 age group of homeowners who bought at the peak of house prices in the boom “are highly indebted” and when tracker rates increase “will find themselves more stretched”.
Pay rises
Despite Brexit, the Central Bank believes workers are in line for pay increases of up to 7% over the next two years.
Cassidy told the committee today that as the country heads towards full employment “a further pick-up in wages” is expected.

Combined with expectations of modest inflation, he said it should translate into “higher real incomes and purchasing power for households”.
The Central Bank is forecasting the average increase per employee to increase from 2.8 % last year to 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2020.
He added that the country is seeing a very high rate in job vacancies, as well as job switching.
Speaking about the labour market, Cassidy said the unemployment rate is projected to drop from an average of 5.8% last year to 4.9% this year. It is expected to hit 4.7 per % in 2020.

Brexit
Discussing the risks of Brexit on the Irish economy, he said a disorderly Brexit and the  breakdown in some of the trade and customs arrangements would be immediately damaging to trade and the “functioning of supply chains for production, distribution and retailing”.
“It is clear that a ‘no deal’ scenario would have very severe and immediate disruptiveeffects, which would permeate almost all areas of economic activity. Certain sectors and regions would be disproportionately affected, particularly agriculture and food sectors as well as border regions and other rural regions with a heavy reliance on agriculture and a particular reliance on the UK as an export market,” said Cassidy.
“We estimate that a disorderly Brexit could reduce the growth rate of the Irish economy by up to four percentage points in the first year,” added the Central Bank official.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-daily-telegraph-press-ruling-4589170-Apr2019/,"THE DAILY TELEGRAPH has been ordered to correct a “misleading” claim by Boris Johnson that a no-deal Brexit was the public’s favoured way to leave the European Union.
The ruling was made by the UK’s Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), who found that the article breached the accuracy clause of the Editors’ Code of Practice.
It came on foot of a complaint to the organisation about an article by the former British foreign secretary headlined “The British people won’t be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for”, which was published on 7 January this year.
The article, a long-form opinion piece, saw Johnson set out his opposition to Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal deal, arguing instead for a no-deal Brexit.
In it, he claimed that fear of a no-deal Brexit had been greatly exaggerated by opponents to Brexit, and was in fact the public’s expectation of what would happen when they voted to leave the EU.
He wrote: “Of all the options suggested by pollsters – staying in the EU, coming out on Theresa May’ terms, or coming out on World Trade terms – it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity.
“In spite of – or perhaps because of – everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public.”
Front page
The member of the public who brought the complaint alleged that Johnson was inaccurate to claim that polls showed that a no-deal Brexit was more popular “by some margin” over remaining in the EU or leaving under Theresa May’s deal.
They said that no poll available at the time of publication, or provided by the publication in defence of Johnson’s statement supported his claims, and that the inaccuracy was exacerbated by the fact that Johnson and his column in the newspaper are high profile.
The complainant also noted that a news piece, which reported that Johnson had expressed the views in the article, also appeared on the newspaper’s front page.
In its response, the Daily Telegraph said that the article was clearly an opinion piece, and that readers would understand that Johnson’s statement was not invoking specific polling.
It also claimed that Johnson was entitled to make sweeping generalisations based on his opinions, and that the complainant had misconstrued the purpose of the article, which was clearly comically polemical and could not be reasonably read as serious.
Advertisement
The newspaper added that should the statement have been read literally, there were polls that supported the claim.
It pointed to one poll which showed that after support for a Canada-style trade deal and those who were unsure, respondents preferred a no-deal Brexit over Theresa May’s deal and remaining in the EU.
The Daily Telegraph also pointed to four other polls researching support for Brexit outcomes, and said that as polls were rarely identical or comparable, it was inevitable that there would be some degree of subjectivity involved in interpreting the results.
Accuracy failure
In its ruling, the IPSO committee said columnists are free under its code to campaign, be partisan, and to express strong opinions using hyperbole, melodrama and humour.
However, the committee pointed to an obligation under the code to ensure the accuracy of any claims of fact.
It also said that Johnson’s article made a factual claim, and in considering whether that claim had a basis in fact, it analysed the content of the five polls provided to it.
However, the committee said the newspaper had not provided any data which supported the claim that a no-deal Brexit was the option preferred “by some margin” over the three options listed, or that these represented “…all of the options suggested by pollsters”.
Rather, it found that the newspaper had construed the polls as signalling support for a no-deal Brexit when this was the result of the publication either amalgamating several findings together, or interpreting an option beyond what was set out in the poll.
It found that this represented a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article in breach of the accuracy clause of its code.
“The reference to the polling was not material to the author’s polemical argument,” it wrote.
“However, it was a significant inaccuracy, because it misrepresented polling information.”
The committee decided that the Daily Telegraph had therefore breached its editors’ code by giving a misleading impression that polling had found a statistical basis to support a no-deal Brexit.
However, as the inaccuracy was not material to the overall argument of the article, the committee considered that the newspaper should publish a correction which made clear that no poll had found that a no-deal Brexit was the most popular option.

THIS EVENING, MPS will gather in the House of Commons chamber to vote on whether to approve the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has to get at least 320 votes in order for her deal to pass – if she doesn’t get this, she has three or four main options available to her.
The first is toextend Article 50: at the moment there’s a legal obligation to leave the European Union by the 29 March 2019. The EU is reported to be reluctant to extend the timeline without a reasonable expectation that something will come of that extension.
There’s also another awkward milestone: the European Parliament elections in May. If the UK hasn’t left by this date, it might have to elect MEPs to the EU on a temporary basis, something both sides want to avoid.
Another option is ageneral electionor a Tory leadership challenge. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would table a motion of no confidence in the government if May’s Brexit deal fails to pass through the House of Commons.
If Labour were to come to power, Corbyn has said previously that he would call a second referendum if it’s what his party wants – this is despite Corbyn’s own Eurosceptic views – but has been inconsistent when questioned on this.
If there is a general election, this would mean the UK would have to ask the European Union for an extension to Article 50: it’s not clear if the leaders of the 27 EU member states would be happy to grant it on this basis, as it could lead to more uncertainty.
It’s not certain that the EU would grant an extension for a second referendum either (if one is held and the outcome is ‘Leave’, would negotiations begin again?)
Ano-deal Brexitis the other option – although no one on either side want this, it could still happen though a lack of agreement from the House of Commons on what MPs want.
If the deal does fail, Theresa May won’t have much time to choose one of these options either –an amendment voted for earlier this weekmeans that she will have just three days to come back to the House of Commons with a new plan.

So what’s the most likely option?
Feargal Cochrane – a Professor of International Conflict Analysis in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent – reckons there will be an extension.

“The EU are talking about July at the latest for [an extension] and they have been making arrangements on that basis. They are apparently already planning for an extension, and discussing it among themselves, which seems a little more organised than the UK side with both main parties publicly denying they want it.”
He says that it’s important to note that the UK can onlyrequestan extension – they do not have a right to it without agreement from the other 27 member states. He says that although it’s likely it will be granted, it’s possible that there will be conditions to it.
“The fact that there is an assumption about extension by sections of the UK media speaks to the wider malaise – namely lack of understanding of where the UK stands in relation to its EU counterparts.”
Irishman Ronan McCrea, Professor of Constitutional and European Law at University College London, says that the European Council is growing tired of discussing Brexit, and would need to see evidence of progression before agreeing to giving the UK more time to get their house in order.
“An extension needs the unanimous consent of the 27 states. Many states are not that interested in Brexit and resent the time and energy it is taking up.”
If there was evidence that the deal would pass through the House if they were given more time, or that they needed more time to hold a second referendum, then the likelihood of 27 member states agreeing to an extension is high. But the UK is still uncertain.
“There is, as yet, no sign of a British position that has majority support emerging.
Will Theresa May resign?

“I doubt that she will resign,” Cochrane says. “She has had plenty of opportunity over recent years given her hapless performance over Brexit and other issues but I doubt that she will.”
He said that statements by the Prime Minister to warn MPs that ‘no Brexit’ is more likely than ‘no deal’ could be a “damage limitation strategy so she keeps defeat down under 100 votes”.
Professor McCrea says it will be hard to win over MPs, given that they are “ideologically-driven”.
“The Withdrawal Agreement places significant limits on how a hard Brexit can ultimately be, so it’s unattractive to Brexiteer MPs.
Before MPs vote on her Brexit deal, there will be a long list of amendments that will also need to be voted on – when this process ends depends on how many amendments are passed, and if they have an impact on other amendments that are due to be voted on.
Last week, MPs voted to reduce the time that Theresa May has to produce her plan B from 21 days to just three days.
The vote on Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal Agreement will be held at 7pm tonight.

THE BRITISH LABOUR party leader Jeremy Corbyn has met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government buildings this morning.
The pair had a “detailed” discussion about Northern Ireland, Brexit and the current political landscape in the UK for an hour and a half.
In relation to Brexit, both sides are believed to have shared “serious concerns” about a No Deal scenario and the dangers that may come with it, “including the possibility that the UK may end up in a no deal situation by default unless alternatives are pursued”.
Varadkar and Corbyn’s discussion of Northern Ireland focused mainly on the need to restore power-sharing and the importance of avoiding any return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The two party leaders also pledged to stay in touch with regard to both Northern Ireland and Brexit.
Speaking ahead of his Dublin visit, Corbyn said Labour would “work with anyone across party boundaries and do whatever is necessary to stop a disastrous No Deal outcome, which would open the way for a frenzy of deregulation and a race to the bottom in jobs, rights and protections”.
He added that the only way out of the current political crisis facing the UK was to hold a general election or a second “public vote on any deal agreed by parliament”.
“But faced with the threat of No Deal and a Prime Minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament.

“For Labour any outcome has to work for our whole country, not just one side of this deliberately inflamed divide.”

This morning, Corbyn also visited Áras an Uachtaráin where he had a “lengthy and comprehensive” meeting with President Michael D Higgins.
The pair are believed to have discussed a range of current issues including Irish-UK relations, Brexit, the future of the European Union and Northern Ireland.
“The President and Mr Corbyn have known each other for several decades,” a spokesperson for the President said.
Last night in Dublin, Corbyn met with ICTU General Secretary Patricia King to discuss how Brexit will affect workers in Ireland, North, and South
King described the meeting as “very worthwhile” and welcomed the opportunity to share the Congress’ views on the consequences of Brexit for workers and labour standards.
“It is our view that the best way to achieve this is to negotiate as close as possible a relationship between the UK and the EU; preferably with the UK as a whole remaining in the Single Market and a Customs Union in the longer term,” Kind said.
Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin also met with Corbyn, saying afterwards that he was “assured that a no-deal Brexit is off the table”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/strict-rules-banning-the-wrong-kind-of-pallet-could-lead-to-knock-on-delays-here-post-brexit-4517216-Mar2019/,"A UK-WIDE SHORTAGE of the ‘right kind’ of pallet for the import and export of goods could lead to knock on effects for Irish companies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, businesses here are being told.
A crisis meeting was held in the UK this week between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and distributors on how to keep goods on the road in the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of this month.
Strict globally-agreed rules known as ISPM15, designed to stop the spread of bark beetles and other insects, currently govern the use of pallets and other wood packaging worldwide.
The standard, which requires all such packaging to be heat-treated in order to eradicate pests, was introduced 15 years ago.
At the moment the EU is treated as a single country, so packaging that does not meet the ISPM15 standard is allowed to move freely between member states.
That would all change in the event of a no-deal, as the UK would then be treated as a third country – essentially being put on the same footing as India or China.
“In the event of no deal, all WPM [wood packaging material] moving between the UK and the EU must meetISPM15 international standardsby undergoing heat treatment and marking,”Defra said in a notice last week.

“All WPM may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.”
The notice was met with concern by freight and haulage operatorsaccording to The Guardian, which reported that only an estimated one third of pallets used for trade between the EU and UK complied with the standard.
Business Insider reportedthat the UK government was planning emergency talks on the issue. Industry figures who spoke to the website said they were baffled as to why it took ministers so long to get to grips with the situation.
Ireland
Here at home, the Revenue and Customs service has been informing businesses of potential issues with mismatched pallets at a series of Brexit seminars held throughout the country in recent months.
“Capacity may be an issue if at short notice the UK is required to use ISPM15 compliant wood packaging for all their exports,” attendees were told,according to a presentation shown at the seminars.
The National Standards Authority of Ireland, which certifies pallets and other wood packaging produced in Ireland, has been aware of potential problems in the sector since last autumn andhas produced a factsheeton the issue for companies here.
Non-compliance with ISPM15 is one of the biggest reasons for sending back goods that arrive at Dublin Port, Fergal O’Byrne, head of the NSAI’s Brexit unit, explained.
“If a product is being shipped into Ireland from China or India, when customs people open the container at the dock one of the first things they will do is look to see if the wood packaging has the ISPM15 stamp embedded on it.”
Related ReadsRTÉ says it could benefit from other TV channels 'going dark' with a no-deal BrexitFormer Real IRA commander: Even cameras on masts would be seen as 'spy posts' in border regions
If it’s not properly certified “they seal it back up and send it back”.
The same standards will apply to UK-based exporters in the event of a no-deal. O’Byrne said Irish companies could face problems if stray, non-compliant pallets are sent back as part of a return shipment.
“The issue is I could send a container with 20 pallets off to England but the same 20 pallets may not come back. The driver of the forklift might get them mixed up, so you might get 19 back and a stray one.
He said that most pallet manufacturers here are compliant with the scheme, which is implemented in Ireland by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
The NSAI is advising that the UK may introduce reciprocal arrangements requiring EU exporters to ensure all wood packaging arriving from member states is compliant with the international standard.
O’Byrne said that while a deal between the EU and UK may still be reached in the coming weeks, the agency was continuing to brief companies on what would happen in the event of a no-deal.
The NSAI has also been holding information sessions on the potential impacts of Brexit, andwill hold events for the construction sectorin Dublin and Cork later this month.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-brexit-delay-deal-4509409-Feb2019/,"THREE BRITISH CABINET ministers have said today that Brexit should be delayed if the UK parliament doesn’t approve a deal in the next few days.
Writing in theDaily Mail, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark said it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay Britain’s departure rather than crash out of the EU on 29 March with no deal.
The ministers’ warning comes ahead of next week’s crucial vote in the House of Commons. On Wednesday, MPs are expected to consider an amendment to give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and stop a no-deal scenario if there is no agreement made with the EU by the middle of March,the BBC reported.

https://www.thejournal.ie/backstop-from-the-brink-uk-front-pages-react-to-brexit-latest-4466537-Jan2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has vowed to seek legally binding changes to the Brexit withdrawal agreement following a series of amendment votes yesterday evening in Westminster.
MPs reached a majority on some kind of Brexit deal – one that eliminates the backstop – clearing the way for PM May to renegotiate with Brussels.
Yet at the same time, nothing has changed. Ireland and the EU remain united and have stood firm, saying renegotiation would not take place.
Following last night’s vote, Tory MP Boris Johnson told the BBC that the passing of the amendment is “terrific”, and that the EU will be “compelled” to renegotiate.
The next few days will see how this all plays out. So, let’s see what spin the UK’s newspapers have put on the latest development.
The Times has a confident PM May who has “united Tories behind fresh talks with Brussels.”

The Daily Mirror has gone with: “May’s deal back from the dead…for now.”

The Guardian, meanwhile, has struck a more sobering tone, running with: “May goes back to Brussels but EU says: nothing has changed.”

On the flip side, The Daily Express has gone with: “SHE DID IT! Now it’s up to EU.”

The Sun opted for: “Backstop from the brink.”

And finally, The Daily Mail ran with: “Theresa’s Triumph.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-shop-costs-4504920-Feb2019/,"GROUPS REPRESENTING RETAILERS have warned that Brexit will have a dire economic impact on the price of food and drink being sold here in Ireland.
Three retail organisations have warned how increased tariffs and new checks would lead to increases in the cost of making fresh food and drink – increases of up to 45% in some cases – and that it could lead to a shortage of some items.
There are less than 40 days to go until 29 March, the date by which the UK must leave the European Union. The UK parliament has rejected the draft Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between EU and UK officials; the most ardent Brexit supporters say that their opposition is mostly to do with the Irish border backstop.
The backstop would mean that if a solution to avoid a hard border in Ireland isn’t reached, that the UK would remain aligned to the rules and regulations of the EU in order to allow frictionless trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK.
But without agreement on the deal, and with no majority in the House of Commons for any alternative, Brexit talks are at a stalemate – a no-deal Brexit looks more unlikely than ever, although Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have said that it is still unlikely to happen.
This political uncertainty has caused a headache for businesses: as a number of groups have said, there is no “good” Brexit, just a least-worst Brexit, but the uncertainty means that businesses are limited in how they can prepare for trade and customs changes.
Today, Thomas Burke of Retail Ireland said that a “no-deal Brexit would have devastating economic consequences and must be avoided”.
Advertisement
“Regardless of the type of Brexit agreed over the coming weeks, retailers will see an increase in their operating costs arising from checks at ports and other supply chain disruption.
“Our members continue to work hard to plan for all possible eventualities, but the ongoing uncertainty is damaging our industry and impacting our customers.”
Aodhán Connolly, the Director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium agreed with Burke, saying that a “no-deal Brexit brings tariffs, customs processes, checks and costs that our industry…  cannot afford to absorb”.
He said that if there’s a hard border, supply chains that have been built up over 40 years within the EU would be “disintegrated” – but that it couldn’t be a choice between the EU or the UK for Northern Ireland, as they need access to both markets “to survive”.
William Bain, Head of EU and International at the British Retail Consortium added:
“It is not just the people on the island of Ireland that this will affect. Those in Great Britain will see the price of goods from Ireland and Northern Ireland rise.
Two of Ireland’s main exports are beef and cheddar cheese.Ireland exports87% of its cheddar cheese to the UK, and of the 90% of Irish beef that’s exported, 50% of that goes to the UK.
Today, the Irish Independent reports that the UK would introduce tariffs and quotas that would favour Brazilian beef over Irish beef (which is cheaper due to less checks and traceability). This would have a devastating effect on the Irish beef sector in Ireland, which is already suffering due to the fluctuating price of sterling.
“This will affect the price of shopping in the Prime Minister’s constituency of Maidenhead in the same way as it will in Belfast or Dublin, with cost rises.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dub-cabinet-brexit-4545062-Mar2019/,"THE DUP HAS held talks with the British government about Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which is due for another House of Commons vote next week.
“We have had a long series of discussions with Cabinet ministers,” DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said to reporters this afternoon. “We have had a constructive dialogue.”
He said that the key problem remains the Irish backstop, which he said would “separate Northern Ireland from UK while we’re in the backstop”.
“Our focus has always been how can we ensure that Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK together as one country.”
Chancellor Philip Hammond joined the British government’s talks with the DUP earlier, fuelling suggestions that Northern Ireland could be offered more money in an attempt to win the DUP’s support for Theresa May’s deal in what would be the third ‘Meaningful Vote’.

Responding to a question fromSky News, Dodds said: “The Chancellor is a key member of the government, and also responsible for HM Revenue and Customs, which is a key concern for us… that’s an area we have discussed.”
Speaking to the Guardian, Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg said that he would support Theresa May’s deal if the DUP agreed to vote for it.
I am a unionist, but I’m not more unionist than the Democratic Unionist Party, he said.
There are just two weeks left before Brexit happens on 29 March; yesterday, MPs voted to postpone that date by at least three months. This is on condition that her deal is passed by the UK parliament next week.
In the event that it is passed, Theresa May would then ask the EU for a three-month extension, which needs the unanimous support of the 27 EU leaders.
The European Council is to meet next week, on Thursday 21 and Friday 22 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-brexit-4535852-Mar2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave a late press conference in Strasbourg tonight.
It followed what was being described as a last ditch attempt by May to secure Brexit concessions from the EU ahead of a planned House of Commons vote on the deal tomorrow.
Reading from prepared statements, the pair said they had agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop.
The announcement came as ministers here prepared to reconvene a Cabinet meeting – their second of the day, called in response to the Brexit developments in Strasbourg.
Earlier, British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told MPs in the House of Commons tonight that the government had secured “legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration”.
He said the government had signed-off on a new document providing confirmation that the EU could not try and trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, and that doing so would be in breach of legally-binding commitments.
“If – contrary to all expectations – the EU were to act with that intention, the UK could use this acceptance of what could constitute an explicit breach as the basis for a formal dispute, through independent arbitration, that such a breach had occurred – ultimately suspending the protocol if the EU continued to breach its obligations,” Lidington said.
Juncker began his comments tonight by highlighting that any deal agreed must preserve peace on the island of Ireland.
He said the backstop was an insurance policy and that if it was ever used it would not be used as a trap.
The mechanism being announced tonight complemented the withdrawal agreement agreed last November without reopening it, he said – noting that this was a “second chance” and that there would be no third chance.
Juncker implied that Varadkar had signed off on the strengthened guarantees offered to London.

“I have spoken to the Taoiseach this evening who would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal,” Juncker told reporters.
Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications & legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement &#backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or#Brexitmay not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.https://t.co/lfy9eehEZipic.twitter.com/XCqcLwZV7V— Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU)March 11, 2019Jean-Claude Juncker/ Twitter

Reading her prepared statement, May said the backstop could not be a template for a future relationship and that so far that hadn’t been clear enough to MPs.
The EU, under the new proposals, will not be able to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, May said. If it makes any move to do so, that can be tackled through arbitration.
“MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes.” May said.
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.”
She said it was the UK’s position that it believed it could withdraw, unilaterally, from the backstop if negotiations on the future relationship broke down.
The Taoiseach delayed his planned US St Patrick’s trip as ministers met here to stay on top of developments.
The Cabinet meeting broke up earlier this evening but recommenced at around 11pm. One minister described the mood as “sombre”.
In London, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for MPs to reject the deal tomorrow.
A spokesperson for the DUP said the party would take time to analyse tonight’s announcements.

He confirmed the news on Twitter, saying he has decided to leave the party to put those in his constituency of Dudley first.
Austin told the Express and Star newspaper that he quit over the party’s “lurch to the left” under Jeremy Corbyn and its failure to tackle anti-Semitism.
He becomesthe ninth MP to leave the party this week, after Luciana Berger, Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey announced their departure on Monday, while Joan Ryan quit the party on Tuesday.

However, the BBC reports that Austin does not plan to join the independent group formed by his former colleagues in the House of Commons.
Corbyn’s tenure as leader has seen near-constant rumours that some MPs were planning to split from the party.
Support from grassroots Labour members saw himsurvive a leadership challenge in 2016, but he has often struggled to maintain authority within the party.
His perceived lack of leadership during the Brexit referendum, when Labour was campaigning for Remain, was sharply criticised by some MPs, while there have also been numerous allegations of anti-Semitism within the party.

https://www.thejournal.ie/real-ira-brexit-border-john-connolly-4495704-Feb2019/,"A FORMER COMMANDER of the Real IRA has said that life around the border would change “dramatically” in the short-term in the event of a hard Brexit.
Even basic infrastructure like a camera on a mast would be attacked and removed and resurgent armed republican groups would stage a massive recruitment drive, John Connolly, a former officer commanding of the Real IRA’s prisoners, said in an interview withTheJournal.ie.
Connolly, who was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in jail after being caught with a large ‘barrack buster’ mortar bomb in Fermanagh in 2000, stressed that he was not speaking on behalf of any group or organisation and did not wish to see a return to violence, but was offering an analysis of the situation based on his experience.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, he said, any form of physical infrastructure imposed by the British government would be seen as the manifestation of “a foreign occupying military force”.
John Connolly, a former senior figure in the Real IRA, at a bridge on the Fermanagh-Monaghan border.Daragh Brophy / TheJournal.ieDaragh Brophy / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Cameras would be regarded as “spy posts” and removed by the local population in border areas, he said.
“The British government don’t seem to have learned from the past. From oppression grows resistance. It definitely does. We’re living in peaceful times at the minute and no-one wants to go back to the war years.”
Customs posts would not stop smuggling either, he said. “It never stopped it in the past.”
He said he didn’t believe European Union cameras or border infrastructure would be attacked, but warned that any EU posts or masts that were erected would soon be mirrored by the British government on the other side of the border and that the situation would then “escalate in a big, big way”.
Connolly stressed several times in the course of the interview that his war was over and that he did not represent any republican armed or political entity. He said he cut all ties with armed groups after being released from prison in 2007.
His analysis that border posts would become a target is in line with views expressed by a range of security experts and senior politicians, including PSNI chief constable George Hamiltonwho saidthey would be regarded as “fair game” by violent dissident republicans.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, speakingat Davos last month, said that if things went very wrong in Brexit negotiations it could result in the need for “cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up”.
Security analyst and former Defence Forces officer Tom Clonan, who served at the border during The Troubles, said he also agreed with Connolly’s assessment – but that he believed EU border posts would also be attacked.
“There are elements within the border area that do not want normal policing. So anything like that would be very, very provocative in the border areas – masts, aerials, sensors, or cameras would be seen as very provocative. I believe that that type of infrastructure would be attacked and would be destroyed.
“He and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum. I was a member of Oglaigh Na hÉireann. We were there to uphold law and order in the State and he’s a person right at the other end of the spectrum who took matters into his own hands, but I would agree completely with his analysis.

Border violence
The first roads along the 500km border began to be closed in response to the IRA’s border campaign of the 1950s. Even harsher restrictions and increased fortification was introduced as violence in the North spiralled out of control in the early 1970s.
At the height of the IRA’s campaign in the 1970s and early 80s most smaller border roads around the Fermanagh-Monaghan border, where Connolly is from, were spiked, blocked with large concrete blocks or blown up by the British Army. Traffic crossing the border along main routes had to go through a full military checkpoint, often resulting in long delays.
Attacks on British Army troops and positions were frequent. Connolly, who was born in the mid-70s, said he remembers “explosions going off. There was gunfire, gun battles.”
Sectarian killings had sparked an upsurge in those army road closures in the area after the start of the Troubles –including the 1972 murders, within the space of 24 hours, of an off-duty member of the UDR by the IRA, and the killing of two Catholic farmers the following day by members of the British Army.
Connolly said he remembered being taken off his school bus, as children were made to line up on the road to show their schoolbags to British soldiers.
“If we didn’t do it they were physically taken off us and you would get pushed on the ground and all. You know, they were like animals.
“They were very jumpy you see. They were very jumpy [because] they were waiting to be fired on.
Accounts from the time tell how an atmosphere of tension and mistrust became entrenched in the area. The IRA regarded members of the security forces as legitimate targets. The Protestant farming community had become deeply suspicious of Catholics – any of whom, they believed, could have been part of the IRA’s information network.
Said Connolly: “You have Catholic farmers and Protestant farmers – everyone’s all friendly now. Back at the time of the Troubles they wouldn’t look at each other, there would be hatred. You don’t realise the hatred there would have been back then.
“But now everyone is talking, everyone is getting on. Neighbours, both Catholic and protestant, doing things for each other that back in the war years, when things were bad, they wouldn’t even look at each other.”
A return to those days is “the last thing I want to see and it’s the last thing that people in my area want to see, and that is a hard border coming back”.

Real IRA
Connolly said that British military checkpoints were being attacked on a daily basis at the height of the conflict. In contrast, he said there was “no appetite” for armed conflict now.
“I was part of the provisional movement myself. I was caught and charged and done for intelligence gathering and I did time for that as a young man, for collecting intelligence for the Provisional IRA.”
Related ReadsExplainer: What is the Good Friday Agreement?
Connolly was sentenced to a five-year term in prison in the early 90s. As the peace process gathered pace, later that decade, he was part of the group that broke away from the Provisional IRA at the time of the 1997 ceasefire and did not sign up to the provisions of the following year’s Good Friday Agreement.
He was jailed for 14 years alongside two other men for possession of the mortar bomb at a crossroads in Co Fermanagh on Armistice Day in November 2000, and was the leader of the Real IRA’s prisoners in Antrim’s Maghaberry Prison until his release in 2007.
Said Connolly: “I did not agree with the decommissioning of IRA weapons. That’s why I broke all contact with the provisional movement. I would have left that movement very disoriented and felt very let down that they would go and decommission weapons that were needed to fight an occupying force.”
Connolly said he regarded the breakaway group to be the true IRA. Speaking about current armed groups he said he did not use the term “dissident” to describe them.
Regarding their ongoing activities, he said: “You do have armed groups out there that are continuing the struggle. But I am not in support of armed struggle myself. I’ll not condemn people who are, okay? Because I would be a hypocrite if I did, especially with my past of being involved in armed actions myself.”
Asked about the recent car bomb attack in Derry, which the PSNI says was carried out by the dissident New IRA, he said: ”I have no comment on that.”
Army presence
The need for customs posts along the border ended as the Troubles were still ongoing when the EU single market came into effect in 1993.
As the peace process continued in the 2000s in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement, the Sinn Féin leadership made the demilitarisation of the border, particularly in South Armagh, one of its key demands in the negotiations leading to the establishment of a stable Northern Assembly.
Britain removed the last of its armoured towers at Crossmaglen police station in February of 2007. The British Army formally ended its long-running Operation Banner later the same year, as its presence along the border was no longer deemed necessary.
Increasing numbers of specialist troops have, however, been deployed to the North in recent years in response to a resurgent dissident threat under a new strategy known as Operation Helvetic.
Clonan, the security analyst, explained that these troops include highly trained explosive ordnance disposal officers and the Special Reconnaissance Squadron of the SAS, which acts in support of MI5 and the PSNI in countering the threat posed by dissident republicans, in particular the New IRA.
Said Clonan: “All of the political discussion has been about law-abiding people, people exporting and importing. But Brexit would create a huge opportunity for non-law abiding people, for criminal elements. Because if we become a European Union frontier then there will be opportunities there for the movement of illegal goods, contraband goods, illegal substances, drugs, people… It will open up all sorts of stuff and the organised criminal elements on this island are very organised and they are very well armed.
“Groups like that have very, very close links to both dissident armed loyalists and republicans – those links are already there and they’re well documented. So the criminal element will use nationalist and loyalist rhetoric to ramp up the tension.”
Acts of violence, Clonan said, “will have the effect of disrupting normal policing and normal monitoring of the border in the name of republican rhetoric and loyalist rhetoric. But really a lot of it will be fuelled by criminality. That border – a value exchange on the island, a change of jurisdiction – that doesn’t exist now because we’re all in the European union … so that will pour petrol on that particular fire.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-uk-backstop-poll-4483026-Feb2019/,"A RECENT SKY News poll in Irelandhas shown that 66% of Irish people have a less favourable view of the UK as a result of Brexit, with 26% saying it made no difference.
Just under half of Irish people also have a less favourable view of Northern Irish unionists due to Brexit, the poll showed. 16% said it was more favourable, with the remainder — more than a quarter — saying it didn’t make a difference.

The poll – which surveyed 1,611 Irish Sky customers online – showed that the vast majority of Irish people want the Irish government to hold their ground on a Brexit backstop, even if it risks a no-deal Brexit scenario.
The backstop is an insurance policy, designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
If the UK leaves the single market and customs union, any goods passing from Northern Ireland into Ireland, or vice versa, will have to be checked.
The North’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have expressed their opposition to the backstop in the past, as have a number of MP’s.

The DUP’s opposition comes on the back of fears that it would weaken the North’s integrity, meaning it would be treated differently to the rest of the UK.
The poll also found that the majority of Irish people would rather cut ties completely with the UK, than the EU, with 81% voting in favour.

https://www.thejournal.ie/us-politicians-brexit-4478048-Feb2019/,"WHILE BREXIT MAY seem like all politicians talk about in this part of the world, in the United States it has not been making much of a ripple.
And while this is unlikely to change dramatically anytime soon, there have been some indications our transatlantic cousins are at least beginning to take a bit of an interest.
It’s against that backdrop that Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is in Washington DC today to meet with politicians who have been voicing some concerns about the ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
Last week, a Democratic Congressman from Pennsylvania called Brendan Boyleintroduced a resolutionwhich sought to have the House of Representatives oppose the reintroduction of a hard border in Ireland.
The resolution said that the people in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland “voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Good Friday Agreement” and noted that the US is one of three guarantors of the agreement.
The bill says that Brexit has “increased concerns” about the future of the agreement and seeks to have the House of Representatives oppose:
After he introduced the bill, the Irish-American representative went onto Channel 4 News to speak about how Washington is viewing the British government’s efforts at resolving the Brexit impasse.

Asked whether faith in the UK government has been eroded, he said that it was:
From the British government’s perspective, its primary goal in relations to the US on Brexit is to ensure that the countries will be able to trade freely afterwards.
In that same interview, Boyle argued that Britain may find it more difficult to agree a deal with the US if its trustworthiness continues to be lost.

But while an Irish-American from Pennsylvania may predictably be tuned into Irish interests, it also makes sense that at government level they have not raised the same concerns.
In May of last year, Boyle asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo whether he was aware of a letter from representatives that the US appoint a new Special Envoy to Northern Ireland.
Pompeo admitted that he knew little about it.

“I don’t know, I haven’t considered it. I’m happy to review the letter,” the newly-appointed diplomat responded.
In fact, Pompeo has only mentioned Brexit recently as an example “disruption” in world politics.
“Voters have tuned out politicians and political alliances that they thought were not representing their interests,” Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
For his part, Trump hasn’t mentioned it much either having once describedhimself as ‘Mr. Brexit’.
Having tweetedextensively about it in 2016, the US President has tweeted once about it since.
The most influential example of Trump wading into the Brexit debate happened in November, a number of weeks before MPs were supposed to vote on May’s deal.
Speaking before boarding his Marine helicopter, Trump questioned whether the deal was a good one for the UK.
“It sounds like a great deal for the EU,” Trump said.
“But right now as the deal stands she might not be able to, they may not be able to trade with the US and I don’t think they want that at all. That would be a very big negative.”

But if senior US politicians have not yet fully embraced Brexit as an issue, the former Senator who helped broker the Good Friday Agreement certainly has.
Speaking to Sky News today, Mitchell said that nothing should be taken for granted about the peace in Northern Ireland.
“Reason, common sense and prudence tells us that in light of the history of Northern Ireland, no step should be taken that might make the resumption of violence more possible. I think that’s the best way to frame it. It could happen anywhere, it’s not guaranteed to happen one way or another and we hope it doesn’t happen.”

Asked what advice he’d give to Theresa May in thinking about the border issue, Mitchell said he’d only ask that she’d be mindful of the past.
“My only comment on this, and I don’t put it in the form of advice to anyone, is keep history in mind as you engage in these discussion and think about the context and think about the future. Peace is not guaranteed anywhere. Stability, prosperity, democracy and freedom are not guaranteed anywhere.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-merkel-may-4582650-Apr2019/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Apr 2019

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has rubbished rumours suggesting Germany could be open to a five-year time-limit on the Brexit backstop, saying they have “no credibility”.
Coveney was speaking in Luxembourg ahead of a meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
May will also travel to Paris to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron as part of a last-gasp bid to keep her country from crashing out of the European Union without a deal.
The PM’s meetings in Europe come on the eve of another tension-packed summit in Brussels where EU leaders will decide whether to agree to the UK’s request to delay Brexit until 30 June.
May has been unable to get her deal through parliament and there have been suggestions this morning that a time-limited backstop could break the House of Commons deadlock.
This approach has already been ruled out by EU leaders and chief negotiator Michel Barnier again ruled out renegotiating the backstop today, but some senior UK politicians have suggested it as a way forward.
Speaking this morning, Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom said that Merkel should be open to negotiating the backstop.
It would be “fantastic” if Germany's Angela Merkel agreed to “support a proper UK#Brexit” by reopening the withdrawal agreement, says senior minister Andrea Leadsom - despite PM's admission EU will not change ithttps://t.co/ei7eWdNSpBpic.twitter.com/vTrQUM9sut— BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics)April 9, 2019BBC Politics/ Twitter

“What I think would be fantastic is if Angela Merkel will try to support a proper UK Brexit by agreeing to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and there have been rumours that some senior members of the German government would be willing to do that in order to get Theresa May’s deal across the line,” Leadsom said.
BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt added in a tweet that at least one Brexiteer has said Merkel could be open to a five-year time-limit on the backstop.

Responding to the rumours in Luxembourg this morning, Coveney said they have no basis in fact.
“So I suspect that may be a rumour started and circulated by someone in London but it really has no credibility when it comes to the reality of where we are.”
In his press conference, Barnier did not specifically mention the rumours but repeated that renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement was off the table.

“You will have heard me say on a number of occasions that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation and is not going to be reopened. That continues to be the case,” he said.
Ahead of tomorrow’s Brussels summit, attention is turning to the circumstances in which EU leaders would agree to a further Brexit extension.
The 27 European leaders have already signed off on one extension and have serious doubts that May will somehow break through the political gridlock now.
May’s predicament is complicated by growing EU fears that the chaos will soon carry political and economic costs even heavier than those potentially incurred in case of a messy “no-deal Brexit”.
This view is being promoted publicly by Macron and is also believed to be backed by Belgium and Spain.
“We’d need a strong political reason to delay,” a diplomat from this camp said.
Coveney said that it was his view that EU leaders would be open to an extension if the UK did have a reason.
“I think EU leaders this week are open to an extension but they certainly want to see a plan to go with that extension, so that everybody knows the time is being used to try to conclude the first phase of Brexit, which requires the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and if necessary changes to the future relationship declaration.”
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.
Asked for greater details, Coveney refused to go into specifics.
EU Council president Donald Tusk’s office last week floated a compromise proposal that gives Britain a “flexible” extension of up to a year — which ends earlier should some way forward emerge in London.
But a diplomatic source insisted that this was “Mr. Tusk’s position, not the position of the Council”.
Merkel takes a more conciliatory approach backed by Ireland.
“I will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit,” Merkel said Friday. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”
Speaking yesterday in Dublin, EU chief Brexit negotiator reaffirmed thatthe bloc “stand fully behind Ireland”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-corbyn-brexit-2-4646339-May2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urging him to compromise with her because her deal is “our last chance” to deliver Brexit.
May has come under fierce criticism over her new Brexit dealthat she unveiled yesterdaywhere, for the first time, she made a concession on the possibility of a second referendum that would see MPs would get a vote on whether the Brexit deal should be put to the people.
Her ten-point plan includes “as close to frictionless trade with the EU as possible” while ending free movement, an admission that the backstop would remain and guarantees that Northern Ireland would stay aligned with Great Britain no matter the outcome of talks with the EU.
Senior Tories, including future leadership hopefuls, such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab dismissed May’s proposals while Labour’s Corbyn also said he will not support her.
Talks between Labour and the Conservatives to agree the way forward with Brexit stalled earlier this month.
In a letter to her opposition counterpart,seen by Sky News, May set out the measures she would take to compromise with Labour’s demands on Brexit and urged Corbyn to back her deal.

On a second referendum, she told Corbyn: “My views on this question are a matter of record, but there are MPs on both sides of this House, but particularly the opposition benches, who have made it clear that they will not support any deal unless it includes a second referendum.
May said she’d shown that she was willing to compromise in order to deliver Brexit.
“The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is our last chance to do so,” she said. “I ask you to compromise too so that we can deliver what both our parties promised in our manifestos and restore faith in our politics.”
The prime minister is hoping to get her maligned withdrawal agreement through parliament by the time the summer recess begins on 20 July, which would allow Britain to leave the EU at the end of that month – as long as MPs reject a second referendum.
Otherwise the process could be delayed until 31 October – the deadline set by the EU – or even later if EU leaders grant Britain another postponement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-meps-4580156-Apr2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said that the party is preparing for European elections in Northern Ireland should they go ahead next month.
The party’s Northern Ireland MEP Martina Anderson is promising to fight an “energetic and solid campaign” in the elections.
As it stands, the United Kingdom is set to leave the European Union on 12 April but Prime Minister Theresa May has requested this deadline be put back to 30 June.
European leaders have insisted that the UK could not remain part of the EU if it did not hold MEP elections that are due across Europe between 23 and 26 May.
The European Union fears legal challenges could be brought against the EU by British citizens who wished to exercise their vote in the European election.

This has raised the prospect that the UK may be forced to hold European elections next month, even if the UK may leave the EU soon afterwards. Aneventuality which would likely affect Ireland’s processfor electing MEPs.
UK political parties area already making preparations for the elections withLabour beginning the process of selecting candidatesand Nigel Farage preparing to lead The Brexit Party into the European Parliament.
Sinn Féin currently has four MEPs, three in the Republic and one in Northern Ireland, and party leader McDonald said today that they are preparing for elections on both parts of the island.
“One of the uncertainties is the whole issue around elections in the north, whether or not there will be European elections, we’ll be discussing that here at our Ard Comhairle today and we will be ensuring that we will be prepared and above all this is about protecting Irish interests,” McDonald said today.
In a tweet after that Ard Comhairle meeting, Anderson said that she is ready to seek re-election as a Northern Ireland MEP.
“SF will fight an energetic and solid campaign which puts your interests, your rights & entitlements first. SF more than up for an EU campaign in the north of Ireland,” she tweeted.

IT’S LOOKING MORE and more likely that the UK will vote in European elections along with the rest of the EU.
While Brexit has been delayed twiceand given a flexible deadline, there was no flexibility over whether this would happen.
If the UK is still a member of the EU when the bloc votes between 23 and 26 May, it needs to hold MEP elections to prevent citizens from being disenfranchised.
In reality this means that EU elections across Britain and Northern Ireland are coming next month unless Prime Minister Theresa May gets a Withdrawal Deal through parliament.
The slim chance of this happening has meant parties are preparing to fight elections, some more enthusiastically than others.
So what is the state of play?
The Tories must feel like an election is the last thing the party needs right now.
Leader and Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said that she doesn’t think the elections should be held, but she is pretty powerless to stop it if she can’t get a deal through parliament before 22 May.
The party seems more concerned with fighting amongst itself rather than fighting elections but it would have to run candidates regardless.
The Tories have askedwould-be candidates to express an interestin running before nominations close today but recent polling of Conservative members may temper any interest.
The website Conservative Home conducted a survey which found that more than three out of five party members were planning on voting for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party rather than the Tories.
Perhaps even more strikingwas a poll in the Mail on Sundaywhich showed that 40% of Conservative councillors were planning on ditching their own party to vote for Farage’s

Conservative Home wrotethat members were full of “sheer anger with the postponement of Brexit” and are feeling rebellious as a result.
It shows that just as the Conservative MPs are split over the best course forward on Brexit, grassroots members are as well.
The party is split between those who want to back May’s way forwardand those who favour a harder or no-deal Brexit. Something which may play into Farage’s hands.
Labour may benefit from a fractured Conservative vote in the European elections, it’s coming a close second to the Brexit Party polls, but they are also facing internal strife and a battle for votes from various sides.

The party’s position on Brexit is that the result of the referendum is to be respected but that a no-deal exit must be avoided.
The party is to set out its stall in a EU elections manifesto next week that will give a better idea of where it stands.

Ahead of that though, deputy leader Tom Watson ramped up the stakes on Sunday by writing that the manifesto should include a“confirmatory referendum on any deal”.
This question is at the heart of Labour’s debate over Brexit, with many members being of this view but others pointing to the fact that 61% of Labour MPs are from Leave-voting constituencies.
This fact, and a history of Euroscepticism, has weighed heavily on Jeremy Corbyn’s focus on winning a general election and not another referendum.
It’s for this reason that Corbyn’s focus may be as much on local elections on 2 May as the European ones.

While the messages of the two main parties could be criticised as being somewhat muddled, Farage’s new vehicle benefits from greater clarity and a name that is instantly recognisable.
The party is seeking to make the ballot a one issue vote and to provide a home for Brexit voters of all hues.
Farage’s agitation to remove the UK from the EU was conducted while an MEP himself and he’s looking to use this route again.
Theformer UKIP leader launched the party earlier this monthwith Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob, as one of its candidates.
Yesterday, the Brexit Party announced five more candidates, including Claire Fox, a left-wing TV pundit and Farage said his party will be going after Labour votes “in a very big way”.
Change UK
Guardian News/ YouTube
The party formerly known as the Independent Group, but which still has the Independent Group in its logo, launched its campaign yesterday.
The party is running 70 candidates and revealed that Rachel Johnson, sister of Boris, and former BBC journalist Gavin Esler are among them.
The party was formed by breakaway MPs from Labour and the Conservatives and interim party leader Heidi Allen said yesterday: “We are not the rebel alliance, we are the Remain alliance.”
The party says it received 3,700 applications to run as candidates and Allen said these were whittled down by people in “Tigger towers”, ‘Tigger’ being a nickname party members have given themselves.
More Remainers
The Liberal Democrats won just one seat in the last European elections, down from 11 in 2009. The party will be hoping its staunch support of a second referendum will help them return to the figure of a decade ago.
The Green Party, the SNP and Plaid Cymru are also all in favour of a second referendum and collectively their votes add up to a significant bloc.
The Liberal Democrats said they wanted to use the PR-STV system to engage in a Remain-voting pact with Change UK but that this offer was rejected.
Much to theannoyance of Remain advocates.

Photos showed Farage giving a talk to a crowd near a milkshake shop moments beforehand;a video of the incidentalso documents Farage say “a complete failure”, “could’ve spotted that a mile away” as he’s being led away from the area.
This is the latest in a number of recent incidents in which far-right figures in the UK have had milkshakes thrown at them in public as a form of protest.
Earlier this month, footage of former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson having a milkshake thrown over him in Manchester went viral.
Last week, two other protesters attempted to throw a milkshake over Ukip candidate Carl Benjamin at another event in Cornwall.

McDonald’s had been asked by British policeto stop selling milkshakes temporarilyin areas where Farage was due to speak.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Moments after the milkshake was thrown on him, Faragetweeted out:
“For a civilised democracy to work you need the losers consent, politicians not accepting the referendum result have led us to this.”
Farage is the leader of the Brexit Party which, despite being a newly set-up party,is charging aheadof the Tory and Labour parties in the polls for the European election.
The UK’s electoral system means that citizens vote for a party and not a candidate, meaning that if the Brexit party retain their 34% share of the vote, they will receive the greatest share of British MEP seats in the next term of the European Parliament.
Farage is also the cofounder and former leader of Ukip; he resigned as leader immediately after the Brexit vote in June 2016.

Let me explain what's happening with Brexit.pic.twitter.com/gjGkvFk8fT
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that she can’t see MPs backing her Brexit deal “as things stand”, which has forced her to reach out to the opposition Labour party for a compromise.
In a video posted on Twitter today, May said the choice that lay ahead “is either leaving the European Union with a deal, or not leaving at all”.
It comes as the possibility yet remains open that the UK could leave the EUwithouta deal this coming Friday. The Prime Minister has asked Europe to delay Brexit until 30 June, and EU leaders will consider this request at a summit this Wednesday.
May’s Conservatives are currently in negotiations with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party to try to find a way to move forward with Brexit that would ensure a majority in the House of Commons back some sort of deal.
So far, MPs have voted against Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement three times.

The Prime Minister has said she has no appetite for a no-deal, but that isn’t echoed by some colleagues within her party and her Cabinet.
Senior Tory MP Andrea Leadsom told the BBC today that a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to cancelling Brexit, and that her party was working “through gritted teeth” with Labour on the issue.
She said a no-deal Brexit wouldn’t be “nearly as grim” as some fear, and that prolonging Brexit long enough to hold European elections in the UK is “utterly unacceptable”.
Yesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was “highly unlikely” any EU member state would veto the UK’s request for a further extension but said Ireland doesn’t want an extension that “just allows for more indecision”.
If May must go to Europe with a new plan to deliver Brexit, then her hopes now appear pinned on an agreement with Labour.
So far, a consensus has not been reached.
In a statement last night, she said: “”The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all. It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers.”
Corbyn said this weekend that he hadn’t seen any great change in the government’s position so far, and was still waiting “to see the red lines move”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-defeated-in-westminster-as-last-ditch-strasbourg-agreement-fails-to-convince-critics-4538144-Mar2019/,"THE BREXIT WITHDRAWAL deal has been defeated again in the House of Commons, with Prime Minister Theresa May suffering a thumping 149-vote loss.
The result was 242 in favour and 391 against.
MPs will now vote tomorrow on whether there’s support to leave the EU without a deal, with a further possible vote on Thursday on extending Article 50.
This evening’s votecame in the wakeof last-minute measures announced last night by May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
However,advice from attorney generalGeoffrey Cox published this morning put the likelihood of the deal making it through the House tonight in jeopardy.
Earlier, the DUP said its MPs would not back it, Tory Brexiteer group the ERG indicated it wouldn’t either and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said leaving without a deal was now the safest route out of the EU.
As the vote was taking place, it became clear that May was heading for a second major defeat on the withdrawal agreement. Earlier projections by Sky News had put the scale of the defeat at around 100 votes. In the end, that tally was short by several dozen.

So what happens now?
Speaking immediately after the vote, May told MPs that the government would now hold a debate and vote tomorrow on whether the UK should leave without a deal.
A free vote will be allowed in the Conservative Party.
She said she believed there was still a majority in the House that wished to leave with a deal, and that she would return to the Commons to begin the debate tomorrow.
Information would be published on essential policies that would need to be in place for the UK to leave without a deal, including measures for the border, she said.
Following tomorrow’s vote, it’s possible a motion will be put forward on Thursday offering MPs an option on whether they want an extension to Article 50. That will only happen in the event that tomorrow’s vote shows support for a deal.
May said in her statement that if the House votes to leave without a deal on 29 March, “it will be the policy of the Government to implement that decision”.
“If the House declines to approve leaving without a deal on 29 March, the Government will, following that vote, bring forward a motion on Thursday on whether Parliament wants to seek an extension to Article 50.
“If the House votes for an extension, the Government will seek to agree that extension with the EU and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.
“But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declared the Brexit deal “dead”, and called on the government to adopt his proposals for a softer Brexit.
“Their deal, their proposal, the one the prime minister’s put is clearly dead,” Corbyn said.

The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the#UK. Our “no-deal” preparations are now more important than ever before.
The EU, meanwhile, is standing firm on its position that negotiations on this deal are at an end.
“The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the UK. Our ‘no-deal’ preparations are now more important than ever before,” the union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Twitter.
A spokesperson for President of the European Council Donald Tusk said that should the UK make a “reasoned request” for an extension, the remaining EU 27 would consider it and decide by unanimity.
“EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth functioning of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”
“With only 17 days left to 29 March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” the spokesman said.

If MPs vote against a no-deal exit tomorrow, and vote to postpone Brexit on Thursday, the other 27 EU nations would need to agree.
Their leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit on 21-22 March.
But any postponement may have to be short-lived. Juncker on Monday said Brexit “should be complete before the European elections” at the end of May.
The new EU parliament begins on the 1 July, meaning the latest possible date that they could extend Article 50 by, would be three months.
Speaking to Sky News tonight, Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said he “doesn’t know what’s next”, adding that “a series of negative majorities does not produce a positive majority”.
The EU can’t “suppress” the Good Friday Agreement, he said, adding that the idea of the EU agreeing to leave its border with Northern Ireland open, negatively impacting the valuable Single Market is “ludicrous”.
When asked whether the EU would grant the UK an extension, Lamberts said:
“Only if there’s a serious game plan – but without a plan, why should we grant you an extension? It makes no sense.”

THERE’S A WELL intentioned apathy from Brexit demonstrators towards Ireland.
Talking to demonstrators who had gathered outside Westminster on Tuesday ahead of thefateful House of Commons vote on the Brexit deal, all spoke with a sympathetic tone when asked about their nearest neighbour.
“The EU caused a housing crisis in Ireland,” was repeated in various versions three times by Brexit supporters, one of whom was corrected by his friend.
“There was never a trade border on the island of Ireland, we always had custom unity,” was the input of one Brexiteer, and in fairness, that same day DUP leader Arlene Foster saidsomething similar.
“I won’t pretend to understand the Irish situation,” was repeated by four or five people, both Remainers and Leave voters, some of whom said it was unfortunate that Ireland was being pulled into this Brexit furore.
On the issue of the backstop, which is the contentious part of the Brexit deal that aims to avoid a hard border in Ireland, they were less kind.
“We don’t want this deal as it’s done because it will mean that we are in the EU forever,” said Lynn, who’s a member of Ukip. “Because of the backstop, if we can’t agree a trade deal with the EU, well then the backstop will step in and we’ll be in the EU forever.”
Lynn and her friend Carol say that the backstop isn’t necessary, as all sides have said that they don’t want a hard border.
“Surely,” Carol says, “being an independent country, we can decide if we put a border up there. It worked alright before, didn’t it?”
Many people said that British Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal would pass if it wasn’t for the backstop. But why the staunch opposition to the assurance of no border?
“Firstly, it isolates Northern Ireland from Great Britain,” Joshua, a young Leave supporter who works in Westminster, toldTheJournal.ie.
“That’s a huge concern obviously – the Prime Minister said before that it would be ‘morally unacceptable’.
“And secondly, there’s no unilateral withdrawal from the backstop, which means it’s the only treaty in Britain’s history that we would sign up to which we can’t unilaterally withdraw from without the approval with the EU.”
Backtrack: what is the backstop?
Niall CarsonNiall Carson
The Irish backstop, which is referred to in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement as “the Protocol” is a promise that if all efforts to close a deal fail, that there will be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland to avoid a hard border.
This would mean that rules and regulations in Northern Ireland would have to be similar to the EU’s/Ireland’s rules, to avoid customs checks or posts that would make up a hard border.
The backstop was first agreed between the EU, UK and Irish government in December 2017. Last year, arguments over the backstop put the entire Brexit deal, or the Withdrawal Agreement, in jeopardy as Brexiteer MPs said it wasn’t necessary and restricted the UK. The EU said that the backstop was vital to the agreement, in what was seen as a show of solidarity with Ireland.
Eventually, the two sides came to a compromise that allowed them to finalise a deal (pending approval from the EU and UK parliaments).
It would mean that there would be a UK-wide customs deal or “regulatory alignment”, rather than plans specific to Northern Ireland, which would ensure that there would be no border.
This would, however, limit the UK’s abilities to strike up new trade deals with non-EU countries after they leave, as they have committed to rules that are not theirs, and over which they would have no say in changing.

The backstop is a guarantee that no matter what rules the UK decides to change, or what Prime Minister is in power, that a hard border will not appear in Ireland.
Another problem that both Brexiteers have with the backstop is that it isn’t time-limited, meaning that if the EU and UK cannot strike up a free trade deal at the end of the next phase of negotiations (assuming they get that far), then the UK will be locked into what was meant to be a temporary arrangement in the form of the Irish backstop.
Political practicalities
Peter ByrnePeter Byrne
There’s fierce opposition to the backstop in the House of Commons; many estimate that May’s deal would pass if the backstop wasn’t included. The DUP are fiercely opposed to it; this is because they see imposing different customs rules or other regulations on Northern Ireland as a threat to its place in the United Kingdom.
There had been suggestions that to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, checks would only be carried out on goods and people at ports and airports. The DUP and a large number of other MPs are firmly opposed to this option, which is the border along the Irish Sea option, as it’s seen as another threat to the Union.
In response to attempts by EU leaders to pacify concerns around the backstop, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that it only“bolstered”them.
At the DUP’s annual conferencein November, the former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said that they should “junk the backstop”.
“Unless we junk this backstop, we are going to find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us: a satellite state,” Johnson said.
Meanwhile, the Dublin government here has repeatedly said that the UK government provided a written assurance that there would be no hard border in the form of a backstop, and have repeatedly tried to help sell it to May’s parliamentarians.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the British parliament “feared” the backstop, whichwasn’t necessary.
Behind the scenes,  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s Cabinet seem adamant to not be the Irish government that allowed a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, which in turn could lead to Trouble-era violence.
One exchange
SIPA USA / PA ImagesSIPA USA / PA Images / PA Images
One Brexiteer we spoke to named Graham was adamant that there was “no trade border” ever in Ireland, and later said that there never would be one in the future.
But when a border first went up in April 1924, there were customs posts put up along the border to monitor what passed between the two jurisdictions.
These customs posts were manned by officials only, until the IRA began targetting these posts as symbols of partition in a series of violent attacks. Police officers, and eventually armed British soldiers, were then sent to the customs posts to protect them.
Before Christmas, theEU published its plans for a no-deal Brexit, and the preparations that were needed.
It says that there would need to be “simplified border controls” for live animals and animal products, hinting that some infrastructure would be needed.
This would be a border along the Irish Sea, which is the other contentious issue for MPs.
The DUP, the party supporting Theresa May’s government since the 2017 snap election, do have a problem with that.
There’s a chance that there will be more of those types of checks in the future, however.
That is oft-repeated, but just weeks away from Brexit day on 29 March, it seems more uncertain than ever. The demonstrator turns and asks, with a smile:

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is due back in Brussels today in a last-ditch attempt to get EU leaders to delay Brexit.
Britain is due to officially leave the European Union on 29 March, just eight days away.
Yesterday May wrote to the EU asking to extend Article 50 until 30 June.
Other EU member states are due to consider her request at a summit in Brussels today, but a decision is not expected until next week.
A three-month extension would mean Britain doesn’t have to take part in May’s European elections; the new European Parliament is set to convene in July.
Responding to May’s request, European Council President Donald Tusk said he believes a short extension would be possible.
However, he said it would be conditional on MPs backing the Withdrawal Agreement drawn up by May’s government and the EU – a deal they have already twice rejected.
Tusk admitted that European leaders are suffering “Brexit fatigue” and said he feared his hopes may prove “frail, even illusory”.

In atelevised speechlast night, May hit out at MPs for not supporting her deal.
“You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with this. I agree. I am on your side,” May said, directly addressing members of the public.
Her speech was sharply criticised by many MPs, from across the political divide, who viewed it as an attempt to shift blame for the ongoing crisis from herself to others.
Conservative Sam Gyimah said “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.
Resorting to the 'blame game' as the PM is doing is a low blow. Democracy loses when a PM who has set herself against the HoC then blames MPs for doing their job. Distracts from Art 50 extension, all part of her strategy to run down the clock and rule out other options. Toxic.— Sam Gyimah (@SamGyimah)March 20, 2019Sam Gyimah MP/ Twitter

Describing her speech as “incendiary and irresponsible”, Labour MP Wes Streeting said May would be partly responsible “if any harm comes to us”, noting that MPs have been subjected “credible” death threats.

‘Constitutional crisis’
May’s appeal for an extension comes amid doubt over whether or not the House of Commons will vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
The planned vote was thrown into doubt on Monday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
Resignation threat?
In her letter to the EU, May said she intends to bring her deal back to the House of Commons “as soon as possible”, arguing that if it passed, she would need the delay to implement the treaty.
If the text is rejected a third time, a deeply divided parliament will have to decide what happens next.
“As prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30,” May told lawmakers, in comments interpreted as a hint about her own future.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
As the crisis rumbles on, a number of opponents are said to be eyeing up May’s job. Former Foreign Secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson is one of the frontrunners – something that could further split the Tories, with some MPs vowing to quit if he becomes leader,according to the Guardian.
May’s team is trying to engage senior members of the opposition, hoping to bring enough members on side to pull her deal through, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also be in Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
The pound fell sharply against the euro during yesterday – exactly 1,000 days on from the seismic 2016 Brexit referendum — reflecting fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without any agreement at all.
‘Credibility’
May yesterday said any postponement beyond the end of June would undermine voters’ trust. “It is high time we made a decision,” May said in her TV address.
Meanwhile, the European Commission advised EU leaders that it would be preferable to either have a shorter delay to 23 May — when voting begins in European Parliament elections — or a much longer one, until at least the end of 2019.
A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed London’s “clear request” and said she would “make every effort” to bring about an agreement at the Brussels summit.
But her foreign minister Heiko Maas, of the junior coalition partner Social Democrats, said May’s letter “only pushes the solution further down the road”.
In Paris, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had a tough message.
“A situation in which Mrs May is unable to deliver sufficient guarantees on the credibility of her strategy at the European Council meeting would lead to the request being refused and a preference for a no deal,” he told parliament.

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-armed-unit-cavan-4525095-Mar2019/,"AN ARMED SUPPORT unit will shortly be operational along the border regions, under new plans being rolled out by the Garda Commissioner, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
The Taoiseach was asked about the new unit being set up in light of Brexit, and the possibility of a no-deal.
The Irish Independent reports today that there are plans to deploy armed support units on a round-the-clock basis to deal with the possible Brexit fallout.
However, Varadkar said the additional garda unit would be “happening Brexit or no Brexit”, adding that additional resources are being ramped up nationwide.
Earlier this year, Garda Commissioner Drew Harrisdismissed a reportthat he had discussed a proposal to move 600 gardaí to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Varadkar confirmed today that a third unit is to be located in Cavan.
He said it is being set up following joint work between PSNI and the Gardaí, which finds that 43% of organised crime has a cross-border aspect.
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett asked the Taoiseach if it is just coincidence that a new unit is being established near the border.
“The position is we are improving garda resources all over the country,” stating that it should be a surprise to no one that the norther regions would also receive additional resources.
Responding to the news, James Morrisroe, GRA representative for the Cavan Monaghan Division stated:
“At the GRA conference as far back as 2016 delegates based in the border divisions called for the lack of 24 hr Armed support units in those divisions to be addressed immediately and indeed at the GRA conference in 2018 we called for an effective geographical spread of such units in the border region.
“One would hope that the armed unit in Cavan is set up without delay and training commenced as soon as possible given the current Brexit impasse.”
Previously, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said that in the circumstances of a no-deal Brexit, hard conversations with the European Commission about the border would have to take place.
No discussions about the border
Speaking to reporters today, he said those discussions with the EC haven’t taken place yet, adding that those discussions won’t be happening until a no-deal becomes a certainty.

“If Britain crashes out in an unmanaged way, I think Britain too has said that there will need to be a serious negotiations about how to avoid physical infrastructure on the border and retain peace on the island,” he added.

Varadkar later said in the Dáil that in a no-deal, discussions would be needed with the European Commission on how to maintain open borders and protect the single market.
“People talk about alternative arrangements but the only thing written down that works in law and reality is what’s contained in the backstop,” he said.
Contingency planning continues
The Cabinet today received a further update on the contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit scenario.
Coveney said the government is committed to maintaining the Common Travel Area, and today it finalised the remaining domestic decisions necessary to conclude the Common Travel Area arrangements.
He added that the Irish government is now ready to sign a full memorandum with UK to safeguard all elements of the CTA.
Updates were also provided around preparations for ports and airports, with the Tánaiste stating that work on temporary infrastructure at Dublin and Rosslare ports is well underway.
By the end of March, Revenue will have over 400 additional staff trained and in place, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have over 200 additional staff trained and in place.
The Department of Health will have at least 59 additional staff trained and in place
“Everyone is looking to next week where a vote will be held in Westminster and a deal will be ratified.
“Worst-case scenario of a crash-out Brexit, we will do everything we can to support Irish people and the economy,” said Coveney.
He added that some of the EC-based no-deal preparations progressed today. This includes a six-month grace period for airlines being put in place in the case of a no-deal scenario, which will allow airline owners make any necessary changes to its shareholder arrangements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hard-brexit-budget-impact-ireland-4511975-Feb2019/,"A NO-DEAL BREXIT could push Ireland’s budget back into the red for another five years – putting the squeeze on the government in meeting its pledges to ramp up spending on infrastructure and other needs.
In a recent note on the potential impact of a hard Brexit, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) said the hit to the economy would push employment, company profits and consumption below the current official forecasts.
That would cut tax incomes and lead to higher welfare costs, dragging the budget back into negative territory this year “with further increases in the deficit to 2023″, based on previous Department of Finance estimates.
The PBO added that the risks from a no-deal Brexit to the public finances were influenced by existing policies as Budget 2019 had been built on the assumptions that there would be little trade friction between the EU and the UK.
With just over 30 days until the Brexit deadline, Irish officials are getting increasingly jittery about the possibility that the UK will go crashing out of the bloc without an agreement in place – although Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday said he expected either a deal would be struck or the deadline would be extended.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney recently warned that Ireland would probably face deficits for “another year or two” in the case of a hard Brexit.

The PBO, which provides independent budget analysis to the Oireachtas, added that letting tax revenues fall while ramping up spending “may be merited” with a no-deal Brexit, depending on the size of the resulting economic shock.
That could be complicated, however, by Ireland’s already-high debt curbing the country’s ability to continue borrowing, while EU fiscal rules – which aim to stop member states from large deficits “may also be a constraint”.
Ireland’s gross government debt stood at €216 billion in the third quarter of last year, among the highest per-capita amounts in the developed world.

Back in the black
The State posted a small surplus last year, its first since 2006, on the back of buoyant company tax receipts, which have recently been boosted by the windfall from a handful of foreign firms.
The budget had included forecasts for a small deficit both last year and in 2019 followed by increasing surpluses to 2023.
A large share of the predicted increases in tax revenues were earmarked to go towards higher capital spending to cover major projects included in the National Development Plan, like Dublin’s €3 billion MetroLink.
Related ReadsMetrolink: How did we get here and what's next?
Goodbody chief economist Dermot O’Leary toldTheJournal.iethat he expected Ireland to go into a “mild” recession next year in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
“It is very likely that we would see a budget deficit of 2% or so, and it will be difficult to get back into surplus in the following years,” he said.
While the government would be “unwise” to cut spending in the short-term, a longer-term hit to the public finances could force its hand.
However in a no-deal scenario, O’Leary expected that Ireland would be given extra leeway by the European Commission to temporarily break the EU’s spending rules.
“Given the fact that Europe is well aware that this external shock would affect Ireland more than any other country, there’s a likelihood of fiscal support coming from Europe for the sectors that are most affected,” he said.
Last year the government was criticised by its financial watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, for its repeated failure to rein in unbudgeted spending increases in areas like health since the economic recovery.
That had left the State’s finances vulnerable to shocks like higher-than-expected Brexit costs or a sudden drop in volatile corporate taxes, the council said.

May arrives#Brexitpic.twitter.com/PIUi5ggyZe
[Note: Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker have given a press conference on progress at the Strasbourg talks. The two leaders have agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop -more details here.]
BRITISH CABINET OFFICE Minister David Lidington has told MPs in the House of Commons tonight that the UK government has “secured legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration”.
He said proposed new mechanisms would prevent the EU from trapping the UK in the backstop indefinitely.
He said the deal would be put to MPs in a vote tomorrow as planned.
May earlier arrived in Strasbourg for last-ditch talks with senior EU officials ahead of tomorrow’s planned vote.
She arrived after 8pm this evening for her meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Here at home, ministers convened this evening for their second Cabinet meeting of the day, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has spoken by phone with Juncker.
It’s understood that the Taoiseach and his entourage were due to fly to Washington DC this evening ahead of his week-long St Patrick’s Day visit to the States, however, his travels have been delayed until tomorrow.
Varadkar had wanted to travel a day early to America so as to avoid being mid-flight when the Westminster votes were taking place tomorrow.
However, senior sources confirmed that Cabinet members were summoned to a meeting for 6.45pm this evening. “Very sudden,” is how one source described it.
A government spokesperson has said the Taoiseach’s travel plans have always been “flexible” due to the unpredictability of Brexit events this week. It is “very much” the plan that Varadkar’s agreed schedule, which is due to begin on Wednesday, will go ahead.
Some ministers were not present in person this evening as they have already left the country to fulfill their St Patrick’s Day itineraries.
The meeting broke up just after 8.30pm and is due to reconvene later tonight.

May was greeted this evening at the Strasbourg parliament building by Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Her visit comes after British officials worked through the weekend to secure concessions from the European Union they hope will persuade MPs to back the text.
Britain’s House of Commons overwhelmingly defeated the agreed EU-UK withdrawal deal in January and without significant changes, it is expected to do so again in a vote tomorrow.
The EU has rejected many of May’s demands, which relate to the controversial backstop, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it had made an offer at the weekend.
Guy Verhofstadt, who oversees the negotiations for the European Parliament, said he and European Parliament President Antonio Tajani would meet later with May.
“I hope progress can be made, if it is possible, as a no deal #Brexit would be a catastrophe,” Verhofstadt tweeted.
“We will stand by Ireland & the need to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement.”

Another defeat in parliament could see the UK sever ties with its closest trading partner on 29 March with no new arrangements.
It would also raise the possibility of postponing Brexit, after May promised to allow MPs a vote later this week on whether to accept a no-deal scenario or request a short delay from the EU.
May has promised Britain will leave the EU whatever happens on 29 March, but many MPs fear that a “no deal” exit would wreak economic havoc.
In the face of a cabinet revolt, she promised that if her deal is defeated again then MPs will vote on “no deal” on Wednesday and then on Thursday, on delaying Brexit.
Any postponement would have to be approved by the leaders of the other 27 nations, who are next meeting at a Brussels summit on March 21-22 – a week before Brexit.

THE UK LABOUR party is preparing to back an amendment for a second referendum on Brexit as part of efforts to avoid an no-deal scenario.
In recent weeks, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that his priority has been to avoid a no-deal Brexit and Labour said this evening that it will back a public vote to avoid it.
A series of House of Commons votes on Brexit are scheduled this week and Corbyn has said the party will be “putting forward or supporting” an amendment on a public vote.
Corbynplans to tell MPsabout the plan in a parliamentary party meeting this evening in which he’ll accusing British Prime Minister Theresa May of trying to “run down the clock” and force MPs to choose between her deal and no-deal.
“We will also be backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment to rule out a no deal outcome. One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal,” Corbyn will say.

The development comes after a day in which May sought to downplay any suggestion that a Brexit extension could be sought.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the Prime Minister earlier this morning.
“It’s evident to me that no one wants the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal,” Varadkar said onTwitter, repeating a sentiment given before.
In a press statement given after her meeting with Varadkar,May saidthat an extension to Article 50 “isn’t addressing the issues”, adding that “any delay is a delay”.
“We have it within our grasp,” she said, adding that there’s been “a real sense that we can achieve that deal on 29 March, and that is where all my energies are going to be focused.”

The leaders have gathered in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh this weekend; May has held bilateral meetings with a number of EU leaders, hours after announcing that she would postpone the UK parliament’s vote on her divisive Brexit deal.
May has already held talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte this morning.

She and her team will return to Brussels tomorrow, and will address the House of Commons on her talks with the EU on the Brexit process. On Wednesday, MPs will have the chance to debate their own ideas for the way forward through this prolonged Brexit stalemate.
Yesterday,May confirmed reportsthat a vote on her Withdrawal Agreement would be postponed. The House of Commons was due to hold a vote this Wednesday, 27 February – but that has now been pushed back to Tuesday 12 March, just over two weeks before the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March.

Commentators are speculating that leaving the vote until the last minute could pressure MPs to vote for her deal, which suffered a historic House of Commons defeat in January.
There are also reports that assurances to the Irish backstop, which MPs have blamed for the rejection of May’s deal, will be given by the EU and Ireland in an attempt to avoid a dreaded no-deal Brexit.
Reacting to May’s decision to postpone the vote, Varadkar said:
“This is a situation the UK has created for itself so we are not playing chicken, we are not playing poker, we are just standing by our position which has been solid from day one.”

https://www.the42.ie/racing-leinster-ulster-epcr-brexit-4491987-Feb2019/,"LEINSTER OR ULSTER could face Racing 92 at the French club’s home venue of the Paris La Défense Arena in the semi-finals of the Champions Cup, with EPCR considering allowing the Top 14 outfit to use their home stadium.
Semi-finalists who have enjoyed ‘home advantage’ in the Champions Cup in recent seasons have not been able to host the games in their own home stadium, instead having ‘home country advantage’.

For example, Racing 92 had home advantage against Munster in last season’s semi-finals but hosted the game in Bordeaux.
However, EPCR has confirmed that it is considering the suitability of the 32,000-capacity Paris La Défense Arena in the event of Racing beating Toulouse in the Champions Cup quarter-finals at the end of March.
That could mean the winner of the Leinster versus Ulster quarter-final travelling to face Racing at their home stadium in the semi-finals, with Racing having a higher seeding than both Irish provinces after the pool stages of the Champions Cup.
Similarly, if Edinburgh beat Munster and Glasgow overcome Saracens on the other side of the draw, EPCR is considering Edinburgh’s home stadium, BT Murrayfield, as the semi-final venue.

EPCR says it will confirm the selected semi-final venue options in England, France, Ireland and Scotland “at a later date.”
Meanwhile, EPCR says it has reassured European clubs that registered players who are citizens of the United Kingdom will continue to be considered as ‘European Players’ in the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup for the remainder of the current season.
With the UK scheduled to leave the European Union on Friday 29 March – the same weekend as the European rugby quarter-finals – there had been concerns over how Brexit would affect player eligibility.
This reassurance will come as a relief to UK-based clubs, while EPCR also confirmed that it is considering minor rule changes that would resolve the issue of ‘European Player’ status in the coming seasons, post-Brexit.
“Following a recent meeting, the EPCR Board has decided to use its full discretion in selecting appropriate venues for Heineken Champions Cup semi-finals matches,” reads a statement from EPCR.
Racing's stadium is indoor.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
“With key elements such as stadium capacity, commercial viability, operational suitability and location remaining paramount for the high-profile matches, EPCR will continue to designate the venues in conjunction with the recommendations of its stakeholders.
“As a number of clubs now own or control premium venues which befit the status of a Heineken Champions Cup semi-final, EPCR will also consider the possibility of staging a semi-final at a home stadium of a qualified club.
“Regarding the current season, the suitability of BT Murrayfield as a venue should Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors be scheduled to meet in Semi-final 1 of the Heineken Champions Cup will be assessed, while the 32,000-capacity Paris La Défense Arena will be considered along with other stadiums in France should Racing 92 qualify for Semi-final 2 on the weekend of 20/21 April.

“This use of full discretion in selecting Heineken Champions Cup semi-final venues does not require any change to the governing rules and regulations of EPCR and, as in previous seasons, continues to recognise performances during the pool stage with the highest-ranked clubs earning home country advantage in their respective semi-final matches.
“The selected semi-final venue options in England, France, Ireland and Scotland will be announced at a later date.
“On a separate note, EPCR has reassured the clubs which have qualified for the knockout stages of the Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup that a registered player who is a citizen of the United Kingdom will be considered as aEuropean Playerfor the purposes of the tournaments as far as the remainder of the 2018/19 season is concerned.
“EPCR is also considering a number of minor rule changes which would resolve the issue ofEuropean Playerstatus for future seasons.”

THERESA MAY HAS told Tory MPs that she would not “stand in the way” of being replaced as leader in the next stage of Brexit negotiations.
In the wake of the announcement, British media reported that members of the pro-Brexit ERG group said that they would back May’s deal – including Boris Johnson, who’s among those tipped as the next Tory leader.
It wasn’t enough for the DUP, however, who said that the failure to renegotiate the backstop means that they will “not risk compromising the Union”.
May held a meeting with Conservative Party’s backbenchers, known as the 1922 Committee hours before MPs were due to vote on a series of Brexit options.
“I know there is a desire for a new approach – and new leadership – in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations, and I won’t stand in the way of that,” she said.
The current deal that May has negotiated only handles the conditions upon which the UK leaves the European Union; the next phase of Brexit negotiations is about the future relationship, and covers issues like trade.
“I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty – to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit,” according to wording released by 10 Downing Street.
The deal has been twice-defeated before in the House of Commons, by a majority of 230 votes in January, and a majority of 149 votes in February. The third ‘Meaningful Vote’ is rumoured to take place on Friday; but House Speaker John Bercow has said it’s not certain that the deal would be allowed to be put forward for a vote.

@BorisJohnsonabsolutely right telling MPs that palpable risk of losing Brexit altogether with the chance of change in the next phase means we have little choice but to vote for the Withdrawal Agreement.
In an ERG meeting following the statement, Johnson is to have said that he would support May’s deal, adding that there was a fear Brexit might not happen at all otherwise.
The DUP were due to release a statement at 6pm announcing their decision not to back May’s deal, but it came instead 3 hours later.
A statement from the party said that it “poses an unacceptable threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom” and “create an internal trade border within the UK”.
Speaking on Sky News, party leader Arlene Foster said that she didn’t feel betrayed by her ERG colleagues who had switched sides to support May’s deal following her statement today. Their priority was Brexit, while the DUP’s is the Union, she said.

Conservative MP James Cartlidge, who was at the closed-door meeting, told reporters as he walked out that May had said she would step down before the “next phase” of Brexit negotiations.
Another MP, Pauline Latham, told reporters that May had said she would resign “after the meaningful vote was through”, meaning the vote on her EU divorce deal.
“We have to pass it or all bets are off,” Latham said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/you-people-northern-ireland-groomed-into-violence-hard-brexit-border-4499273-Feb2019/,"A NEW REPORT has warned that if a hard border emerges after Brexit young people in Northern Ireland could be “groomed into violent activity by dissident republicans”.
The reportcompiled by chairs of two UNESCO committees warns that young people who are marginalised are more susceptible to be recruited by groups like the New IRA.
“The deconstruction of a border swiftly after its creation could become the absolute raison d’etre for youth becoming engaged in violence,” the report states.
The report warns that in a little as six weeks it is possible that a hard border could materialise due to a no-deal Brexit and without direct efforts to engage youth and citizens of all backgrounds there will be a return to violence.
Authors of the report, Professor Pat Dolan and Professor Mark Brennan, also warn that if “a rushed and ill-timed” referendum for United Ireland – which Sinn Féin has repeatedly advocated for – is held after the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, it too could result in conflict.
“The only question in both scenarios will be the scale of the violence,” the report said.
The Agreement Generation
The report claims that the generation of people born after the Good Friday Agreement – the ‘Agreement Generation’ -  has no memory of the “horrors” of the Troubles, a key problem according to the report’s authors.
“It is not unusual that in post-conflict situations such as Northern Ireland, the immediate generation find it very difficult to discuss with the following generation (and in particular their offspring) the horrors of war and what happened to loved ones and, in this case, what is termed the ‘period of the troubles’,” the report said.

It added that while there may be a proportion of the population who are not sharing their experiences of the Troubles, there may also be those for whom what happened is unfinished and they in turn potentially could incite youth.
“This leads to an unforeseen risk in that youth falsely bias and romanticise past local history and minimise the human harm sorrow and grief that violence has caused to their fellow beings and neighbours.”
In aninterview withTheJournal.ie,a former commander of the Real IRA said that life around the border would change “dramatically” in the short-term in the event of a hard Brexit.
He warned that resurgent armed republican groups would stage a massive recruitment drive if there was a hard border.
Security analyst and former Defence Forces officer Tom Clonan, who served at the border during The Troubles, argues that basic infrastructure like a camera on a mast would be attacked and removed.
“There are elements within the border area that do not want normal policing. So anything like that would be very, very provocative in the border areas – masts, aerials, sensors, or cameras would be seen as very provocative. I believe that type of infrastructure would be attacked and would be destroyed,” he previously toldTheJournal.ie.
Preventing violence
The report carried out in conjunction with Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly, has warned that a return to violence would result in the increase in security costs and in prison numbers.
The report claims that a critical part of preventing violent extremism is to be found in community-level leadership, “which can counteract the emergence of extremism by providing a space for interaction between those of different traditions”.
Another recommendation is the development of youth-driven anti-extremism and anti-violence media campaigns, “to proactively prevent the emergence of violence both in a Brexit and possible referendum environment”.
“Acting together to facilitate peace and stability does not take away or diminish any tradition, culture, belief or background. This only helps to create something new that is more dynamic, adaptive, inclusive and far removed from politics, ideology, and the baggage of history,” the study concluded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-commons-explainer-4566896-Mar2019/,"WILL TODAY BE third time lucky for British Prime Minister Theresa May?
A couple of hours out from the latest Brexit vote it seems unlikely if the DUP’s stance continues, but her government is going to try anyway.
The House of Commons is going to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement for the third time, but why are they going again and why is it different this time around.
In large part, the primary reason for today’s vote is an attempt to push back the Brexit date, again.
Lest anyone forget, today was supposed to be#BrexitDay. The UK invoked Article 50 two years ago today and so was supposed to leave the bloc at 11pm tonight.
But as we know, the agreement on how this is to happen has not been approved by the House of Commons, and the UK therefore sought an extension on this deadline.
The EU agreed, but there were some conditions attached.
European leaders insisted that the UK could not remain part of the EU if it did not hold MEP elections that are due on 23 May.
It was therefore agreed that the UK’s exit date be extended until 22 May, but only if the UK parliament passed the Withdrawal Agreement.
If the agreement is not passed, which is currently the case, Brexit may happen before 12 April as this is the date considered the cut off for MEP elections.
Advertisement
May and the UK government do not want to leave with no deal on 12 April and are therefore giving parliament one more shot at passing the agreement today.
The EU has also stated that if the UK government wants a longer extension, this would also have to be agreed before 12 April so the Withdrawal Agreement will still need to be passed.
To complicate things though, House Speaker John Bercow said that Commons rules dictate that MPs could not vote on the exact same thing again.
So to get around this, May’s government has proposed an important change to today’s vote.
While the two previous votes were on the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration on the Future Relationship, today’s vote will only be on the Withdrawal Agreement.
This change satisfied Bercow, who said the motion was not “substantially different”.
But what is the story with these two documents?
They’re different in that the Withdrawal Agreement sets out conditions for how the UK will leave, such as the transition period and rules about the backstop.
The document is 585 pages long and also contains details about the UK’s €39-44 billion divorce bill.
The Political Declaration is much shorter, at 26 pages, and sets out what the UK hopes for the UK-EU relationship after the transition period.
It sets out the end of free movement of EU citizens and also makes reference to trade between both parties being as close as possible to what it currently is.
Importantly, the Withdrawal Agreement is legally binding while the Political Declaration is not.

The British Parliament’s petitions committee tweeted that the rate of signings is the “highest the site has ever had to deal with”, after the website briefly crashed earlier. A House of Commons spokesman said the technical difficulties on parliament’s e-petition website were caused by “a large and sustained load on the system”.
Since then, the committee has also attemptedto tackle claimsthat the huge interest in the petition is not fraud, and has claimed that 96% of the signatures to the petition are from the UK.
“We don’t comment in detail about security measures. We use different techniques – automated and manual – to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses and other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. We also monitor signing patterns.
The House of Commons pledges to consider all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate in the chamber.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-tusk-brexit-solidarity-4562871-Mar2019/,"EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk has told the European Parliament that its members “should be open if the UK wishes to rethink its British strategy”.
Addressing parliamentarians in Strasbourg, Tusk said the possibility remains that the UK could seek a long extension to its Brexit process.
“It would of course mean the UK’s participation in the European Parliament elections,” he said.
At last week’s European summit, EU leaders agreed to delay the day of Britain’s departure from the bloc by three weeks until 12 April, while Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to ratify a withdrawal treaty.
But many on the continent – most vocally France’s President Emmanuel Macron – oppose a longer extension, concerned it would disrupt the European Parliament elections that start on 23 May.

Appeal to EP: You should be open to a long extension, if the UK wishes to rethink its strategy. 6 million people signed the petition, 1 million marched. They may not feel sufficiently represented by UK Parliament but they must feel represented by you. Because they are Europeans.
If Britain is still an EU member on that date, it would have to take part in the vote, and wrangling over Brexit would continue to disrupt the European political agenda for months or years to come.
On Saturday, an estimated 1 million people marched through Londoncalling for a people’s vote on Brexit. Similarly, a petition calling for Article 50to be reversed is nearing 6 million signatures.
“Then there were voices saying it would be inconvenient or harmful to some of you [if UK takes part in European elections]. Let me be clear – such thinking is unacceptable,” Tusk said.
His comments come with the House of Commons today set to debate and hold a series of indicative votes on Brexit that could point the way towards the next steps the UK will take in the coming weeks.
MPs will have the chance to vote on various options such as revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit, holding another referendum, a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leaving the European Union without a deal.
Even if MPs decide a majority course of action today, it won’t be legally binding and could be ignored by the government.

IRISH HAULIER REPRESENTATIVES have said that the no-deal test run at the Port of Dover was too little too late, and wasn’t representative of how bad the tailbacks could be.
Yesterday, the UK governmentpaid truck driversto take part in a test of how one element of trade would be handled in the event of a no-deal.
The Port of Dover is Europe’s busiest ferry port, and is the second busiest in England; its Cargo Terminal handles 300,000 tonnes of freightannually.
A no-deal Brexit would see additional custom and regulatory checks at ports and airports, and possibly along the Irish border unless the Good Friday Agreement supersedes no-deal Brexit arrangements.
But the test was criticised as “a waste of time” and not accurate to how bad the traffic would actually be in the event of a no-deal.

According toan article in the Financial Times, a government report said that if custom checks were to delay each vehicle by over 80 seconds, it would lead to “no recovery”, meaning permanent gridlock in and out of Dover.
If the delays take 40 seconds or less, then there will be no additional delays, according to the Financial Times.
When Aidan Flynn, General Manager of the Irish Freight Association was asked about the likelihood of checks taking less than 40 seconds, he said it was “unreasonable”.
He also says that the uncertain nature of the congestion on the way to the port means that there are issues for driver safety, as it’s more difficult to take a break.
“The landbridge used is because it’s the path with the least amount of friction and it’s the quickest way of getting to continental Europe. But it could now create its own bottleneck for the delivery reaching its destination on time and all subsequent deliveries.
Flynn said that there was a suggestion that Irish hauliers could operate under the Common Transport Convention, but that would need to be paid for and developed.
“Nobody will be exempt for checks,” Flynn adds.
“The UK doesn’t have the infrastructure to give Irish hauliers a free route into these ports, so you’re going to get caught [in these tailbacks] no matter what. Looks completely unworkable, but you do have to try these things, so locals ad politicians can see the impact a no-deal would have on their region. We already know the impact it would have.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will return to Brussels today to continue attempts to reopen the terms of Britain’s Brexit divorce, but appears headed for disappointment.
With less than six weeks until Brexit, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has agreed to meet May once again, but EU leaders insist they will not restart negotiations.
“I have great respect for Theresa May, for her courage and her assertiveness,” Juncker said yesterday.
“We will have a friendly talk tomorrow but I don’t expect a breakthrough.”
May and the other 27 EU leaders approved a Brexit withdrawal agreement at a summit on 25 November last year, but the House of Commons rejected it on 15 January.
Since then, May and her ministers have repeatedly met EU leaders and their negotiator Michel Barnier to urge them to reopen the text to find a way to appease eurosceptic MPs.
May will try again today, but on this trip she will not even meet Donald Tusk who, as president of the European Council, represents the leaders of EU member states.

She will instead meet Juncker and Barnier, who have no mandate from Tusk’s council or EU capitals to renegotiate the deal, or to modify the Northern Ireland backstop.
However, Brexiteers in the Conservative party see this as a trap to keep Britain in a form of union indefinitely, and have demanded a time limit or a unilateral exit clause.
May’s spokesman said the prime minister was “working hard to secure legally binding changes” to the backstop.
“The prime minister believes that she can secure changes in relation to the backstop MPs want – there is a majority in parliament for a deal,” he added.
May is due at the EU’s Berlaymont headquarters for her meeting with the Commission president at 5:30 pm, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also meet Barnier tomorrow.
Separately, the Irish Independent reports that the British and Irish governments have guaranteed the continued payment of social welfare payments, including state pensions and child benefit, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
A legally binding agreement was signed by the two governments to ensure that welfare payments will still be paid to expats living in both countries, as part of rights that currently exist under the Common Travel Area.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE gathered this afternoon at the Dundalk-Newry border to protest against the prospect of any type of border in the outcome of a hard Brexit.
Border Communities Against Brexit(BCAB) had encouraged people from cross-border populations to come and express their “fears and concerns” about the potential for a hard border in Ireland.
The group estimated that around 1,500 people were in attendance.
A mock eight-foot wall and army watchtower were built to make “a stand against Brexit, against borders, against division”.
“We never want to see a border on this island again,” BCAB spokesperson Declan Fearon toldTheJournal.ie.
Demonstration organisers went as far as putting ‘troops’ at the mock border wall to illustrate their concern that Ireland could be heading back to the days when there were border checkpoints.
“It was a manifestation of what it used to look like and we don’t want to go back to that time,” Fearon said.
He explained that it was important to show the reenactment of a border checkpoint because there are so many people who do not remember how it was when checkpoints were in place and that “we could be heading back in that direction”.

As a newly formed group, Fearon said the BCAB was really pleased with how well the demonstration was received.
“Leo’s comments yesterday were stark to listen to but it’s what we have been saying. Everything we’ve read points to a hard border,” Fearon said.
During an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was asked what the border is going to look like“if they screw this up”.
Varadkar said it would “involve people in uniform and it may involve the need, for example, for cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up”.

‘There will be no troops’
Speaking toSky Newsat the border protest, Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald was critical of Varadkar for “summoning up” the imagery of troops back at checkpoints.
McDonald went on to echo her speech from the ‘Beyond Brexit’ conference earlier today, in which she called for the government to convene a forum to beginplanning for Irish unity.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will put her Withdrawal Agreement back before the House of Commonsthis Tuesday, but the strictest opposition from the House of Commons seems to be due to the backstop.
Many pro-Brexit and some pro-Remain MPs have expressed concern about whether the backstop would threaten Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom; others have said that the backstop needs to be time-limited, which EU leaders have said would make the backstop entirely pointless.
With time running out before the 29 March, which is when the UK must legally leave the European Union, the UK government, the EU and Ireland are scrambling for solutions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/history-when-the-uk-joined-the-eu-4392827-Jan2019/,"WE’RE NOW AT the tailend of what looks like the end of an era: the United Kingdom’s time as part of the European Union.
Whether you agree with the Brexit vote or not, it’s almost certain to still be happening, and by 29 March, it will no longer be possible to retract what the UK voted for – to leave the European Union.
So let’s look at when they first voted to join the European Union (or what was the precursor to the EU).
The original Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community kept in the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome, Italy.Vandeville Eric / ABACAVandeville Eric / ABACA / ABACA
The early EU
The ‘European ideal’ began as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. A purely economic arrangement, it was formed in the aftermath of World War II to regulate industries between six nations: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany.
It then developed into European Economic Community, which was an early version of the EU’s Common Market, which allows for the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
It was overseen by authorities that would eventually become the European Commission, Parliament, Council of the European Union and Courts of Justice.
After the UK’s first application to join the European Communities in 1963 was vetoed by France (which also stopped Ireland’s progression to membership), a friendship between British Prime Minister Edward Heath, a Conservative, and the French president Georges Pompidou saw that veto lifted.
No referendum
When the UK agreed to an accession treaty in January 1972 and when the corresponding act went through the legislative process, no referendum was held on the grounds that to hold one would be unconstitutional (it had been argued, as it had been with previous votes, that a referendum could violate parliamentary sovereignty).

The UK joined the European Communities on 1 January 1973, along with Denmark and Ireland. Areferendum held in May 1972confirmed Ireland’s entry into the European community with 83% of voters supporting membership.
But in a general election in February 1974 Labour, running on an election manifesto promising a referendum on membership, won a working majority.
Yes, there will be a referendum

After a number of legislative arguments, the referendum was called and would be held on 5 June 1975, by which time, Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Conservatives.
The vote would be the only nationwide plebiscite to be held in the UK during the 20th century. The question put to the people was:
A ‘Yes’ vote was also supported by the majority of the Conservative Party, including Thatcher: 249 of 275 party members in Parliament supported staying in the European Community in a free vote in April 1975.
But there were Tories who said that the party was split over the issue, as was the Labour party. Most of the UUP, as well as the DUP and the Scottish National Party were in favour of a ‘No’ vote.
In a pamphlet Prime Minister Harold Wilson said: “I ask you to use your vote. For it is your vote that will now decide. The government will accept your verdict. The pamphlet also said: “Now the time has come for you to decide. The government will accept your decision – whichever way it goes.”
With a national turnout of 64% across the United Kingdom, the target to secure a majority for the winning side was 12,951,598 votes. It won the support of over two-thirds of those who voted (67%, or 17.4 million).
On 23 June 2016,a referendum was held in the UK on EU membership, where it was expected that the Remain vote would win.The final resultsaw 51.9% voting to leave the European Union (that’s 17 million people), with 48.1% voting to remain.
The populations of Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU, while England and Wales voted to leave.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-construction-cost-to-rise-4585421-Apr2019/,"THE COST OF building in Dublin is forecast to jump by 7% this year putting the capital as one of the most expensive cities for construction in the world, a new report has claimed.
The International Construction Market (ICM) survey put Dublin in third place behind London and Zurich as the most expensive city to build in Europe and landed it in seventh place globally.
Against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty, the report found Dublin was a “hot” construction market with costs increasing by up to 7%, and outpacing the global forecast average of 4% over the next 12 months.
The ICM survey puts the average cost of building in Dublin at around €2,900 p/m2, while London came in with an average cost of €3,365 p/m2 and Zurich came in at €3,334 p/m2.
Last month the Construction Industry Federation (CIF)warnedthat construction costs would increase in any Brexit scenario, as a report revealed half of businesses had not engaged with suppliers – many from the UK – on cost implications of the UK’s exit from the EU.
“In the immediate term post-Brexit, the supply chain will be extremely challenged to absorb costs and many companies have already been struggling with increasing input and labour costs,” CIF director general Tom Parlon said in a message to members at the time.
Mark Kelly, marketing director Ireland at Turner and Townsend, who carried out the ICM survey said Dublin’s “hot” status is due in part to the surge in commercial and residential projects in recent years.

“Market confidence and construction demand in Dublin hasn’t been too badly shaken by the continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit in the UK, yet largely insulated by the economic revival we’ve seen in Ireland over recent years,” he said.
“The upturn has attracted a wave of large office and residential projects in the Irish capital, and the early spoils of Brexit have added further momentum as some major occupiers look to relocate from London,” he added.
Skills shortage
Kelly also identified a skills shortage within the construction industry here which is expected to further exacerbate costs as wages rise.
Overall, two-thirds of the markets surveyed reported a trade labour shortage. In Ireland, this has pushed the average hourly wage up 5% in the past 12 months, to €35.70.
“Another factor currently clouding the market outlook is mounting construction cost pressures, with demand relatively high across the continent, and investment only likely to continue this upward march,” he said.
“The shortage of skilled labour and supply chain capacity in Europe is becoming increasingly problematic – driving significant competition on wages and inflating construction costs further.”
Globally, San Francisco reigns as the most expensive city for construction in the world with a cost of €3,989 p/m2 ahead of New York which previously held the title.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-brexit-party-4588865-Apr2019/,"FORMER UKIP LEADER Nigel Farage has launched his new Brexit Party, and announced he has a list of 70 candidates set to run for the outfit in next month’s European elections.
In the wake of thelate night dealstruck by Theresa May and the leaders of the 27 remaining EU nations in Brussels this week, the UK must hold elections in May or face crashing out of the EU without a deal on 1 June.
Farage is hoping to capitalise on disillusionment among supporters of the Conservative party after the prime minister failed to meet a series of deadlines she had set herself to exit the EU.
“I genuinely believe right now this nation, we are lions led by donkeys,” Farage told his  Coventry launch event.
Farage, one of the leaders of the 2016 leave movement, quit UKIP in December saying the party had become too extreme.
Writing in The Daily Telegraphat the time, Farage said the “obsession” the current UKIP leadership has with Tommy Robinson and fixation with the issue of Islam “makes UKIP unrecognisable to many of us”.
Robinson, the former English Defence League leader, has been appointed an adviser to UKIP and there’s speculation he could have some role in the party’s Euro campaign.

Annunziata Rees-Mogg, the sister of Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg and a former Telegraph journalist, is to run as a candidate for Farage’s new party.
Speaking today, she said that while she had stuck with the Conservatives through thick and thin, “We’ve got to rescue our democracy, we have got to show that the people of this country have a say in how we are run”.
Farage said in a BBC radio interview earlier that there was no difference between his new party and his former one in terms of policy – but that there was in terms of personnel. UKIP’s brand had become tarnished, he insisted, because it had “allowed the far right to join it and effectively take it over”.
Responding on Twitter, current UKIP leader Gerard Batten insisted that Farage’s new party was just a vehicle for him and “not a teal [sic] political party”.

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Farage has been forced to concede there have been, as he described them, “teething problems” in his nascent political party.
The previous leaderresigned last monthafter a series of anti-Islam tweets came to light, whileanother senior officialwas removed from his post, also due to the emergence of offensive social media posts (including one referring to a foreigner as “someone from a bingo bongo land”).
Speaking earlier today Farage said the party was going to be going to be “deeply intolerant of all forms of intolerance”.
At the launch, he said its first task would be to change politics, warning: “I said that if I did come back into the political fray it would be no more Mr Nice Guy and I mean it.”
The European elections offer newer parties in the UK a rare chance to grab the national limelight and capitalise, in particular, on the woes of the Conservatives.
An outfit called The Renew Party kicked off its campaign by promising to give a voice to “people from outside politics” who still view themselves as Europeans and believers in causes such as fighting climate change.
It said it was “ready to speak up for disenfranchised voters who cannot rely on the Conservative and Labour parties”.
The Tories meanwhile will have to face supporters frustrated by the party’s inability to lead the way on the biggest issue to face Britain in generations.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay admitted last week that “asking the public to hold elections for an organisation we are meant to have left would damage trust in politics”.
For Labour, the fact that the party includes both Brexiters and remainers could cause campaign problems and split voters.
Anand Menon, European politics professor at King’s College London, said: “It is hard to imagine a worse time for Labour and the (Conservatives) to face the only UK-wide proportional electoral contest.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-leo-varadkar-dublin-meeting-4480061-Feb2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will visit Dublin on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has confirmed.
Speaking after a meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today, the Taoiseach said May will visit Dublin on Friday evening, where they will both have dinner together.
“It’s an opportunity as well to discuss the situation and work together to chart a way forward,” he said.
Varadkar added that the UK can request a Brexit extension, but speaking about the backstop issue, he said alternative arrangements for the Irish border can be explored but this cannot result in the deletion of the backstop.
The British Prime Minister is due to travel to Brussels tomorrow to meet with European leaders amid the continuing Brexit impasse.
While the Taoiseach has been in Brussels today, the British prime minister is spending a second day in the North meeting representatives of the five main Stormont parties.
This latest round of meetings comes after May was given a mandate by the House of Commons last week to pursue an eleventh hour deal with the EU on the basis of the so-called ‘Malthouse Compromise’.
Attempting to build support for the strategy,May told business leadersin Belfast yesterday that she intended to secure a deal that “commands broad support” as well as backing from a majority of MPs.

‘Ready to help Ireland’
Speaking today, Juncker said the EU is ready to help Ireland.
He said the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration have been negotiated in good faith and have been agreed by all 27 Leaders of the European Union Member States as well as by the United Kingdom.
“As we have said on many occasions, the Withdrawal Agreement is the best and only deal possible. It is not open for renegotiation.
“The backstop is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement. While we hope the backstop will not need to be used, it is a necessary legal guarantee to protect peace and to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, while protecting the integrity of our Single Market and the Customs Union,” he said this afternoon.
He said the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, is a “balanced compromise”, representing a good outcome for citizens and businesses on all sides, including in Northern Ireland.
Juncker added:
He said the Commission “stands ready to support Ireland” in finding solutions answering the specific challenges that Ireland and Irish citizens, farmers and businesses will face.
“We will work closely together to this end over the coming weeks.
“We will continue to remind the Government of the United Kingdom of its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement, with or without a deal,” he concluded.

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY Pelosi has issued a strong warning to the UK that a US-UK trade deal is not going to happen if the Good Friday Agreement is weakened by the Brexit process.
Speaking to the packed out ballroom at Iveagh House at the Department of Foreign Affairs, the US politician said she told “our friends in the UK” that the United States is a co-guarantor of the Agreement.
In her address, she said “it’s just not on the cards… don’t even think about it…” in reference to a US-UK trade deal.
While US President Donald Trump has indicated that a deal would be on the table post-Brexit, he would have to get such move approved by Congress.
Using strong language, Pelosi said  during her “high-level” meetings in the UK recently, she made it clear as to the purpose of the US delegation’s visit to Ireland this week.

“We made it clear that the Good Friday Accord for us, they are not just a peace agreement, it so much more elevated” due to the hundreds of years of conflict that ended with the signing of that document 21 years ago.
She added that the Good Friday Agreement is not just a peace agreement to the US, but a  value that she and her colleagues will protect.
Pelosi said that the UK should “not think for one minute there is comfort for them” after Brexit that a US-UK deal will be be achieved.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said in his address that the UK has every right to determine its own destiny, but it cannot determine Ireland’s.

Her speech today reiterated what she said at theLondon School of Economicsyesterday, where Pelosi said that it’s “very hard to pass a trade bill in the Congress in US, so there’s no given anyway”.
“But if there would be any weakening of the Good Friday accord, then there would be no chance whatsoever – a non-starter – for a US-UK trade agreement.”

She continued:
Pelosi is to pay a visit toÁras an Uachtaráinas part of a Democrat Congressional delegation to Ireland, Northern Ireland, London and Stuttgart this week.
She will also visit the border and Derry in Northern Ireland on Thursday.

A US-UK trade agreement is one of the ambitions of the British government post-Brexit, as part of the policy to strengthen ties with countries outside of the EU.
As the UK has failed to pass the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons three times, and failed to vote in favour of any other alternative, it’s had to request to delay the date upon which it was due to leave.
The UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, which was extended until 12 April and now has been extended again until 31 October at the very latest.
If MPs vote the Withdrawal Agreement through before 31 October, they will leave “on the first day of the following month”, according to European Council President Donald Tusk.

Speaking today,Tusk saidthat the long extension “ensures that all options remain on the table, such as ratification of the current Withdrawal Agreement, or extra time to rethink Brexit, if that were the wish of the British people”.
It also means that the UK will need to take part in European elections at the end of May.
Tusk said that during this extension, the UK should not be treated “as a second-category member state”.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said something similar today, when he said he was on a “Brexit break” and doesn’t want to talk about it at length this morning.

BRITAIN HAS ANNOUNCED plans for “swarm squadrons” of drones that could overwhelm enemy air defences as part of a series of plans to “enhance its lethality” after Brexit.
Speaking in London, UK Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said leaving the European Union was an opportunity for Britain “when we must strengthen our global presence”.
Williamson announced plans to invest €8 million in the drones, saying he expected squadrons “capable of confusing and overwhelming enemy air defences” to be ready by the end of 2019.
Williamson also said Britain would spend £65 million in “offensive cyber”, and bring two new naval vessels into service for operations from crisis support to conflict.

‘nonsense’
Opposition parties criticised Williamson’s rhetoric.
“The idea that our membership of the European Union restricts us is the purest nonsense,” Labour MP Chris Leslie said.
“In fact, the economic damage that Brexit threatens is what will most quickly weaken our forces,” the anti-Brexit MP said.
Britain is weeks away from its scheduled departure from the European Union and still has no firm arrangements in place.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s Downing Street office played down another of Williamson’s suggestions, to deploy Britain’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, in a challenge to China in the Pacific.
“The full details of her deployment will be agreed by the prime minister in due course,” May’s spokesman said.
The spokesman said the ship would only be ready to sail in 2021 and its first operational mission would include the Mediterranean, Middle East and Pacific regions.","10.30pm, 11 Feb 2019",

Speaking to reporters this morning, McDonald added to calls on Bradley to go, over comments made in the House of Commons earlier this week.
The Sinn Féin leader also went on the attack against the British government today, accusing the Conservative party of “recklessness” and “indecision”.
On Wednesday, Bradley said in parliament that deaths in Northern Ireland during the Troubles “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
She added: “They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way.”
After a number of statements seeking to clarify her comments, she said on Thursday evening that she was “profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt” that her words had caused.
Speaking to RTÉ News, Bradley said again that she was “profoundly sorry” for the offence caused, and said she didn’t believe what she said.
The Northern Ireland Secretary has since faced a barrage of criticism over her statement, while this FactCheck foundher original claim to be false.

Sinn Féin’s McDonald said today that “certainly her comments are a resigning matter”.
“It’d be hard to overstate the level of anger and stress it’s generated,” she said.
With a series of crucial votes in Westminster next week that will decide the UK’s course with Brexit, McDonald said these votes coming with just 20 days to go until Brexit was a further sign of the British government “playing down the clock” and “playing for time”.
She said: “If Britain wishes to Brexit, who are we to stop them? They’re not taking the North of Ireland with them. And they’re certainly not going to wreck the Irish economy, or upend our peace process or our peace settlement.”
The Sinn Féin leader added that it’s essential that Dublin and Brussels stands firm in the coming weeks and “doesn’t blink”.
Yesterday, Michel Barnier offered the UK a new Brexit deal which would see it leave the customs union but keep parts of the backstop which would ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.
In a number of tweets sent this afternoon, Barnier said the UK has been offered a way to exit the “single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, in response to Barnier’s tweets, said the ball is in the UK’s court.
He said: “We were and remain happy to apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland, if they want to go back to that. It doesn’t have to trap or keep all of Great Britain in the single customs territory for a prolonged period, or at all.”

Agriculture minister George Eustice sent a letter to May today tendering his resignation.
“It is with tremendous sadness that I have decided to resign from the government following the decision this week to allow the postponement of out exit from the EU,” Eustice said.
Eustice is a Brexiteer and former Ukip candidate who was first elected in 2010.

He said it had been “an honour” to work in his role and that he had “stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats”, but felt May had been “terribly undermined” by people who weren’t supporting the referendum result.
“I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,” Eustice said.
Yesterday, members of parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of a proposal that could allow Brexit to be delayed.
The motion, put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, was passed by 502 votes to 20.
May announced on Tuesday that she would give MPs a vote on seeking an extension to Article 50 if the House of Commons fails to pass her Brexit deal in March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-economic-forecast-4456961-Jan2019/,"THE CENTRAL BANK has published its economic forecast for how Ireland would fare in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as one of various possible scenarios that could happen after 29 March.
Among the most extreme effects of a no-deal Brexit as predicted by Ireland’s financial regulator are an “immediate disruption” in financial markets, higher costs and “further falls” in the value of sterling.
The Central Bank said that given that Brexit is “a situation that is without historical precedent”, there is considerable uncertainty around potential Brexit outcomes. In its latest quarterly update, it published an analysis of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit.
It predicts:
Over a 10-year period, the level of Irish output could be reduced by around 6 percentage points, though again employment and growth still remain positive overall.
The Central Bank said that it’s forecast would shift depending on when the UK leaves (there’s currently strong indications that there will be an extension); and a possible increase in foreign direct investment.
Preparations for Brexit
The Irish government’s and private businesses’ preparations for Brexit have been somewhat hampered as it’s not certain whether preparations should be for the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, a no-deal Brexit, or another unknown option.
Advertisement
The UK parliament voted against the Withdrawal Agreement last week; the opposition to it seem to be mostly to do with the backstop, which has drummed up staunch opposition from within the House of Commons.
If there is no deal, the EU has said that there will need to be basic checks between the EU and UK, which could include checking for animal documentation at the Irish border.
This would impact on farmers: many farming industries, such as the cheese production sector, is an all-island economy and could be delayed by a no-deal Brexit.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this will mean that the British government will have to apply to adopt World Trade Organisation rules.
This will mean that tariffs, or taxes, will have to be introduced by the UK for goods being imported from the EU, and EU member states will do the same for goods being imported from the UK. These tariffs are set rates: for example dairy goods are at 35%, while car imports cost 10% of their value.
In response to the Central Bank’s forecast, Mark Cassidy, Director of Economics and Statistics, said:
“The economy is forecast to continue growing at a relatively solid pace, though this is expected to moderate in line with international economic output and where we find ourselves in the current economic cycle.
“However, a disorderly no-deal Brexit has the potential to significantly alter the path of the Irish economy in both the short and medium term, with a substantial and permanent loss of output.
“Although Brexit continues to dominate headlines, we cannot ignore the other risks facing the economy, such as overheating and the international trade and taxation environment. Our ability to withstand any future downturns in the economy will be greatly enhanced by building up larger surpluses and buffers in the public finances now, especially if a no-deal Brexit can be avoided.”

THERESA MAY HAS said MPs who don’t back her Brexit deal risk damaging democracy.
The Prime Minister has also doubled down on her opposition to another public vote on the matter, saying it would “divide” Britain and be “disrespectful” to those who voted to leave the European Union.
Writing inthe Mail on Sunday, May said MPs who don’t back her deal risk damaging democracy.
“There are some in Parliament who, despite voting in favour of holding the referendum, voting in favour of triggering Article 50 and standing on manifestos committed to delivering Brexit, now want to stop us leaving by holding another referendum.
“Both groups are motivated by what they think is best for the country, but both must realise the risks they are running with our democracy and the livelihoods of our constituents,” May wrote.
During the week, an opinion poll found that more than half of Conservative Party members would prefer ano-deal Brexitrather than the draft Withdrawal Agreement.

Meanwhile, speaking on theAndrew Marr Show, May said there “should not be a second referendum”.
“What we see in parliament is some people who are advocating a second referendum because they want to stop Brexit.”
May noted that others, however, do not want a second vote, stating: “The chairman of the Labour Party, Ian Lavery, has said that this would be disrespectful to people who went out and voted Leave.

“You’d be talking about extending Article 50 – we’re already nearly three years from the vote to leave the European Union, I think we should be leaving the European Union and delivering on that vote.”
Shutdown
Earlier today the Sunday Times reported that a group of cross-party senior MPs are consideringcausing a government shutdownin order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
When Marr asked if May would back a second referendum if the House of Commons voted for such a scenario, she said it’s her job to convince MPs that this is “not the way forward for this country”.
“We’ve got different views across the House of Commons, we’ve got people who want a second referendum to stop Brexit, we’ve got people who are trying to use various means in the House of Commons to stop no-deal.
“My message to anybody who doesn’t want no-deal is actually you have two alternatives: no-deal or you can have a deal, and the deal that is on the table is the deal people will be voting on.”
House of Commons vote
In December, Maypostponed a voteon the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the deal.
She has insisted a vote on the agreement will go ahead this month.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of the official withdrawal date of 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-health-secretary-hancock-joins-race-to-become-tory-leadership-4651998-May2019/,"LAST UPDATE|25 May 2019
FORMER HOUSE OF Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has become the latest Tory MP to enter the race to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister who announced she would stand down as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.
Leadsom was the runner up in the Conservative leadership contest when May became leader in 2016 and until Wednesday served as Leader of the House of Commons.
She told the Sunday Times that she has the “experience and confidence” to lead the UK “into a brighter future”.
Leadsom joins front runner Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey, along with former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, according toSkynews.
Raab made his intentions known in the Mail on Sunday, where he wrote that he will put his hat in the ring to offer an “optimistic Conservative vision” and “fight for a fairer deal on Brexit”.
Early today, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock joined the long list of contenders.
The 40-year-old MP announced he was joining an already crowded field of Tory politicians hoping to succeed May.
“I’m running for the next prime minister because I profoundly believe we need a leader for the future and not just for now,” Hancock toldSky Newsthis morning.
“We need to deliver Brexit, and I will deliver Brexit, and we need to move this country forward, taking all the opportunities that Brexit brings.”

Leaving the European Union without an agreement is “not an active policy choice that is available to the next prime minister,”  Hancock said.
The Health Secretaryis viewed as one of the dark horses who might make it through a crowded field that is expected to include more than a dozen names.
Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has ruled herself out of the leadership contest while prominent Brexiteer MP Michael Gove, who ran for leader in 2016, has refused to be drawn on whether or not he will enter the race.
The contest is being held against the backdrop of European Parliament elections that the new Brexit Party of the anti-EU populist Nigel Farage is expected to win with about a third of the vote.
Polls show the Conservatives getting punished for their bickering over Brexit and finishing as low as fifth – their worst result in a national election.
The contenders are also mindful of a party revolt over May’s fateful decision to court the pro-EU opposition with the promise of a second Brexit referendum.
The concession was designed to help ram her withdrawal agreement through parliament on the fourth attempt.
But it won her no converts and sparked a party coup attempt that forced May to walk away before she was pushed out.
Parliamentary party members will begin whittling down the field of Tory party contenders to a final two on 10 June.
The finalists will go up for a vote in a ballot held across Britain by around 100,000 party members (who have three months’ standing) in July.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tds-passports-4421100-Jan2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said TDs offices should not be set up as passport delivery offices, stating that a “small number” of politicians encourage it.
As of last summer,TheJournal.ierevealedthat TDS and senators had made close to 5,000 representations to the Passport Office on behalf of their constituents seeking passports in the last two years.
According to figures released in July, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan made the most representations. In 2018, the Passport Office received 163 from the Cabinet minister. Fianna Fáil’s Pat the Cope Gallagher followed, with Minister for Rural and Community Development Michael Ring coming in third.
Others who made a large number of representations were Fianna Fáil’s deputy leader Dara Calleary and Fianna Fáil TD Charlie McConalogue.
TDs can make representations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Passport Office on behalf of distressed constituents whose passport applications are taking longer than expected.
However, when asked about the system, Coveney said:
He said the Passport Office experienced some “real problems” last year, due to the increase in the number of passport applications in light of Brexit, as well as the office having to close for a period due to extreme weather, which caused a backlog.

“Because of that there were a lot of emergency cases that actually came through the political system rather than through the standard process. We tried to facilitate that as best we can, because there is always exceptional circumstances and tragic cases… I think we muddled through okay last year,” he said.
Coveney said it is not quicker for constituents to go through their TD to get a passport.
“The only time I think TDs should be involved here is in a special case outside the norm… Any TD can contact my office and say well there is a special case here can the system accommodate getting a turnaround time quicker. Sometimes we have to pull a passport which can delay everyone slightly but we don’t like doing it, but we do it in exceptional circumstances. But that shouldn’t be the norm,” he said.
When asked if politicians making representations on behalf of their constituents was causing delays in the system, Coveney said:
Coveney said he makes a point of trying to encourage people to go through the system, adding that creating a “kind of secondary system through TDs offices which in some instances slows down the system” and can result in a lot of paperwork.
He added that by and large, TDs are simply trying to be helpful, but stated that he gets calls from politicians where their constituents find themselves in an emergency situation.
“There is nothing inappropriate here, this is a case of public representatives doing their job with the system, but I wouldn’t encourage is for TDs to set their offices up as the first port of call for a passport application when there is a very efficient online system there, and a postal system. People should only go to their TD if there is a fundamental problem here… otherwise we have a duplication.”
The Tánaiste said the Passport Office is anticipating an increase again in the number of passport applications this year, particularly from Britain.
“Clearly if there was a no deal Brexit that could well be a significant figure so we have to anticipate and prepare for that and we are,” he said.

TODAY WAS BILLED by Brexiteers as ‘Independence Day’, the day Britain was due to leave the European Union.
That was until Brexit was thrown into political turmoil on numerous occasions in recent months, with MPs unable to come to an agreement on deal. Today, MPs voted against British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreementfor a third time.
With the continued uncertainty, thousands of Brexit supporters have today taken to the streets of London to protest outside the UK Parliament – some after completing a two-week 435-kilometre protest march from Sunderland in northeast England.
The two-week protest has been organised by March To Leave.
“Come along to tell the establishment in London that we must leave and respect the referendum result,” it said on its website.
Hundreds of protesters walked through the capital this afternoon, blaring the Queen hit I Want to Break Free from loudspeakers and waving Union Jack flags as the march neared its destination.
Some demonstrators made their way to the parliament building via the banks of River Thames.

Today’s major protest comes as numbers of fiercely pro- and anti-Brexit demonstrators have kept up a constant presence in Westminster in recent months.
Hardline Brexiteers want Britain to leave the bloc now without any divorce deal in place, falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
At the other end of the political spectrum, London Mayor Sadiq Khan launched a campaign bus today emblazoned with the slogan “We are all Londoners”.

Speaking ahead of today’s vote in the House of Commons, one protestor said: “Whatever happens today with Brexit, things will never be the same in the UK.”
Another added: “I’m not going to have my country taken over by a dictatorship.”
Britain was originally due to leave the EU at 11pm tonight.
As the clock ticks down to that time, a number of bars and nightclubs in the remain-dominated London will kick off a host of Brexit-themed parties to celebrate the non-departure.

Third vote
This afternoon, Theresa May failed for a third time to get her withdrawal deal through the Parliament.
MPs voted against her deal by 344 votes to 286 votes – a majority of 58.
Now, there are very few options left to May going forward.
She must now go back to Brussels and seek a longer extension to Article 50, delaying Brexit for a much greater time period. Or the UK will now crash out of the EU on 12 April.
“Mr Speaker, I fear we are reaching the limits of the process in this house,” May told the House of Commons after the vote.
“This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.
In light of the result, EU President Donald Tusk has decided to call a European Council meeting on 10 April.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that in the “uncertain” time of Brexit, support from the United States is needed “more so than ever”.
All eyes were on Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett, as they attended the Irish Funds dinner in Washington DC last night.
With Brexit tensions at their height, some of the key players were all in the same room – Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and the DUP leader Arlene Foster, both seated on separate tables, but noteworthy that Foster switched seats later in the evening to sit next to the Taoiseach.
Yesterday the House of Commons voted against a no-deal Brexit with 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time.
After a chaotic evening in Westminster, 278 voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
Tomorrow, a vote on extending Article 50 and pushing Brexit out a few months will take place.

Speaking to the crowd of Irish-Americans last night, Varadkar said Brexit is sixteen days away, “we need our friends here in the US more so than ever”.
Earlier in the day, he said the appointment by the US of  a Northern Ireland special envoy would be welcomed, stating that it has proved beneficial in the past.
At the dinner, he said that while some had made the decision to leave the EU, Ireland was steadfast in its belief that it can be the centre of Europe, stating that the Irish government is determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement and “everything the flows from it”.
Applause
There was a round of applause from the audience, when he said Ireland will remain a committed member of the EU and guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.
The second applause came when Varadkar mentioned planned legislation which will require companies to disclose gender pay gaps.

The theme of the dinner this year was honouring visionary women.
Earlier in the day, Varadkar warned that the possibility of UK crashing out of EU is “growing”.
Supports
Speaking ahead of his meeting with US Donald Trump today, Varadkar had one message for the Irish public and Irish businesses – “the Irish government has your back”.
Varadkar said he understands that a lot of people in “Ireland must be very worried and must be very concerned today, but what I want to say to our exporters and our business people today, our farmers, out fishermen, the government has your back and we have put in place a package of measures to support incomes, to support and assist business, to restructure and reorientate to new markets”.
The package of support measures will go before Cabinet next week, he stated.
“We are well placed to deal with any shock that might arise from no deal. The fact we have a budget surplus means we can borrow if we need to support our economy, the NTMA has cash on hand should there be any disturbance in the markets, the banks are well capitalised,” said Varadkar.
There will be damage limitation, he added, stating that the government “will protect incomes, we will protect jobs and we will support businesses to overcome whatever happens in the next couple of weeks”.
US-EU trade deal
Speaking about trade with the US, the Taoiseach said he would like to see renewed engagement around a US-EU trade deal, before the US strikes one with the UK.
He said this could prove difficult due to the sensitivities surrounding agriculture, but he said it would be beneficial for both sides to talk.
To the broader public, the Taoiseach gave reassurances yesterday that “the Common Travel Area and all that comes with it, free movement between Britain and Ireland, north south will continue, that has already been agreed, and also the country is well prepared for a no-deal”.
Unlike other countries, Ireland has a budget surplus, he explained, stating that the country can borrow “if we have to”.
Addressing a room full of American and Irish business people today, Varadkar said the US investment to Ireland “really transformed” the country, adding that it would not be as prosperous as it is today without that investment.
He urged businesses to continue to invest in Ireland, and in the light of Brexit, added that it is Ireland’s position that it will always be at the “heart of Europe”. Varadkar told the businesspeople today that maintaining peace on the island of Ireland is the key priority.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump during their joint press conference this afternoonStefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has called opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn “somewhat of a negative force” and said he turned down a meeting with him.
Trump made his comments during a press conference this afternoon in London with British Prime Minister Theresa May.
During the conference, Trump said Corbyn asked to meet with him today or tomorrow but he declined the offer, calling him “somewhat of a negative force”.
“He wanted to meet today or tomorrow and I decided that I would not do that,” Trump said.
“I really don’t like critics,” he added.

Yesterday, Trump called London Mayor Sadiq Khan a “stone cold loser”. Responding to questions about his comments this afternoon, the US president said Khan has been a poor mayor and that he is “a negative force, he’s not a positive force”.
“He hurts the people of this country,” he said.
The president’s three-day visit – centred around Wednesday’s D-Day 75th-anniversary commemorations – comes at a tricky time for Britain, with May stepping down within weeks over her handling of Brexit.
The UK-US “special relationship” has been under strain over different approaches to Iran, the use of Chinese technology in 5G networks, climate change, and Trump’s personal politics.
May is due to step down as leader of the governing Conservative Party on Friday, some 13 candidates so far are jostling to replace her by late July.
Speaking of a post-Brexit trade deal,  Trump said “when you’re dealing with trade, everything is on the table”.
“I think we’re going to have a great trade deal, yes,” Trump said.

The press conference came as anti-Trump protests were held outside parliament. The “Baby Trump” balloon has been inflated again for today’s protests.
“Trump baby is just a mascot for a massive movement against Trump’s hateful and divisive politics,” organiser Leo Murray told AFP.
Corbyn spoke at the rally after skipping a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace yesterday in protest at Trump’s policies.
He said the protest was “an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he’s attacked in America, around the world and in our own country”.
Addressing the protests during the press conference this afternoon, Trump said there were “thousands of people” on the streets of London yesterday cheering.
He said he saw some protesters today, but only a very small group, adding that reports of protests have been “fake news”.

Morning talks
During their talks this morning, Trump joked with May that she should “stick around” and reach a much stronger economic alliance with the United States once her country finally leaves the European Union.
“I think we will have a very, very substantial trade deal. It will be a very fair deal,” he told her at a meeting with business leaders and ministers, adding: “We’re going to get it done.”
Despite having repeatedly criticised May’s Brexit strategy, Trump said she had done “a fantastic job”.
Trump’s day will be finished off with a dinner at the US ambassador’s Winfield House residence. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla will attend on behalf of Queen Elizabeth.
At yesterday’s state banquet, Trump hailed the sovereign as a “great, great woman” as the Trump dynasty joined the royal family in the Buckingham Palace ballroom.
Tomorrow, May and Trump will conclude the trip by joining other world leaders in  Portsmouth to commemorate 75 years since the D-Day landings.
He will then depart the UK, shifting his base to Doonbeg in Co Clare for the next few days, and is due to meet the Taoiseach tomorrow at Shannon Airport.

Michael Creed, Minister for Agriculture, reacts to suggestions from the European Commission that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a hard border in Irelandpic.twitter.com/6cJgIPRuAA
MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE Michael Creed repeatedly refused to directly answer the question over whether there would be a return to border checks on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In a tense interview with Audrey Carville onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, the minister was told that “many people listening this morning might think you’re treating us as if we are stupid”, over his and the government’s insistence that there would be no border.
For the first time yesterday, the EU indicated that it was “pretty obvious” there would be some kind of border andchecks if the UK crashes out of Europe without a deal.
However, the government has repeatedly said that it has an agreement that will avoid a hard border – but that deal put forward by Theresa May was roundly rejected by MPs in the House of Commons last week, leaving it uncertain how Britain will proceed from here.
The deal that the Irish government says exists to avoid a hard border is a deal that the British parliament has roundly rejected.
Question and answer
Niall Carson / PA ImagesNiall Carson / PA Images / PA Images
“The first thing which I want to say is we’re in a period of heightened political anxiety over Brexit,” Creed said this morning.
Carvillethen asked: “Could you explain how a hard border could be avoided in the event of a no deal?”
Creedanswered: “What is abundantly clear even from as late as on Monday when Tánaiste Simon Coveney was in Brussels with Michel Barnier is that there is no diminution  – not a single iota – of the commitment from Brussels to the withdrawal agreement in its full content presently.
Carville: “But we’re talking about a no deal, minister, with respect if you could answer the question of how would we avoid a hard border?”
Later on in the interview, Carville pressed Creed again on the question of a hard border in the event of a no deal.

Carville: “I must repeat, minister, we are talking this morning about a no deal Brexit and what will happen on this island on 30 March or 1 April, when a tanker load of milk leaves LacPatrick dairies in Tyrone bound for Donegal, who will check that milk?
Carville: “But who will check the milk? This is the practicalities of a no deal Brexit…”
Carville: “Are you going to tell us who and where that tanker load of milk and countless other food products be checked?”
Carville: “But where will the border be? Where will the products be checked in the event of a no deal?”
Carville: “No it isn’t… it doesn’t deal with a no deal Brexit.”
Carville: “In the event of a no deal, who will check the tanker load of that milk as it prepares to cross the border on a daily basis?”
Carville: “Many people listening this morning might think you are treating us all as if we’re stupid.”
Minister Creed was asked again during the interview about a hard border in a no deal, but he repeated again and again there would be no hard border or checks because a withdrawal agreement was in place.
He concluded that the next move must come from Westminster.
Border solution
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald also spoke to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
She told the programme: “The backstop mitigates the effect of Brexit in the event of a crash and no agreement, we are faced with the prospect of a hard border. It is the truth.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with party leaders last night, and it was suggested he said that the single market border could be in France or the Netherlands, rather than Ireland.
McDonald said it wasn’t a runner, and she said it wasn’t forwarded as a proposition by Varadkar.
“I said the task for him and his government is to hold their nerve,” she said, suggesting that the Irish government should “play for time” if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-poll-result-february-2019-4500824-Feb2019/,"THE MAJORITY OF Irish people would like to see a united Ireland in their lifetime, a new poll has shown.
Last night’s poll for Claire Byrne Live on RTÉ 1, which was carried out by Amárach Research, revealed that 63% of people want to see a united Ireland before they die.
Just 18% of people said they would not like to see Irish unity happen, while 19% said they didn’t know.
There has been increasing speculation that the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 29 March could lead to the unification of the Republic and Northern Ireland.
However, most people who responded to the poll did not think that Brexit would cause a united Ireland.

48% of people felt that Brexit would not unite the 32 counties, with only 31% of respondents saying a united Ireland would happen because of Britain’s departure from the EU.
Meanwhile, the public was split down the middle when asked if there would be a hard border in the island of Ireland after Brexit.
If the United Kingdom crashes out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, it will revert to World Trade Organisation rules on trade.
That means customs checks will have to take place on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, creating a hard border between the two countries.
Responding to the poll, 37% people felt there would be a hard border, while 37% also felt there would not be, with 26% of people saying they didn’t know.
The poll questions were carried out by Amarách Research for Claire Byrne Live yesterday, 18 February, and were put to a panel of over 1,000 Irish adults.

Good afternoon!Sinéad O’Carrollhere to bring you through some of the afternoon.
Our Brexit reporterGráinne Ní Aodhais in London to bring us all the latest from Westminster so we’ll be bringing you live updates as we move closer to the key 8pm vote.
The D-Day label makes it seem like – either way – we’ll be more clear tomorrow on what is happening but of course, this is Brexit, so that’s not the case.
Gráinne has taken a look at the various possible scenarios with the experts so that’s probably a good place to start ….read it here.
Gráinne has described London as a ‘carnival’ today and it would be hard to refute that.

So here’s a rundown of what’s going to happen later.
The main vote on the deal will be held at8pm.
Before that, MPs will vote on these four amendments to the deal:
Amendment a – Official Labour Opposition:
This would reject the deal on the basis of Labour’s six tests. But it also rejects the prospect of a ‘no deal’. It commits the House to pursuing every option that prevents the UK from crashing out.
So basically, it says the House can’t allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal, but it also can’t allow it to leave under this deal.
It doesn’t give an alternative, other than to pursue other alternatives.
Right. Moving onto the next one.
Amendment k: Scottish National Party
This would essentially refuse the deal on the table, stating it would be damaging for Scotland and Wales, as well as the rest of the UK. It asks for the government to request an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period (which ends on 29 March, in case you haven’t been listening).
The next one is from a Conservative Party MP…
Amendment b: Sir Edward Leigh
He wants to make sure the Northern Ireland backstop is not – and never will be – a permanent arrangement. This amendment, if passed, would see the government terminate the Withdrawal Agreement if the EU “will not agree to remove the NOrthern Ireland backstop”.
Similar theme for the next one…  unsurprisingly from another Conservative MP.
Amendment f: John Baron
It would give consent to the deal provided the Withdrawal Agreement is amended so that the UK can terminate the Northern Ireland protocol unilaterally.

The folk in Leinster House had their back-to-school limelight stolen a little today but Leo Varadkar did take his first Leaders’ Questions of the term.
Here’s our political reporter Christina Finn’s report:
“The Taoiseach reiterated the point he made yesterday that he believes a no-deal Brexit is still unlikely.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin said tonight’s vote in Westminster is the “latest instalment in a lengthening saga in which no coherent, concrete view on Brexit commanding a majority of British parliamentarians is emerging”.
The withdrawal treaty looks set to be defeated – although we do not know that for certain – plunging all of us into greater uncertainty and speculation in the days ahead. We cannot influence tonight’s vote, if we are honest, but we can influence how prepared we are for any eventuality that may emerge including, of course, a no-deal Brexit, by the end of March.
“It is my view that the government has treated the Dáil and the public shabbily and badly when it comes to sharing its plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The government should treat the Oireachtas and the public with greater respect in this regard.Under pressure, the government published a contingency plan on 19 December, the day on which the Dáil went into recess prior to Christmas,” he said.
He criticised the contingency plan document published before Christmas stating that it is “light, lacking in detail and needs considerable fleshing out”.
“The contingency plan published in late December deals rather sketchily with a number of important areas such as medicine supplies, aviation, the land bridge, ports and airports, staffing, Revenue and agriculture,” he said.
Varadkar said preparations at ports are already underway. He said further contingency plans in relation to medicines, transport and the common travel area were discussed by Cabinet today and opposition leaders will be briefed ahead of the media today.
He said stockpiling of medicines has not been recommended by the working group, but added that 24 medicines are on a watch list.
Afternoon,Daragh Brophytaking over liveblog duties here for the afternoon… A ‘meaningful’ Tuesday to you all.
European Commission President Juncker is travelling back to Brussels at the moment to deal with emergency Brexit-related business, according to Brussels-based journalists.
Theresa May might be paying a visit there as early as tomorrow.
Labour MP John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was on BBC radio earlier outlining how the main opposition party might proceed after tonight’s vote.
He said:
“We will consider all options that come in front of us but our priority is a permanent customs union, that close collaborative relationship with the single market. If you don’t get that you won’t get the frictionless trade that the government promised and hasn’t delivered.”
Protection of employment and consumer rights was also a priority for Labour, he said.
McDonnell said that if politicians run into an impasse as the process continues “we do have to consider the option of a people’s vote”.

MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT in the British House of Commons have overwhelmingly backed a proposal that could allow Brexit to be delayed.
The motion, put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, was passed by 502 votes to 20.
Essentially, MPs were voting on plans Prime Minister Theresa May proposed yesterday in relation to a series of Brexit-related votes being held next month.
They have now formally backed the holding of a series of meaningful votes in the coming weeks to decidewhat form Brexit will take, including a potential vote on whether to seek to extend Article 50 and delay leaving the EU.
Twenty Conservative Party MPs voted against the proposal.

In an earlier vote Labour’s Brexit proposals – which called for a new customs union with the EU and close alignment with the bloc’s single market - were defeated by 323 votes to 240.
Afterwards, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would back a second referendum on Brexit “in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no-deal outcome”.
May faces an uphill battle to get a Brexit deal over the line. The draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the EU was rejected by the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 last month.
She is seeking reassurances on certain elements of the deal, in particular the backstop related to Northern Ireland. European leaders have repeatedly said the deal cannot be renegotiated.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.

Seeking a delay
If May fails to get the House of Commons to back a deal, MPs are expected to vote on 13 and 14 March on whether to leave the EU with no deal, or to seek a delay.
“The government’s policy is to get the legally binding changes so a deal can be brought back to this house … and we can leave on March 29 with a deal,” May said ahead of the vote.
Any delay must be approved by the other 27 EU member states. Some of the bloc’s leaders have questioned whether a short delay would achieve much.
“We don’t need more time: what we need most of all is a decision,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris.
“If Britain needs more time, then clearly we shall not refuse,” added Merkel, without mentioning conditions.
In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: “Although Spain will not oppose granting a possible extension, this must have an assured perspective of resolution.”
EU citizens’ rights
May has repeatedly ruled out delaying Brexit, even after her deal was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January.
Her u-turn yesterday prompted outrage among Tory hardliners, with Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg warning that “any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit”.
However, May’s change of plan averted a rebellion by pro-Europeans who fear economic chaos if Britain ends its 46-year-old relationship with the EU without a deal.
In a rare moment of unity, MPs approved without a vote an amendment seeking to protect the rights of 3.6 million Europeans living in Britain, and more than one million Britons living in EU countries.
It calls on the government to make efforts to preserve the rights of those expats set out in the divorce agreement, even in a no-deal scenario.
Conservative MP Alberto Costa said his amendment “does not deal in goods or services, backstops or borders, but people, living and breathing, skin and bone”.
Costa was forced to quit as a junior minister because he was not technically allowed to put forward the amendment.
MPs also rejected a Scottish National Party motion which stated that the UK should not leave the EU without a deal “under any circumstances” – by 324 votes to 288.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-dissidents-ira-weapons-4479771-Feb2019/,"GARDAÍ POLICING THE border region suspect that dissident republicans have “dozens” of makeshift weapons caches dotted along the border.
The news comes after a significant quantity of munitions were found in Omeath, on the Cooley Peninsula,earlier this month.
In that find, a substantial quantity of ammunition was discovered along witha mortar tube.
Gardaí received intelligence in the weeks before the search that significant munitions had been placed along the peninsula.
The operation was led by members of the Garda Special Detective and Emergency Response Units. No arrests have been made at this time.
That find is linked to the so-called New IRA – a splinter group which gardaí and the PSNI believe is in the process of unearthing weapons stored in remote areas along the border.
As we move closer to the possibility of a no deal Brexit, gardaí believe certain elements of the dissident community are unearthing caches of weapons which have been buried in a number of locations across the region for a number of years.
Dozens of areas are suspected of being utilised in this way but police on both sides of the border need concrete evidence before a dig for munitions is launched.
Gardaí are also in the process of drawing up a list of suspected dissidents who could become active in the wake of a hard border. The suspects’ names, addresses, places they frequent and their associates are being compiled in the event of further dissident related incidents. Gardaí are also continuing surveillance operations on more than 100 people they believe are involved in directing dissident activity across Ireland.
There are a number of people who have admitted they are worried that any sign of a hard border will see a return of violence to the region.
Former Chief Constable of the PSNI, Hugh Orde, warned about the risks of a border leading to a resumption violence in the area.

Brexit risk
Orde said recreating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic would have “huge consequences in terms of security” and police and customs officers “would become a target”.
“There is no way that I can see to have a soft border unless you have equality in terms of customs and freedom of movement,” he said.
Orde added that it would not be possible to put cameras or technology on the border without police, or some other form of security to protect them.
James Morrisroe, who represents gardaí in the Cavan/Monaghan division for the Garda Representative Association, compared the possibility of a hard border post-Brexit to the foot and mouth and BSE crises.
“At the time of the foot and mouth crisis, they would have had a large number of gardaí on temporary transfer from all over the country to cover all the border crossings, of which there are a lot, on minor roads and major roads in the Cavan/Monaghan division,” he said.
He said with the number of gardaí in the country at the moment, the temporary transfer model would not work long-term and would be costly for the State.
“You would have to increase the number of gardaí in Cavan/Monaghan – I’d say you’d have to double them at least on a permanent basis, so that has its own implications.”
British soldiers on the streets
Increasing numbers of specialist troops have been deployed to the North in recent years in response to a resurgent dissident threat under a new strategy known as Operation Helvetic.
Tom Clonan, a security analyst,explained toTheJournal.ielast weekthat these troops include highly trained explosive ordnance disposal officers and the Special Reconnaissance Squadron of the SAS, which acts in support of MI5 and the PSNI in countering the threat posed by dissident republicans, in particular the New IRA.
Said Clonan: “All of the political discussion has been about law-abiding people, people exporting and importing. But Brexit would create a huge opportunity for non-law abiding people, for criminal elements. Because if we become a European Union frontier then there will be opportunities there for the movement of illegal goods, contraband goods, illegal substances, drugs, people… It will open up all sorts of stuff and the organised criminal elements on this island are very organised and they are very well armed.
“Groups like that have very, very close links to both dissident armed loyalists and republicans – those links are already there and they’re well documented. So the criminal element will use nationalist and loyalist rhetoric to ramp up the tension.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that legally binding changes need to be made to the backstop, and listed the three different options she suggested to the EU.
In a statement to theHouse of Commons today, May said that the EU have been told that alternative arrangements could be given to the current backstop, which proposes certain regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland in order to avoid a hard border.
The other two options the EU were told was a legally binding time limit, or legally binding unilateral exit, both of which have been opposed by the EU and Ireland.
In response to a question from MP Chris Leslie, May denied that putting a time limit on the backstop would be like putting a time limit on the Good Friday Agreement.
She said that “when we achieve the progress we need” on the backstop, that the UK government “will bring forward another meaningful vote” in the House of Commons.
She said that if there is no progress on this by 26 February, then a vote will be held on 27 February.
May also said that she and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker would meet again before the end of February, and that the British Attorney General had been in Dublin to meet with his Irish counterpart.
The UK parliament rejected the deal negotiated between the EU and UK negotiating teams over two years, with most Tory MPs voicing their opposition to the Irish backstop.
It was rejected by a historic majority of 432 votes against to 202 votes in favour.

In a separate vote, the House of Commons voted in favour of an amendment that would replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements”, but that didn’t specify what those arrangements would be.
Cheers and jeers
During the Prime Minister’s statement today on Leaving the EU, three moments in particular raised the loudest jeers and protestations from the House.
The first was when May said that the UK had a “proud tradition in leading the way in workers’ rights…”, and the second was when she said that “businesses were in favour” of her Brexit deal.
The third was when may claimed that she “wanted to have this sorted before Christmas”, leaving MPs furious and reminding her that she postponed the vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, which was to be held on the 11 December, until 15 January – three weeks after Christmas.
In response to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestions of a Brexit deal that would include a customs union, May said:
“The House of Commons has already voted against this… and in any case, membership of the Customs Union is a worse deal than that which is provided for in the political declaration.”
She said that these provisions would allow the UK “to strike trade deals around the world”.

“I don’t wake up in the morning any more… I wake up in the middle of the night.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-what-happens-next-4-4447967-Jan2019/,"AFTER A WEEK of turmoil in Westminster, which included a historic defeat for any British government, a number of last-minute letters and more resignations, where are we now with Brexit?
In short: not even Theresa May knows.
The British Prime Minister spoke to EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk by telephone this lunchtime to discuss where to go next on Brexit.
May had previously been in touch with Brussels only by text message since Tuesday, the day that the British parliament rejected the Brexit deal she signed in November, that lays out the conditions for leaving the European Union.
The deal was defeated by a historic 432 votes to 202: in the last record for a UK government defeat was in 1924, when the Labour government lost by 166 votes.
“Discussed with PM Theresa May the next steps on the UK side,” tweeted Tusk, who represents EU leaders as president of the European Council.
Discussed with PM@theresa_maythe next steps on the UK side.#Brexit— António Costa (@eucopresident)January 18, 2019Donald Tusk/ Twitter
Discussed with PM@theresa_maythe next steps on the UK side.#Brexit
May also spoke separately with the head of the EU executive, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, at her request.

“It was an exchange of information on both sides. The two agreed to stay in touch,” a spokeswoman for Juncker said.
May also held a telephone conversation with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald today. Minutes after Tusk’s tweet, the Dublin TD tweeted out:
“Spoke with Theresa May. Reminded her of the obligation of British State to honour and implement the Good Friday Agreement: that the backstop is the bottom line, that people of the North do not consent to Brexit.
Theresa May must return to the House of Commons on Monday and present her plans to MPs on what to do next.
Among her options are: further negotiations with the EU, which Tusk and Barnier have said previously cannot happen; requesting an extension to Article 50; call a second referendum, where it isn’t certain that the outcome would be different, or push for a no-deal Brexit, which would most likely lead to a border on the island of Ireland.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday announced that he wouldn’t engage with Theresa May’s government until she ruled out a no-deal Brexit entirely. This is almost impossible to do: to avoid a no-deal Brexit, May needs to get the majority of the House of Commons to vote for a deal, which is proving tricky if not impossible.
The House of Commons will then debate and vote on those plans on the 29 January.
Legally, the UK must leave the EU by 29 March, two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May.

There’s a lot of creativity in the crowd of Brexit-enthusiasts, whatever side they’re on: there’s a WTO-umbrella, a Brexit grim reaper, and what can only be accurately described as a pro-Brexit girl band.
A little girl walks by the sticker-man, and he offers her one. She looks reluctant, but reaches out to take it and crunches it in her hand, smiling. Another girl, a man and a woman follow her, all dressed in high-vis vests.
“Bollocks to the EU,” the woman shouts.
A giant drum propped up on a ‘Leave’ campaign stall is beaten incessantly, marking the separation point between the Brexit supporters, and those calling for a People’s Vote.

A little bit further on the same path, a man plays an Ode to Joy on the harmonica, while a woman sings pro-EU lyrics to that tune, using words she’s Googled.
A man rushes towards the sticker-man and says that his luminous stickers were removed.
“A group of about three of them surrounded me and took them off,” he says, muttering afterwards that it wasn’t worth challenging the Brexiteers.
Behind them, an elderly woman holds up a sign to the traffic, and then exclaims to the man on her left, ”Oh you voted leave? I thought you were one of them!”
Joshua, a young staff member in the Houses of Parliament says that he’s not worried about the divide the Brexit vote has caused, saying that this debate has been going on for 40 years – it’s just more visible now.
A Leave supporter says that a couple of hundred years ago, there would have been a civil war in the country over Brexit: “We would’ve been here with our swords and pikes, killing each other.”
Ahistoric loss
Isabel InfantesIsabel Infantes
As MPs flowed back into the chamber after casting their vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, an audience of 100 people had gathered around the television in the main hall of Westminster to watch the result.
When the historic result was announced, some let out a short gasp or an intake of breath, others muttered to the person beside them. No one had predicted that she would win the vote, but the scale of the defeat was still shocking: a record-making 230-vote defeat, on the extreme upper end of the scale of predictions.
The last record-holder for this title was a Labour government in 1924, who lost by 166 votes – an outcome May would have been reasonably happy with.
The clustered visitors to Westminster stared at the screen as Theresa May tells the Parliament that we now know what MPs don’t want, asking the House: what do they want instead?

Johnson said it was time to go back to Brussels and renegotiate, despite the EU’s assertions that this isn’t possible. Meanwhile, the Irish government has advanced itsplans for a no-deal Brexiteven further, saying it is now a possible outcome.
In the debate that lead up to the crucial vote, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told the House that thousands of legal systems would be “plunged into uncertainty” if there was a no-deal Brexit, and if you were a litigant in a court and found yourself “with the rug pulled from underneath you, you would say to this House”:
“We are playing with people’s lives,” he concluded.

So what’s next?
Most Brexiteers protesting outside Westminster have faith in a no-deal exit; with many holding signs saying “No deal? No problem!”
When asked about the Port of Dover test, where 89 lorries took part in a no-deal Brexit dry-run, they cite it as a feature of Project Fear – a suspicion that the downsides of Brexit are being exaggerated in order to prevent it from happening.
Although some protesters admit there might be problems immediately after, they say this is the best way forward, given the restricted legal timeframe that means the UK must leave by 29 March.
“We can default to WTO rules – lots of countries use WTO rules – what’s the problem,” says one member of Ukip.
It’s pointed out to him that if they took this option, the UK would have toapplyto adopt WTO rules, which could take years.
“Do we? I don’t know,” he responds.

Another Leave voter called Paul, says that if there’s a second vote it wouldn’t resolve anything.
Another demonstrator says of the option of parliamentrevokingArticle 50, which would mean reversing Brexit without taking it to a second vote:
“If they’d voted to Remain, and MPs decided that they were going to take us out of the EU anyway, there’d be uproar. We’re leaving and that’s the end of it.”
Harry, who is a Conservative supporter, says that the ”duplicitous” politicians will force the current deal, perhaps with some changes, through the House of Commons somehow.
He says that he expects the Conservative party to split over Brexit.
This tallys with the actions of the party last night: of Theresa May’s 315 Tory MPs,118 of her party colleaguesvoted against her deal. That’s over a third of her parliamentary party and represents a record show of indiscipline.
After the vote, visitors, journalists, parliament staffers and MPs spilled onto Westminster square, where a small number of demonstrators still stood, gathered around the gated exit. As a car leaves, they don’t cheer or jeer, but talk amongst themselves or look silently on.
As Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s motion of no confidence in Theresa May is due to be debated from early on today until 7pm, it’s expected that many of the protesters will return to the same spot, across from the Houses of Parliament.
With some of the staunchest critics of her Brexit deal publicly declaring they’ll back her on this deal, May is expected to survive her second confidence vote in the space of 30 days – but how many more bruising Brexit defeats can the embattled leader handle?
And, if she does leave, who will take over, and will they be able to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons? It’s doubtful whether Theresa May herself knows.

AFTER A HISTORIC defeat for her Brexit deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May is putting her Withdrawal Agreement back before the House of Commons this Tuesday.
A record-breaking 230 MPs voted against the government last week, and May was given just three days to come up with her Plan B. On Monday this week, she announced that her Plan B was to hold another vote on slight amendments to Plan A (a very Brexit means Brexit move).
The strictest opposition from the House of Commons seems to be due to the backstop.
Many pro-Brexit and some pro-Remain MPs have expressed concern about whether the backstop would threaten Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom; others have said that the backstop needs to be time-limited, which EU leaders have said would make the backstop entirely pointless.
With time running out before the 29 March, which is when the UK must legally leave the European Union, the UK government, the EU and Ireland are scrambling for solutions.
Tensions are high, as the Irish government is pressured to detail its plans for a border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the leaders of the 27 EU member states are pushed for their opinion on whether the backstop needs to be altered.
Among the solutions being offered from the UK side, are amendments to the deal. It’s thought that if the House of Commons passes an amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement, that this would put pressure on the EU to agree to those terms to facilitate an orderly EU-UK divorce.
So what are the Grieve and Cooper amendments?
PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
Former Conservative government lawyerDominic Grievehas introduced a cross-party amendment that would force the government to allow six days throughout February and March for MPs to debate and vote on Brexit options.
The latest of the dates would be 26 March, just three days before Britain leaves the EU.
Labour MPYvette Cooperhas proposed an amendment to force the government to make time in the Commons to debate her own bill preventing a no-deal Brexit.
Under this legislation, if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February, the government must delay Britain’s departure from the bloc until 31 December 2019.
This has the support of some former ministers in May’s Conservative party. The only thing that can force an unwilling government to act is legislation – which is why Cooper has introduced her own bill. However, she might struggle to get this through parliament in time.

Other amendments
An amendment introduced by opposition Labour leaderJeremy Corbyndemands parliamentary time to debate and vote on options to avoid a “no deal” Brexit.
These include negotiating a new UK-EU customs union and a “strong relationship” with the EU’s single market, and holding a second referendum.
Senior Labour MPHilary Bennhas proposed an amendment demanding the government hold a series of votes designed to test what the Commons wants.
These would include votes on leaving the EU with no deal, holding a second referendum or renegotiating with Brussels.
‘Hijacking’ Brexit
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused MPs of trying to “hijack Brexit” and defy the 2016 vote to leave the European Union.
But Corbyn said the government has no new ideas and “MPs must now act to break the deadlock”.
Benn added: “MPs doing their job are not plotters, they are trying to sort out the mess the prime minister has created.”
Not all amendments will be put to a vote – the selection will be made on the morning of 29 January by Commons Speaker John Bercow.
Bercow has been criticised previously afterhe was accusedof working against the government after he allowed MPs to submit amendments to motions that have previously been considered unamendable.
What’s likely to pass?
Any that are chosen would need support from all sides – both Grieve’s and Cooper’s amendments are seen as the most likely to win support. It is unlikely that Corbyn’s plan would command the support of any Conservative MPs.
Technically, any amendments agreed would not be legally binding, but it would be politically hard for the prime minister to ignore them.
“It’s an opportunity for the House of Commons to express its political will,” Theresa May’s spokesman said.
This would be particularly true if a significant number of Conservative MPs backed any amendment.
The government is under pressure to allow a free vote by its MPs, with reports that failure to do so could result in a slew of ministerial resignations.
This week, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd, who’s also the former Home Secretary, warned May that there could be a slew of resignations if MPs weren’t given a free vote. Rudd also dodged questions over her own resignation if May’s Brexit deal fails to pass through the House for a second time.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-tusk-david-cameron-referendum-4451509-Jan2019/,"EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk is said to have told David Cameron that promising an EU referendum was a bad idea, saying that it was “stupid” and telling him to “get real”.
Cameron, who was a Tory Prime Minister in government with the Liberal Democrats since 2010, had been trying to negotiate with the EU for a better deal for the UK ahead of the referendum on EU membership.
There had been increased talk of an EU referendum as politicians like Nigel Farage drew attention to it, and his party, Ukip, began gaining traction at grassroot-level.
In a new BBC documentary Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, Tusk says he probed Cameron on why he was holding an EU referendum.
“I told him bluntly, ‘Come on David, get real’,” Tusk says.
“And for the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realized what a challenge he was facing.”

Tusk claims that Cameron denied that he thought the referendum would be called.
“I asked David Cameron, ‘Why did you decide on this referendum, this – it’s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know,’ and, he told me – and I was really amazed and even shocked – that the only reason was his own party.”
Tusk says that Cameron “felt really safe”.
But in the May 2015 election, Cameron’s Conservatives won an unexpected outright majority, based on their manifesto which included a referendum on EU membership.
Tusk says that “paradoxically, David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory”.
Craig Oliver, Cameron’s former head of communications, responded to say that the coalition as “an excuse to bail is a myth”.
Cameron resigned from office following the referendum result; he was succeeded by Theresa May following a leadership battle. He’s currently writing his memoirs on his time in office.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-english-out-sign-4547437-Mar2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has criticised Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald for posing beside an anti-English banner at the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York.
Sinn Féin yesterday shared images of McDonald standing beside a number of banners at the parade, including one which read: ‘England Get Out Of Ireland’.
The banner, or a variation of it, has been theonly political bannerallowed in the parade for decades.
Coveney was not impressed, this morning tweeting that the gesture was “offensive, divisive and an embarrassment”.
“Grow up, this is NOT Ireland in 2019! We are better than this!,” he wrote.

The DUP also took offence to the image, saying it sums up Sinn Féin’s “attitude to explanations, truth and respect”.
Derry MP Gregory Campbell said: “When slogans such as “Brits out” or “England out of Ireland” are used the unionist community are well within their rights to see themselves as the intended focus.
“The ‘British presence in Ireland’ is the unionist population in Northern Ireland.”
In response, a spokesperson for Sinn Féin toldTheJournal.ie: “The most divisive and offensive act on this island for almost the last 100 years has been the partition of Ireland.
“However if Simon Coveney and the government is serious about achieving a new and agreed united Ireland then he should immediately convene an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity.”
The party has recently stepped up calls for a border poll as Brexit negotiations continue, noting the negative impacts Britain leaving the European Union could have in Northern Ireland.
Opinion polls have shown that the majority of people in the Republicwant a border pollin the event of a no-deal Brexit, and thatsix in 10 peoplewant to see a united Ireland in their lifetime.
However, others fear holding a poll in the near future would only intensify divisions in Northern Ireland, which has been without a devolved government since January 2017.

According to an opinion poll carried out by Amarách Research for RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live, 50% of people here have no sympathy for British people while 44% said they did have at least some sympathy and 6% said they didn’t know.
Today is the day when the House of Commons will finally get to vote on May’s Brexit deal, which was originally scheduled in December but delayed when it became clear the prime minister wouldn’t win the vote.
This time around, she looks unlikely to win this time either.

With the question of the Irish border backstop front and centre in the Brexit negotiations for some time and the ridiculous things that some British politicians have said about Ireland, it is clear this hasn’t translated to sympathy for their situation from many people here.
Chief among those drawing consternation was former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said last year that the UK government’s concerns about customs arrangements post-Brexit was“pure millenium bug”stuff. On Northern Ireland, he added:
With Theresa May on course to lose today’s vote, it will plunge the UK into fresh uncertainty.
There’s only 11 weeks left until it’s due to leave the EU at the end of March, but that may have to be delayed to avoid crashing out without a deal.
With Labour due to submit a motion of no confidence in May and her government immediately after the vote if it fails, it’s set to be another tumultuous week in Brexitland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-elections-uk-4557742-Mar2019/,"THE MAN WHO is tipped to be the next president of the European Commissioner, Manfred Weber, has said the UK needs to give Brexit clarity before the European elections.
The leader of the European People’s Party (EPP) downplayed the possibility of any long  Brexit extension, and questioned how the UK could be permitted in taking part in the European elections in May.
If the Brexit date gets pushed out, Britain would have to elect MEPs. This would cause a major headache to other EU countries, including Ireland, who have gained seats after the reallocation of the UK’s seats in Europe.
Ireland was allotted the additional two seats as part of the redistribution of seats due to UK’s vote to leave the European Union.
Irish European election candidates elected in the South constituency and the Dublin constituency will not be able to take up their seats in the European Parliament until the UK has left the EU.

Weber told reporters at the Fine Gael National Conference today that the UK “uncertainty” now has the potential to “infect European decision-making process”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the Irish government has legislated for either scenario if Brexit happens with a deal or without.
“I think that would have a disruptive impact and would may not be facilitated any way but even if it was, we do have a legal mechanism that would essentially meant that two of the 13, the last elected in Ireland South and the last elected in Dublin would essentially not take their seats until that vacancy arose when the UK leaves the EU and therefore withdraws from the European parliament.”
If a further extension is sought by the UK, they might not get it, said Coveney. If significant more time is sought “they would have to face EU elections”.
“There are a lot of voices who will not accept that Great Britain will participate in the elections, I myself I must tell you I cannot explain to people in Spain, Greece, in Finland or even here in Ireland that a country that is leaving the European Union formally has a big say in the future of the European Union, that is a big question on the table,” said Weber.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mps-take-back-control-house-of-commons-4463565-Jan2019/,"TODAY, MPS HAVE a chance to ‘Take Back Control’ of Brexit.
For the past two years, British Prime Minister Theresa May has been at the steering wheel of the Brexit machine, and whichever direction she takes it seems to make a significant portion of the House of Commons unhappy.
Today, members of the House will have their say on what kind of Brexit they want. Politicians have been criticised for slamming Theresa May’s deal without explaining in any detail what they want instead.
Two weeks ago, members of the House of Commons voted against Theresa May’s deal by a politically significant majority of 202 to 432 votes. The 230 votes against the government represents the largest defeat for any modern British government.
Three days later – last Monday – May returned to the House to announce her Plan B: that she would work on the concerns that had been raised about the Irish backstop, and that a day of debates would take place on 29 January.
There would also be a chance for MPs to table amendments to Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which – if passed by the disjointed House of Commons – could put pressure on May’s government and the EU to alter the Withdrawal Agreement in accordance with the approved amendment, in order to secure a Brexit deal.
There are 19 amendments tabled, but not all of these will be voted on tomorrow. (The votes begin at 7pm.) The Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow will select the amendments that should be voted on.
Ahead of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement vote earlier this month, Bercow selected four amendments, but only one was put forward for a vote in the end. Tomorrow, Bercow is expected to select a similar number.

Among theamendmentsbeing tabled arethe Grieve amendment (g), introduced by former Conservative government lawyer Dominic Grieve. This would force the government to allow six days throughout February and March forMPs to debate and voteon Brexit options; the latest of the dates would be 26 March, just three days before Britain leaves the EU.

The Cooper amendment (b), proposed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would mean that if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February, the government must delay Britain’s departure from the blocby nine monthsuntil 31 December 2019.
Sir Graham Brady and Dr Andrew Murrison have tabled two amendments to do with the Irish backstop.
The Order Paper (pg 27)The Order Paper (pg 27)
Amendment (n), orthe Brady amendment, on the Irish backstop, suggests replacing the Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements” that would still avoid a hard border. The Guardian was told would give Theresa May“enormous firepower”in her negotiations with Brussels; reports late last night indicated that MPs were being whipped to vote for this amendment.
The Order Paper (pg 27)The Order Paper (pg 27)
The Murrison amendment(e), proposes limiting the backstop until 31 December 2021, which it has been argued would put pressure on the EU to agree to that in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
Amendment(a), introduced by oppositionLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn,demands parliamentary time to debate and vote on options to avoid a no-deal Brexit. These include negotiating a new UK-EU customs union and a “strong relationship” with the EU’s single market, and holding a second referendum.
Labour MP Hilary Bennhas proposed an amendment(f)demanding the government hold votes to test what the Commons wants. These would include votes on leaving the EU with no deal, holding a second referendum or renegotiating with Brussels.
The European Research Group will not support any of the above amendments, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said last night.
“I am in no mood to support” Sir Graham’s Brady’s amendment, he told Sky News after a meeting that the group held before one with Theresa May.
And what aboutTheresa May’s plan? Reports last night indicated that No 10 Downing St could have tabled their own amendment to the deal, but they’re reluctant to do so because it would mean the British premier would have to make a choice between backing a Leave or Remain style amendment, something May seems reluctant to do.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-withdrawal-agreement-4443096-Jan2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR said the Irish government “profoundly regrets” Westminster’s rejection of Brexit deal, adding that a no-deal scenario would have a “deeply negative” effect on jobs and the economy and peace in Northern Ireland.
Speaking to the media this morning, he said the deal on the table will ensure a hard border is avoided and will protect the rights of citizens in all parts of Ireland.
He said the withdrawal agreement provides a solution but added “that solution has been rejected by Westminster. The problem now lies there.”
“The ball is in Westminster’s court,” he said.
A disorderly Brexit at the end of March can be avoided, with the extension of Article 50 – but that can only be done when a request is made by the UK government.
Contingency plans being implemented
Work on Ireland’ contingency plans will continue, but Varadkar said “these are no longer contingency plans, they are being implemented by government”.
He said businesses and other organisations must now do the same.
Varadkar said the Irish government are not planning for checks along the land border – only at ports and airports.
He said a soft border isn’t just achieved by wishful thinking, stating that it can only be achieved through an agreement, on customs and regulatory alignment.
Varadkar rejected a time-limited backstop, stating:
“A guarantee with a time limit is not a guarantee.”

Checks along the border
The Taoiseach also faced questions about a private conversation between Transport Minister Shane Ross and Tánaiste Simon Coveney yesterday. At a media briefing there was tension during a media briefing when Ross was asked if food shipping driven into Ireland would require checks.
Ross answered: “I’d imagine there would be checks…”.
Coveney quickly interjected stating, “Well, no…”, and stated that the issue will be thrashed out with EU and UK if the agreement fails.
The Irish Independent reports today that a recording of their conversation between the two ministers after the press conference finds that Ross asked if he should not have said that, with Coveney stating that once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, the government could be blamed as the administration that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.
Varadkar said the Irish government can’t shift on the issue of there being no hard border. “That is the outcome we need. We’ve said it from day one,” he said.
During Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, Fianna Fáil Micheal Martin raised the conversation between Coveney and Ross stating that “it’s like the episode of Fawlty Towers, where people are told not to mention the war. It seems someone forgot to tell Minister Ross”.
He said it seems to be very much the case of “God, don’t mention the border” – but he questioned the secrecy and lack of clarity for the public.
“What the Tánaiste was referring to was checks on goods moving from the Britain to Ireland… that’s what the withdrawal agreement provides for,” said Varadkar.
The Taoiseach said “this problem started in Westminister with the Brexit referendum, we found a solution, they rejected that solution, now they need to come back with something they can get through parliament but it also has to be something the European Union and Ireland can accept”.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Ireland must hold its nerve in the weeks ahead.
“There is so much still to happen in Westminster in the next few days before it becomes clear what Britain is asking for.
“It’s hard for us as EU leaders to respond in a helpful way if we still don’t know what they are asking for,” he said.
Appearing before the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said a review of Ireland’s economic forecast will take place a lot sooner than it normally would in light of last night’s vote in Westminster.
He said the vote is “exceptionally disappointing and concerning”.
He admitted that the “central scenario” that he based Budget 2019 on, was that a Brexit deal would be agreed with the UK.
Explaining this reasoning, he said that at the time he was carrying out his “budgetary arithmetic that did look like the most likely scenario”.
Donohoe said his department are now doing a further assessment on the possible impact on Ireland’s economic forecast “given the scale of the defeat last night”.
He added that he did not believe the Budget’s expenditure plans would be impacted this year.
He said he has told his department to carry out the economic forecast “far earlier than we normally do” adding that he is looking for it to be done “as soon as possible”.
The new forecast will look at what a disorderly Brexit will be, but told Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath that it would be “heavily caveatted” the department is being tasked to form a view “on an event that has never happened before”.
Never in history has a country left a trading block in this manner, he explained, stating that any scenarios are based on “assumptions, upon assumptions, upon assumptions”.
He said it is “very difficult to be absolutely clear” as to what would happen with no regularity alignment.
Concerns surrounding Ireland’s over reliance on corporation tax in light of Brexit were also raised with the minister.
McGrath said corporation receipts account for €10.4 billion in 2018 – stating that it has close to doubled on the 2015 predictions. Given that a small number of large corporations are contributing to the fund, McGrath said a further report on predictions out to 2020 should be carried out.
Donohoe said he is aware of the concerns, adding that it was a contributing factor to why he decided to increase the hospitality VAT rate. He said including such measures as the VAT rise in the Budget will help reduce Ireland’s reliance on corporation tax in the future.

The mood at Dromintee GAA club is good-humoured as the group of eight locals  – teachers, a farmer, a business owner, a lawyer, the club caretaker, an artist and an accountant – settle at a row of tables beside a wood-burning stove.
But as cameras and recorders are produced, the atmosphere soon becomes serious. The locals recount their memories of how, at the height of The Troubles, this part of South Armagh became one of the most fortified and observed areas of Western Europe.
Dromintee, a small village close to Jonesborough and to the west of Newry and Dundalk,  is about 2km from the border at its closest point.
Like elsewhere along the 500km boundary, people here are fearful the impact a hard Brexit will have on business, on their livelihoods and most of all, on their daily routines.
“The mountain you can see from here – that would be in the North and they had a permanent checkpoint on the top of that mountain,” Peter Toale, a retired school principal and former chairman of the club says.
Caóilfíonn Murphy O’Hanlon, an artist, says it was “the most surreal place” to live when British Army militarisation was at its height.
Says Toale: “They were constantly monitoring what was going on.”
The retired teacher recounts how, towards the end of the Troubles, documents emerged showing the British Army had been keeping track of everyone calling to the gates of the rural GAA club.
The effect on daily life was stifling, he says. “If you were going to school in Newry you could be stopped three or four times. You could be sitting in a queue here for two miles.
One of Murphy O’Hanlon’s sons is over at training in Dundalk, she says. She’s been across the border already tonight and will be making another seamless transition between the jurisdictions later.
That wouldn’t have been possible when she was a teenager, towards the end of the conflict.
“I know when I first learned to drive and I’d be staying with my granny maybe and had to leave her house and go home late on at night – maybe going to school the next morning at 17 or 18.
“Driving, you’d see a red light in the middle of the road. You wouldn’t know who could be behind that red light or who was going to stop you – and it was that fear of ‘any identification there?’
“You’d go away and stand up the road, and you’re a girl on your own in your car with your licence taken off you. You’re told to switch off your engine, to switch off  your lights, and they could leave you sitting there for 15 minutes before they let you go. Or maybe not – ‘get out and open the boot!’
She adds: “You’d like to hope that wouldn’t happen now, in the dark, on your own at one o’clock in the morning. But to go back to that is terrifying.”
The reimposition of a border could be “the start of it”,  says Murphy O’Hanlon. “It’s the opening of the gates for it to return and that’s the most terrifying part.”

Border posts
The first real restrictions of movement around in the area were in response to the IRA’s border campaign of the 1950s. Routines got back to normal as that campaign fizzled out – but even harsher restrictions and increased fortification was introduced as violence in the North spiralled out of control in the early 1970s.
South Armagh became one of the major battlegrounds between the IRA and the British Army, and the demilitarisation of the area was one of the key demands of the Sinn Féin leadership in negotiations leading to the establishment of a stable Northern Assembly. Britain removed the last of its armoured towers at Crossmaglen police station in February of 2007.
In the intervening years the need for customs posts in the area ended, as the EU single market came into force in 1993.
Asked to assess whether there was now a real risk of a threat to the peace process, businessman Declan Fearon says people in the area are likely to be dismissed as “scaremongers … and South Armagh scaremongers at that”.
“The reality is that if you listen to people who are just going about their everyday lives here, I don’t think there’s anybody sitting here would say that it [a hard Brexit] won’t threaten it.
“This border was originally imposed in the late 40s and 50s as an economic border long before there were any Troubles here,” says Fearon, one of the local spokespeople from Border Communities Against Brexit, the group that organised the evening’s event.
“With the onset of the Troubles the first thing to be attacked was the customs posts. They were the manifestation of what people in this area didn’t want – they didn’t want that border.
“So from that the police came to protect the customs huts and the police were attacked, and the army came to attack them. And the helicopters came to protect the army, and you had the lookout posts, and we ended up with the most militarised area in western Europe for a period – you had an area where there was 23,000 people living and there were 3,000 British troops stationed here.
“So we well know what it could go back to and the dangers of that, and it only takes a small spark like the reintroduction of whatever border manifests itself.”
Violence may not emerge overnight, Fearon says, “but if the European Union has to put a border on the southern side to check stuff it will very quickly be followed by reciprocation on the Northern side by the British government because they don’t want free movement of people they see as not being allowed into Britain. And then off we go again, the erection of border and customs posts, and maybe they close the roads.”
Derry violence
Several speakers tell of their fears that the hard-won peace they now enjoy will be disrupted. Many say the recent car bomb in Derry heightened those concerns.
Says Justin Byrne, a barrister: “What we have now, when we say we have law and order, is a huge cooperation between the PSNI and the gardaí. They get together all the time. I work as a barrister, I do a lot of criminal law, and you’d see that.
“I think if there is a hard border that’s bound to change because we’re all within EU law, and now you’re going to have a difference.

Kevin Toale – Peter’s son and a head teacher at a school for people with special needs – says many of those involved in recent violence and unrest in Derry are too young to have known what life was like during The Troubles.
He’s concerned the youth of today “could certainly become much like the youth of yesterday. That’s ultimately an unstable situation and an unhealthy situation that no-one at all would want to go back to, regardless of background, no-one wants to go back to it.”
Asked to up sum of the mood of people in the area, several speakers say they agree that locals are angry. “There’s a fear of the unknown,” Toale says. His father nods in agreement, and says people are “worried and concerned”.
Asked what he thinks will happen on 29 March, Kevin Toale says:
“I would like to think that there is going to be a lifeline thrown from either side. Generally, when there is so much at risk, I would like to think … not that right will prevail but an ounce of common sense will prevail.
“It’s incredible to think of so-called intelligent people going to meetings and leaving things in a state of affairs like this.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-to-put-forward-brexit-bill-in-early-june-4635106-May2019/,"
PRIME MINISTER Theresa May’s government will publish draft legislation in the first week of June that would allow Brexit to proceed if approved by parliament, a Downing Street spokesman announced last night.
The statement came after talks between May and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on a possible compromise that would end a deadlock on Brexit in parliament.
May met with Corbyn “to make clear our determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU”.
“We will, therefore, be bringing forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June,” the spokesman said, referring to a draft law based on the divorce deal agreed with EU leaders.
May was seeking a “stable majority in parliament that will ensure the safe passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and the UK’s swift exit from the EU”, the spokesman said.
For the past six weeks, ministers and their Labour counterparts have been discussing how parliament might accept the agreement May struck with the European Union last year.
Progress has been painfully slow, and there are growing calls in May’s Conservative party to abandon the process.
But her ministers discussed at a cabinet meeting yesterday “the compromises which the government was prepared to consider” and agreed to keep talking, May’s spokesman said.
They also said it was “imperative” that any exit plan be approved by parliament before MPs go on their summer holiday, which normally begins at the end of July.

“What she (May) is working to do is to get a deal passed as soon as possible,” the spokesman said.
MPs have already rejected May’s Brexit deal three times.
European Elections
She turned to Labour last month in the hope of finding a way through, but the party is insisting on a close trading relationship with the EU that many Conservative MPs reject.
A Labour party spokesperson said Corbyn had raised “concerns about the prime minister’s ability to deliver on any compromise agreement”.
“He raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments,” the spokesperson said, following statements by Conservative MPs seeking to replace May.
After twice delaying Brexit, Britain is reluctantly taking part in European Parliament elections on 23 May, almost three years after the referendum vote to leave the bloc.
The government had hoped to get the London parliament’s agreement for the divorce deal in the coming weeks so British MEPs would never have to take their seats.
But the goal of getting the bill to ratify the treaty passed by the end of July suggests they will have to.
“The factual position is if MEPs are elected and (the British) parliament has not approved a withdrawal agreement bill which has achieved royal assent by June 30, they will take their seats,” May’s spokesman said.

AFTER A DEVASTATING loss for the Tories and Labour in the local elections last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May looking weaker than ever as leader, what impact does all this have on the Brexit process?
In the aftermath of theUK election results, May has urged Labour to cut a deal on Brexit this week, but the main opposition party accused her of acting in “bad faith” – meaning a deal between the two to pass May’s Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons looks as unlikely as ever.
May has insisted the clobbering both main parties took in last week’s English local elections increased the necessity of finding a Brexit deal that a majority of MPs could vote for.
But there are some problems.Speculation is rifethat the executive of the 1922 Committee, the group of Tory backbenchers, is pushing for a timetable for May’s departure – and that they’re pushing for a shortlist of new leaders to be circulated by June or July.
This could mean that there’s a new Tory leader that completely scraps May’s Withdrawal Agreement and pushes for a new start to the Brexit process – or who pushes for a no-deal.
Among the names rumoured to succeed May as Tory leader and Prime Minister are Boris Johnson, who has pushed for the Irish backstop to be dropped from the deal; and Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary because he couldn’t support Theresa May’s Brexit deal (which he had a hand in negotiating for).

The Conservatives and Labour both lost ground in the local elections last Thursday, held in England and Northern Ireland, where voters had a chance to vent their frustration at the Brexit impasse dominating British politics.
Opinion polls suggest they are on course for an even worse pasting in the European Parliament elections, which take place in Britain on 23 May (they’re held on 24 May in Ireland).
May negotiated a withdrawal agreement with Brussels last year, but British MPs repeatedly voted it down, with large numbers of her own Conservative backbenchers joining the opposition in opposing it.
“Let’s listen to what the voters said in the elections and put our differences aside for a moment. Let’s do a deal,” May wrote in The Mail on Sunday newspaper.
Confidentiality ‘blown’: McDonnell
The Tory-Labour Brexit talks resume today: the Sunday Times reported that the government was prepared to give way to Labour on three areas: customs, goods alignment and workers’ rights.

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
According to the report, May would set out plans for a temporary customs arrangement with the EU that would last until the next general election, which must be held by May 2022.
But McDonnell said the talks had been undermined by the article, blaming May for trying to firm up her own shaky position.
“We have maintained confidentiality,” he told BBC television.
When asked if he trusted May, he said: “No. Sorry. Not after this weekend when she has blown the confidentiality we had, and I actually think she has jeopardised the negotiation for her own personal protection.”
May has said she will step aside once a Brexit deal has been passed by parliament, but after Friday’s election results she has come under pressure to go sooner.
The original date that the UK was due to leave the EU was 29 March. This date was pushed back to 12 April after the UK parliament couldn’t decide what type of Brexit they wanted. The date that the UK must leave the EU by is now the 31 October; although if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is passed in the House of Commons before then, the UK would leave weeks after that vote.
A ‘check-in’ is scheduled to take place at the end of June as part of the extension granted by the EU.
New International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said the ball was now in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s court. adding that if Corbyn wanted to do a Brexit deal with May “it will be actually surprisingly easy to do because our positions are very, very close”.
Stewart said he would run to replace May when the time comes.
Anger at ‘stitch-up’
The newly-formed Brexit Party is leading the opinion polls for the upcoming European elections.
Its leader, eurosceptic figurehead Nigel Farage, said any deal between Labour and the Conservatives to keep Britain in the EU’s customs union would be the “final betrayal” of Brexit voters.
“If May signs up to this, I can’t see the point of the Conservative Party even existing,” he told Sky News.
Meanwhile more than 100 opposition MPs have written to May and Corbyn to say they would vote against any agreement the pair reach unless it is subject to a new referendum.
“The very worst thing we could do at this time is a Westminster stitch-up, whether over the PM’s deal or another deal,” the letter says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/the-irish-for-brexit-and-the-need-for-a-hiberno-english-dictionary-4435647-Jan2019/,"This the latest dispatch from our columnist Darach Ó Séaghdha, author of the award-winning and bestselling Motherfoclóir. Every week, Darach will be regaling (re-Gaeling?) us with insights on what the Irish language says about Ireland, our society, our past and our present. Enjoy.
2019 HAS ARRIVED and barring an unprecedented act of cross-party political heroism-  or an entirely unprecedented act of kicking the can down the road – it will be the year of Brexit.
If you’ve been following the Nuacht on RTÉ or TG4, you’ll have heard them refer to this event as Breatimeacht – a literal translation of Brexit.
The carelessness of this word in English is both frustrating and prophetic – it is obvious in hindsight that the implications of a land border with the Republic never crossed the minds of people who use the terms ‘the United Kingdom’ and ‘Britain’ interchangeably.
This is why some Irish speakers call Brexit Sasamach (Sasanach + amach, English + outside) instead.
Language and Brexit
One way in which the European Union will change after Brexit is in the realm of language.
The lack of a single, official language of business – specifically, picking one of the big languages over the others – has been a sore point throughout the history of the European institutions and has contributed to its reputation of being indecisive and bureaucratic.
Fortunately, Sasamach creates an opportunity for the EU to re-evaluate its approach to linguistic policy and ordain English as the first language of business in the institutions. Not the English of Britain though, that would be ridiculous once they are gone.
Hiberno-English, the version of English spoken in Ireland should be the vernacular of the EU. The more you think about it, the more you’ll realise that this makes perfect sense.
Global English Doesn’t Come From England
The reason English is the most powerful second language in the world isn’t down to the efforts of the Oxford Dictionary or the way it’s taught in Stoke on Trent.
It’s down to the lyrics of Swede Max Martin and Colombian Shakira, the films of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the stilted phrasing in Japanese computer games.
Then there’s also the small matter of some very influential countries that use English as a first language, including the USA, Canada and Australia.
Advertisement
The decision by the United States to use English was not taken lightly and one of the conditions of its acceptance was a distinct approach to spelling (e.g. color, realize).
Since then, other English speaking countries have adapted their own dictionaries to record the specifics of how that language is used there.
These can cover humorously local terms, like Canadian loonies and toonies, for one and two dollar coins, or struth in Australia. The dictionaries collate the local uses of mainstream words t00 – like when the Australians say thongs for flip-flops.
Ireland Needs Its Own English Dictionary
We generally think of Hiberno-English as an adorably wacky uncle of a language – a sleeveen here and a yurt there, a splash of thin English paint over a lumpy Gaelic undercoat.
But Irish people understand words like tribunal, bailout and referendum in a particular way based on recent history which cannot be explained by a relationship to the Irish language.
These understandings are not recorded in any dictionary because Ireland doesn’t keep such a record. This is posterity’s loss – meanwhile deadly meaning good, is listed as Australian slang in some dictionaries.
Hiberno-English Is Utterly European
The words of Beckett (Anglais? Au contraire), Joyce and Heaney are a literary tradition entirely consistent with the ideals of the European Union – horrified by war, baffled by the arbitrary lines that divide nations but open to the treasures of other cultures.
The spoken English of Ireland is the resource of a world power that has evolved to meet local circumstances as required – like the European Union, it is micro and macro, foreign and local at the same time.
The Joys of Hiberno-English
European English is a mess. Take for example ‘the non-compliance of a proposal for a legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity represent at least a simple majority of the votes allocated to the national Parliaments in accordance with the second subparagraph’ – nobody speaks like that in real life, and nobody would miss such inelegant prose.
On the other hand every Autumn, thousands of Spanish students return to Madrid and Seville to delight their English teachers with colloquial phrases, like “ah, stop”, “come here to me” and “I will in me hoop”.
And after 2019, Ireland will see a sharp rise in European second and third level students coming here to learn the real English of the EU. So perhaps it is time to make it official and create an Irish Dictionary of English, a real living European language – that everyone can use and enjoy.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-warns-against-rolling-cliff-edge-as-leaders-meet-for-crunch-summit-4553822-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
European People's Party / TwitterEuropean People's Party / Twitter/ Twitter
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has warned against a “rolling cliff edge” situation as EU leaders meet for a crunch summit just eight days until the scheduled Brexit date of 29 March.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels Varadkar said the EU needed to cut Britain “a little bit of slack” and give consideration to their request for a short extension.
Theresa May confirmed her decision to seek a three month extension to Article 50, the mechanism by which the UK is exiting the EU, yesterday.
Some European leaders warned the date would have to be 23 May, the same date as the European elections, while others warned they would veto any extension unless the British Prime Minister presented a credible strategy at this week’s summit.
May was thrown something of a lifeline yesterday afternoon when European Council President Donald Tusk said a short extension would be possible but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the Commons.
He also said the 30 June date had its merits but created “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”.
Reports have emerged that an extension until 23 May will be given to the UK on condition that May’s draft Brexit deal is passed in the House of Commons next week.
In an address to the nation last night May said she was on the side of the public and reiterated her call for MPs to back the twice-rejected withdrawal deal.
Asked on her way into the summit today if she was prepared to lead UK out on a ‘no deal’ basis in 8 days she didn’t rule it out but reiterated that the Commons should vote to back the deal in the coming days.

A vote could take place as early as Tuesday next.
No deal
If the deal is rejected at the third time of asking, there’s still a possibility the EU could come back and offer a much longer extension in order to avoid the so-called ‘rolling cliff-edge’. This would require the UK to take part in EU elections.
May has said that’s not something she would countenance and strongly hinted she would quit if forced into a corner on the issue by the EU and parliament (we’ve gone into detail on some of the scenarios that could throw uphere).

Speaking on his way into the summit this afternoon Varadkar said everyone needed to bear in mind that nobody wanted at no-deal exit.
“No deal can only ever be a British choice. Let’s not forget the March 29th deadline was set by the United Kingdom.”
He reiterated that the UK always had the choice if it so wished to revoke Article 50 at the last moment “and they do not need permission to do that, so no-deal will be a British choice and a British decision”.
He said that if the UK was to remain in the EU beyond this summer it would have to take part in European elections.
That message was echoed earlier by Phil Hogan, the Agriculture Commissioner and former Fine Gael minister.
“Our legal advice is there would be European elections in the UK if an extension was granted beyond 23 May,” Hogan said.

BOSSES AT TOP supermarkets and food chains have written to MPs urging them to avoid a no-deal Brexit and warn of the risks that it could reduce the availability of many products.
On the eve of parliament’s vote on unlocking the Brexit impasse,10 food chiefs plus industry body the British Retail Consortiumcalled on the members of House of Commons to work “urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and removes… risks for UK consumers”.
“We anticipate significant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tariffs,” they said in a letter to MPs.
“We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no-deal Brexit,” they added.

The letter was signed by supermarkets Asda, Co-op, Costcutter, Lidl, Sainsbury and Waitrose, as well as food retailer Marks & Spencer, KFC, McDonald’s and sandwich chain Pret A Manger.
It was not signed by Britain’s biggest retailer Tesco nor German discounter Aldi.

‘Significant disruption’
“On behalf of our businesses and the wider food industry we want to highlight to you the challenges for retailers and the consequences for millions of UK consumers of leaving the European Union without a deal at the end of March,” the letter said.
Almost one-third of the food consumed in the UK comes from the European Union, they stressed.
“This complex, just-in-time supply chain will be significantly disrupted in the event of no deal,” the letter added.
After British MPs overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal earlier this month, they will vote again tomorrow on what they want her to do next as the 29 March departure deadline looms.
May has scheduled a day’s debate tomorrow and MPs have introduced amendments which they hope could indicate which options may have majority support in parliament.
Several amendments demand changes to the backstop arrangement in May’s deal, which could see Britain in effect tied to EU custom rules in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Her visit is aimed at securing changes to her government’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU that was rejected by the House of Commons last month.
Her tour was not expected to be fruitful one but expectations were dampened further yesterday by EU officials Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker.
The president of the European Commission, Juncker, told reporters May already knows and accepts that the EU will not re-open talks on the deal.
And Tusk, who represents EU member governments as head of the European Council,triggered outrage across the Channel by damning pro-Brexitpoliticians for — in his view — recklessly failing to plan.
“I’ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely,” Tusk said.
Juncker, at a later news conference, did not use the same language, but cheerfully laughed off Tusk’s remark.
But he also repeated the same warning that the withdrawal agreement, and the backstop clause designed to keep the Irish border open if no future trade deal is agreed, will not be changed.
“She knows that the commission is not prepared to reopen the issue,” Juncker said, after talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who also insisted on the need for the backstop.

This apparently united front did not daunt Number 10, who insisted that the British parliament’s rejection of the deal meant that May must seek material changes to the accord or see it fail.
Labour
Back in the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to May to outline changes to her deal that would be needed for his party to support it.
Corbyn reluctantly met with May last week after parliament voted to reject her Withdrawal Agreement.
In the letter, which Corbyn has published, the Labour leader said changes to May’s “red lines” were needed. Among them that the UK must enter into a customs union with the EU.

“We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,” Corbyn writes.
In the letter, Corbyn outlined in five bullet points the changes he and his party wanted to see:
If that first point were to be implemented, it would eliminate the need for a backstop as the UK keeping trade standards in line with the EU would negate the need for a border.
Corbyn’s letter will disappoint supporters of a second referendum who have pushed for the Labour party to back their campaign.

https://www.thejournal.ie/salaries-employers-brexit-4479426-Feb2019/,"SALARIES ARE SET to rise by 5% on average, and by up to 20% for in demand and emerging niche skill-sets this year, according to the Morgan McKinley Irish Salary Guide for 2019.
Its analysis forecasts that the positive outlook for the economy has put pressure on the jobs market that will help to drive up salaries this year, with Ireland also well placed to receive an employment boost after Brexit.
With the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March, and the potential of a no deal remaining high, two surveys released today on the Irish economy are very-much Brexit-heavy in their forecasts.
While there is a degree of positivity regarding Ireland’s ability to cope with Brexit, there is also a certain limbo at present until we find out exactly how it will affect us here.
In a separate survey by KBC Bank Ireland and the ESRI, consumer sentiment was also strong in the first month of 2019, as spenders wait to see how Brexit may affect their pockets.
‘More attractive’
According to the analysis by the recruitment agency Morgan McKinley, 52% of employers who participated in its survey agreed that the Irish jobs market will be “more attractive” due to Brexit.
However, a large proportion of employees feel undervalued with 60% saying that they deserve higher salaries.
A similar proportion (61%) of workers say they work more than their contracted hours, while just over half (53%) of professionals are expecting a salary increase in 2019.
Employers cited a “lack of growth opportunities for employees” as the number one reason for employee attrition.

Morgan McKinley’s chief operations officer Ger Fitzgerald said: “Preparation for GDPR and the ongoing ramifications of Brexit have both positively impacted project orientated employment during 2018, however it remains to be seen whether the influence of Brexit will have an overall negative effect as it unfolds during 2019.
‘Choppy path’
According to the KBC Bank/ESRI consumer sentiment index for January, spending indicators will remain on a “choppy path” in early 2019 as people juggle the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU with modestly improving conditions in the economy.
Irish consumer sentiment rose slightly in January on the back of post-Christmas sales and positive jobs news, which offset ongoing concerns over Brexit, KBC said.
The bank said that consumers are watching and waiting to see whether Brexit pivots towards “promise or pain” as they regulate their spending.
KBCKBC
Its chief economist Austin Hughes said in his analysis: “Irish consumers have adopted a more cautious approach of late.
KBCKBC
The index suggests that consumers aren’t ignoring Brexit, even if they aren’t sure how it will affect them going forward.
The weakest element of the survey was consumers’ outlook for the Irish economy, with people expecting a weaker rather than a stronger economy to prevail in the next twelve months.
Hughes added: “The uptick in sentiment in January is encouraging in that it suggests Irish consumers are not completely overwhelmed by Brexit gloom.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-dup-theresa-may-extension-4556139-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Mar 2019
DUP DEPUTY LEADER Nigel Dodds has criticised the UK government, and called the delay to the date by which the UK leaves the European Union “a humiliation”.
Last night, it was agreed that the date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if British Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was passed; if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
The DUP, whose 10 MPs are supporting May’s government, said today that she had missed an opportunity to put forward new proposals to change the Withdrawal Agreement.
In a statement released this afternoon, Dodds said that the fact that Theresa May didn’t do so “is all the more disappointing and inexcusable given the clear divisions and arguments which became evident amongst EU member states”.
He said that these divisions were made evident “when faced with outcomes they don’t like” – possibly referring to the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons.
There had been rumours that the DUP had been softening its stance towards May’s twice-rejected Withdrawal Agreement and could be preparing to vote for it next week for the third Meaningful Vote.

Speaking at the Fine Gael National Conference, which is taking place in Wexford over the next two days, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he had read the DUP statement today, though he warned not to pay too much heed to “emotive” language at this stage of play.
DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson will be addressing tomorrow’s Young Fine Gael session at the conference, titled: ‘North-South relations into the future’.
Coveney said he hopes to get some”quiet time” with Donaldson tomorrow to discuss the Brexit state-of-play, though when asked what he could say to twist the DUP’s arm, Coveney said they do not take too kindly to that.
He said they have tried to give “reassurances and clarifications” around the backstop, adding that this weekend, the British parliament, should be given the time and space it needs to get a majority over the line for another vote next week.
Last weekend, the DUP held talks with Theresa May and her Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond, to discuss what changes they wanted to make to in order that they would vote for it.
We have been very clear that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the U.K. and for the EU.But it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. 2/2pic.twitter.com/TVQopbbHnG— Nigel Dodds (@NigelDoddsDUP)March 22, 2019Nigel Dodds/ Twitter

Dodds said today, however that negotiations with the EU had been expected to go down to the wire and accused the government to be “far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had said earlier that the extension gave the UK some “breathing space” and opened up the possibility of indicative votes in the House of Commons.
In a statement ahead of the European Council summit, Theresa May had laid the blame for the current political impasse with MPs, for not voting her deal through. In response to this, Dodds said today:
“Lectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in Parliament.
“Nothing has changed as far as the Withdrawal Agreement is concerned,” Dodds added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-backstop-meaningful-vote-2-4536984-Mar2019/,"THE DUP HAS said that it cannot support Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest Brexit deal tonight, making it less likely that the Withdrawal Agreement will pass in the House of Commons.
MPs are due to vote once again on the Brexit deal, in the wake of last-minute measures announced last night by May and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
However, advice from attorney general Geoffrey Cox published this morning put hopes of the deal passing in doubt.
Deputy leader and MP, Nigel Dodds tweeted the party’s current position, adding: “Sufficient progress has NOT been achieved at this time.”

However, the party added that it does want to back an agreement but does not believe May’s deal passes its “fundamental tests” on the “constitutional and economic integrity” of the Union.

The DUP’s statement in full reads:
“The Prime Minister set out a clear objective for legally binding change which would command a majority in the House of Commons in line with the Brady amendment.  We recognise that the Prime Minister has made limited progress in her discussions with the European Union.
“Having carefully considered the published material as well as measuring what has been achieved against our own fundamental tests, namely the impact of the backstop on the constitutional and economic integrity of the Union of the United Kingdom, it is clear that the risks remain that the UK would be unable to lawfully exit the backstop were it to be activated.
“The Attorney General’s legal advice is clear in his last paragraph “the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”

“The European Union has been intransigent. It is possible to reach a sensible deal which works for the United Kingdom and the European Union but it will require all sides to be reasonable and in deal making mode.”
The European Research Group (or the ERG), made up of hardline-Tory Brexiteers – has also advised its 110 members not to support the government’s motion, describing the new assurances as offering only “faint and remote prospects of escaping” from the backstop.
The House of Commons is due to vote on May’s Withdrawal Agreement at 7pm.
There are650 seats in the House of Commons; Theresa May needs 320 votes to pass her deal tonight.
If the deal fails again this evening, parliament will vote on a no-deal Brexit tomorrow, or an extension to Article 50 on Thursday which could delay Brexit if the EU is amenable.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-britain-gibraltar-colony-4472357-Feb2019/,"
BRITAIN HAS REACTED with fury after a European Council document published on Friday described Gibraltar as a colony.
The document, laying out proposals to give British nationals short-stay, visa-free access to the EU’s borderless Schengen area after Brexit, contained the description in a footnote.
“It is completely unacceptable to describe Gibraltar in this way,” British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman told reporters.
“Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family and this will not change due to our exit from the EU,” he said.
Gibraltar, home to 33,000 people, was ceded to Britain by Spain in 1713, in perpetuity.
The seven square-kilometre peninsula is an internally self-governing British overseas territory.
Sharing a 1.2-kilometre fenced border with Spain, the implications of Brexit on Gibraltar have formed part of Britain’s divorce talks with the European Union.

“Gibraltar is a colony of the British crown,” the European Council document said in a starred footnote.
“There is a controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over Gibraltar, a territory for which a solution has to be reached in light of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations.”
In a 2002 referendum on whether Britain and Spain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar, 99% of voters said no.
In the 2016 referendum on Britain’s EU membership, Gibraltar had the highest pro-Remain vote, at 96%.
The draft divorce deal between London and Brussels – rejected by British MPs – sought to defuse any future tensions over Gibraltar when Britain leaves the EU on 29 March.
The deal provides for Spanish-British cooperation on citizens’ rights, tobacco and other products, environment, police and customs matters.
It sets the basis for administrative cooperation for achieving full transparency in tax matters, fighting fraud, smuggling and money laundering.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-dominic-raab-varadkar-4469317-Jan2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS rubbished claims by the former UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab that the Taoiseach leaked inaccurate information about him to the media.
Raab was speaking yesterday to Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and said that the information was “leaked in an inaccurate and misrepresenting way”.
Raab denied that this meant he was accusing the Taoiseach of lying, but rather that the information in the report was not correct.
Areport in the Telegraph claimedthat Raab that had privately suggested to Tánaiste Simon Coveney that the backstop be time-limited to three months.
“The conversation I had with him was leaked to the media in terms which were not factually accurate, in terms of the proposal that I had put forward, privately and confidentiality at his request,” Raab told the committee.
Responding last night to Raab’s claims, Coveney’s advisor last night described Raab’s comment’s as “pure spoof”.
Chris Donoghue / TwitterChris Donoghue / Twitter/ Twitter
The chain of events surrounding Raab’s rubbished claim involves a meeting that was held between Raab, his adviser, the Tánaiste and his adviser.

A week later The Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times reported thatRaab had suggested to Coveney that Britain should have the right to withdraw from the backstop after three months.
Dismissing the claim from Raab, a government source questioned when the Irish government has ever leaked to The Daily Telegraph. The Tánaiste and Taoiseach were asked about the newspaper reports at the time, they added.
“Then three months later the Taoiseach is being brandished the leaker. Totally bizarre,” they added.
During exchange, Raab said that the meeting in question with Coveney was “very constructive” and that the pair had agreed to keep it private.”
“Check the media, I didn’t comment on it. It was only commented on, not by Simon Coveney, but by the Taoiseach,” Raab stated.
A government spokesperson toldTheJournal.iethat the claim is “absolutely nonsense”.
“There is no basis to this allegation. Mr Raab should produce any evidence to support it if he has any,” they added.
Raab was the UK’s Brexit secretary from July to November last yearbut resigned from Theresa May’s Cabinetwhen he disagreed with the Withdrawal Agreement being proposed by the Prime Minister.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-extension-summit-4586456-Apr2019/,"THE UK AND EU have agreed a flexible Brexit extension until 31 October following marathon talks in Brussels.
Theresa May insisted in her post-summit press conference, held shortly before 3am local time, that she would redouble efforts to get the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement through parliament as soon as possible.
The British Prime Minister insisted that her “key request” had been granted – the extension could be terminated if the withdrawal deal was passed.
The overnight deal agreed between May and the 27 leaders from the remaining states means the UK will have to hold elections for the EU Parliament if it wants to avoid another potential cliff edge.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, tweeting after the negotiations ended, noted: “UK to take part in@Europarl_ENelection or must leave on June 1st without a deal.”
And we’re done. (1) Flextension to Oct 31st (2) We’ll take stock of situation at our regular summit in June (3) UK to take part in@Europarl_ENelection or must leave on June 1st without a deal.Good night !— Leo Varadkar (@LeoVaradkar)April 11, 2019Leo Varadkar/ Twitter
And we’re done. (1) Flextension to Oct 31st (2) We’ll take stock of situation at our regular summit in June (3) UK to take part in@Europarl_ENelection or must leave on June 1st without a deal.Good night !
Cliff edge
The summit had been scheduled to begin just two days before the UK was due to exit the union without a deal on Friday.
May had been seeking a much shorter extension, until 30 June, but the majority of leaders from remaining nations wanted a long one of up to a year. European Council President Donald Tusk had mooted the ‘flextension’ option – allowing the UK to exit if the withdrawal deal was passed – as a compromise.
May made her pitch and answered questions from the other leaders yesterday evening before the remaining heads of government held their own lengthy meeting to discuss their position.
France’s Emmanuel Macron had been seeking a much shorter extension, and according to reports emerging from the talks believed the UK leaving with no deal would be less of a risk than it remaining on and disrupting the EU’s business from within.
As the EU 27 discussions went past midnight in Brussels a new deadline of 31 October emerged, with a review to happen in June before the next session of the EU Parliament.
Breakthrough
European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted shortly after 2am Brussels time: “EU27/UK have agreed a flexible extension until 31 October. This means additional six months for the UK to find the best possible solution.”

The nature of what had been agreed was soon clarified: In a press conference Tusk confirmed the UK could still sign off the deal and leave early.
He also offered this stark warning to politicians in the UK: ”This extension is as flexible as I expected and a little bit shorter than I expected but it’s still enough to find a best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.”
As for that review in June, Tusk said it was so he could inform EU leaders about the Brexit outlook. Speaking alongside him EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it would be a time to take stock and was not a cliff-edge.
Tusk stressed that the UK will be treated as a full EU member state and retain all of its rights during the extension period.

Frustration
Theresa May said she knew there was “huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension”.
“The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal which would allow the UK to leave in a smooth and orderly way.”
She added: “The choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. We must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest.”
She said she would give an update to the Commons later today and that talks between Downing Street and the Labour leadership would continue.
“I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in parliament but we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfill the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit, and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital.”
Paul Brand / TwitterPaul Brand / Twitter/ Twitter
She said the UK might still manage an orderly departure by 22 May, before the EU elections.
“What this extension enables us to do is to go through the process we’ve set up,” May said. “If we’re able to do that before May 22, then we won’t have to hold European Parliamentary Elections.”
Meanwhile Tory backbenchers also met on Thursday night. It’s safe to say we can expect speculation about May’s expected departure date to dominate the political agenda in London today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/emma-desouza-belfast-rally-4596514-Apr2019/,"RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER EMMA DeSouza is to lead a rally in Belfast tomorrow to raise awareness of how there’s no legal basis for the Good Friday Agreement in British law.
In a rally that will address people at City Hall, DeSouza and others will call on the Good Friday Agreement to be upheld in all its parts.
DeSouza, a 31-year-old woman from Derry,is challenging the British government’s assertionthat people born in Northern Ireland can’t declare themselves as Irish, but are born British and must renounce British citizenship to claim their Irish citizenship.
This is contrary to the Good Friday Agreement, but the Home Office’s assertion is that British immigration laws supercede that Agreement. DeSouza is challenging that argument; one British tribunal has found in her favour.
Since her case was put into the public eye, DeSouza has prompted an online campaign, with other Northern Ireland citizens who faced similar obstacles in accessing their Irish rights by tweeting their experiences out under the hashtags “I Stand With Emma” and “We Are Irish Too”.
“We keep hearing from the Irish government and the EU that the Good Friday Agreement needs to be upheld in all its parts, but that’s not what’s happening, and if anything we’re seeing a hardening against these rights.
Numbers
DeSouza says that she’s not sure how many will be attending the rally tomorrow, and said that she organised it after people began asking her to, saying that it all happened “quite organically” through social media. The rally in Belfast is happening at noon at City Hall; a sister rally is taking place in London at the Northern Ireland Office.
Actor Siobhán McSweeney, who plays Sister Michael in Derry Girls, hasexpressed supportfor the London rally on Twitter, and DeSouza understands that some of those who worked on the show are going to attend.
She says that Northern Irish unionists got involved with the campaign too: “We got all these responses, with people sharing where they were born. So I know that I’m not alone, and the responsibility is on me to try to advocate on their behalf.”
She says that since she started her legal battle against the Home Office, others have got in touch with similar stories about their struggle to access their right to citizenship.
Advertisement
DeSouza says that these problems have been going on for years, and the only reason we’re hearing about it now is that “a) we went public, and b) we’re the only people who have stuck with it”.
“They appeal, and appeal, and appeal again until you relent.
Parliaments
DeSouza first took the case against the British Home Office after her US husband Jake’s application for an EEA residence cardwas rejected.
In their refusal letter, the Home Office wrote: “…your spouse is entitled to renounce her status as a British citizen and rely on her Irish citizenship, but until that status is renounced she is as a matter of fact a British citizen”.
The UK government effectively argued that DeSouza is a British citizen until she revokes it in favour of her Irish citizenship. As she is classed as a British citizen, but is an Irish passport holder, the UK government had classed her as having dual-citizenship, and cannot go through the UK immigration system as an EU national. On this basis, her husband’s application for a residence card was refused.
Her case has also been raised in the Dáil and in the House of Commons in recent months.
“I know that Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been talking to the Home Secretary about this, so it’s really good to see him publicly support the issue.”
DeSouza says that there’s a failing in the Good Friday Agreement that if the British government do something wrong, “there’s nothing to make sure they hold up their end of the bargain”.
This gap in the law is particularly relevant in the context of Brexit, where citizens in Northern Ireland are hoping that through their Irish citizenship, they can gain access to EU rights post-Brexit.
DeSouza says that if these rights are given to Irish citizens, then they should also be given to British citizens from Northern Ireland, or else that would also contravene the Good Friday Agreement: “One set of people can’t have a choice that others don’t.”
“The real purpose is to give people a voice,” DeSouza says. “On Saturday, myself and others will be making a very specific ask to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. These words are not being translated and we need to make it clear that it’s time to address this issue.”

Farage is the leader of the Brexit Party which, despite being a newly set-up party,is charging aheadof the Tory and Labour parties in the polls for the European election.
The UK’s electoral system means that citizens vote for a party and not a candidate, meaning that if the Brexit party retain their 34% share of the vote, they will receive the greatest share of British MEP seats in the next term of the European Parliament.
Farage is also the cofounder and former leader of Ukip; he resigned as leader immediately after the Brexit vote in June 2016.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-impact-shops-ireland-4447701-Jan2019/,"THE PROSPECT OF a no deal Brexit became more likely this week as Theresa May’s proposed withdrawal deal with the EUsuffered a thumping defeatin the House of Commons.
The government here said in a statement released immediately after that vote that it would intensify preparations for a disorderly Brexit.
France, too, took immediate action, with the country’s interior minister activating a plan for a no deal exit and providing for €50 million of investment in French ports and airports.
From the consumer’s point of view, the impact of a no deal Brexit will be “potentially grisly,” the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association’s CEO Michael Bell toldTheJournal.ie.

The impact of Brexit was already being felt across the North, Bell said. In the years since the vote “a considerable amount” of essential migrant workers had already left, due in part to the chilling effect of the expected exit from the European Union and concerns about whether they’d still be welcome after Brexit.
Speaking at theNational Manufacturing and Supply Chain Conferencein Dublin Bell described no deal as a “disaster” for the agri-food industry north and south of the border. His organisation is strongly anti-Brexit and members want trading conditions to stay “as close to what they are today as possible”.
In a worst case scenario a return to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would mean an enormous hike in tariffs – the taxes imposed on imports and exports – for food producers. The tariffs average at 22% but are far higher on some goods.
Using flour as an example, Bell explained that there are only three flour mills on the island of island. Of that number the two in Belfast are the only ones that supply bulk commercial flour, delivering to bakers north and south.
“60% of the output of the two mills in Belfast goes to the Republic of Ireland,” he said. “The WTO tariff on flour is over 60% at today’s prices.”
An ESRI study published last year found that if tariffs were introduced and other trade costs also increased following a hard Brexit, the price of bread and cereals could rise by up to 30%, while milk, cheese and egg prices could increase by 46%.

A hard Brexit would increase the cost of living for all households in Ireland by 2% to 3% – an annual increase of €892 to €1,360 per household,that study found. Costs would rise most for lower-income households.
The disruption to trade caused by tariffs, checks and transport issues could have a massive distorting effect on the array of goods available at your local supermarket or convenience store, Bell said.
“I know empty shelves makes great column inches. The reality is I think it’s going to be more distortion.
“The things that you might want might not be there or they might be there at a price you don’t want to pay anymore, and there might be other things there in glut and because they’re in glut the price has been reduced to try and get them moved.
Bell said his organisation would be stepping up lobbying activities in the coming weeks amid continuing political turmoil in London.

After a chaotic evening in Westminster,278voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
The Prime Minister’s motion had an amendment attached to it because of an earlier vote in the house. The initial motion read:
However, during tonight’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as Theresa May had proposed.
A total of312voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while308voted against the amendment.
That vote was essentially repeated as May’s main motion was altered to reflect the Spelman amendment. To add to the confusion of the evening, Spelman tried to pull her amendment but other signatories to it wanted it to be pushed and voted on.
She said she wanted to stop the vote after it was clear the two main parties would “put their weight behind a no to ‘no deal’ amendment – the government motion”.
She told BBC News that it would send “a very strong signal of the parties coming together in the national interest to make a clear statement that we do not want to crash out without a deal”.
In the end, it was voted on and MPs did completely reject a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances. It was not the way that May intended the evening to play out.
Taking ‘no deal’ off the table entirely (politically, even if it can’t be take off the table in actuality) was not part of the UK’s negotiating plan.
In the end, it is understood the Prime Minister voted against her own motion because of that amendment and there was some confusion over who in her party was whipped, and in what way. A number of Cabinet ministers are said to have abstained.

The government had tried to whip its members but the final numbers show that a  significant cohort of 17 Tory MPs would have voted against the wishes of their party.

A third vote
The so-called Malthouse B Compromise was also voted on but roundly rejected – with164politicians voting for it and374against.
The motion asked for a delay until 22 May to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. The amendment detailed how the British government should ask the EU for a ‘standstill pay-as-you-go’ arrangement until end-2021 at the latest, during which a future relationship would be carved out.
So what happens now?
Tomorrow, the House of Commons will hold another vote. MPs will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
If passed, the UK would not leave the EU on the 29 March but May said the motion will ask politicians to vote on a ‘short, limited, technical’ extension to Article 50.
However, it would have to ask the EU if it could do so. The EU has said it would be amenable to such a move – but it would need to know what the UK’s plan would be.

The motion proposes an extension until 30 June, a day before the new EU parliament will sit.
May said that to get such an extension, there would have to be a deal in place, and that the only deal on offer is the current Withdrawal Agreement.
The Prime Minister said that parliament needs to accept that the only other option open to them if that motion is rejected is to opt for a much longer extension.
As noted today by chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, one of the current risks is an ‘accidental no-deal Brexit’.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-medicines-4500979-Feb2019/,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that there is enough medicine in Ireland for 8 to 12 weeks in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and that people should not be stockpiling medicines, as it may cause issues later on.
“The pharmaceutical industry has been preparing for this, as has the Department of Health and the HSE. There aren’t any medicines that are on any kind of a risk-list in terms of not being supplied after the end of March,” he toldRTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
He said that contingency work around medicines has been going on for many months now, and that they would be monitoring the situation as time goes on.
The UK is due to leave the European Union by 11pm on 29 March; the drafted Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected by the House of Commons. In subsequent votes, a group of MPs voted against ruling out a no-deal Brexit.
Coveney said that Ireland relies heavily on Britain for its medicines, and that this would need to change in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“The regulation of medicines is an EU competence, so when the UK leaves the EU they won’t have the European Medicines Agency based in the UK. Many of the medicines based in the UK, unless there’s a future agreement, they won’t be able to get the European authorisations they need.
Coveney also said that while a huge amount of contingency planning is in place, that a no-deal would still “put a huge strain” on a variety of sectors in Ireland.

“I don’t want to give the impression that it will be easily managed… but we’re doing everything that we physically can to protect Irish interests.”
Cabinet approval
The government will be signing off on ‘omnibus legislation’ today, which comprises of 16 pieces of legislation from nine different government departments all related to no-deal Brexit planning. “It’s a mega bill, if you like,” Coveney said.
The legislation will ensure children from Northern Ireland can access specialist paediatric care in the Republic.
“It also does things we never thought we’d have to do, like put a legislative base in place for someone to get on a train in Dublin and go to Belfast, because they’ll now be going out of the European Union into a third country and back again.”
There are 21 different social welfare payments and pension payments that Irish citizens who are living in the UK access from Ireland; new laws need to be passed to protect those in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
When asked about veterinary and food checks and ports and airports, Coveney said that they were carried out on an all-island basis because “it made sense to do it” that way.
He said that he was still of the opinion that there wouldn’t be a no-deal Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-papers-tusk-hell-4481571-Feb2019/,"YESTERDAY, EU COUNCIL President Donald Tusk wondered aloud whether there was a “special place in hell” for those whopushed for Brexit without a plan.
His words weretaken out of context by some, but there is no doubt they were pretty inflammatory.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar quietly told Tusk that the British press would give him “terrible trouble” for  his words and as the papers came out today we saw if that prediction came true.
Tusk was certainly attacked by some of the papers, while others ignored it. Surprisingly, The Mail, The Sun and the Daily Express were among the papers that did not feature Tusk.
Here’s a taster of some of the front pages where he did.
The Telegraph left out some crucial context for Tusk’s words and went big on it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-companies-leaving-uk-4458654-Jan2019/,"AS THE CLOCK ticks closer to 29 March, the date the UK is set to leave the EU, and as it’s looking more and more likely that there will be a no-deal scenario, a number of major companies have made announcements this week with regards to its Brexit preparations.
British lawmakers last week roundly rejected the divorce terms May agreed with Brussels, raising fresh fears with just 10 weeks to go that Britain could crash out of the EU with no deal.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this will mean that the British government will have to apply to adopt World Trade Organisation rules.
This will mean that tariffs, or taxes, will have to be introduced by the UK for goods being imported from the EU, and EU member states will do the same for goods being imported from the UK. These tariffs are set rates: for example, dairy goods are at 35%, while car imports cost 10% of their value.
However, as major companies like Sony and Dyson announced this week that they were moving their headquarters out of the UK, Britain’s International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told AFP at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Britain “remains open for business”.
Britain “is an attractive destination for foreign direct investment – and that during the time where there’s been uncertainty over Brexit”, Fox said.
So, with that, what companies have announced their departure from the UK in recent weeks and what were their reasons for the move?
Sony
On Wednesday, Japanese electronics giant Sony said it was moving its headquarters’ registration to the Netherlands by the end of March to avoid Brexit-related customs issues.
Its rival Panasonic last year also moved its European headquarters from Britain to the Netherlands over concerns about potential Brexit-related tax issues.
Several other Japanese firms, including megabank MUFG, Nomura Holdings, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, have said they are planning to move their main EU bases out of London since the 2016 Brexit vote.
Dyson
British electric appliance pioneer Dyson announced on Tuesday that it will switch its headquarters to Singapore this year.
Unlike Sony, however, Dyson said the decision is not because of Brexit, but rather due to booming Asian demand.
The group, founded and owned by serial entrepreneur and vocal Brexit supporter James Dyson, last year announced it would produce electric cars in Singapore.
The firm stressed that Brexit was not a factor behind the decision to ditch its corporate base in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, western England, in favour of Singapore.
P&O
British ferry operator P&O announced on Tuesday that it will register to Cyprus its ships operating on the English Channel in order to function more smoothly after Brexit.

“For operational and accounting reasons, we have concluded that the best course of action is to re-flag all ships to be under the Cyprus flag,” a spokesperson said.
The decision will result in “fewer inspections and delays, and will result in significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state”, he added.
Other preparations
A number of other companies have announced plans to prepare for Brexit, while not explicitly announcing their departure from the UK.
Airbus chief executive Tom Enders this week warned that the European aerospace giant could make “very harmful decisions” for Britain if it leaves the EU without a deal.
Enders branded the UK government’s handling of Brexit a “disgrace” and suggested 14,000 jobs at its sites designing and manufacturing wings at Filton in southwest England and Broughton in north Wales were under threat.
US car giant Ford later warned that a no-deal scenario “would severely impact Ford’s operations in the UK and across Europe, which potentially could result in an $800 million headwind in 2019″, it said.
Fellow carmaker Jaguar Land Rover also said in a statement it would pause production in Britain for a week after the 29 March departure date “due to potential Brexit disruption”, whatever the outcome.
The Guardianhas also reported that retailers Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home announced plans to shore up suppliers in the event of chaos at British ports.
Benefits for other countries
Ireland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have all benefited from companies moving out of London, although the large impact predicted by some on Britain’s financial sector has so far failed to materialise.
Dutch officials are in contact with more than 250 companies about a possible post-Brexit move, the government there said Wednesday.
The Dutch government will announce a final figure in February but “every new arrival of a business, big or small, is a success,” Michiel Bakhuizen, a spokesman for the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, told AFP.
What’s next with Brexit?
Well, after a historic defeat for her Brexit deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May will put her Withdrawal Agreement back before the House of Commons this Tuesday.
A record-breaking 230 MPs voted against the government last week, and May was given just three days to come up with her Plan B. On Monday this week, she announced that her Plan B was to hold another vote on Plan A (a very Brexit means Brexit move).
The strictest opposition from the House of Commons seems to be due to the backstop.
Many pro-Brexit and some pro-Remain MPs have expressed concern about whether the backstop would threaten Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom; others have said that the backstop needs to be time-limited, which EU leaders have said would make the backstop entirely pointless.
With time running out before the 29 March, which is when the UK must legally leave the European Union, the UK government, the EU and Ireland are scrambling for solutions.

AHEAD OF THE European elections in the UK today, a pro-unionist Twitter account shared a video that claimed that the Secretary-General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr, said: “Northern Ireland is the price to pay for Brexit.”
The video has been widely shared, but an EU spokesperson has called the quote “fake, fraudulent and pure disinformation.”
But is it true? Did Selmayr say Northern Ireland would be the price for Brexit?
On 22 May 2019, a pro-unionist Twitter page with nearly 4,000 followers, NI in Union,released a videowith the caption: “Stand up for Northern Ireland – Reject the Backstop: Use your Unionist Vote TOMORROW.” The two-minute long video was also released on Facebook from a page with the same name, which has 1,223 likes. The video encourages unionists to “stand up for Northern Ireland” and vote.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet

In the video, music plays over a clip of Selmayr talking with the subtitles: “Northern Ireland is the price to pay for Brexit.” On Twitter, the tweet received nearly 100 re-tweets and prompted an intervention from the chief spokesperson of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, whosaid in a tweet: “The sentence attributed to the @EU_Commission Secretary General at 1:16 of this video is fake, fraudulent and pure disinformation that has been spread maliciously.”
Schinas’s comments promptednumerous media reports, citing his criticism of the video and denial of the quote’s veracity. Selmayr has not yet publicly commented on the video, but did today re-tweet a tweet from Pablo Pérez, the head of the social media sector at the European Commission, who said: “So Russia Today -RT- decides to mute@EU_CommissionSecretary-General@MartinSelmayrwords and totally invent and attribute him something else. They are not journalists. They are nothing but a Kremilin [sic] propapanda [sic] machine. Disgusting.”

The claim that Selmayr said that Northern Ireland was the price to pay for Brexit was made originally by former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabin an interviewwith the UK’s Sunday Times newspaper on 18 November 2018. Raab, who proved controversialduring his tenurein the role, has proven himself an ardent Brexit backer and no-deal supporter since his resignation on 15 November 2018.
In the interview, published a few days after his resignation, he said: “There were certainly swirling dark forces in the commission, which you would hear rumbling that Northern Ireland was the price the United Kingdom must pay for leaving the EU… That’s totally irresponsible and reckless and not something we should give in to. The EU has become incredibly controlling and I think that’s a sign of their insecurity as an organisation.”
The article states:
The claimattracted attentionon Twitter at the time and fueled Brexit supporters’ anger at the EU. Selmayr, aclose allyof European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker,strongly deniedRaab’s claim at the time: “Mr Raab and I never met. This may explain why he does not say the truth. The European Commission is working day and night to help ensuring [sic] an orderly Brexit. And just like we expect our UK partners to fully respect the integrity of the EU’s single market, we fully respect the integrity of the EU.”
Rabb repeated the claim days later. On 9 December 2018, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Rabb told the Sophie Ridge on Sunday programme: “I was very surprised in particular about the way Northern Ireland was treated and you would hear, swirling around in Brussels, particularly the people around Selmayr, Martin Selmayr, in the Commission, and some others, that losing Northern Ireland would be the price the UK would pay for Brexit. This was reported to me through the diplomatic channel.” Raab accused the EU of “trying to carve up a major European nation.”
This claim was re-reported by some UKmedia outletsand attracted some attentioninternationally.
The video suggests that Martin Selmayr said the words: “Northern Ireland is the price to pay for Brexit.” There is no evidence that Martin Selmayr said this publicly. The quote originates from a claim made by Dominic Raab, following his resignation from cabinet, in several interviews. Raab also did not claim to have heard this directly from Selmayr, but instead from rumours he had been told by diplomatic staff in Brussels, meaning that they are second-hand claims.
Selmayr denied Rabb’s claim at the time and the quote contained in the video has been strongly rebutted and called “pure disinformation” by an EU spokesperson.
However, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of Raab’s claim and factcheck something that may or may not have been said.
As a result, we rate the claim that Martin Selmayr said that Northern Ireland is the price to pay for Brexit:UNPROVEN

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-party-campaign-rally-4590622-Apr2019/,"FORMER UKIP LEADER Nigel Farage has given a speech at the Brexit Party’s first campaign rally, after the party was officially launched yesterday.
“What happened on June 23 2016 should have been decisive,” he told those gathered in Birmingham this afternoon.
The crowd erupted into boos at the mention of a wide-range of figures including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, British Prime Minister Theresa May – and former US president Barack Obama, who had urged the UK to vote against Brexit during the referendum campaign.
Farage said of the crowd’s booing of Obama: “I have a friend in the White House who would agree with that”.
Former Tory MP Anna Soubry, Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, and French President Emmanuel Macron drew the biggest boos from the crowd. “This is better than polling,” Farage told the delegation.
Twitter / PeriscopeTwitter / Periscope / Periscope
Farage was a founder and leader of the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party, aka Ukip. He resigned as leader of the party shortly after the vote.
“I genuinely thought and believed on that day, that we’d won,” he said.
“And I’ll admit that I perhaps did not spend as much of my life at the front line of politics, as I thought that I had achieved my goal of 25 years.”

“And yet I am here before you today because I could not comprehend the sheer deceit, dishonesty, verging on treachery” of the current British government, Farage said.
When Farage said that the mood in favour of Brexit was stronger than it’s ever been, it provoked a huge round of applause from the audience.
A YouGov poll released today indicates that the Brexit party holds 15% support in the context of the upcoming European elections, which the UK will most likely take part in.
The Labour Party is on 24% and the Conservatives are on 16%, according to the same poll.

After spending 20 years as an MEP, but having failed to get elected to the UK parliament, Farage is to contest the upcoming European elections as a Brexit Party MEP.
“I don’t want to see Britain humiliated on the world stage,” he said, drawing a comparison between Theresa May asking the EU for more time to Oliver Twist.
“Her dreadful treaty… it’s such a shameful document… it’s only something someone would have signed who had been defeated in war.”
He said the Brexit Party was “fresh, it is new, it is professional, it is patriotic, and we are fighting this with one simple objective: to win”.
He also said that he was not “anti-European”, but wanted a Europe “of nation states”, and criticised the idea of a European army.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-forced-out-4647776-May2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is staring at the prospect of her political career coming to a crashing halt today, as her closest supporters in Cabinet rallied against her new Brexit plans.
The prime minister faces mutiny from the front and back benches over her revised way forward on Brexit, which includes a vote in parliament on holding a second referendum.
Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons who was runner up to May in the 2016 leadership contest, resigned last night in a fresh blow to May’s chances of remaining in power.
In astatement, Leadsom says she stayed in Cabinet “to shape and fight for Brexit” but “no longer believes that our approach will deliver on the referendum result”.
She added May’s latest proposal risks “undermining our Union” and will not deliver “a truly sovereign United Kingdom”.
The Conservative backbench committee – dubbed the 1922 committee – will meet with May on Friday, with speculation that its chair Graham Brady will demand she set out a departure date.

This comes against the backdrop of an expected drubbing at the polls in the European elections, as the UK votes today. Opinion polls have predicted that the Tories could come as low as fourth place behind Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-brexit-barnier-4431914-Jan2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said that there’s a possibility an “accidental no-deal Brexit” could still happen, but that after the series of votes in the House of Commons yesterday she didn’t think it would come to pass.
She also said that she was seeking a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May after a white paper on Northern Ireland was published, aimed at reassuring those with concerns about Northern Ireland’s position in the United Kingdom under the backstop.
Her comments were made after a meeting with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today, asa series of votes take place in the UK parliamenton the divisive Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
The meeting with Barnier, in which Sinn Féin leader in the North Michelle O’Neill also attended, was to ensure that “Ireland doesn’t become collateral damage in the Tory Brexit,” McDonald said.
She toldTheJournal.iethat they sought assurances from Barnier that they still stood with Ireland, as the UK government seeks “comfort, clarity and assurances” to try to get the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement passed in a House of Commons vote next Tuesday.
She added that after the House of Commons votes yesterday, that it was clear that there isn’t a majority for a no-deal Brexit, but that it still isn’t clear what they do want.
“A no-deal Brexit could happen by accident or by design, I think it’s something that we need to not panic over at this stage, and there can be no question of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
She said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, that Theresa May and the Irish government have been told that a border poll on Irish unity should be held.
The Northern Ireland white paper
On the two-year anniversary of the collapse of the Stormont Assembly, the UK government publisheda 13-page-long white paper on Northern Irelandand the Brexit deal – an attempt at reassuring the DUP and other MPs over the Irish backstop provisions.

In the white paper, the British government commits to giving Stormont Assembly a vote on whether or not to extend transition period, or go into the backstop. This isn’t legally binding, however, and isn’t the “veto for Stormont on the backstop” that the DUP had asked for.
The UK government also commits to giving the Stormont Assembly a ‘lock’ on accepting any new laws/directives from the EU when the backstop comes into force.
McDonald said that they were seeking a meeting with Theresa May on this white paper and what it would mean.
“I can only surmise at this stage that this is a ruse to placate the DUP,” she said.

“It’s very clear that the Tories are trying to placate the DUP. From what I hear, they have failed in that effort and I understand that the DUP have rejected their overtures.
Today, DUP MP Gregory Campbell attacked Sinn Féin’s policy of abstentionism with Westminster.
“Sinn Fein appears to revel in its own irrelevance,” he said.
Speaking to Sky News earlier, the Sinn Féin leader said when asked whether her MPs would take their seats: “I’m an Irishwoman, I have no business in Westminster.”
“Sinn Fein MPs have never taken their seats at Westminster, in fact, the first woman elected to the House of Commons was [Sinn Féin member] Countess Markievicz, who was in jail at the time.
She also acknowledged that although there were problems with the European Union, “Brexit was never the answer” to those problems.
“If the question was there is a need for a radical change in direction of the European project, then I say absolutely, but Brexit, and a Tory Brexit at that, was never the answer.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-lied-court-4659171-May2019/,"
BORIS JOHNSON, THE frontrunner to become Britain’s next prime minister, must attend court over allegations that he knowingly lied during campaigning for the Brexit referendum, a judge announced today.
Johnson, the former foreign secretary, will be summoned to appear before a London court to face allegations of misconduct in public office, judge Margot Coleman said in a written decision without specifying the date.
The private prosecution is being brought over the 2016 claim that Britain sends £350 million (€400 million) a week to the European Union.
The decision follows a hearing last week at Westminster Magistrates Court in London, during which lawyers for businessman Marcus Ball, who crowdfunded the bid, lodged an application to summon Johnson.
“The allegations which have been made are unproven accusations and I do not make any findings of fact,” Coleman said.

“Having considered all the relevant factors I am satisfied that this is a proper case to issue the summons as requested for the three offences as drafted.
“This means the proposed defendant will be required to attend this court for a preliminary hearing, and the case will then be sent to the crown court for trial. The charges can only be dealt with in the crown court.”
Johnson, a former London mayor, is running to replace Theresa May as leader of the governing Conservative Party, and therefore prime minister.
Johnson was not present at last week’s hearing, but his lawyer Adrian Darbishire said the pro-Brexit figurehead staunchly denied acting in an improper or dishonest manner.

PRIME MINISTER Theresa May’s chief Brexit adviser has been overheard saying that he expects a Brexit delay is likely and that the backstop is “a bridge” to a long-term trading relationship with the EU.
ITV correspondent Angus Walker has reported that he overheard Oliver Robbins in a hotel bar in Brussels saying that he expects MPs to have a choice between either backing May’s withdrawal deal or to extend talks with the EU.
May has consistently ruled out extending the UK’s departure date of 29 March.
Following Walker’s report a government spokesperson is quoted saying: “We don’t propose to comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation.”
Robbins was apparently overheard last night saying that he expects MPs to be presented with either backing a reworked Brexit deal in March or backing a potentially significant delay to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
According to ITV’s Walker, Robbins was heard to have said: “The issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension. In the end they will probably just give us an extension.”
During the conversation Robbins was also overheard to have said that the backstop – which would keep the UK in the customs union – was designed not as a “safety net” for the island of Ireland but as “a bridge” to the long-term trading relationship. May has consistently denied this, however.
“The big clash all along is the ‘safety net’,” Walker has reported Robbins as saying. “We agreed a bridge but it came out as a ‘safety net’.”

Prominent backbench MP Andrea Jenkyns hassaidthat if Robbins’ comments were true then May should “stop ignoring the wishes of the Brit(ish) people” and pursue theMatlhouse Compromise.
Conservative MP Steve Baker, however, has thrown cold water over Walker’s report saying that “as a consummate civil servant, Olly Robbins is likely to be appalled by this story.”
“Officials advise. Ministers decide. What matters ultimately is the policy of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,” Baker tweeted. “If the PM decides we are leaving on 29 March, deal or no deal, that will happen.”

John Longworth, Chairman of the Leave Means Leave campaign remarked that “if it is true that Britain’s chief negotiator was carelessly briefing in a bar on the UK position in the Brexit negotiations, it clearly demonstrates the casual overreach of Olly Robbins.”
“It is not for a civil servant to be speculating publicly on any matter, let alone one of such national importance and it is not for a civil servant to be formulating policy publicly.”
Following further talks in Brussels and a trip to Dublin last Friday, May today said that legally binding changes need to be made to the backstop, listing three different options she suggested to the EU.
In a statement to theHouse of Commons, the Prime Minister said that the EU have been told that alternative arrangements could be given to the current backstop, which proposes certain regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland in order to avoid a hard border.
The other two options the EU were told was a legally binding time limit, or legally binding unilateral exit, both of which have been opposed by the EU and Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-monday-house-of-commons-vote-4560848-Mar2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted to hold a series of Brexit votes on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Theresa May said that her Brexit deal doesn’t currently have enough support to pass through parliament.
Earlier today, May said that she was skeptical of indicative votes strategy, as it could lead to “contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all”.
Tonight, MPs voted in favour of taking control of parliamentary time on Wednesday to vote on the Brexit options in a series of indicative votes in what isn’t a legally binding vote, in what was dubbed the Letwin amendment.
Ina majority of 27, 329 MPs voted in favour of the amendment, and 302 voted against. Later on, when the vote was held again once other amendments were voted down, the amendment was passed by the exact same majority: 327 MPs in favour and 300 against.
Business minister Richard Harrington and Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt were among those who voted for the amendment in defiance of May – Harrington then announced his resignation.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, he said that he feared the “widespread and longstanding” ramifications of a no-deal Brexit, and said that he was resigning to stop this from happening.

Reports earlier today in the British media had indicated that May would put her deal forward for a vote tomorrow, but as tensions flare between her and the DUP, the party supporting her Tory government, May said that the vote would not be held until later in the week.
Hardline Brexiteers had indicated that they would vote for May’s deal if the DUP were happy with it; but the DUP have thus far only called for changes to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, which May flatly ruled out in parliament today.
If May’s deal is not passed by the House of Commons this week, the extension offered by the European Union last week indicates that the UK parliament must offer a new way forward, or else it would leave the EU without a deal on 12 April.
If May’s deal passes, the UK would leave the EU on 22 May.
Tonight’s vote
As part of a condition for the second rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement, May said that she would place a “neutral” motion down in order that MPs could propose amendments and indicate a way forward for the government. The results of these votes are not legally binding but simply a statement of intent.
House Speaker John Bercow selected amendments (d), (a) and (f):
Amendment (d) wasn’t moved, which doesn’t really matter as it was a weaker version of amendment (a), and could have split the vote of those who want parliament to take back control.
Amendment (f) was rejected by a narrow majority of 311 for to 314 against.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-it-is-a-paradox-to-say-that-a-second-brexit-referendum-would-be-undemocratic-4426560-Jan2019/,"AS THE DEADLINE for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union approaches, there are increasing calls for a second referendum on the question of Brexit.
In light of this, and given the fact that the Irish public is regularly asked to vote on constitutional matters, it is worth exploring whether a referendum should ever be re-run and if so, by what criteria do we decide when second votes are justified?
The idea that the public should be entrusted to make major decisions stems from the French Revolution. Supporters believed that if the people were consulted on an issue in the form of a referendum, then the ‘general will’ of the nation would manifest itself, the majority of people would naturally choose what was best for the public, and as such, the ‘right’ decision would always be made.
This largely represents the argument of those who insist that a second Brexit referendum cannot be held. The people have spoken, they say, and there can be no going back, come what may.
This is also the position of the British prime minister herself. May has claimed that a second vote “would break faith with the British people” because it will send a message that “our democracy does not deliver.”
When we vote to form a government in a general election, we do so on the understanding that we can evaluate its performance, usually over a few years. The electorate will then be consulted again and is free to change its mind. On principle, how is that any different to holding a second Brexit vote?
In 2015, May’s Conservative Party was given a mandate by the British public to govern for five years. Yet May called an early general election in 2017 solely because she believed that her premiership and her party stood to gain enormously from it.
When we think of May’s decision to call that snap  election in the U.K. the hypocrisy of her concern not to “break faith with the British people” is laid bare
May thought she saw an open goal, but in the end, scored an own goal, and in the process tightened the political garrote she finds herself trapped within today.
Why is the idea, of giving the voting public a chance to change its mind, so problematic?
Frankly, there are probably very few people who oppose second referendums on principle. Rather than being a point of principle, it seems that most people think a second referendum is a good idea when their side lost the initial vote and a bad idea when the opposite is true.
The U.K. voted to remain in the E.U. in 1975. By having a vote on the question again in 2016, was this not “breaking faith” with the British public who already decided the question?
Of course, you could argue that was different because of the amount of time that passed between the two votes. Fair enough. But how much time has to go by before it is reasonable to ask for a second vote? Five years? Ten?

Irish Referendum Reruns
In Ireland, of course, we have a history of running second referendums.
The most famous examples were the referendums in the previous decade on the treaties of Nice and Lisbon respectively.
Those who take issue with Ireland’s membership of the E.U. grumble that the will of the people was ignored when the Irish electorate declined to ratify both the first time around. But that view is difficult to square with the fact that in each second referendum, voter turnout was substantially higher and the margin of victory much wider than in the initial votes.
The same thing could well happen if the Brexit referendum were re-run, additionally, the electorate has a lot more information now on what Brexit really means.
Another interesting example, in terms of understanding when a second vote should be held, can be seen on Ireland’s two referendums on divorce.
In 1986, 63.5% of Irish voters decided to maintain Ireland’s constitutional ban on divorce. Despite this convincing margin of victory, the question was put to the Irish electorate again in 1995. This time, the ban on divorce was lifted, but the winning margin was only nine thousand votes or half a per cent of the overall turnout.
By way of comparison, the first attempts to ratify both Nice and Lisbon were both defeated by a winning margin of over 7% of those who voted. From an abstract point of view, is there some principle by which we can say that the Nice and Lisbon reruns were justified, but holding another vote in the wake of the razor-thin decision on divorce in 1995 was not?
In some ways, the best comparison between the Brexit vote and Irish referendums is the vote on the Eighth Amendment in 1983. These were very different issues obviously, but the problem in both cases was that an unsophisticated ‘yes or no’ choice was presented on questions of extraordinary complexity.
After the Eighth Amendment was introduced in 1983, the Irish electorate had to be consulted four more times for clarification on what they believed should or should not be permissible under the abortion ban.
Up until this point, the effort to achieve Brexit for the U.K. has proven impossible as there is no consensus on what it should actually entail. Offering voters a simple choice on intricate issues can have disastrous consequences.
When it comes to holding second referendums, it is evident that there are times when that can be justified. But the scenario in which this is true is more ‘know it when you see it’ rather than any clear set of criteria.
Based on what has happened in the United Kingdom since the Brexit vote, it seems that this is ‘it’.

The sides had been talking at length since early April in a bid to break the Brexit impasse but today Corbyn pulled the plug on the negotiations.
In a letter to May, the Labour leader said the talks had “gone as far as they can” and that he had no confidence in the government securing any deal the two sides might have struck because of the erosion of the May’s authority.
Corbyn has said “we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us” and that the “increasing weakness and instability” of the government made striking a lasting agreement impossible.

Sky Newsreportsthat Downing Street has confirmed that no further talks are planned with a spokesperson saying they were “absolutely in the national interest”.
The breakdown in talks comes after May agreed yesterday to set out a timetable for her resignation as Tory leader next month.
May has agreed with her party’s backbench 1922 Committee that she will make clear her intentions after her Brexit Withdrawal Agreement again goes before the House of Commons in the first week of June.
The chairperson of the 1922 Committee Graham Brady has said May will discuss her resignation plans whether or not the Withdrawal Agreement passes parliament.
A statement from Brady said that May is seeking the UK’s exit from the EU in the coming months:
MPs have voted againstMay’s Withdrawal Agreement on three occasions.
May’s confirmation of her intention to step down had been widely expected and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson had earlier told the BBC’s Huw Edwards that he will contest a leadership contest.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he is not ruling out a general election, but said it is “not a prospect in the next couple of days or weeks”.
“I can’t rule it out,” he told RTÉ’s Six One News, adding that if it was about maximising the prospect for Fine Gael “we would have gone to the country a year ago in the aftermath of the referendum when were on 35 per cent in the polls”.
Varadkar added: “I don’t intend to be calling into Aras an Uachtarain in the next couple of days… I can’t rule it out. First of all it is not necessarily my decision. Others could pull the plug on the government.”
After the interview, the Taoiseach told reporters at the RDS that the results today don’t change the fact that his decision on a general election will be based on what’s best for the country, rather than what is best for his own party.
His comments follow on from he previous comments today where he said the prospect of a general election “has to be considered in the next couple of weeks”.

When asked by RTÉ Radios 1′sThis Weekprogramme, whether he would rather hold a number of Dáil by-elections this November or go to the country, Varadkar said it was “a judgment to be made at a later date”.
“The instability across the water in relation to Brexit, we have to bear that in mind as well and also whether we can get the votes to get the budget through.
“That’s something that has to be considered in the next couple of weeks but obviously, those by-elections have to be held by the end of November.”
Táiniste Simon Coveney too did not rule out a general election in the coming months.
Speaking to RTÉ this morning, Coveney said: “I don’t think people are thinking general election today. I think at the moment let’s wait and see how these local and European elections work out in the next few days.”

“We’re going to have a very challenging summer and early autumn in the context of Brexit as well and in many ways those Brexit challenges may well shape the Budget in October. So those are big things for the government to manage in the coming months,” he said.
However, he said that the prospect of a general election was down to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and whether the confidence and supply arrangement that’s been in place since the 2016 general election continued. In December, Martincommitted to maintainingthe agreement until 2020 due to the uncertainty caused by Brexit.
Green wave
The results of the local and European elections, he said, had been somewhat disappointing but he promised a shift in the government’s approach to climate change and the environment. “I think you will see in the next few weeks… a very significant climate policy coming from the government,” he said.
“A number of weeks ago, certainly a number of months ago, we would have been hoping to have made bigger gains than we have made. But I don’t think anyone anticipated just the scale of the increase in the vote for the Green Party, particularly in Dublin.”
Climate issues proved adominant issuein the election campaign, with Fine Gael European election candidates forced to defend claims that there was a tension between the government’s policies on climate and farming.
“I think we can reduce our carbon footprint while also producing food more sustainably and every dairy farmer in the country has signed up to a sustainability programme on a voluntary basis”, he said.
“We don’t need to wipe out farming to be pro the green agenda.”
Varadkar told RTÉ that he doesn’t see the green wave in the local election results as a protest vote, but rather “a message from the public to us in government that they want us to do more, more quickly”.
“I see it as a signal of a very big change in opinion on environmental issues and climate issues,” Varadkar said.
Labour leader, Brendan Howlin, speaking to RTÉ this morning, admitted that his party had been “eclipsed by the green wave” in the local and European elections.
Howlin said that the elections are for people to give a signal, and that the signal this time is “take the climate change agenda seriously, enough of the talk about action, we need to see action – and I think all the political parties will take that call and will act.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-no-confidence-vote-4442451-Jan2019/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will today face a confidence vote after MPs overwhelmingly rejected her deal to leave the European Union, leaving Britain with no set plan as it hurtles towards Brexit on 29 March.
May suffered the largest government defeat in modern British history last night when the House of Commons rejected by432 votes to 202the draft Withdrawal Agreement she struck with Brussels late last year.
The EU immediately warned that the vote raises the risk of a hugely disruptive ‘no deal’ Brexit where Britain could sever ties with its biggest trading partner overnight.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged London to “clarify its intentions as soon as possible”, warning: “Time is almost up.”
Ireland has said it will now intensify preparations for a “disorderly Brexit”.
May struck a conciliatory tone after the vote, promising cross-party talks to try to salvage a workable Brexit deal before returning with a new plan next Monday.
She expects to win the confidence vote scheduled to take place around 7pm today. It was tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to force a general election.
While her own Conservative MPs and her allies in Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have led the charge against her Brexit deal, they do not want a Labour government.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
However, it would seem as though May’s future as Tory leader is untenable.
Britain’s newspapers are withering at thescale of her defeat, a damning verdict on 18 months of negotiations with the EU.
The Sun said May was “crushed”, while the Daily Mail said her power was left “hanging by a thread”, and one commentator in The Times described her as a “zombie prime minister”.
Fundamental change
Most lawmakers — including May — opposed Brexit ahead of the 2016 referendum, which has caused bitter divisions across Britain.
Nearly three years later, they still cannot decide what to do – with MPs criticising May’s deal both for keeping Britain too closely tied to the EU, and for not keeping it closer.

Former foreign minister and leading Brexit supporter Boris Johnson said the vote gave May a “massive mandate” to renegotiate her deal with the EU.
DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party props up May’s minority government in the Commons, also called for “fundamental change” to the Brexit deal.
“We will give the government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal,” she said.
But, speaking ahead of yesterday’s vote, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas ruled out any substantial changes to the withdrawal agreement — a message reinforced by Juncker.
“It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union,” Juncker said.
After the defeat, French President Emmanuel Macron said “the pressure” was mainly on Britain to find a solution.
High-stakes poker
Increasing numbers of pro-European MPs are calling for a second referendum as the way out of the deadlock, with an option to cancel Brexit altogether.
EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted after the vote:
Speculation is also growing on both sides of the Channel that May could ask to delay Brexit, although she denies this.
This morning the pound edged down, but mostly held its ground as investors considered the next likely developments in the long-running saga.
Sterling has tanked to a near two-year low soon after the expected defeat but it rebounded back against both the dollar and euro on hopes that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided.
While it was slightly lower in Asia, the pound managed to avoid the sort of pummelling many had predicted and analysts say the positive news is that the options for the future are narrowing.
British businesses urged politicians to unite.
“Financial stability must not be jeopardised in a game of high-stakes political poker,” warned Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, the body governing the British capital’s massive financial district.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-opposition-leaders-4448183-Jan2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR is to meet opposition party leaders next week to brief them on contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.
It is understood the meeting is taking place due the scenario of a no-deal Brexit becoming more of a possibility in recent days.
The meeting will take place on Tuesday – a day after UK Prime Minister Theresa May is due to present her plans to the House of Commons on what is next for Brexit.
The Taoiseach is also due to brief party leaders on the omnibus “mega” Brexit Bill.
There are 17 areas where legislation change will be needed across multiple government departments in a no-deal scenario.
The heads of the Brexit Bill will be finalised and published next week.
This week, Varadkar said a disorderly Brexit at the end of March can be avoided, with the extension of Article 50 – but that can only be done when a request is made by the UK government.

He added that work on Ireland’ contingency plans will continue, adding “these are no longer contingency plans, they are being implemented by government”.
Fianna Fail’s Micheál Martin criticised the Taoiseach and government for their lack of preparedness for Brexit as the end date of 29 March approaches.
A government source said it is not unprecedented for the Taoiseach to invite party leaders to a briefing about such important matters stating that similar meetings were held in relation to the IBRC.
The meeting will take place after Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk by telephone yesterday to discuss where to go next on Brexit.
May also spoke separately with the head of the EU executive, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, at her request.
May had previously been in touch with Brussels only by text message since Tuesday, the day that the British parliament rejected the Brexit deal she signed in November, that lays out the conditions for leaving the European Union.
The deal was defeated by a historic 432 votes to 202: in the last record for a UK government defeat was in 1924, when the Labour government lost by 166 votes.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is holding crisis talks today at Chequers with Conservative colleagues amid reports from the British press that she is facing a “cabinet coup”, as ministers move to force her to resign.
“The prime minister is speaking to her colleagues this weekend,” a Downing Street spokesperson said, declining to confirm reports she would hold an afternoon summit with leading Brexiteer MPs outside government.
The talks comes as two newspapers have reported that a number of ministers have said they could back May’s Brexit deal if the PM is not in charge for the next round of EU negotiations.
Chancellor Philip Hammondtold Sky Newsthis morning, however, that the idea of ousting May is “self-indulgent” and that parliament “has to come together” to make a decision on Brexit.
The Sunday Times has reported that May is “at the mercy of a full-blown cabinet coup”, with plans afoot for her de facto deputy David Lidington to take over in a caretaker capacity.
The Times has said that it had spoken to 11 senior ministers who “confirmed that they wanted the Prime Minister to make way for someone else” and planned to confront May at a cabinet meeting tomorrow.
The Mail on Sunday has reported that May could be ousted “within days” and that Environment Secretary Michael Gove – a prominent Brexiteer – could take over as interim leader.

‘Put it to the people’
Meanwhile, May has said a third vote on her Brexit deal may not happen next week if there is insufficient support to approve it.

It was agreed on Thursday that date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if the deal was passed.
However, if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
In a letter to MPs on Friday evening, May said she would only bring her withdrawal agreement before the House of Commons if there was sufficient support for it.
May laid out four “clear choices” facing Parliament:
“If it appears that there is sufficient support and the speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week and if it is approved we can leave on May 22,” May wrote to MPs.
But she said if there was not sufficient support or the house rejected it, Britain could ask for another extension and take part in the European Parliament elections, adding: “I strongly believe that… would be wrong”.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Friday at the close of the EU summit, EU Council President Donald Tusk said: “Until April 12, anything is possible.
The latest political maneuvers follow yesterday’s ‘Put It To The People’marchwhich saw a million people protest in London demanding a second referendum.
May has repeatedly ruled out holding another referendum on the issue, claiming it would be divisive and renege on promises to honour the 2016 result.
Meanwhile, more than four million people have signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched on Friday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-driving-insurance-green-card-4444105-Jan2019/,"IRISH MOTORISTS HAVE been advised that they will require an insurance ‘Green Card’ to travel to Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has sent out hundreds of thousands of application forms to insurers and brokers across the country ahead of the UK’s departure from the European Union on 29 March.
The industry has reportedly been preparing for a no-deal scenario for months, but the MIBI has warned motorists about the potential requirement for a Green Card to travel to the UK in a bid to address confusion over what form Brexit will take.
The card is an international insurance document which shows proof that a motorist has the minimum level of car insurance required by a country they are visiting.
Currently, Irish-registered vehicles that travel within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU Motor Insurance Directive.
However, a no-deal Brexit would see the UK withdraw from this directive, meaning Irish motorists will require a Green Card to travel there.
WhileMIBI guidelinesstate that there is no charge to obtain a Green Card, some insurers say that fees may apply when customers order them.

‘Possible implications’
“We had hoped to avoid the need for Green Cards,” said David Fitzgerald, chief executive of the MIBI.
“However, as there continues to be uncertainty as to what the final outcome of the Brexit process will be, we want to raise awareness about the possible implications from a motor insurance perspective.”
As a precaution, over 400,000 Green Card forms, along with electronic templates, are expected to be sent to motor insurance companies and brokers by the end of the week.
The MIBI has advised any motorists who plan on driving an Irish-registered vehicle to Northern Ireland or the rest of the UK after 29 March to contact their insurer or broker a month before their expected travel date to ensure they receive their Green Card in time.
However, Green Cards will not be required if an agreement is reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit, or if a transitional arrangement is implemented.
“If there are no further developments and a hard Brexit is still a possibility, then insurance companies and insurance brokers will begin issuing Green Cards to affected policyholders in March,” Fitzgerald added.
“At that point anyone who is planning on driving their motor vehicle in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the UK is advised to contact their insurer or broker one month in advance of their expected travel date.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has suffered another humiliating Brexit defeat at the hands of her own eurosceptic MPs this evening, with just weeks to go until Britain officially leaves the EU.
In the symbolic vote, MPs voted 303 to 258 against a government motion endorsing its next moves in trying to secure a new withdrawal deal with the European Union.
The motion being put forward by Prime Minister Theresa May was as follows:
This would have caused a problem for some hardline Brexiteers: it meant that they must vote for both the Brady and Spelman amendments, or vote for neither.
Many in the ERG, or a group of hardline Brexiteers, aren’t in favour of the Spelman amendment, as they see a no-deal Brexit as a viable and realistic option.
On Tuesday, Mayannounced to the House of Commonsthat she had suggested three options to the EU on how to get the changes to the backstop needed to secure MPs’ approval (those are an alternative backstop, a time limit to the backstop, or a unilateral exit from the backstop).

With no update to the current Withdrawal Agreement on offer, she announced that if this remained the case by 26 February, another statement would be given to the House and a another motion would be tabled on 27 February.
MPs voted on this and more amendments this evening.The similar debateon 29 January was on a motion which asked lawmakers to agree that they had considered May’s latest statement on the Brexit negotiations.
Seven proposed amendments to this were made, andtwo were passed:the Brady amendment, which said that the backstop should be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements” (passed by 317 votes to 301);and the Spelman amendment,which rejected a no-deal Brexit (passed by 318 votes to 310).
It’s been argued is an impossible assurance to give without a House majority for a deal.
What was being voted on today?
There were also other amendments to the motion today (so, amendments to the already-amended motion).
Among the things that the amendments were:

https://www.the42.ie/the-open-portrush-brexit-4514572-Feb2019/,"
THIS YEAR’S OPEN Championship at the Northern Irish golf course Royal Portrush is causing “significant concern” due to Brexit, said Martin Slumbers, chief executive of organisers the R&A.
Portrush – which last hosted the Open in 1951 – was awarded the honour in October 2015 before the 2016 referendum in which Britons voted to leave the European Union.
The uncertainty surrounding Brexit – and in particular the backstop – is causing headaches for golf’s governing body ahead of the tournament which runs from 18-21 July.
“Like every business, and I think about the Open as such, the lack of certainty about the rules, the law in which we are operating under post-29 March has caused us significant concern,” Slumbers told a press conference on Tuesday.
“In hindsight, would I be wanting to do Portrush in the year that we would be potentially leaving the European Union without a deal? No.
“We, as a management team, have spent a lot of time looking at contingencies and what we need to do.
“The future of the border is the number one concern.

“We have over 2,000 containers to get across the Irish Sea and we start building on April 2.”
Slumbers, who said the tournament is a sell out with 70 percent of the spectators from Ireland, said that contact with ministers had not resolved the logistical conundrum of which port to use to bring in the containers, some from as far afield as the Middle East.
R&A CEO Martin Slumbers.David DaviesDavid Davies
“We have engagement with ministers and Parliament but the concern is all around certainty,” he said.
“If you know the rules you’re playing by then you can play, you optimise what you’ve got.
“The problem is we don’t know whether to reschedule to bring all our containers in through Dublin, whether to move them through Belfast, whether to ship them out of the UK now.”
Slumbers, though, said the spectators will not notice and the show will go on regardless.
“It doesn’t threaten the staging, we will make it happen,” said Slumbers.
“It’s just more complex than we anticipated.

“For the insiders it’s a bit harder but for everyone outside it won’t impact at all, they won’t notice.”
Brexit is not the only headache for Slumbers. Portrush management have had to build two new holes because the tented village for the tournament has supplanted the two closing holes.
“Someone said to me when I was out for the Latin American amateur championship ‘You must be looking forward to Portrush’ and I said well actually I’ll be quite pleased when it’s over,” said Slumbers.

MPS HAVE VOTED, once again, to rejected the Brexit deal, despite last-minute measures announced last night by Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker.
Although the loss was significantly less than the first Meaningful Vote (a 149-vote loss, as opposed to 230), it’s still being described as a “thumping” defeat.
After advice from attorney general Geoffrey Cox was published this morning, it significantly reduced the chances of May’s deal being passed in the House of Commons.

PRIME MINISTER THERESA May has said that she still intends to ask for an extension until 30 June today, despite suggestions of a ‘flexible’ year-long extension.
“We could have actually been outside the European Union by now,” she told the House of Commons this afternoon.
When asked by the SNP’s Ian Blackford, who said May was in her “final days as Prime Minister”, whether a second referendum had been discussed with Labour, she replied:
“My position on a second referendum has not changed, the House has rejected a second referendum two times. When we come to a deal there may be those who push that issue, but my position on this has not changed.
The Prime Minister answered questions from MPs since noon, and will then fly to Brussels later to formally request an extension by addressing EU leaders at 5pm.
“I believe a Conservative government will make a success of any situation,” she told the House of Commons today when asked about the UK leaving the EU without a deal.
May also responding to questions by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn about the 21st anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, calling it “an important moment in Northern Irish history”.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is in Brussels today for a special meeting of the European Council, where EU leaders will decide whether to grant Theresa May another delay to the Brexit date (aka an extension to Article 50).
As it currently stands, the UK is due to leave the EU this coming Friday and still hasn’t ratified a withdrawal agreement in parliament.
A no-deal is the default position in this case, but the Prime Minister is seeking a further extension to Article 50 until 30 June in order to give herself more time to win over her opponents in the House of Commons.
Following on from his recent talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Varadkar will attend meetings with European counterparts from 2pm Irish time today.
House of CommonsHouse of Commons
Prime Minister May also spoke with her French and German counterparts in a bid to convince them to back her extending Brexit again, after the initial leaving date of 29 March was postponed.
The formal meeting of the European Council will get under way at 5pm Irish time but the indications are that leaders will back granting the UK a further extension.
‘Wouldn’t be forgiven’

Last weekend, the Taoiseach said he was confident that EU leaders would ratify an extension to Brexit.
He said that any country that vetoes it “wouldn’t be forgiven”, considering the risk of a no-deal to the economies of Ireland and the UK’s other close neighbours.
However, Varadkar also said that Ireland didn’t want to grant an extension that “just allows for more indecision”.
This has been echoed by other EU leaders who are seen to prefer a longer extension to Brexit for the time being.
“From Ireland’s perspective, we are open to extending the deadline to allow time for these discussions to run their course and come to a conclusion,” he told the Dáil yesterday.
The Fine Gael leader added that Ireland’s European colleagues “fully understand the challenge here” and stood with Ireland in this regard.
“The EU is a home that we have helped to build and whatever happens we will stay at its heart,” he said.
May-Corbyn talks to approve a deal
With the extension the UK has asked for, Prime Minister May has pinned her hopes on reaching a compromise with the Labour Party to finally find a way of getting her Withdrawal Agreement through parliament.
There’s been little progress here so far, as hardline Tories have expressed outrage at May reaching out to the opposition in what they fear could result in a softer Brexit.
Both the Conservatives and Labour acknowledged they wouldn’t reach an agreement ahead of today’s EU summit yesterday evening.
“We have had further productive and wide-ranging talks this afternoon, and the parties have agreed to meet again on Thursday once European Council has concluded,” a spokesman for the UK government said.
DPA / PA ImagesDPA / PA Images / PA Images
May has also been speaking to fellow EU leaders, asking Macron and Merkel yesterday to back her planned extension to 30 June.
Both leaders are said to be open to a longer extension than this, which would give more clarity and remove uncertainty with May still unable to secure a consensus at home.
In a letter to leaders ahead of tomorrow’s meeting, EU Council President Donald Tusk urged them to back the extension, but not the one Theresa May wants.
“However, our experience so far, as well as the deep divisions within the House of Commons, give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of June,” he said. “In reality, granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates.
This longer extension will allow the UK to leave “whenever it is ready”, he said. It is not clear at this stage how palatable this would prove to May’s government.
We still don’t know when Brexit will be happening, but today could fix a new departure date for the UK to finally leave the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-eastenders-4559197-Apr2019/,"Rehearsal shot of hostile locals witnessing May's arrival.
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is set to make a stunning appearance on Eastenders tonight, as she makes a last-ditch attempt to save her Brexit deal.
The beleaguered Prime Minister has faced a string of crushing blows, and will hope that she receives a better reception from the patrons of the Queen Vic – and the general public – on tonight’s special live edition of the soap opera.
Number 10 sources have indicated that May will win over the pub goers in the Vic – as well as the entire nation – with a passionate speech in unfamiliar surroundings.
However, and in a move that’s likely to enrage the British government further, this news has emerged because the Irish government has opted to give notice of May’s appearance in advance.
But – unlike previous instances where the Irish side has given the game away for May’s government when it comes to Brexit announcements – Varadkar was actually required to do so.
As part of the most recent Anglo-Irish Agreement in 2003, the head of government in each country must give advance notice to their counterpart across the Irish Sea if they are to make an appearance on a primetime soap opera.
Script
A BBC source has revealed a draft script of tonight’s episode to theTheJournal.ielast night.
The source was bleary-eyed through a chronic lack of sleep, and explained that the script had undergone a number of rewrites.
“This is the 416th draft,” the source said. “And her appearance was only confirmed at the start of March. Brexit won’t stop f*****g, c*****g changing every two seconds. It’s driving the actors mad.”
In a video supplied by the source, it shows actor Adam Woodyatt – who plays stalwart Ian Beale – reacting to the latest news the script was being rewritten, and expressing concerns about how other actors would take it.

via GIPHY
Here are some excerpts from tonight’s script – although we do remind you it’s contingent on what the hell happens in Brexit over the course of today:

After the initial bad reception May gets at the pub, she sits plotting her next move when she gets some advice from an unlikely source.

It is understood that it is this next bit that required the most rewriting, as Number 10 demanded meticulous control over what May says here and the reaction in the pub.
TheJournal.ieextends its apologies for the incomplete nature of this extract.


There is then to be spontaneous cheering, with the famous “dun dun dun” music swiftly following.
Reaction
At this critical juncture in the future of Britain, critics of the Prime Minister are baffled as to why she is going on a soap opera at this stage.
While being very critical of the Prime Minister for example, Jeremy Corbyn tried to set up a last minute rebuttal on tonight’s Coronation Street but locals there are still in mourning over the knicker factory tragedy last month.
One supporter of May however, is Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Citizenship Peter Mannion.
While profusely sweating, the man who absolutely doesn’t want to replace her as Prime Minister toldTheJournal.ie: “In criticising all of us the other week, the Prime Minister was sending a clear message that parliamentarians aren’t to be trusted. And she was… eh… completely right. I think she’ll really connect with the people this evening.”
It’s understood that high-level talks will take place throughout the day between Fine Gael and RTÉ to try get Leo Varadkar on the next edition of Fair City.
“Leo sees this happening across the water, and sees it as such a good PR opportunity,” a government source said. “He’s absolutely raging he didn’t think of it first.”
So, with May sipping a gin in the Queen Vic tonight, don’t be surprised to see Leo slurping down a pint of blackstuff in McCoy’s pub within the next week.
Tonight, we’ll be liveblogging Theresa May’s appearance on Eastenders. Join us here on the site or get involved with the hashtags #Brextenders #TJMay and #Whatthefuckisgoingon.

ATTEMPTS BY MPs to remove the British government’s control over the Brexit process have been described as “extremely concerning” by a Downing Street spokesperson.
Several backbench MPs plan to table amendments in an attempt to take control of the business of Parliament in order to frustrate British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The move comes after May’s Brexit deal was defeated in the House of Commonsearlier this week.
Two groups of MPs are planning to table amendments next week which would further frustrate the Brexit process, the Sunday Times has reported.
One group – including Labour’s Yvette Cooper and former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan – is attempting to block a no-deal Brexit while another group – led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve – aims to suspend the UK’s withdrawal process altogether.
A Downing Street spokesperson, however, has said that “any attempt to remove the government’s power to meet the legal conditions of an orderly exit at this moment of historic significance is extremely concerning.”
“This news should serve as a reminder to those MPs who want to deliver Brexit that they need to vote for it – otherwise there is a danger that parliament could stop Brexit.”

Article 50 – the legal means by which the UK can leave the EU – was invoked by MPs in March 2017. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year.
Speaking to Sky Newsthis morning, Tory MP Morgan defended the move saying that “many people…are desperate for their politicians in government to talk about other issues” than Brexit.
Nicky Morgan MPPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Asked if attempts to wrestle control from the government amounted to a coup by MPs, Morgan described the various attempts to take control over the Brexit process as “unprecedented”.
Following her defeat in the House of Commons, Prime Minister May must return to the House of Commons tomorrow and present her plans to MPs on what to do next.
Among her options are: further negotiations with the EU, which European Council president Donald Tusk and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have said previously cannot happen; requesting an extension to Article 50; call a second referendum, where it isn’t certain that the outcome would be different, or push for a no-deal Brexit, which would most likely lead to a border on the island of Ireland.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he is to meet opposition party leaders next week to brief them on contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.
Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has warned of a “political tsunami” if MPs fail to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.
Writing in today’s Sunday Telegraph, Fox slammed people calling for May to rule out a no-deal Brexit saying the “most stupid thing possible” in a negotiation is to “give away your strongest card”.

“Failure to deliver Brexit would produce a yawning gap between parliament and the people, a schism in our political system with unknowable consequences,” said Fox, a senior pro-Brexit cabinet minister.
“It is time for MPs to deliver on the promises they made. It is a matter of honour and a matter of duty.”
Earlier today, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab MP told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had not ruled out a backstop exit mechanism when they met.
Raab said that Coveney’s view differed with that of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar whom Raab described as “less moderate” than Coveney.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-inevitable-4496412-Feb2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that the UK isn’t doing itself any favours for its future aims of striking trade deals with other countries given the current impasse on Brexit.
After Theresa May’s latest defeat in the House of Commons yesterday after members of her own party turned on her again, the looming date for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March has been brought into sharper view.
With Ireland and the EU refusing to back down on the backstop, and May unable to secure backing for the withdrawal deal that includes it, the threat of a no-deal Brexit remains a pressing one.
Varadkar was speaking at Dublin Castle today ahead of a meeting of the All-Island Civil Dialogue on Brexit, and said that he doesn’t think a no-deal is “inevitable”.
“I think it’s within the power of the UK to either revoke Article 50 altogether, or to ask for an extension from the European Union,” he said.
Varadkar said that if there is an extension, there needs to be a purpose.
“I don’t think anyone would like to see this stalemate or impasse or period of political purgatory continue,” he said.
He said that the fact that the House of Commons hasn’t ratified the deal will be a problem for the British government.

“Part of the case for the United Kingdom would able to strike new trade deals with countries all over the world, but countries all over the world are looking at the United Kingdom and wondering is this a country that’s going to be able to make agreements, ratify them and then stick to them.”
Speaking at the event, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that the “urgency could not be greater and the stakes could not be higher” in ensuring Ireland was ready to cope with Brexit.
He also defended his party’s continued support for the confidence and supply agreement keeping the minority Fine Gael government in power, as the threat of Brexit meant stability was needed.
“My party is being criticised on a near daily basis for this decision,” he said. “Certainly the route of all-out opposition is easier.  But when you look at the scale of the Brexit threat I believe we are right to say that our country simply cannot afford the added risk of spending up to four months holding an election and forming a government.  It was the right decision and we stand by it.”
Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald took the opportunity of today’s meeting to repeat calls for discussions to be held around a referendum on Irish unity.
She said: “It is time to look beyond Brexit and beyond partition. If the border cannot be mitigated, it must be removed.
“The demand for Irish unity is growing. Ireland north and south is changing. Now is the time to look the future.”
With the pressure still on the UK, it is expected that Prime Minister May will return to the EU for talks within days.

DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster called for “continued neighbourliness” with Ireland post-Brexit today, as she spoke at an event in Leitrim with Minister for Transport Shane Ross.
The pair posed for the cameras in the same hall in Glenfarne used for the film Ballroom of Romance, starring Brenda Fricker.
Turning to Brexit, Foster said that the Irish government’s “mega Bill” to deal with a no-deal Brexit that was published today does not include any plans for infrastructure on the border with Northern Ireland.
“We don’t want to see any infrastructure on the border going forward,” she told RTÉ News.
Foster was there for the opening of a section of a new greenway linking Sligo, Leitrim and Fermanagh.
Minister Ross said the greenway project has “great potential”.

“If it were to be completed, it could have economic benefits for the many communities it encompasses and would enable people to walk and cycle on a segregated route from Sligo in the Republic to Enniskillen in Co. Fermanagh,” he said.
As Foster and Ross posed for the cameras, she told the Transport Minister that he was a “rascal”.
‘Lose, lose, lose’
The DUP leader reiterated her belief a deal could be struck between the UK and the EU to avoid a no-deal Brexit before the 29 March deadline.
“We want to see a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and one that works for our neighbours here in Ireland as well,” she told RTÉ. “We very much hope that can be the case but what we need to see is a willingness from everybody to get there.”
The DUP is vehemently opposed to the provision of a backstop within the UK’s withdrawal agreement, and Theresa May’s government is seeking to secure some form concession from the EU on the backstop.
Both the Irish government and the EU have stood firm on the backstop thus far, raising the possibility of neither sides agreeing and the UK leaving without a deal.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, in outlining the no-deal Brexit legislation today, said it was vital that a no-deal was avoided as it was a “lose, lose, lose” situation.

The body also believes itself to be ready for a no-deal Brexit as the upgrading of its Customs IT systems to handle the increased transaction levels is on track.
However, it is preparing for a massive increase in import and export declaration forms – from last year’s figure of 1.7 million to in the region of 20 million.
Revenue chairman Niall Cody will tell the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and An Taoiseach that the government has made it clear that its overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“Revenue is not planning for customs posts. The government has indicated that in the event of no deal, it will engage in intensive discussions with the EU Commission and our EU partners and Revenue will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process.”
He will say that current proposals and plans will see checks take place at “traders’ premises”.
“Revenue’s overarching approach is to carry out the required customs controls through a risk-based programme of post clearance checks and customs audits which, to the greatest extent possible, will take place at traders’ premises, away from the point of importation,” Cody will tell the committee in his opening statement.
Prepared for a no-deal Brexit
He will also outline that the Revenue Commissioners is prepared for a no-deal Brexit.
His comments come following an intense few days of talk surrounding the border in a no-deal scenario.
On Tuesday, a European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that it’s “pretty obvious” that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He clarified a day later that the Commission will “do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border”.
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed also repeatedly refused to directly answer a question onRTE’s Morning Irelandover whether there would be a return to border checks on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit yesterday.
Agovernment spokesperson also maintainedthat there are no preparations underway for a hard border. However, he added that contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit in areas such as health, education and transport is already getting underway.
Then on Wednesday, the European Union’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier said:
‘Significant challenges’
In his opening statement, Cody discusses customs issues in a no-deal scenario.
He states that if the UK leaves the EU Customs Union, it will become “a third country and the free circulation and movement of goods between EU Member States and the UK will end”.
If this occurs, it will “substantially increase” the proportion of Revenue customers who are required to deal with customs formalities and other related obligations, he adds.

Cody explains this will pose a significant challenge for many businesses which do not have any experience of third country trade and what it entails.
To give context, he outlines the numbers. At the moment, about 17,000 businesses trade with third countries. Last year, Revenue’s electronic systems processed 898,000 import declarations and 762,000 export declarations. About 5.6 million transport documents were declared in the eManifest system, related to this trade.
Annually, 39,000 transit declarations and 100,000 Safety and Security declarations are made through the Import Control System.
Businesses trading with the UK do not have to deal in any of the above. In 2017, about 84,000 businesses engaged in UK trade – more than half described as regular trader.
“Post Brexit, import and export declarations could increase to as many as20 million per annum,” Cody calculated.
Scaling up IT systems
He outlines that Revenue has invested in scaling up its Customs IT systems to handle the increased transaction levels.
Outlining the added pressures, he notes that Revenue systems were not originally designed to handle the number of customs transactions that can be expected post Brexit.
In Budget 2017, he said the Minister for Finance included provision for a €2 million investment in scaling up the customs IT framework and carry out significant work to increase systems capacity to cater for trade with the UK as a third country.
“All our IT preparations are currently on schedule. Based on the progress made to date, and the robustness of our testing programmes, we are confident that by the end of March 2019, our IT systems will handle the increased transaction levels in a no deal scenario,” states Cody.
Staffing levels
The committee will be told that the Revenue’s initial planning process was based on the assumption of the withdrawal agreement would be agreed and the Brexit transition period would last until the end of 2020.
At the time, Revenue determined that an additional 600 staff would be required.
In Budget 2017, funding provided for 40 additional Revenue staff to prepare for Brexit. In September 2018, the phased recruitment of additional staff was approved and an open recruitment campaign for Customs Officers to work on a 24/7 basis was rolled out.
More than 3,000 applications were received and successful candidates completed a five-week training programme before Christmas.
Cody will tell committee members that Revenue is on track to have enough staff in place come 29 March – the day the UK is due to leave the EU.
At risk groups
In addition to outlining the work that has gone on to engage with businesses impacted, Revenue has identified two key trader groupings that are expected to be “significantly impacted by Brexit”.
These are large economic operators who trade with the UK and logistics companies and freight forwarders.
Cody will tell politicians today that Revenue is “strongly focused on facilitating the efficient and timely movement of goods in compliance with customs controls, post Brexit”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jean-claude-juncker-michel-barnier-4438736-Jan2019/,"THE PRESIDENT OF the European Council Donald Tusk and the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker have published their “reassurance” letter to UK Prime Minister Theresa May.
On the eve of the vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, May is looking likely to lose the vote, with an audit by the Guardian predicting she will lose by423 votes to 216.
This letter from Juncker and Barnier was hoped to offer enough reassurance in order to get the deal over the line, particularly by offering clarification on the backstop.
The letter is in response to a letter from Theresa May to the two leaders,which has also been published this morning.
On the backstop,Juncker and Barnier saidthat if the backstop were to come into force that it would be a “suboptimal trading agreement for both sides”.
The letter also says that the Withdrawal Agreement and backstop “do not affect or supersede the provisions of the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement… in any way whatsoever”.
It also does not “extend regulatory alignment with European Union law in Northern Ireland beyond what is strictly necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland”.
In an effort to soothe Brexiteers’ concerns about the timeframe of the backstop, the EU leaders confirm that the backstop would be temporary:
“The European Council also said that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered (sic), it would only apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided.”
The letter UK Prime Minister Theresa May sent.UK governmentUK government
The BritishAttorney General Geoffrey Cox respondedto the publication of the letters by saying that the letters were useful in making a “political judgement” on the backstop.
Cox surmises that “the balance of risks favours the conclusion that it is unlikely that the EU will wish to rely on the implementation of the backstop provisions”.
DUP Deputy leader Nigel Doddsresponded to the lettersalso, by saying that rather than reassure the DUP, it “bolstered” their concerns because:

The letter adds that the EU cannot agree to anything that would “change” or would be “inconsistent” with the Withdrawal Agreement, but they could clarify their understanding of the existing agreement.
The letter goes on to ensure that if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed, that negotiations on trade and the future relationship will begin quickly:
“As regards the European Commission, we will set up the negotiating structure for these negotiations directly after signature to ensure that formal negotiations can start as soon as possible after the withdrawal agreement of the United Kingdom.”
“The European Commission also shares your intentions for the future relationship to be in place as quickly as possible. Given our joint commitment to using best endeavours to conclude before the end of 2020 a subsequent agreement, which supersedes the Protocol in whole or in part, the Commission is determined to give priority in our work programme to the discussion of proposals that might replace the backstop with alternative arrangements.”
Interestingly, the letter says that the backstop does not have to be the template for the future.
How likely is this to change MPs’ minds?
Sky NewsSky News
Speaking to reporters at a press conference at a factory in Stoke, Theresa May said that she had achieved assurances from some MPs that they would vote in favour of her deal despite having previous doubts about it.
“…Having heard MPs during the debate, we have achieved these letters which do give further confidence to members of Parliament and about both sides not wanting to use the backstop.”
She said that no one had come up with an alternative plan to her Brexit deal, reiterating previous comments that she made that her deal was “the only deal on the table”.
When asked whether Article 50 was extended until June, she said that “we are leaving on 29 March”. The letter from Juncker and Barnier offered assurances that the EU could ratify the deal in time for this date if it is approved tomorrow.
When asked whether her deal actually delivered the Brexit that people voted for on 29 March, she said that it did on the basis that it “took control” of immigration and their own money, delivered on an independent trade policy, and took them out of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy.
In her letter to Juncker and Barnier, May said that “discussions of the backstop has also exposed some misunderstandings about how it would work if it were ever to be used”.
“…Any checks needed for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be minimised, mainly carried out away from ports and airports, and performed by UK officials.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-papers-brexit-4442452-Jan2019/,"IT MAY HAVE been expected for Theresa May to suffer defeat in the House of Commons last night, but the scale of this defeat is driving the headlines in the UK this morning as the papers savage the prime minister.
In all, 432 MPs – including over 100 from her own party – voted against her Brexit deal to inflict a historic defeat on May with a majority of 230 securing the no vote.
It leaves Brexit in chaos, with warring factions in parliament now facing a race against time to either agree on the way forward or crash out without a deal.
Despite the House of Commons having no confidence in May’s deal, it is expected to have it in the Prime Minister herself as she’s on course to survive a vote of confidence in the government today.
With Britain hurtling forward into further uncertainty, the papers in the UK pulled no punches with their headlines this morning:
The Daily Telegraph leads with a glum-looking May with the simple headline “A complete humiliation”.

“While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy said in a statement.

The car giant announced in 2016 that it planned to build the model at its plant in Sunderland, but will now assemble it instead at Nissan’s global production hub in Kyushu, Japan.
“Other future models planned for Nissan Sunderland Plant – the next-generation Juke and Qashqai – are unaffected,” added the statement.
“A model like X-Trail is manufactured in multiple locations globally, and can therefore be re-evaluated based on changes to the business environment,” said Hideyuki Sakamoto, Nissan’s executive vice president for manufacturing and supply chain management.

MPs are poised to reject British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal.

On the eve of tomorrow’s monumental vote in parliament on her withdrawal agreement – forged from 18 months of gruelling negotiations with European leaders – May addressed factory workers in Stoke, a Brexit-backing city in central England.
The embattled leader, who is widely expected to lose the House of Commons vote by around 100 votes, made a final bid for support it by arguing: “We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.
“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,” May said.
“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote?” she will ask.
Theresa May needs the support of 320 MPs: the Tories have 315 elected members, and the support of 10 DUP MPs. But after over 100 MPs voted against her during the motion of confidence in December, it looks likely that her Brexit deal won’t pass next week.
If it doesn’t pass, the options are both endless and equally implausible: further negotiations; extending Article 50; a general election or a Tory leadership challenge; a second referendum or a no-deal Brexit have all been floated as possible scenarios.
Many MPs, including the DUP who are supporting Theresa May’s Tory government, oppose the Withdrawal Agreement because of the backstop, which proposes aligning Northern Ireland with the European Union rules if they cannot agree to a better plan in the next phase of negotiations (assuming we get that far).
The vote on May’s Brexit deal will take place at 7pm tomorrow.

BREXIT SHOULD BE delayed if the UK parliament doesn’t approve a deal in the next few days, three British cabinet ministers have warned.
Writing in theDaily Mail, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark said it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay Britain’s departure rather than crash out of the EU on 29 March with no deal.
The three ministers acknowledged British Prime Minister Theresa May’s “extraordinary determination and resilience” in working on a deal to leave the EU.
However, they said there “simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation” before 29 March.
They warned that there could be serious damage to the economy and national security in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“Our national security will be weakened. For example, co-operation with our EU allies depends upon the free flow of data between our authorities. Such co-operation will not be possible unless we reach agreement as to how this will work when we are outside the EU. No such agreement is in place,” they wrote.
The drafted Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected by the House of Commons, with most MPs opposing the deal over the backstop, which would provide for an EU-UK customs union if no other trade or customs agreement is struck that would avoid a border on the island of Ireland.
Because of this, with less than 40 days until the UK leaves the EU, a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely than ever.
The ministers’ warning comes ahead of next week’s crucial vote in the House of Commons. On Wednesday, MPs are expected to consider an amendment to give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and stop a no-deal scenario if there is no agreement made with the EU by the middle of March,the BBC reported.

“If we cannot achieve a parliamentary breakthrough in the next few days, the country will face a choice. We could crash out on March 29 or we could try to leave with a deal at a later date,” the trio wrote.
“Beyond the next few days, there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all necessary legislation before March 29,” they said.
Theresa May plans
May is to meet with EU leader Donald Tusk tomorrow ahead of a summit with Arab leaders, but a Brexit breakthrough should not be expected, according to officials.

Tusk did not meet May when she was in Brussels earlier the week for talks with EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, and officials here do not expect a breakthrough when he sees her tomorrow afternoon.
“There will be no deal in the desert in Sharm el-Sheikh, this is a summit between the EU and the Arab states,” an EU source told reporters in Brussels.
Another official said: “It’s an opportunity where everyone can talk, but don’t expect a deal there.”
On Friday, EU negotiator Michel Barnier told France’s Europe 1 radio it was time for May to take a decision and present a Brexit plan to her parliament.
“We don’t need extra time, what we need now is a decision and for everyone to take responsibility,” he said.
He did not exclude granting Britain more negotiating time, but said it was now up to the British “to take their responsibilities and assume the consequences of decisions they took democratically”.

Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the Irish government will press on with a suite of support measures for businesses and farmers as Brexit day edges close.
Speaking to reporters in Chicago, where hewas marching in the St Patrick’s Dayparade alongside MMA fighter Conor McGregor, the Taoiseach said he had a busy week ahead.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk is going to be in Dublin for talks with the Taoiseach on Tuesday.
Varadkar said the weekly Cabinet meeting will be held on Wednesday.
“On Wednesday at the Cabinet meeting, we will be in a position to sign off on a package of support for business, for farmers, for the agri-food sector, for exporters, for anyone who may be adversely affected by a no-deal Brexit. We are hoping the deal will be ratified
“Obviously we are hoping that the deal will be ratified by the House of Commons before then but if its not we are ready. We have already passed the legislation to provide for a no-deal Brexit,” he said.
The Taoiseach reiterated that the government is ready to deal with whatever may happen, but added that it won’t just be business as usual after Brexit.
“We’ve protected the common travel area and this package will be there to supports incomes, to support jobs. It is not going to be a case of everything being alright. Brexit is bad news and a no-deal Brexit would be very bad news.
“But the package of supports that we will put in place for hundreds of millions of euros and will support and protect incomes and jobs in those most exposed sectors, particularly in the agri-food sector and will also help other businesses and other exporters to be orientated away from the UK markets to other markets. And the country is in a good space to deal with this if we have to,” said Varadkar.

DUP and the deal
A question mark now hangs over the DUP and what they are minded to do next week.
Varadkar has said he believes the DUP do not want Britain to crash out of the EU.
“I had a chance actually to meet with Arlene Foster yesterday in Washington DC so I got to hear her perspective and she heard mine,” he said.
Varadkar and Foster both attended the Ireland Funds dinner on Wednesday evening in Washington. While Foster was seated on the table next to Varadkar, she was seen moving tables at the end of the evening and sitting next to the Taoiseach.
She was also present for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations at the White House, as well as the Speakers lunch on Capitol Hill.
“I certainly have the sense that the DUP would like the UK to leave the European Union with a deal, that they don’t want no deal either so at the moment they’re in discussions with the British government about how they might approach the next vote but they’re discussions that I’m not party to,” said Varadkar.
The DUP is set to resume discussions with the British government on Monday ahead of an expected third Westminster vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal next week.
It is understood that a team led by deputy leader Nigel Dodds yesterday met a range of high-ranking Tories about the withdrawal agreement, with the discussions described as “constructive”.
Varadkar has said that Ireland has always been open to an extension of Article 50, which push out the date for Brexit, but he told the media in Washington this week that an extension would have to have a “purpose”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveneytold France 24 news channelthat he also does not want to see “rolling” deadlines for Brexit.
He added that the Irish government “won’t be an obstacle” to an extension to the Brexit process, which Theresa May is expected to request next week at a meeting of EU leaders.

https://www.thejournal.ie/article-50-petition-debate-4562080-Mar2019/,"ON APRIL FOOLS’ Day, the House of Commons will debatean online petitionthat calls for the Brexit process to be reversed, which has gathered over 5.7 million signatures.
The e-petition calls for Article 50 to be revoked; Article 50 is the clause that allows a member state to leave the European Union. The debate is scheduled for next Monday, 1 April.
In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK had the power to revoke Article 50, thereby halting its withdrawal from the EU. This would have to be done before actually leaving – it couldn’t be revoked after that.
The petition has gathered a record level of interest, andcaused problemsfor the UK parliament’s e-petition website after it was first uploaded.

The level of reaction led to accusations of “fraud and overseas signatures”, the Petitions Committee said, adding that96% of the signatureson the petition were from the UK.
The House of Commons pledges to consider all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate in the chamber; and responds to those that get over 10,000 signatures with a statement.
The British government’s response to this petition was: “This Government will not revoke Article 50. We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with Parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union.”
The Department for Exiting the European Union added that revoking Article 50 would “undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in Government”.
“As the Prime Minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause ‘potentially irreparable damage to public trust’, and it is imperative that people can trust their Government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them,” it said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-irish-economy-research-4559732-Mar2019/,"THERE WILL BE a negative impact on Ireland’s economy in the long-term as a result of Brexit, a new report by the ESRI and Department of Finance has estimated.
Yesterday, the European Commission said it hascompleted preparationsfor a no-deal Brexit, noting “it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April”.
The European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if British MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement – a deal it has already overwhelmingly rejected twice – the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The report released today has focused on three main scenarios post-Brexit – a deal, a no deal and a disorderly no deal, while acknowledging that other outcomes are possible.
The report has estimated that GDP in Ireland 10 years after Brexit will be around 2.6% lower in a deal scenario, 4.8% lower in a no-deal scenario and 5% lower in a disorderly no-deal scenario respectively, compared to a situation where the UK stays in the EU.
This implies a slower pace of growth with negative consequences throughout the economy.
The report noted:
There is more uncertainty about the short-run impact of Brexit, however, as it depends on how smoothly any transition to a new trading arrangement will be, according to the report.
Results indicated that by 2020, the level of real output in the Irish economy would be 0.6%, 1.2% and 2.4% lower in the deal, no-deal and disorderly no-deal scenarios, respectively, compared to if the UK remains in the EU.
“The impact of each Brexit scenario is considerable and will have negative effects throughout the economy on the household sector, the labour market, firms and the public finances,” lead author of the report Adele Bergin said.
“However, the negative impact on Irish output in the long-run in the deal scenario is approximately half that of the no-deal scenario.”
British Prime Minister Theresa May making a statement on Brexit to the House of Commons yesterdayHouse of CommonsHouse of Commons
In the deal scenario for purpose of the report, the UK makes an orderly agreed exit from the EU. This involves a transition period to the end of 2020, and a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU-27 being in place thereafter.
In the no-deal scenario, the UK exits the EU without a deal but there is an orderly period of adjustment for trade. Ultimately, WTO tariff arrangements will apply to goods trade, there will be non-tariff measures, and services trade will also be negatively impacted.
In the disorderly no-deal scenario, the UK exits the EU without a deal and there is an additional disruption to trade in the short-run, above that considered in the no-deal scenario.

Employment impact
The results of the report have indicated that employment in Ireland, in the long-run, would be 1.8% lower in a deal scenario, 3.2% lower in a no-deal scenario and 3.4% lower in a disorderly scenario, compared to a situation where the UK stays in the EU.
The study estimated the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy by focusing on the impact of trade, incorporating the impact of tariff and non-tariff measures, and the potentially positive impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) diversion in Ireland.
The study assessed the impact of lower UK-EU trade on Ireland’s main trading partners and found that it would severely reduce the demand for Irish exports.
This report comes after the Central Bankin Januarypublished its economic forecast for how Ireland would fare in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Among the most extreme effects of a no-deal Brexit as predicted by Ireland’s financial regulator are an “immediate disruption” in financial markets, higher costs and “further falls” in the value of sterling.
The Central Bank said that given that Brexit is “a situation that is without historical precedent”, there is considerable uncertainty around potential Brexit outcomes.
This echoes the sentiment within the ESRI report, which noted that “the UK is deeply integrated with the European Union and its decision to exit from this trading block has no parallels in modern history”.
The report added:
Today’s report was conducted under the joint Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and ESRI research programme on the macroeconomy, taxation and banking.
An articulated lorry crossing the Irish border near NewryMariusz SmiejekMariusz Smiejek
Concluding the report, the authors noted: “There are both upside and downside risks to these estimates. On the upside, to the extent that businesses have been preparing for Brexit and finding ways of reducing trade exposures, this will help offset some of the negative impact.
“On the downside, the impact of Brexit could be more severe, especially in the short-run, if there is a continued period of uncertainty which could impact investment decisions or if there are even larger disruptions to trade.”
May’s deal
As noted above, the European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if British MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement – a deal it has already overwhelmingly rejected twice – the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU this week, on 29 March. May had wanted to delay Brexit until 30 June but welcomed the extension, insisting Brexitwill still happen.
Some Brexiteers have suggested the delay is part of a wider attempt to stop Britain from leaving the EU.

THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL has agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if British MPs back Theresa May’s deal next week.
The decision wasannounced last nightbut has some stipulations.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement – a deal it has already rejected twice – the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
The May deadline was unanimously agreed upon by the other 27 leaders of the European Union’s member states following discussions in Brussels yesterday.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU on 29 March, just a week from now, and May had requested an extension until 30 June.
Speaking at a press conference last night, President of the European Council Donald Tusk said Britain now has four options: a deal, no deal, a long delay or revoking Article 50.
“The 12th of April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European Parliament elections. If it has not decided to do so by then, the option of long extension will automatically become impossible,” Tusk said.
At the same press conference, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU is ready for all outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit.

May insisted at a press conference after the announcement that Brexit will still happen.
She welcomed the brief extension agreed by the EU, saying: “I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.”
About 2.5 million people have to date signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched on Wednesday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
May has consistently said she will not revoke Article 50.
No hard border
Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the extension avoids “a cliffedge” next week, adding that “nobody wants a no-deal scenario”.

She said the political situation in the UK is “quite chaotic and likely to change any given day” but that the deal may still be backed by MPs.
McEntee reiterated Europe’s stance that negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement are “not for reopening”.
She said she doesn’t want to preempt what will happen in the House of Commons next week but noted that if MPs don’t back the deal, the UK needs to present other options before 12 April.
“It is on that date that the UK has to signal whether or not they’re running in the European elections,” she noted, adding that Britain must then “set out very clearly what it is that they want to do and how they want to move forward”.
McEntee said the Irish government is committed to avoiding a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit and will work with the UK and the European Commission to make sure this situation doesn’t come to pass.
‘Constitutional crisis’
Negotiations are ongoing behind the scenes in a bid to get MPs to back May’s deal. This uphill battle may have been made even steeper after May hit out at MPs for not backing her to date in a televised speech on Wednesday night.
“MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, we will not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me,” May said.
Her speech was sharply criticised by many MPs, from across the political divide, who viewed it as anattempt to shift blamefor the ongoing crisis from herself to others.
Conservative Sam Gyimah said “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.
Describing her speech as “incendiary and irresponsible”, Labour MP Wes Streeting said May would be partly responsible “if any harm comes to us”, noting that MPs have been subjected “credible” death threats.
I’ve thought long and hard before saying this, but@theresa_mayknows that MPs across the House are subjected to death threats - some very credible. Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible. If any harm comes to any of us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.— Wes Streeting (@wesstreeting)March 20, 2019Wes Streeting MP/ Twitter

Asked at last night’s press conference if she would apologise for her comments, May said she understands that MPs are frustrated, saying so is she.
“There are passionately held views on all sides of the argument,” she noted, adding that the House of Commons now has a “clear choice” between an “orderly” Brexit and a no-deal scenario.
She said the idea of Britain taking part in the European elections while still preparing to leave the EU would focus people’s minds, adding: “I think the choice is clear for people.”
Earlier this week doubt was cast on over whether or not the House of Commons would actually vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
On Monday, John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland claimed the UK was facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the deal – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-on-the-attack-over-heavy-handed-tactics-after-naval-service-detains-two-uk-registered-trawlers-4518726-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|1 Mar 2019
THE DETENTION OF two UK-registered fishing vessels Dundalk Bay has sparked a political row between the Irish government and the DUP, who accused Leo Varadkar of dragging his heels on a fishing agreement in order to use it as a Brexit bargaining chip.
The two trawlers were detained in Dundalk Bay by Naval Service vessel the LÉ Orla on Tuesday for alleged breaches of fishing regulations.
The two captains of the vessels appeared at Drogheda Court today, where a judge said they were of “absolute integrity” and did not deserve a conviction,reports the BBC.
“This should be dealt with absolute discretion,” the judge said.
Both men received the benefit of Section 1.1 of the Probation Act (they weren’t convicted), and their impounded boats were ordered for immediate release.
Voisinage
Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed confirmed this morning that these were the first two vessels detained by the Defence Forces since a Supreme Court ruling in 2016 which found a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ called voisinage had no legal standing.
Voisinage, roughly translated as “neighbourliness”, allows fishing vessels registered in Northern Ireland to fish from 0-6 nautical miles up to Irish coasts, and vice versa.
The arrangement was brought to the Supreme Court which ruled in 2016 that despite Ireland having signed up to the arrangement as part of the London Fisheries Convention (1964), there wereno provisions for it in Irish law.
Irish vessels, however, are still permitted to fish in the 0-6 nautical miles around Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Although the Irish government has argued in favour of changing the laws, it’s been met withstrict opposition in the Dáil and Seanad, resulting in the legislation being stalled.
In a tweet and press statement released today, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the “Irish Prime Minister must explain why two Northern Ireland trawlers have been impounded by an Irish Navy warship”.

He added in his statement:
“Whilst Northern Ireland allows Irish boats to fish in our waters, the Republic of Ireland has policed a hard border and do not allow Northern Ireland boats enter their waters.
“Despite the Voisinage Agreement to have reciprocal fishing arrangements, the Irish have never enacted any legislation to give legal effect to the agreement. Legislation was drafted in 2016 but remains on the shelf.

He said the tactics demonstrated that Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney “are entirely focused on Ireland and are fair weather friends to Northern Ireland”.
“When Leo Varadkar talked about soldiers on the border he didn’t mention the Irish sending warships with 76mm guns.”
Other DUP and unionist politicians have also raised concerns about the detention. Dodds’ party colleague Jim Shannon said in the House of Commons that he was “appalled” at the actions of the Defence Forces.
He claimed that the waters were disputed, and that the naval service had illegally seized vessels that were in “waters that belong to this great nation, this British nation”.
The Irish government’s response

Speaking on Morning Ireland, Minister Creed said that the reciprocal agreement between Northern Ireland and the Republic that had been observed since the 1960s was acknowledged by the Supreme Court to be “a good idea” but needed to be put on a statutory footing.
Creed said the government had been doing everything possible to avoid the kind of situation that developed in Dundalk Bay from taking place, but that legislation giving effect to the fishing agreement had stalled in the Oireachtas.
He said he understood the “annoyance and upset” the detention of the vessels had caused in the broader political community.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney had been in touch with Fianna Fáil yesterday evening, Creed added, and it was hoped legislation governing the issue could now be fast-tracked in the coming weeks.
He saidhe rejected entirely any accusations linking the issue with Brexit, pointing out that issues to do with fishing rights in that inshore zone were solely a matter for sovereign governments and nothing to do with the EU.
The row comes as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar travels to Belfast today to meet with business leaders for discussions on Brexit and the impasse at Stormont. He is also due to deliver an address at the Alliance Party’s annual conference dinner.

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-border-4456751-Jan2019/,"THIS MORNING THE Garda Commissioner dismissed a report that he had discussed a proposal to move 600 gardaí to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Irish Independent reported that draft emergency plans were the focus of a meeting yesterday between Commissioner Drew Harris and senior staff at Garda Headquarters.
The paper cited sources who said 600 gardaí would be required to man an estimated 300 border crossings if the force is faced with a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.
However the Commissioner today said the reports of 600 gardaí being moved to the border are “entirely incorrect”.
“I have not discussed this matter neither have I considered this proposal,” he said.
“We continue to prepare for Brexit in line with government policy”.
The Commissioner did not expand on how garda management is preparing for Brexit, and government policy so far has been to deny that it is making any plans for a hard border.
In November, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the governmentwas not making contingency plansin terms of policing in the event of a no-deal Brexit. His department has been asked for an update on this position today.

‘Sensible planning’
An Oireachtas committee todayheard from Revenue’s chairpersonNiall Cody, who explained that his staff are not planning for customs posts but they are prepared for a no-deal Brexit. He said in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Revenue will operate controls and checks with a risk-based approach at traders’ premises.
It has also upgraded its Customs IT system to handle increased transaction levels. And a number of additional staff are being recruited and trained to be in place for the March deadline.
Last year, PSNI chief constable George Hamiltonindicated the police force on the other side of the border was preparingfor a scenario that would require between 300 and 500 extra officers to police the border.
At the time he described it as “sensible planning” that would enable the PSNI to be ready for the post-Brexit era.
Senior sources have said there are discussions within An Garda Síochána about the implications of Brexit, but there have been no talks with representative associations about how this is likely to impact on their members.
The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (Agsi) said today it has sought a meeting with garda management about Brexit issues and expects to meet them “in the near future”.
“As for the movement of personnel, we have no details of same right now,” a spokesperson said.
The Garda Commissioner’s denial of similar ‘sensible’ planning, and the government’s repeated denial that it has contingency plans for policing a hard border have caused concern among the gardaí who may be transferred at short notice to do the job.
‘It can’t be enough’
One source said they did not believe even the 600 figure the Commissioner refuted today would be enough to police 300 border posts.
“It can’t be enough. You’d need four people minimum for every checkpoint if you’re going to have it manned 24/7. And that’s with just two people at each post.”
Related ReadsBrexit 66 days out, but Irish government says there are 'absolutely no preparations for a hard border''It's impossible to completely predict what might be in short supply and what might be in ridiculous oversupply'
They also pointed out that the temporary transfer of so many members would be a “massive cost” for the already financially stretched organisation.
Another said it is likely that a large number of inexperienced new recruits would be sent straight from Templemore when they graduate to bulk up the numbers.
The organisation will struggle to get enough gardaí to volunteer for these transfers and sources said forcing hundreds of personnel to move away from their families to police the border will drive morale down even further.
James Morrisroe, Garda Representative Association (GRA) representative for the Cavan Monaghan division, said his members have been asking him about what will happen if the March deadline passes and there is no deal.
“One would have thought that at this stage that the members who may be potentially affected in the worst case scenario would have been given some indication of a contingency plan.
“I have been inundated with queries from the garda members within the Cavan/Monaghan division as to what, if any, are the plans but I’m afraid I have no answers at this stage and this only fuels the speculation.”
When initially asked about policing plans for Brexit, the Department of Justice did not address queries about whether any contingency plans have been discussed or whether any estimations of garda numbers needed have been made.
It also did not respond to a question about garda members who are concerned about being moved last-minute to the border and about cuts to resources in their stations as a result of a hard border.
Instead it referredTheJournal.ieto the Garda Commissioner’s statement.
In a statement this evening, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said:
“The Department of Justice and Equality has been preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU since 2016.
“Obviously operational matters are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his team but the department has been working closely with organisations and agencies across the sector including An Garda Síochána.
It is important to note that the Common Travel Area arrangements will continue post-Brexit and police cooperation – both North/South and East/West – which are currently at historically positive levels, will also continue.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-7-4452376-Jan2019/,"THE UK PRIME Minister has been warned that dozens of members of her government will resign if they’re banned from voting for a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.
It comes as a cohort of Conservatives are seeking to delay Brexit altogether by extending Article 50 if it remains impossible for the House of Commons to agree a way forward on Brexit, the Times reported this morning.
The group is headed by Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has told Number 10 that MPs should be allowed a free vote on plans that would clear the way for Article 50 to be extended.
Article 50 is the mechanism through which the UK is leaving the EU, but the option remains open to extend that leaving date of 29 March until parliament is able to ratify some sort of deal agreed with the EU.
Theresa May faced the House of Commons to deliver her much-anticipated “plan B” on Brexit yesterday, following the resounding defeat to her deal last week.
She said she plans to return to Brussels to discuss changes to the deal she agreed with EU leaders last month, despite an overwhelming rejection of the draft text by MPs last week.

“I believe we can make progress” on the so-called Irish backstop, she told parliament, adding that she would be consulting with MPs about possible changes and “then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU”.
Addressing the House of Commons, she said after last week’s vote it became “clear the government’s approach had to change”.
The UK prime minister ruled out holding a second referendum, as it would create a concerning precedent. May added that it could “damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy”.
Although there are widespread concerns about the UK leaving with no deal on 29 March, May also appeared to rule out extending Article 50 yesterday, saying it would go against the referendum result.
Among those who could resign if she refuses to rule out a no deal are, Business Minister Richard Harrington, Culture Minister Margot James, Defence Minister Tobias Elwood and Justice Secretary David Gauke, the Times reported.
Minister Amber Rudd has told May to expect up to 40 resignations if she refuses to allow MPs a free vote on blocking a no-deal Brexit.
The Prime Minister will face a series of votes next week where MPs from varying factions in the House of Commons will try to force a change of direction regarding Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-border-preparations-4454161-Jan2019/,"IN WHAT HAS been described as ‘stating the obvious’, a European Commission spokesperson said today a no-deal Brexit will bring about a return of a hard border.
It’s understood the Cabinet “noted the remarks” this afternoon, but the Irish government continues to maintain that there are no plans for the scenario of a hard border.
No plans, no secret plans, nothing.
That has been the consistent message for the last number of months, and they are sticking to it.
However, it is now 66 days out, and contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit are being implemented in every other area – other than along the border.
Speculation not helpful
This afternoon, followingTánaiste Simon Coveneystating that it would be “difficult” to avoid a hard border in a no-deal scenario, an Irish government spokesperson said that it serves no purpose to speculate about the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
This comes just one week after Transport Minister Shane Ross stated that in a crash out Brexit, there would need to be some sort of customs checks.
Speaking in the Dáil after Ross’s slip of the tongue, Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin said the message appears to be not to even mention the possibility of a hard border, but as the clock ticks down and Britain’s exit date gets closer, answers are being demanded.

A government spokesperson acknowledged today that a no-deal would be an “extremely difficult” challenge for Ireland, however he ruled out the Irish government putting up customs posts along the border.
When asked if Ireland could ignore an instruction from the EU to put up a hard border with Northern Ireland if we end up in a no-deal Brexit scenario, he stated:
“We’re not putting up border infrastructure,” the spokesman said, adding:
A bilateral arrangement with the UK has also been ruled out, but there are “absolutely no preparations for a hard border”, he repeated. However, it was confirmed to reporters that World Trade Organisation rules kick in at 11.01pm on 29 March in a no-deal scenario.
“The focus needs to be on the withdrawal agreement,” he said, adding that it’s up to the UK to come up with alternatives to avoid a hard border if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.
If not the withdrawal agreement, “it has to be something else… we need to see this now” the media was told.
The government spokesperson said the government was not in denial and shot down any accusations that the Irish government was being dishonest with the Irish public when it says that it has no plans for dealing with a hard border.
‘A real dilemma’
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said today that what would happen in a no deal scenario would always be a difficult thing to speculate about.
While preparations for the border are non-existent, the Cabinet did discuss nine Brexit preparation memos including single electricity markets and grants for students studying in Britain.
As part of its overall “no-deal actions”, the government today agreed the Heads of legislation, for accelerated drafting of the single omnibus Brexit Bill.

The ‘mega’ Bill, as it has been dubbed by the Tánaiste, is officially named the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019).
Cabinet granted approval for the Health Minister Simon Harris to draft his section of the Bill which will enable necessary healthcare arrangements to be maintained between Ireland and the UK in a no-deal Brexit.
Rail and bus links in a no-deal Brexit
Meanwhile, Transport Minister Shane Ross’s section of the Bill will enable and facilitate the continued operation of cross border rail services between Ireland and Northern Ireland – principally the service on the Dublin/Belfast rail line – and the operation of bus/coach services between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.
Minister for Business, Heather Humphries section will enable Enterprise Ireland to further support businesses through investment, loans and research and development grants.
Minister for Climate, Energy and Communications, Richard Bruton will seek to  provides for the modification of Single Electricity Market licences, while Education Minister Joe McHugh was granted approval to draft his part of the Bill that looks ensure assistance for students who are studying in the UK and students studying in the State who are UK nationals can continue to do so post 29 March.
Minister for Finance, Pascal Donohoe is making changes in relation to taxation reliefs, while Social Protection, Regina Doherty will draft amendments to social welfare legislation to ensure people who get UK pensions will continue to receive them.
In order to get this mega Bill over the line in time, the Taoiseach met with opposition leaders today to brief them on the legislation and the timeline needed to ensure there is enough time to enact it, if necessary.
The Taoiseach has promised to brief and regularly update Oireachtas members on the progress of the legislation as it is developed over the coming weeks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-spectator-article-ireland-french-commonwealth-4588604-Apr2019/,"IRELAND’S AMBASSADOR TO the United Kingdom has hit out at a political magazine over a piece about Ireland’s decision to join an international French-speaking organisation.
In an open letter to the editor of the Spectator, Adrian O’Neill claimed the magazine had “lapsed into an anti-Irish sentiment” following the publication of the article this week.
The articleby Daily Mail columnist Roger Hardiman questioned Ireland’s motivation for joining the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an international group representing countries and regions where French is spoken.
It claimed that Ireland’s interests would have been better served by re-joining the British Commonwealth, and listed examples of how the UK has assisted Ireland economically and diplomatically in recent years.
The article said Ireland’s organisations could “plug straight into” the Commonwealth and that young Irish people could win “hatfuls of medals” at the Commonwealth Games.
“Ireland… steadfastly turns its back on a perfect vehicle for its international ambitions for no other reason than that it was once run by the Brits,” Hardiman wrote.
“The last thing likely to lure it back on board will be overtures from Britain. But all the other nations are just as keen to see Ireland back in the club — and have said so often.”
In contrast, Hardiman said that Ireland was joining a group of “flimsily-connected” countries with “deplorable human rights records” and “French-speaking crooks”, some of whom appeared “at the bottom of every global corruption index”.

“Only a cynic would suggest that this is a calculated two fingers to Brexit Britain,” he continued.
“Only the mean-spirited would suggest that little Leo will do anything to suck up to the top gang in the EU playground…
“How odd, then, to see the Irish — usually so quick to take offence at any whiff of imperialism — acting as a cheerleader for French aggrandisement.”
In response, O’Neill penned a letter to the editor of the Spectator which acknowledged that Brexit had placed pressure on British-Irish relations.
However, he said that most people he had spoken to in the UK had understood the Irish Government’s approach to Britain’s departure from the European Union.
He also hit out at the piece by claiming it was one of a series of recent publications by the magazine about Ireland which did not fall under its aims to publish pieces to “inform, to entertain and to make people think”.
Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O'Neill's letter to the editor of the SpectatorTwitterTwitter
“I am not unduly thin-skinned but, over the last couple of years, the prevailing tone and tenor of most Spectator articles relating to Ireland have been snide and hostile,” he wrote, adding that Hardiman’s piece was an “egregious” example of this.
“While 17 EU Member States are either members or observers of this international organisation, only Ireland’s affiliation [with the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie] incurs this scorn.”
O’Neill concluded by saying that a recognition that anti-Irish sentiment had been confined to the past would likely be the reaction to Hardiman’s article, not a feeling of being informed, entertained, or encouraged to think.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-brexit-no-deal-4481729-Feb2019/,"LAST UPDATE|7 Feb 2019
THERESA MAY HAS been told that the EU will not re-open negotiations on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Jean-Claude Juncker and the British prime minister have however agreed to hold further talks on Britain’s withdrawal, after what they described as a “robust” meeting.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier will meet Britain’s Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay on Monday in Strasbourg and May and Juncker themselves will get back together before the end of February, a spokesman said.
In a joint statement issued after May met the European Commission President in Brussels, the pair confirmed that Juncker had warned the British premier that the Brexit withdrawal deal could not be looked at again.
He “expressed his openness to add wording” to a parallel political declaration laying out ambitions for future EU-UK ties if London wants to seek a “more ambitious” closer relationship after Brexit.
“The discussion was robust but constructive,” the joint statement today said.

As UK political commentators have observed, the release of this joint assessment of the situation appears to end hopes that May can get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons with the support of the Brexiteer wing of her party.
‘Alternative arrangements’
May, according to the statement, had urged that the withdrawal agreement itself be changed, and reminded Juncker that the British parliament had mandated her to seek “a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop”.
Theresa May’s cabinet last November backed an agreement on the backstop that would see Northern Ireland aligned to some rules of the single market if alternative solutions could not be found by the end of the Brexit transition period in 2020.
The revised backstop plan, which would also effectively keep the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU until both parties no longer deemed it necessary, has been roundly rejected by Brexiteer MPs.
Last week those MPs lent their support to a new amendment proposing replacing the Irish backstop with unspecified “alternative arrangements”, as the proposal gained the support of a majority of the House of Commons.
After his own talks with May, EU President Donald Tusk warned there was “no breakthrough in sight”, although the British leader said she had seen willingness from Brussels to find a deal.
Tusk today apparently suggested to May that she study a plan laid out by British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
May has already rejected the proposal for an EU-UK customs union, but the EU leader said it “might be a promising way out of the impasse”, the official told AFP.
Speaking to reporters as she left Brussels, May said she had spelled out Britain’s “clear position” that legally-binding changes are needed to the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border.
If no agreement is reached on the withdrawal deal, which has yet to be approved by either the British or EU parliaments, Britain will crash out of the union with no follow-on trade arrangements on 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rainy-day-fund-brexit-4463725-Feb2019/,"THE BILL, WHICH will allow for the setting up of the much talked about Rainy Day Fund, won’t be used for a Brexit fallout.
A Department of Finance briefing note for Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe on the fund, which was released under Freedom of Information, notes that it should not be used for Brexit or climate change, stating that it “is vital that the Rainy Day Fund is not earmarked to meet challenges of which we are already fully aware”.
It adds that to set out from its inception that the Rainy Day Fund would be available to meet Brexit or climate change challenges could lead to “moral hazard problems”.
“All of us in Government and the Oireachtas must take responsibility for addressing these challenges by planning and taking mitigating actions. We cannot plan on just using the Rainy Day Fund,” the note reads.
In addition, it envisages that the Rainy Day Fund would only ever be used “for an extreme outcome…  a ‘tail-risk scenario’ of one of these challenges”.
Ever since the bank bailout, there has been discussions about a rainy day fund, with the then Finance MinisterMichael Noonanproposing the idea back in 2016. Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath had previously floated a similar plan the year previous.
Money goes to the fund this year
However, in announcing the establishment of the fund last year, Donohoe said money will start going into the fund in 2019 – first with an initial deposit of €500 million, followed by further annual contributions of €500 million in 2020 and 2021.
These amounts are on top of the €1.5 billion in seed funding which has already been committed to.
The view that the fund should not be used for Brexit differs somewhat from the Fianna Fáil position, which is set out in their recent submission on the fund.
The party believes the fund should be used in the case of a “natural or other disaster but it also could be another threat”.
However, the department has confirmed that the fund will only be used to mitigate severe events, as opposed to the normal fluctuations of the economic cycle.

In light of this, the Parliamentary Budget Office has stated that if the fund is to be used as a contingency fund for once off events then “it should not be called the rainy day fund” as the office states this term is more appropriate for a fund that is used as a counter-cyclical policy tool.
Bailing out the banks
While the fund is being ruled out for spending on the likes of Brexit, and any major domestic crises like in housing or health, one area where the fund could end being used in the future is another bank bailout.
The minister’s memo outlines answers to the question as to whether the fund could be used to bail out financial institutions.
The document outlines that the core objective of EU banking policy is to separate the sovereign from the banks, adding that “the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive is designed so as to impose the cost of bank failures on the banks, their shareholders and the holders of their eligible liabilities”.
The minister’s briefing memo says that there is no expectation that the fund will be needed by banks because of the current “regulatory regime”.
It adds: “However, I would caution against closing off future uses of the Rainy Day Fund at this time, particularly given:
‘A severe economic downturn’
It goes on to state that the Rainy Day Fund will be deployed only with the consent of the Dáil and only due to exceptional circumstances. The circumstances, defined by the EU, can result from:
The minister’s memo adds: “Accordingly, we could deploy the Rainy Day Fund to meet such a force majeure events and still be compliant. By way of example, some Member States under the unusual events clause, have increased expenditure related to recent refugee inflows or terrorism security measures.”
Sinn Féin is opposing the Bill which seeks to establish the fund on a statutory footing.
The Bill is currently at Third Stage.
Sinn Féin’s Jonathan O’Brien said that in the midst of a housing and homelessness crisis, and with overspends in the National Children’s Hospital resulting in other capital projects throughout the country being stalled and deferred as a result, it is in the public interest to know where up to €8 billion is going in the next five years, and what it will be for.
He said the use of the fund is “obscure and unclear”, adding that it is most probable it will be used to bail out the banks “at a time when we should be investing in housing and infrastructure to future-proof our economy from future threats”.

THE NEWLY-FORMED Brexit Party in the UK has doubled its lead over other British parties in an opinion poll out today on the European Parliament elections.
The Opinium survey in The Observer newspaper put the Brexit Party of eurosceptic figurehead Nigel Farage on 34%, doubling its lead over the main opposition Labour Party to 13 points in a fortnight – and on course to get more votes than Britain’s two main parties put together.
In a testy interview on BBC with Andrew Marr today, Farage criticised how Theresa May had conducted the Brexit negotiations and said that the “only way the democratic will of the people” from the 2016 vote could be respected is to leave the EU without a deal.
He claimed that he came up with the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal”, and repeated it every day in the two weeks running up to the June 2016 referendum. Marr said he hadn’t been able to find evidence of Farage saying this.
Farage: “I didn’t spend 25 years campaigning to leave the European Union to sign up to a new treaty.”
He said the only way to leave the EU now is on WTO trade terms and, if the UK does, Europe will be “banging our door down” seeking a trade deal.

European opinion poll
Labour, on 21%, has dropped seven points while the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats are in third place on 12%, up five points, on the corresponding poll from two weeks ago.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s governing Conservatives are in fourth place on 11%.
Had Britain left the European Union as planned on 29 March, it would not be taking part in the European Parliament elections, which will be held in the UK on May 23.

In the 2016 referendum on Britain’s EU membership, 52% voted to leave while 48 percent voted to remain.
Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said Remain voters were scattered among several parties.
“While 63% of Leavers say they will vote for the Brexit Party in the European elections, the most popular party among Remainers (Labour) only has 31%, versus 22% for the Lib Dems and 14% for the Greens,” he said.
Brexit voters have deserted the Conservatives to such an extent that they now have a higher share of Remainers (12%) backing them than of Leavers (11%), he added.
General election
In voting intentions for the next general election – which must be held by May 2022 – left-wing Labour is on 28%, the centre-right Conservatives on 22%, the Brexit Party on 21% and the centrist Liberal Democrats on 11%.
Opinium Research conducted an online survey of 2,004 British adults between Wednesday and Friday. The results were weighted.
A ComRes general election poll, which appears in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, puts Labour on 27%, the Brexit Party on 20% and the Conservatives on 19%.
The poll of 2,034 adults conducted on Thursday was commissioned by Brexit Express, a campaign group run by the Brexit Party’s biggest donor.
May has pledged to step down once a Brexit divorce deal has been agreed upon by parliament. She is under pressure from within her own party to disclose what her eventual departure date will be.
ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins said of those bidding to replace May: “If the Conservative leadership contenders are not careful, there will be no party for them to lead.”

THE HOUSE OF Commons has backed a proposal to hold a series of votes tomorrow which will indicate their Brexit preferences.
MPs last night voted by 329 to 302 to seize control of parliamentary business tomorrow in an unprecedented move that the British government called “dangerous”.
Three junior ministers quit the Conservative Party aftervoting against the government.
Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt, Health Minister Steve Brine and Business Minister Richard Harrington all resigned.

In his resignation letter, Harrington said the government’s approach was “playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country”.
The Brexit ministry said in a statement it was “disappointed” by the vote, adding that it “upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent”.
Almost three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, last night’s vote sets up a potentially crucial clash between government and parliament on the best way to end the political crisis.
MPs will now have the chance to vote on various options such as revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit, holding another referendum, a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leaving the EU without a deal.
But even if MPs decide a majority course of action, it won’t be legally binding so the government could ignore it.
“The government will continue to call for realism — any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU,” the Brexit ministry said.
Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “sceptical” about the process and that similar efforts in the past “produced contradictory outcomes or no outcomes at all”.
May yesterday admitted she had still not secured the votes needed to get her twice-rejected Brexit deal through parliament, raising again the prospect that Britain could crash out of the EU in just over two weeks’ time.

‘National embarrassment’
The European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU this Friday, 29 March. May had wanted to delay Brexit until 30 June but last week welcomed the extension, insisting Brexit will still happen.
Some Brexiteers have suggested the delay is part of a wider attempt to stop Britain from leaving the EU.
The European Commission yesterday said it hascompleted preparationsfor a no-deal Brexit, noting “it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April”.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was a “national embarrassment”, adding: “We will still face the prospect of a disastrous no-deal Brexit.”

LAST NIGHT, THE UK and the EU announced they had reached an agreement on a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop.
It followed what was being described as a last-ditch attempt by British Prime Minister May to secure Brexit concessions from the EU ahead of a planned House of Commons vote on the deal later today.
For now, however, it remains to be seen whether the new guarantees will be enough to sway Brexiteers within her own party and the DUP to back her Brexit deal.
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
So, what does this all mean? Let’s break it down.
What happened last night?
First – a quick look back.
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
The backstop locks the UK, including Northern Ireland, into a customs deal and other regulations in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It’s basically been a bone of contention in the Brexit debate.
Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications & legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement &#backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or#Brexitmay not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.https://t.co/lfy9eehEZipic.twitter.com/XCqcLwZV7V— Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU)March 11, 2019Jean-Claude Juncker/ Twitter

Last night, following last-ditch attempts to secure Brexit concessions from the EU, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave a press conference in Strasbourg.
Both reading from prepared statements, the pair said they had agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop – “legally binding changes” to the old agreement aimed at addressing Britain’s needs and getting the deal through parliament.
The joint instrument is essentially a three-part package of changes from the EU to the terms of the withdrawal agreement.
These new documents have been agreed to run alongside the withdrawal agreement, which governs Britain’s exit terms, and the political declaration on future trade terms.
First is a “joint legally binding instrument” on the withdrawal text, which addresses the deal’s controversial backstop plan to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
A second document would supplement the political declaration, and outline commitments from both sides on moving swiftly to this new relationship.
Britain has also put forward a “unilateral declaration” with legal status in international law emphasising the temporary nature of the backstop.
This would clarify that Britain believes there is nothing in the Brexit deal to stop it seeking to exit the backstop if the EU fails to live up to its commitments to find a replacement.
What does this mean for the backstop?
The backstop is a sort of Plan B, insurance policy, or safety net that would kick in if a better deal isn’t agreed in the second stage of Brexit talks, which will focus on trade (a part of the Future Relationship).
It would kick in at the end of the transition period – which starts on 29 March and ends on31 December 2020- if a final deal is agreed.
Put simply, the backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
However, the new guarantees say that every effort will be made to ensure the Irish backstop never needs to be enacted and measures through which any attempt to make the backstop apply indefinitely can be legally challenged.

What did the EU say last night?
Juncker last night explained that the backstop was an insurance policy and that if it was ever used it would not be used as a trap.
The mechanism being announced last night complemented the withdrawal agreement agreed last November without reopening it, he said – noting that this was a “second chance” and that there would be no third chance.
“In politics sometimes you get a second chance, it is what we do with this second chance that counts because there will be no third chance,” Juncker said.
What did the UK say?
May last night said the backstop could not be a template for a future relationship and that so far that hadn’t been clear enough to MPs.
The EU, under the new proposals, will not be able to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, May said. If it makes any move to do so, that can be tackled through arbitration.
British Prime Minister Theresa MayJean-Francois BadiasJean-Francois Badias
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” May said.
She said it was the UK’s position that it believed it could withdraw, unilaterally, from the backstop if negotiations on the future relationship broke down.
What’s Ireland’s view on this?
Well, during his speech last night, Juncker implied that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had signed off on the strengthened guarantees offered to London.
“I have spoken to the Taoiseach this evening who would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal,” Juncker told reporters.
Varadkar had been due to travel to Washington, but remains in Dublin this morning.
He is expected to hold a press conference later this morning to outline the Irish government’s position.
What will the DUP have to say?
Up until now, May’s withdrawal agreement has proven unpalatable for Northern Ireland’s DUP, hardline Conservatives and the opposition parties.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.

Since last night, the DUP has said it will scrutinise the documents that have been agreed.
May needs the DUP’s support for the deal to pass through the House of Commons.
Finally, what on earth happens now?
Later today, the House of Commons will vote on May’s Brexit plan.
The vote is expected to take place at 7pm.
Another defeat would set the stage for additional votes in parliament this week that could postpone Brexit and possibly reverse it in the months to come.
If she loses the vote, May has promised to give MPs a vote tomorrow on whether Britain should simply leave without any deal at all.
If MPs would defeat the “no-deal” scenario, it would be followed on Thursday with a vote on requesting a delay from the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-plea-to-corbyn-4620633-May2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May apologised to local councillors within the conservative party who lost their seats in the local elections and called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to do a deal on Brexit.
The Conservative party lost over 1,300 councillors in Thursday’s local elections, while the Labour party lost 83 seats, some in areas where it had a long history of support.
In an open letter published today in theUK’s Mail on Sunday, May made a fresh call for Corbyn to help her push the proposed withdrawal deal over the line.
“The electorate delivered a message on Brexit to Labour, too. Labour also lost seats and councils which it has held for decades,” she said.
“Clearly, the public is fed up with the failure of both of the two main parties to find a way to honour the result of the referendum, take the United Kingdom out of the European Union and to bring our country back together again.”
May said she has tried to secure the backing of her own party members and he DUP, who are part of the government’s confidence-and-supply agreement but that she “could not persuade enough of my colleagues to vote for the Withdrawal Agreement”.
The withdrawal deal which was negotiated by May with Europe was shot down on three occasions in the House of Commons – the latest by a majority of 58.

“We don’t agree with the opposition on lots of policy issues, but on Brexit there are areas we do agree on – leaving with a good deal that protects jobs and our security and ends free movement.
“To MPs, I would say this: if we are able to negotiate a cross-party agreement, this deal will be a stepping stone to a brighter future, outside the EU, where the UK can determine the road ahead.
“And to the Leader of the opposition, I say this: let’s listen to what the voters said in the local elections and put our differences aside for a moment. Let’s do a deal.”
Talks between the two parties are to resume on Tuesday as May hopes Labour MPs will back her deal after failing to get enough of her own party’s MPs on board.
I’m Sorry
The prime minister apologised for the historic loss for local councillors in Thursday’s UK local elections.
“In the local elections, many Conservative councillors lost their seats,” she said.
“I want to thank all of my colleagues for their tremendous hard work and dedication to public duty, and for all they did to improve the lives of the communities which they served.
“I have been a councillor and I know what a rewarding and important job it is.”

EU citizens and their families had been asked to apply to a new settlement scheme to continue living there after June 2021.
Irish citizens are not required to apply to the scheme, but other EU citizens were being asked to pay £65 if they were over 16 and £32.50 for those under 16 years of age.
There wassignificant criticism of the schemeat the end of last year with many EU citizens expressing anger at having to pay to remain in Britain. Today the prime minister said the scheme would go ahead but without the need to pay a fee.

“Having listened to concerns from members and organisations like The3Million group I can confirm today when we roll out the scheme in full on the 30th of March the government will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals who wish to stay,” she told MPs in Westminster.
“And anyone who has or will apply during a pilot phase will have their fee reimbursed.”
May made the commentsas she announced her much-anticipated“plan B” on Brexit following last week’s defeat of her original deal. She told MPs she plans to return to Brussels to discuss changes to the deal she agreed with EU leaders last month.
May said she believes progress can be made on the Irish backstop and she will be consulting with MPs about possible changes before going back to the EU for further talks.
The UK prime minister ruled out holding a second referendum, as she said it would create a concerning precedent.

SINN FÉIN PRESIDENT Mary Lou McDonald has accused the British Prime Minister Theresa May of acting “in bad faith” and “playing a game of chicken with Irish interests”, in several UK media appearances this morning.
The Dublin TD appeared on ITV’s flagship programme Good Morning Britain this morning, defending Sinn Féin’s decision not to take its seven seats in Westminster and speaking about the threat Brexit poses to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
McDonald said that it would be “utterly reckless” for any British Prime Minister “to knowingly and cynically destabilize peace in Northern Ireland”, referring to May’s attempts to renegotiate the backstop, a clause in her Brexit deal that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Later, onBBC Radio 4 Today, McDonald said that ”the British government has played a game of chicken with Irish interests, they’re running down the clock”.
She added: “Brexit threatens to sunder the entire constitutional and political framework that accommodates the current stability and beds-down the peace process.”

Answering a number of questions about why Sinn Féin MPs don’t take their seats in Westminster in order to influence the direction Brexit is taking, McDonald told Good Morning Britain:

She said that Sinn Féin participates in the Brexit debate through the European Union; both Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill have met with EU negotiator Michel Barnier in relation to Northern Ireland and the backstop.
McDonald added that “as an observer” she thought that the Brexit debate in the House of Commons “has been about England in the first instance, which is fair enough, about English interests, which is also fair enough”.

Speaking to BBC News afterwards, McDonald called for a referendum on Irish unity.
“People across Ireland have an appetite for progress and should be given the opportunity to decide their own future through a unity referendum,” she said.
There are less than 50 days until the 29 March, the date by which the UK must leave the EU (barring an extension to Article 50, which looks increasingly unlikely).
The UK parliament overwhelmingly voted to reject Theresa May’s deal last month; she has promised to try to obtain concessions on the backstop in order to get the deal passed before the 29 March.
The EU has responded by saying that both the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop are not up for renegotiation.
Yesterday, May said that if there is no breakthrough on the backstop by the 26 February, that another amendable motion would be tabled on 27 February, which could mean MPs vote on another series of options on what to do next.
In response to a question from MP Chris Leslie, May denied that putting a time limit on the backstop would be like putting a time limit on the Good Friday Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-does-perfidious-albion-mean-4472338-Feb2019/,"DPA / PA ImagesDPA / PA Images / PA Images
WE’VE HAD PLENTY of new phrases emerge thanks to Brexit: red lines; backstop; max fac.
But this week we saw the reemergence of a phrase that has popped up every now and then during the Brexit debacle: Perfidious Albion.
But what does it mean, and why were people using it this week?
Waterford Hurling / TwitterWaterford Hurling / Twitter/ Twitter
First off, ‘perfidious albion’ isn’t a new phrase.
The word ‘perfidious’ is an adjective which comes from the Latin noun ‘perfidia’, whichaccording to the Merriam-Webster dictionaryrefers to:
Albion, meanwhile, means Great Britain or England. It’s also Latin and has been in usesince before the 12th century.
So we can see what ‘perfidious albion’ (or rather, ‘perfidious Albion’) means, then: a disloyal Britain. So it’s not a positive phrase, then.
Advertisement
But where did it come from?
It’s to the French playwright Augustin Louis de Ximénes that the first use of perfidious albion isusually attributed to.
He has a line in his poem L’Ere des Francais (published in 1793) which says:
This is related to political events back in the 1790s. During the French Revolution, it was perceived that Great Britain allied itself with other monarchies in Europe once the revolution led to the overthrow of Louis XVI. That was seen as a perfidious thing to do.
Since then, it’s been used to refer to different political events and Britain’s role in them, relating to countries like Portugal, Rhodesia, Gibraltar and Palestine. During the First World War, it was used by Italians to criticise Great Britain over not enforcing all the terms of the Treaty of London.
What’s key is that the criticism is usually levelled by those outside of Britain itself, towards its behaviour to other countries.
And you can of course see how the phrase could be used when it comes to Brexit, particularly by those outside the UK. But with Brexit, it is also British people who are using the phrase – which in itself demonstrates the fractures caused by the 2016 referendum. (There’s even a book called Perfidious Albion, published in August of last year and written by Sam Byers. As the name befits it, it is apost-Brexit satire. )
The phrase started popping up again this week after Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May got the nod from MPs to go back to Europe and renegotiate on the hugely contentious backstop.
The fact she had previously supported the backstop could be seen by some to be an example of perfidious Albion. But to May, it’s most likely just another move in the giant, confusing game of chess she’s playing with the EU.
One thing’s for sure: as long as the Brexit situation rumbles on with no decisive moment in sight, the phrase perfidious albion will continue to be rolled out by Britain’s – and particularly the Tory party’s – critics.

THERE HAS BEEN outrage from some quarters in the UK after a speech by European Council President Donald Tusk about Brexit.
It was reported that he said there was a “special place in hell” for Brexiteers as he spoke about the importance of the Irish backstop and the Good Friday Agreement.
He was speaking after talks in Brussels with our Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who reportedly told Tusk “they’ll give you terrible trouble” after he had finished his address.
THE CLAIM:Donald Tusk said there was a special place in hell for Brexiteers.
The BBC tweeted a story earlier from a number of its accounts with the headline ‘Tusk: Special place in hell for Brexiteers.’


MP Sammy Wilson had a strong response to the news. He said Tusk had shown contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to “escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom”.

Broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer also got the impression that Tusk was lashing out at UK citizens who had voted for Brexit:

But others accused the BBC of using a “misleading headline” and failing to portray what Tusk had really said.

The word ‘Brexiteer’ is used for anyone who is in favour of Brexit. Here’s the Oxford dictionary definition:

Let’s have a look at the exact words Tusk used in his speech.Here isthe text of his full speech, and we have watch footage of the live speech to confirm he kept to the script.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
The ‘special place in hell’ line is his very last sentence, but here it is with the lead-up, for context:
“The top priority for us remains the issue of the border on the island of Ireland. And the guarantee to maintain the peace process in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement. There’s no room for speculation here. The EU itself is first and foremost a peace project. We will not gamble with peace or put a sell by date on reconciliation. And this is why we insist on the backstop.
“A sense of responsibility also tells us to prepare for a possible fiasco. The Taoiseach and I have spoken about the necessary actions in case of no deal; I know that you will also be discussing this shortly with the European Commission.
VERDICT
Since the earlier deleted tweet, and the response to the story, the BBC has slightly changed its headline, adding the words “without a plan” to the end of it.

Tusk at no point in his speech references the decision by UK voters in the referendum – he specifically refers to those who promoted Brexit without a plan on how to carry it out safely.
While these people could, of course, be referred to as Brexiteers, it is clear he is not talking about every ordinary voter who was pro-Brexit. Voters would not be expected (by the European Council) to have a plan on how to carry out the proposals – it is well established that this is the job of politicians and in particular those in government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-poll-5-4616471-May2019/,"A NEW POLL has shown an increase in the number of people who believe a united Ireland is more likely because of Brexit.
The annual Red C poll published today shows a marginal increase of 6% in the number of people who said a united Ireland was now more likely.
The survey, commissioned by pro-EU group European Movement (EM) Ireland, found that 50% of those polled said it was more likely – up 6% on the 44% of people polled in March 2018.
Some 51% of Leinster said it was likely, while 50% of Connaught/Ulster said it was now more likely, and 43% of people in Munster said it was now more likely.
It shows an increase compared to the previous year’s poll when 42% of participants in Leinster said it was likely, and 46% and 43% of people in Connaught/Ulster and Munster respectively, said they thought it was likely.

The poll of 1,000 people was carried out in the third week of March, meaning it was days out from the UK’s intended exit date from the EU on 29 March.
It also came a month before the riots in Creggan, Co Derry, which prompted renewed efforts from political leaders from across the political divide, to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland.
Those between the ages of 25 to 34 rated highest on the likelihood of a united Ireland at 66%, while 42% in the 55 to 64 age bracket said it was likely.
The questions put to participants of the survey showed there was a favourable opinion among Irish people to remain in the EU.
Some 93% of people said they were in favour of Ireland remaining a member of the EU, 86% of people said the Euro has been positive for Ireland, and 58% said that Brexit had improved their opinion of the EU.
Commenting on the latest results, executive director of EM Ireland said it was “unexpected but welcome to see support has risen yet again in 2019”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-5-4432425-Jan2019/,"THERESA MAY IS facing an uphill battle to save her Brexit deal, and is said to be considering making important concessions to the opposition Labour party to try to secure the support of some of its MPs with Tuesday’s vote looming.
The UK Prime Minister is coming on the back of two defeats in two days in the House of Commons. Firstly, senior members of her own party voted against the government with a vote passing to curb the powers she would have in the event of a no-deal.
Yesterday, MPs voted in favour of the Grieve Amendment, which means May will have to come back to parliament with a Brexit “plan B” within three days if her own Brexit plans are voted down in the vote planned for Tuesday.
In light of the increasing pressure, the prime minister is considering accepting a Labour amendment that would provide additional safeguards on workers’ rights and environmental protections,the BBC reported.
May already cancelled a vote on her Brexit deal before Christmas, after it became apparent she didn’t have the support to get it through.
The main sticking point for Brexiteers, within her own party and the DUP, is the provision of a Northern Ireland backstop in the deal. This backstop would avoid a hard border in Ireland but also keep the UK in regulatory alignment with the EU.
DUP leader Arlene Foster told BBC Newsline yesterday that May’s deal was already “dead” and that the prime minister was continuing to “waste time” trying to get her deal through.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and EU counterparts have repeatedly said they would not make concessions on the backstop.

Veto
Speaking in Ethiopia yesterday, Varadkar said a proposal for Stormont to have a veto over conditions attached to the backstop would not be acceptable.
“I don’t think we could have a situation whereby the Northern Ireland Executive or Assembly had a veto power because that would essentially give one of the two communities a veto power over the other and that would create a difficulty,” the Irish Independent reports him as saying.
Varadkar added that the people of Northern Ireland want to avoid a hard border – something the current Brexit agreement provides for.
There are now mere weeks away before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. With the likelihood of May’s deal being defeated, that leaves a few options left to the UK.
It can seek to delay the date it’s set to leave. It could hold a second referendum, although that appears unlikely at this time. Or it could crash out without a deal.
Today, the House of Commons will begin a second day of debate on Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal.
She has warned that if MPs reject her deal, Britain would still leave the EU on 29 March, with or without any new arrangements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-14-4573603-Apr2019/,"LAST UPDATE|2 Apr 2019
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that she will request another extension to Article 50, saying that although the UK could “make a success” of no-deal, leaving with a deal would be preferable.
“What we need to focus on is our relationship with the EU,” she said, adding that in order to pass a Brexit deal, she would need the support of the opposition.
She said she was offering to sit down with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to work out a way forward, so the UK could leave with a deal, and it was an offer Corbyn agreed to this evening.
Any deal must include her withdrawal agreement, she said.
In a Twitter post this evening, Corbyn said he’d agreed to meet May to ensure a “disastrous no deal outcome is prevented”.
“We also need to ensure we give security and certainty to the people of this country that there will not be a crashing out at the end of this process,” he said.

Any plan agreed by May and Corbyn would be put to the House of Commons for approval next week with a view to bringing it to the European Council summit next week.
She said that if she and the Labour leader could not agree a way forward then a list of options for the UK’s future relationship with the EU would be put to MPs.
She said she wanted the process she set out to be finished by 22 May, so the UK did not have to hold EU elections.
The UK government has until 12 April – Friday week – to propose a plan to the EU or it will crash out without a deal.
European Council president Donald Tusk, reacting via Twitter, said:

May made a public statement following over seven hours of talks with her Cabinet.
It came following events in the House of Commons last night, where MPs voted againstall four alternative optionsto May’s Brexit deal that were on the table.
Tory backlash
After failing to win over enough Brexiteer rebels in her own party to back her withdrawal agreement on three occasions, May’s reaching out to Corbyn has drawn criticism from within the Conservatives.
Boris Johnson, in a series of tweets, said it was “very disappointing” and that the terms Labour would seek, such as a customs union for a softer Brexit, would “in no way resemble what the people were promised when they voted to leave”.
“The PM and cabinet have concluded that any deal is better than no deal, and this is truly a very bad deal indeed – one that leaves us being run by the EU,” he said. “I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as I believe that does not deliver on the referendum.”

Iain Duncan Smith tells me: “This is an utter disaster. Gove is utterly wrong. We are just about to legitimize Corbyn. It is appalling.”
The Prime Minister’s new arrangement also has not impressed the DUP.
The party said in a statement this evening: “The Prime Minister’s lamentable handling of the negotiations with the EU means she has failed to deliver a sensible Brexit deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom. That is why she has not been able to get it through parliament.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eurosceptics-to-discuss-backstop-with-may-4475354-Feb2019/,"THERESA MAY’S GOVERNMENT will discuss alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop with a working group including Eurosceptic MPs, as three days of talks begin today.
The Alternative Arrangements Working Group – with Leave and Remain MPS – will meet for the first time today after the House of Commons voted for May to seek alternative arrangements to the backstop.
EU officials have insisted that the deal – rejected by British lawmakers – is not open for renegotiation.
But May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she would be “battling for Britain and Northern Ireland” in her efforts to get rid of the agreement’s unpopular “backstop” provision.
“If we stand together and speak with one voice, I believe we can find the right way forward,” she said.
Alternative Arrangements
Downing Street said it had established “an Alternative Arrangements Working Group” to mull the backstop issue starting today, and added that “there are a number of ideas on this, including a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit”.
The so-called backstop is intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border with Ireland, but Brexit supporters fear it will keep Britain tied to the EU’s customs rules.
MPs voted last week to send May back to Brussels to renegotiate the clause, suggesting that her deal would then be able to pass after it was roundly rejected in parliament last month.
“I am now confident there is a route that can secure a majority in the House of Commons for leaving the EU with a deal,” she wrote.
“When I return to Brussels I will be battling for Britain and Northern Ireland, I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution.”
Deputy chairman of the Eurosceptic group, Steve Baker MP, tweeted on Sunday to warn the May that there is “trouble ahead”.
The group is expected to hold regular meetings with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay along with other government officials.
The EU insists that the current deal “remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal”, and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that “if the British want to avoid a disorderly Brexit, our offer is on the table”.
But with the clock running down until the 29 March exit date the risks of a no-deal Brexit for both Britain and the bloc are coming into sharp focus.

Nissan blow
Car giant Nissan announced Sunday it was cancelling plans to build its X-Trail SUV at its plant in northeast England, saying that “the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping”.
May said opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn “also believes the potential indefinite nature of the backstop is an issue”, and that the EU has “already accepted the principle of ‘alternative arrangements’ superseding the backstop should it ever be required”.
The backstop would kick in if Britain and the EU have not agreed a trade deal on their future relationship after a limited transition period of up to two years.
The prime minister rejected accusations that plans to reopen the backstop talks risked upsetting the Irish peace process.
“Nor do I have time for those who believe the verdict passed by the British people in 2016 should be overturned before it is even implemented,” she added, referring to the rump of MPs calling for a second referendum.
May has promised MPs that she will bring any revised deal back to be voted on by MPs on 13 February.
Warnings of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit intensified last week as several multinational firms, including Airbus and Ford, said jobs could suffer with an unfavourable negotiating outcome.
Nissan dealt another blow on Sunday by announcing it was shifting future investment away from its largest European plant in Sunderland, northeast England, which employs 7,000 people.
The car giant announced in 2016 that it planned to build its X-Trail model in Sunderland, but will now assemble it instead at Nissan’s global production hub in Kyushu, Japan.
Queen Elizabeth II was even drawn into the fray, with the Sunday Times reporting that the civil service had drawn up plans to whisk away the royal family to a secret location if riots should break out due to no deal, with Buckingham Palace declining to comment on the report.
The Brexit saga has driven a wedge in the heart of both major parties, pitting centrists against their more ideologically driven MPs.
Several rebellious centrist Labour MPs, who want a soft Brexit or to stay in the EU, are mulling forming a new party, according to Sunday’s Observer.
They are disillusioned with the ambiguous stance taken by leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been a long-term eurosceptic but said he voted to Remain in 2016.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rees-mogg-far-right-tweet-4571205-Apr2019/,"JACOB REES-MOGG has defended his decision to share a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany’s far-right political party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
Yesterday evening, the Tory MP tweeted a video of the speech by AfD leader Alice Weidel and quoted her in relation to Brexit:
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
In the speech, Weidel said the German government was partly responsible for Brexit due to its negligence and failure to help the UK.
Last year the party produced election posters with the slogan ‘Islam-free schools!’ showing a group of light-skinned young people in a school corridor – an example that has been cited by people who have criticised Mogg’s Twitter post.

Labour MP David LammyaccusedRees-Mogg of promoting the “racist party”.
“Our country’s proudest moment was defeating the far right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists and isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win,” he said.
We have to deal with the AFD on the Council of Europe. One of their reps claims that 'muslims in Europe are seeking to kill all germans'.

Speaking toLBC radio, Rees-Mogg denied he was supporting the AfD.
“This is a speech made in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit,” he said.
“It is saying to Germans, you’re paying more for this and Angela Merkel has tied herself in knots with the French to the disadvantage of the Germans.
“I don’t think retweeting is an endorsement of things that other people stand for. It’s just pointing out that there’s something interesting which is worth watching.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-uk-us-trade-deal-4509159-Feb2019/,"THE US CONGRESS won’t support any trade deal with the UK post-Brexit that undermines the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.
As the deadline for the UK to leave the EU approaches, there has been speculation of a UK-US trade deal post-Brexit.
However, speaking at a Fine Gael event tonight, he said US politicians will not countenance such a deal if it threatens the open border.

In his speech this evening, Varadkar had some harsh words for the House of Commons:
“Westminster might be the mother of all parliaments but it’s not the boss of other parliaments and I know the European Parliament will not vote for a withdrawal agreement that does not do right by Ireland. And I don’t believe the United States Congress will agree to any trade between the US and the UK that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement and the open border between North and South.”
Today, the Irish government published its Brexit omnibus Bill for the scenario of a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking this morning, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the EU will work to give assurances to the UK parliament about the backstop, Ireland’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border, which is preventing the deal getting the green light from Westminster.
The Taoiseach also spoke about domestic issues, such as homelessness, stating that the government is making progress.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeremy-hunt-brexit-lassie-4435812-Jan2019/,"BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY Jeremy Hunt said that the story of Lassie holds a “lesson for all of us” during a debate about Brexit.
The Tory minister was responding to questions from Labour shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry during the third day of debates on Brexit, ahead of next Tuesday’s crucial vote on the Withdrawal Agreement.
Thornberry took aim at Hunt’s description of the UK’s international relationships post-Brexit as “the invisible chain”, which he used during a trip to Singapore last week.

After an eruption of laughter, Thornberry continued that British ministers weren’t waiting for unicorns to come over the hill, alluding to the impossibility of getting the Brexit deal that everyone is happy with, but were instead waiting for Lassie.
She added: “The health secretary with his invisible green paper on social care, the Transport Secretary with his invisible ferries and his invisible traffic jams, and of course the Prime Minister running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit.”
When Hunt responded, he said that Lassie Come Home was one of his “favourite childhood films”. Drawing on a separate comparison, Hunt responded:
Earlier, Hunt had pressed the Labour MP on whether her party wanted to limit the free movement of people, to which she replied they did.
He rounded off the debate by telling MPs that Brexit would allow the UK for the first time in over 40 years to respond to public concern by “restoring sovereign control over immigration policy, part of which is of course being generous to EU citizens who live amongst us and contribute so magnificently to our national life”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-indicative-votes-4561086-Mar2019/,"LAST NIGHT, MPs in the House of Commons votedto give themselves greater control of the Brexit process, as it enters its potential endgame.
A week may be a long time in politics, but a week in Brexit is something else entirely as the vote last night by MPs comes after weeks and months of political wrangling and upheaval.
So, what happened last night? Will it make a difference? Is a deal or a no-deal now more or less likely?
The Letwin amendment
What MPs were voting on last night was dubbed the Letwin Amendment, proposed by Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin.
His amendment proposed that MPs take control of business in the House of Commons on Wednesday away from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government. This would allow MPs to vote on what type of Brexit it wants, through a series of indicative votes.
By 329 votes to 302, MPs voted in favour of the Letwin Amendment. Conservatives were whipped to vote in favour of the government, but the prime minister had 29 rebels within her party voting against the whip.
MPs voted to set their own agenda for the House of Commons rather than follow May’s. This is a significant step that had not won enough backing in recent months.
But what are indicative votes?
BBC Newsnight/ YouTube
So, indicative votes are when MPs aren’t just given one option to vote on – they’re given many of them.
For Theresa May’s meaningful votes on her Brexit withdrawal agreement, MPs were given the option of either accepting or rejecting the prime minister’s deal.
In the case of indicative votes on Brexit, it’ll mean that MPs can vote on whether they want Theresa May’s deal, a no-deal Brexit, a second referendum, a customs’ union etc.
However, this of course also opens the possibility that there is no majority of MPs for any one option. And, furthermore, two opposed stances – such as no-deal and a second referendum – could theoretically have a majority voting in favour of them (although this is of course unlikely).
The order in which these options are voted on will make a difference to how MPs sway.
If a no-deal is first on the table and MPs rule it out, the rest of the options put to them will be some sort of deal – but is there a majority for any one of them?
Similarly, if everything else is ruled out and a no-deal is the last vote – what then?
Prime Minister May said herself that she was sceptical of an indicative votes strategy as it could lead to “contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all”.
Will this make a difference?
That’s where the narrative of MPs “taking back control” of the Brexit process runs into problems.
Indicative votes from MPs in the House of Commons are not binding on the UK government.
If, for example, an indicative vote on a second referendum was passed by a majority of MPs, Theresa May is not obliged to hold one.
Advertisement
She is free to ignore an indicative vote if she chooses to do so.
However, with May under such severe pressure from inside her party, from the opposition and from Europe, it will take an extraordinary feat of political maneuvering to ignore the will of parliament after she specifically blamed MPs last week for not being able to decide anything.
With the Brexit impasse dominating for so long, if British MPs finally agreed on some way – any way – forward, the political pressure on Theresa May to follow this will be intense.
Even with that, then there’s Europe.
Following years of negotiations, the EU agreed a withdrawal agreement with the UK. The House of Commons has rejected it twice and the EU said it is not willing to reopen this agreement.
If there is to be a radical change in how Britain says it will leave the EU – as long as it still wants to leave with some sort of deal – then a long delay to Brexit could be likely.
What about Theresa May’s deal?
May continues to cling to power amidst increasing pressure on her leadership, with the hope that she can still somehow get her withdrawal agreement through parliament.
She had originally hoped to hold a third meaningful vote on her deal this week, but told the House of Commons yesterday she currently doesn’t have enough support to pass through parliament.
Meanwhile, the DUP continues to remain a roadblock in May’s plans.
Hardline Brexiteers had indicated that they would vote for May’s deal if the DUP were happy with it; but the DUP have thus far only called for changes to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, which May flatly ruled out in parliament yesterday.
The extension offered by the European Union last week indicates that the UK parliament must offer a new way forward, or else it would leave the EU without a deal on 12 April.
If May’s deal passes, the UK would leave the EU on 22 May.
With MPs voting to take control of business in the House of Commons tomorrow, the prime minister has little chance of getting her deal through this week.
But, the deal has come back from the dead before, and we may not have seen the last of it just yet.
Does this make either a deal or a no-deal more likely?
Predicting what’ll happen next in Brexit is fraught with difficulty, given how fluidly the situation has changed so often in recent months.
The next real indication we’ll get of what kind of Brexit will eventually happen will be following the results of the indicative votes tomorrow in Westminster.
MPs voting to set their own agenda does suggest the potential for a majority for a softer Brexit where the UK remains within a customs union, and that’ll be made clearer tomorrow.
But what actually happens there could make the situation no clearer – if there’s no majority for anything and with the potential for May to simply ignore the results.
One thing is clear – after the short extension granted to the UK, it only has two weeks to decide what its next steps are.
As is always the case with Brexit, time is running out.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-vote-4549451-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Mar 2019
THE BRITISH CABINET is meeting today to discuss how to proceed with Brexit negotiations.
The process was thrown into doubt yesterday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said Prime Minister Theresa May cannot have another meaningful vote on her Brexit deal if changes are not made to it.
Bercow said MPs from both sides of the House had expressed concerns to him about being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
“This has given us quite a lot to think about in the immediate term. There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session – but we are now talking about not just days but hours to the 29th of March,” Buckland told BBC News.
Asked about this statement,May’s official spokesman today said: “If you were to look back to the speech which the Prime Minister gave just before ‘meaningful vote two’, she said that if MPs did not support ‘meaningful vote two’ we would be in a crisis.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.
Despite this, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has suggested a vote could still take place next week.

Barclay told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme, however, “serious consideration” is being given to Bercow’s intervention and that it is important to “respect the referee”.
Last week, MPs backed a motion calling for Brexit to be delayed until 30 June. The vote isn’t legally binding and the EU must agree to any delay. Brexit is due to officially happen in just 10 days
‘Can’t be renegotiated’
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea. Negotiations to get the DUP and other MPs onside are ongoing behind the scenes.

European leaders, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, have repeatedly said the deal can’t be renegotiated. Varadkar met European Council President Donald Tusk in Dublin this morning and Brexit was at the top of the agenda.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney is due to meet Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, and Europe’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today.

BRITISH MPS WILL vote on a number of Brexit options today in a bid to find a path forward after rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for a third time last Friday.
Finding a consensus has proved impossible to date – last Wednesday MPs rejected eight options put to them in a series of indicative votes.
The proposals with themost supportwere a UK-wide customs union with the EU and a second referendum.
House Speaker John Bercow is set to choose which motions MPs will vote on – fewer options are likely to be put before the House of Commons in a bid to make progress.
Theeight possible optionsare as follows:
The debate is expected to begin at around 2.30pm, with voting taking place at 8pm.
MPs are also set to discuss an online petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked, and Brexit effectively cancelled, which has received oversix million signaturesto date.

After failing to back the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain must now put forward an alternative plan, which could include asking for a longer extension, before 12 April or face leaving the European Union without a deal.
An extraordinary EU summit is set to be held on 10 April.
In a failed attempt to win over more support, May offered her own resignation if MPs backed her deal. Her future still hangs in the balance, with many people suggesting a general election is needed to break the impasse.
If a delay beyond 22 May is secured, Britain could have to take part in the European Parliament elections.
Running out of patience
Frustration is growing within the EU, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday telling an Italian TV station that the EU is running out of patience with Britain.

“With our British friends we have had a lot of patience, but even patience is running out,” Juncker told Italian public TV channel Rai 1.
However, there appears to be momentum behind a plan to seek a deal that would see Britain stay in some kind of customs union with the EU.
While this may satisfy the pro-EU members of May’s Cabinet, it threatens mass rebellion among the rest of her ministers, posing a serious threat to the government’s survival.
Brexit-supporting minister Andrea Leadsom has organised a letter signed by 10 Cabinet members demanding that there be no further extension beyond 22 May, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
The letter also spells out that May must stand by her party’s manifesto pledge to leave the customs union in order to be able to strike post-Brexit trade deals with other countries.
General election threat
Agreeing to seek a customs union, if demanded by MPs, could therefore trigger a mass ministerial walkout.
However, ignoring MPs’ instructions could result in the same scenario; some pro-EU ministers have already quit and vote against the government.
All of which leaves a general election looking ever more likely, with May last week stating: “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.”
Conservative MPs across the board said they would block such a move, which requires two-thirds support in parliament.
Party support has slipped by 7% to 36%, according an opinion poll in the Sunday Mail, putting Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour (41%) on course to be the largest party if an election is held.

“I don’t think an election would solve anything. Time is of the essence, we have got Brexit to deliver. We don’t want to add any more unnecessary delay,” he toldSophy Ridge on Sky News.
The poll also found narrow support for a second referendum.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has been defeated in the House of Commons yet again – the third time she has failed to get her withdrawal deal through parliament.
In a vote this afternoon, MPs voted against her deal by 344 votes to 286 votes – a majority of 58.
There are now very few options left to May going forward.
She must now go back to Brussels and seek a longer extension to Article 50, delaying Brexit for a much greater time period.
Or the UK will now crash out of the EU on 12 April.
Speaking to the House of Commons following the vote, May said: “The legal default is the UK is due to leave in 14 days’ time.”

An alternative way forward must be agreed now, she said.
It is almost certain to involve an extension.
“Mr Speaker, I fear we are reaching the limits of the process in this house,” she said.
“This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.
In light of the result, EU President Donald Tusk has decided to call a European Council meeting on 10 April.

The European Commission has said “it will be for the UK to indicate the way forward” before 12 April, for consideration by the European Council.
The Commission said in a statement that Britain crashing out of the EU in a no-deal Brexit on 12 April is now a “likely scenario”.
“The EU will remain united. The benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement, including a transitional period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a no-deal scenario,” it said, adding that “sectoral mini-deals are not an option”.
Acknowledging today’s vote, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said “it is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a no deal scenario”.
“Ireland has been preparing intensively for a no deal scenario. But no one should underestimate the difficulties that a no deal will present, for all of us, including the UK. It is not clear that the UK has fully understood that no deal is not off the agenda. Rather, it’s a growing possibility,” Varadkar said.
He added that “we must be open to a long extension should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit and put back on the table some options previously ruled out”.
Varadkar said he believes this will “result in a generous and understanding response” from the 27 EU member states.
MPs’ reaction
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told the House of Commons that the only option now is for May to go and call a general election.
Green MP Caroline Lucas has said it’s “grotesque” that May cannot see her deal is dead.
The newly-formed Independent Group MP Heidi Allen said: “We must have a people’s vote now.”
Repeatedly, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said planned arrangements for the Irish border after Brexit are unacceptable.
In a statement this afternoon, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP reiterated that the party does not believe the Withdrawal Agreement is the best way forward for the UK.
“In our recent discussions with the Government good progress has been made on how domestic legislation would assist in ensuring the economic integrity of the UK as a whole and recognising Northern Ireland’s particular situation sharing a land border with the European Union,” Dodds said.
“We deeply regret the numerous missed opportunities by those who negotiated on behalf of the UK to listen to our warnings about the dangers of the backstop and to take steps to remedy those deficiencies.”
He added that in the coming weeks, the DUP “will continue to play a central role to chart a route that respects the democratic desire to leave the European Union but that does so in a way that strengthens our United Kingdom”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-8-4476394-Feb2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will visit Northern Ireland today to give a speech on Brexit.
May is set to reaffirm the UK’s commitment that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic post-Brexit.
With less than two months until Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March, concerns are growing over the risk of a no-deal Brexit.
During her visit to the North, May will also meet with local businesses and community groups.

The trip to the North comes asMay’s governmentmet yesterday to discuss alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop with a working group including Eurosceptic MPs, as three days of talks begin today.
‘Alternative arrangements’
The Alternative Arrangements Working Group – with Leave and Remain MPs – met for the first time yesterday after the House of Commons voted for May to seek alternative arrangements to the backstop.
EU officials have insisted that the deal – which has been rejected by Westminster – is not open for renegotiation.
But May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she would be “battling for Britain and Northern Ireland” in her efforts to get rid of the agreement’s unpopular “backstop” provision.
The so-called backstop is intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border with Ireland, but Brexit supporters fear it will keep Britain tied to the EU’s customs rules.
Related ReadsCommissioner says there's no plan to move 600 gardaí to border - but what WILL happen?Brexit 66 days out, but Irish government says there are 'absolutely no preparations for a hard border'
MPs voted last week to send May back to Brussels to renegotiate the clause, suggesting that her deal would then be able to pass after it was roundly rejected in parliament last month.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the withdrawal agreement does allow for alternatives to the backstop – but only if they work.
He said the problem has always been that none of the other ideas around alternative arrangements for the border have actually “stood up to scrutiny”, he said.
“We certainly haven’t seen any that have,” said Coveney.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-deal-third-vote-explainer-4542920-Mar2019/,"AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL Agreement was first defeated in the House of Commons by a historic majority of 230 votes, all the way back in January, Theresa May told her parliament that it wasn’t good enough to vote against something, they had to vote for something.
Last night, they voted against no deal. And tonight, while they haven’t quite voted FOR something, they have at least voted to ask for more time to figure out what to do.
In the midst of the coming process, it’s hoped consensus will at last build behind a plan that a majority of MPs can get behind.
How long that takes is another question altogether.
A majority of413parliamentariansvoted tonightin favour of delaying the date the UK is due to leave the EU, with202voting against the government’s motion.
The motion proposed seeking an extension until 30 June and noted that if the House passed the withdrawal agreement by next Wednesday then the three month extension would be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
Tonight’s vote is a statement of intent, but isn’t actually legally binding.
However, it does give May a legitimate reason to hold another vote on her battered Brexit deal, considering that that proposal was within the evening’s main motion.
As recently as Tuesday MPs voted down her deal by a majority of 149 votes. That wasdespite new assurances from the EU on Monday nightto address Brexiteers’ fears of being trapped in the backstop mechanism.
The new proposals suggested an arbitration system to deal with any disputes that might arise between the EU and UK if the backstop had to be activated.
Brexiteers – including the DUP and members of Tory group the ERG – said on Tuesday that these new assurances didn’t go far enough, arguing that if no one “acted in bad faith” the UK would be trapped in the backstop indefinitely anyway.
They used analysis from attorney general Geoffrey Cox to back up their position: Cox told the House of Commons that his earlier advice – that the backstop could“endure indefinitely”without a time limit or exit mechanism – remained true.

Tonight’s vote, despite it being the first victory of the week for Theresa May, also showed what a slim grasp she has on her party.
Among those who opposed the Prime Minister’s extension were Cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (who, bizarrely, had argued in favour of the motion in the debate earlier today).
The government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote.
Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (an ex-Brexit Secretary) also voted against the extension. The original former Brexit secretary, David Davis, voted to back May’s motion and delay Brexit.
The Conservative MPs who voted against the government motion tonight will not face punishment, as a free vote had been offered by May.

Many Brexiteers fear any extension to the exit date will make Brexit more unlikely (with the prospect of Brexit not taking place at all becoming more likely the longer that extension goes on).
Now what?
It’s now up to the EU to agree to grant an extension, and it needs the agreement of all EU Council members – ie, the leaders of remaining 27 EU countries – to sign off.
Up until now, EU leaders have said that without good reason, there would be no extension.In the wordsof Taoiseach Leo Varadkar:
Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who heads the EU Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, put it more forcefully:
The EU Council is due to meet next Thursday 21 and Friday 22 March; it’s expected that the ‘Meaningful Vote 3′ will be held in the House of Commons before then.

The likelihood of May passing her deal this time is significantly higher than before as parliament runs out of other options.

They may not like the deal but Brexiteers have argued that the UK has lost its leverage in negotiations in the wake of the votes ruling out a no-deal Brexit at any point (yesterday) and in favour of postponing Brexit day (tonight).
Already, efforts are under way to get Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP on board. Reports have emerged suggesting the ERG and the unionists could be persuaded to change their votes if Cox could offer refined advice.
Asked by the Guardianwhether he would vote for the deal if the DUP were happy with it, ERG leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said:
Arlene Foster, speaking in the US, indicated today that a deal still could be reached, saying: “When you come to the end of a negotiation that’s when you really start to see the whites in people’s eyes and you get down to the point where you can make a deal.”
EU elections
If parliament rejects Theresa May’s deal again, then the UK could request an extension longer than three months in order to avoid a cliff-edge exit at the end of this month.
This could mean that the UK would have to run candidates in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 24 May – something that the prime minister has said she’s dead set against.
An extension until 30 June would mean Brexit happening the day before the new EU Parliament sits. Ukip founder Nigel Farage has already said that he would run as a ‘Brexit MEP’ if the UK was compelled to run candidates.
Earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney spoke of a possible Brexit postponement of 21 months, saying that it would “give a long reflection period for the British political system to look at how they want to approach Brexit again”.
This could mean holding a general election in order to gain a majority in the House for some sort of Brexit, or even holding a second referendum.
Columnist Jonathan Freedland,writing in The Guardian tonight, argues that Theresa May finally has the Brexiteers where she wants them.
“The ERG and DUP either swallow their objections and vote for May’s deal, or they face the prospect of a long delay to Brexit – perhaps for the best part of two years. Given the mayhem on show these past few days, who would bet what might happen to their precious Brexit project between now and 2021? They might lose it altogether.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/indicative-votes-brexit-4562736-Mar2019/,"A SERIES OF indiviactive votes about Brexit is set to be held in the House of Commons today as pressure mounts on British Prime Minister Theresa May to resign.
On Monday, a majority of MPs (329 to 302) voted to seize control of parliamentary business and vote on their preferences for how to break the Brexit deadlock.
MPs will today have the chance to vote on various options such as revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit, holding another referendum, a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leaving the European Union without a deal.
The Brexit ministry said it was “disappointed” by Monday’s vote, adding that it “upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent”.
Even if MPs decide a majority course of action today, it won’t be legally binding and could be ignored by the government.
“The government will continue to call for realism — any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU,” the Brexit ministry said.
May herself said she is “sceptical” about the process and that similar efforts in the past “produced contradictory outcomes or no outcomes at all”.
Debate about the votes could begin straight after prime minister’s questions at around 12.45pm.
If any other business needs to be discussed at this time, Speaker of the House John Bercow is under instruction to interrupt this at 2pm and hand control over to parliament, asoutlined by The Guardian.
After a debate on the various proposals, MPs are expected to start voting at 7pm and the results are due to be announced between 8.30pm and 10pm.
Calls for resignation

As May continutes her attempts to get MPs to back her Brexit deal, backbench Tory MPs are expected to call on her to resign at a meeting of the 1922 Committee this evening.
Nigel Evans, joint executive secretary of the 1922 Committee,told Sky News: “If the prime minister announces a timetable of departure, I think that’s going to swing a lot of people behind her deal, we could get it over the line.”
Earlier this week May admitted that she didn’t have enough support to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons on her third attempt.
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson yesterdayadvocated for a no-deal Brexit, while fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would back May’s deal if the DUP gets behind it.
Speaking on the Conservative Home podcast, Rees-Mogg said May’s deal is “better than not leaving at all”.
On Monday, the House of Commons is set to debatean online petitionthat calls for the Brexit process to be reversed. It has gathered over 5.8 million signatures to date.
No deal
The European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU this Friday, 29 March.
The European Commission on Monday said it hascompleted preparationsfor a no-deal Brexit, noting “it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April”.

THERESA MAY’S WEEK isn’t going to plan.
That’s pretty much par for the course. Her year so far hasn’t been smooth sailing either.
But a surprise move from the speaker of the Commons and threats of revolt within her cabinet in the last few days meant the British prime minister had to radically alter her intended schedule for this week.
That led toangry scenes in parliamentthis afternoon as May told MPs she intended to ask for an extension of the UK’s exit time from the EU by three months and appeared to take any longer delay off the table entirely.
So what led to today’s change of tack?
Where does that leave us ahead of tomorrow’s meeting of EU leaders in Brussels?
And what are the scenarios that could play out in the coming weeks?
Theresa May wrote a letter to the EU seeking a brief delay to Brexit.
Shetold the House of Commonsshe had written to European Council President Donald Tusk “informing him that the UK seeks an extension … to June 30″.
The European Commission, meanwhile, had advised EU leaders that a shorter delay until 23 May (the date of the European elections) or a much longer one until at least the end of 2019 would be preferable.
May’s under pressure from all sides in Westminster over her latest position on an extension: some Brexiteers want her to stick to 29 March, while others, including Remainers, would prefer a longer period to allow time to figure out a different strategy.
Stuck as she is between several rocks and numerous hard places, May indicated in strong terms today that she would quit as prime minister if the exit date was pushed out beyond 30 June, telling the Commons:

PM@Theresa_Mayhas written to@eucopresidentDonald Tusk on Brexithttps://t.co/2rrQwf8cYGpic.twitter.com/WjutyC507d
The way thingswere stacking up last week, indications were that May would make a third attempt to get the EU withdrawal agreement through the Commons in time for the EU summit getting underway tomorrow.
In the wake of the votes to reject a no-deal exit (last Wednesday) and extend Article 50 (Thursday last) efforts were already under way to get Tory Eurosceptics in the ERG and the ten DUP MPs on board.
The hope was that if the DUP could be convinced to back the twice-rejected deal it was unlikely Jacob Rees-Mogg and his group would out-unionist the unionists and might finally move on their position.
If the deal had been passed by this evening, May could have headed to Brussels seeking her short, technical extension and in all likelihood EU leaders would have acceded.
If it had been rejected, the implication given by May last week was that a much longer extension would be needed. She said last Wednesday:

However, to sum up the series of unfortunate events of the last seven days:
Hence the message to the EU from May today: We need a short extension so I can get this withdrawal agreement through at the third time of asking and if you force us into a longer extension I’ll probably quit.
May was thrown a lifeline by Tusk this afternoon when he told reporters a short extension would be possible but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the Commons.
“In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days, I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons,”Tusk said.
He sounded reasonably positive about the 30 June date saying it “has its merits” but created “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”. He wouldn’t hesitate, he said, to call an emergency EU summit next week if the meaningful vote did not pass.
Tusk was also speaking by phone to Leo Varadkar today, and in Dublin the Taoiseach told reporters that the proposed length of the extension would be discussed in detail at tomorrow’s summit.

Varadkar said it was time to cut the UK “some slack” on the extension time as there was a real risk of a no-deal happening by accident.
The soundings from elsewhere in Europe are less positive for May, however.
Earlier a spokesperson for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he had warned May in a phonecall that Brexit needed to be complete by 23 May if the UK wanted to avoid having to take part in EU elections.
France’s foreign minister meanwhile warned the country was prepared to veto an extension unless May presented a credible strategy at the summit.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
There are various scenarios that could play out over the coming days, weeks and months.
Deal:May gets her deal through next week after returning from Brussels, arguing in the Commons that she’s secured further reassurances from Europe and that the proposition is now substantially different. The UK exits after a short extension.
No deal:Given that we have only nine days to go and the fact that EU leaders need to agree unanimously to extending Article 50, a no-deal could still happen either by the summer or by 29 March (Friday week).
A long extension:The emergency summit Tusk mooted in his comments today could result in an offer of a longer delay from the EU. As this would mean taking part in EU elections, May is extremely unlikely to accept thisandmanage to stay in office. But, those factors aside, a longer extension could pave the way for a rethink by MPs and a possible softer Brexit (or possibly no Brexit at all) – perhaps in the wake of a general election, second referendum or both.
Revoke Article 50:Both sides need to agree to extending the mechanism the UK is using to leave the EU, but the European Court of Justice ruled in December that London can unilaterally halt the process. May has dismissed this option and it’s one of the more unlikely scenarios.
May could quit:Going by her remarks in the Commons today, the implication is clear that she is threatening to resign if forced into a corner by the EU requiring a longer extension.
She could be forced out:At the moment she can’t be shown the door by her own party under the official process after a bid to unseat her failed last December. The way things are going, however, she may be vulnerable if Jeremy Corbyn tables a no-confidence motion.
Neither of the latter scenarios would necessarily solve anything at all and would result in a divisive Tory leadership campaign, a possible split in the party and a possible general election.
There’s a chance a no-deal Brexit could still have happened by accident somewhere in the middle of all that.

THERESA MAY’S TOPPLE from the pinnacle of British power had been predicted for quite a while – andthis morning, it came to pass.
It came after what she called her final push for anew Brexit planisolated more of her supporters, when it did the “classic Theresa May” deed of trying to make everyone happy and pleasing no one.
Then Andrea Leadsom, a senior Brexiteer in May’s party and who challenged Theresa May for the Tory leadership in 2016, resigned earlier this week over May’s handling of the slowly-unfolding crisis.
“I no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum results,” Leadsom said in her resignation letter.
A number of Cabinet members requested a meeting with May, in what was expected to be a push for her to resign from the role – and this all unfolded on the eve of the European elections, where the Tories are expected to lose massively.
May cancelled all meetings that were due to be held with senior figures, signalling the end was near. This morning, she stood outside 10 Downing Street and delivered what is probably her final speech as official Prime Minister, to say that she was to step down as Conservative Party leader.
May will stay on until a successor is appointed.
In her speech, she detailed the battle she’d had to try and get her Brexit deal passed.
But as she neared the end of her speech, where she spoke of her pride in doing an important job in serving “the country I love”, her voice broke.

She had hinted at this on Tuesday, when she revealed “ten legal changes” to her Brexit deal:
A slow-motion downfall
It’s been a long road to get to this point. We’ve had endless uses of the words “last-ditch attempt” in relation to May’s Brexit policies, and had columns heralding the end of Theresa May’s tenure at 10 Downing Street, only for her to last weeks or months more.
In 2017, George Osborne told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Showthat Theresa May was “a dead woman walking” after she lost the Conservative’s majority in the June 2017 general election. (May ended up forming a government with the support of the DUP’s 10 MPs, which now will not vote for her Brexit deal over concerns about the backstop).
“Theresa May is a dead woman walking, it’s just how long is she going to remain on death row… I think we will know very shortly, we could easily get to the middle of next week and it all collapse, or if it doesn’t, it will be delayed.”

After the historic defeat of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement in January (which was rejected by 432 votes to 202 in the House of Commons), commentators said that in previous similar situations, such a vote would be“unsurvivable”.

At the time, the Daily Mail said May’s power was left “hanging by a thread”, and one commentator in The Times described her as a “zombie prime minister”.
But she survived the motion of no confidence tabled by Labour with relative ease, as rebel Tories and the DUP sided with May rather than facing a general election or risking propelling Jeremy Corbyn to 10 Downing Street.
This also meant that another motion of no confidence couldn’t be called for another year; despite her having no clout in parliament to pass her Brexit deal, or any other government legislation, she was to remain in power for the foreseeable, leading to the phrase “she’s in office, but not in power” being used often.
Repeated attempts at coups, or predictions of her resignation have been based on frustration with her Brexit deal and failure to control her Cabinet, but ultimately May has stayed in power due to the time constraint the UK has been under to negotiate a Brexit deal before the various Brexit deadlines, and the reluctance from other candidates in taking on the task of uniting a country that seems irrevocably divided.
Now that there is more time to hold a Tory leadership contest, and off the back of what looks like a strong surge for the Brexit party, the pathway seems more clear for those vying to be the next leader of the Conservative Party (cc: Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab, and Jeremy Hunt).

Onthe Sean O’Rourke Showearlier this week, The London Times’ parliamentary sketch writer Quentin Letts said that Theresa May is “banjaxed”.
“She’s a goner and with her goes this Bill, I think. It’s not entirely clear because she’s holed up in Downing Street like a woodlouse… you know when you touch a woodlouse and it curls up into a ball? Well she’s doing that basically at the moment and it’s an odd day that we face in politics.”
So what has pushed her to the end of her premiership so suddenly? A mixture of another big Brexit announcement that amounted to nothing, pushing forward with a plan that pleases no one, and having the time and space to appoint a new Tory leader.
The signs for a quick resignation were there when the publishing of May’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which was scheduled for today, was cancelled.
May had said previously that if the Bill failed, the choice would be a no-deal Brexit or else revoking Article 50. If Boris Johnson is appointed as the next Prime Minister, the former of those two options is almost inevitable.
So what’s next?

The European elections have just been held in the UK; it’s widely predicted that the Brexit party will win the lion’s share of the MEP seats, in what will be another crushing electoral defeat for the Tory party. Perhaps good timing then for May to step down.
The results will be announced on Sunday, along with the other EU elections results from across Europe.
Notably, US President Donald Trump will visit the UK between Monday 3 and Wednesday 5 June. Jeremy Hunt had earlier said that May will be Prime Minister when Trump visits, and indeed undoubtedly she will still be in place.
When David Cameron resigned in 2016, he stayed on as Prime Minister while the Tories selected a new leader. In that race, Theresa May was chosen after candidates took each other out or self-sabotaged their chances.
Whoever is chosen next will have to negotiate a minority government with the DUP, who you’d imagine, would be happy to remain in government for a bit longer. After that, expect talks with EU officials, rumours of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, and statements proclaiming a no-deal Brexit “more likely than ever”.
A general election in the UK is likely in that time;Peter Wilding, a former adviser of David Cameron’s and the first person to use the word ‘Brexit’, reckons that a general election will be held in October, another extension will be requested from the EU by 31 October, and ultimately, Brexit won’t happen at all.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-theresa-may-4650001-May2019/,"A NO-DEAL crash out Brexit is “more likely than it’s been at any point”, according to Tánaiste Simon Coveney.
Theresa Mayannounced this morningthat she will step down as Conservative leader on 7 June, paving the way for a Tory leadership contest with the eventual winner set to take over as British prime minister.
She will remain in the post until a successor is appointed. A Conservative Party leadership contest will now get underway in earnest
With May stepping aside,speculation is rifethat Brexiteer Boris Johnson might take her place, placing a question mark over the future of the agreed withdrawal agreement.
“I think anything is possible now. Britain needs to be careful. From an EU perspective, patience has run out. The EU wants to get on with very challenging political questions,” Coveneytold Newstalk today.
Coveney said he and the Taoiseach will “ensure Irish interests are protected”.

He said the withdrawal agreement “has negotiated and compromised over a three-year period”, reiterating the agreement can’t be reopened.
Extension possible
“The assumption that some have in the UK that they’ll simply be able to ask for another extension, and they’ll get it with no strings attached, is naive. An extension is possible, it’s likely.
“I think many in the UK see this process as humiliating to Britain. It’s a proud country, a great country. People in Britain are sick of it. They want to move. I’d love Britain to stay in the EU. Everybody is losing here. I think the reality is that Britain is likely to leave and there’ll be more and more pressure on whoever is in government to deliver,” he added.
Coveney criticised UK politician Jacob Rees-Mogg’s argument that neither Ireland or the UK want a border, and therefore it there’s little to be concerned about.#
“That’s a nonsense argument. If there’s a no deal Brexit, Ireland will have a responsibility to work with EU and UK to protect the EU single market. We will have to put some mechanism in place. We know that it’s complicated, and very difficult to do that and avoid physical checks on the border. What we will not do is create a security risk. We’ve been engaging with the EU for some time,” he said.
He added:
Coveney said there is a lot political grandstanding, adding that Irish position cannot be abandoned.

“A hard Brexit seems almost impossible to avoid after Prime Minister Theresa May said she would stand down, the acting spokeswoman for the Spanish government said today.
“A hard Brexit seems a reality that is almost impossible to avoid,” Isabel Celaa said in a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting.
The Spanish government has contingency plans in place for all eventual outcomes over Britain’s planned exit from Europe, Celaa added.
Speaking yesterday, ahead of May’s resignation, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Brexit is very much going to be back centre stage because of political changes in London and the European elections.
“These are dangerous times in the European Union,” added Coveney, stating “things are changing, politics is going to come more divisive, the relationship that we have with our closest neighbour is one that we have to protect and value and we need to respect their decision, but we also need to protect Irish interests and ensure they are understood and are protected in terms of any final arrangements”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-brexit-extension-4580311-Apr2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said it’s possible, but unlikely, that another EU country could veto a proposal from the UK for a longer Brexit extension, but added Ireland doesn’t want an extension that “just allows for more indecision”.
With Theresa May already signalling her wish to extend Brexit until 30 June to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal next Friday, Varadkar said that any country who vetoes that proposal “wouldn’t be forgiven” for it.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Countrywide earlier, he said: “Obviously we don’t want no deal because of the impact it will have on citizens, businesses, farmers and the agri-food industry.
He was speaking amid increasing frustrations from Europe as to how the UK is handling the Brexit process, ahead of a crunch EU summit this week.

Varadkar said that countries most at risk from a no-deal Brexit, including Ireland, have asked for “patience and solidarity” from the other EU countries.
“Today we have got that and I think that will continue,” he said.
So far, the House of Commons has rejected Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times and has failed to support a number of alternatives.
The impasse has led to May reaching out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try reach some sort of consensus on Brexit. Chancellor Philip Hammond said today that he expects that the Conservatives will reach “some form of agreement” with Labour.
In lieu of a deal with Labour, it is not clear how May could proceed with getting her Brexit deal through the House of Commons by 30 June, with Varadkar saying his option at this stage is for a longer extension.

https://www.thejournal.ie/peter-wilding-brexit-4588591-Apr2019/,"THE WORD ‘BREXIT’ was first used in May 2010 during the eurozone crisis, when there was a real threat of Greece crashing out of the European Union.
At the time, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis were immersed in intensive talks with EU leaders about how to salvage the country from huge debt.
If they couldn’t reach an agreement, Grexit was an almost inevitable outcome – and Peter Wilding thought that the UK was stumbling towards a something similar.
In a piece called ‘Stumbling towards the Brexit’, Wilding described the UK establishment’s fractured relationship with the EU, and a swell in anti-European rhetoric:
“Unless a clear view is pushed that Britain must lead in Europe at the very least to achieve the completion of the Single Market, then the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word, Brexit.”
It wasn’t until 2016 when representatives of the Oxford English Dictionary called him that he was told that the word had been traced back to him as the first person to use it. It was then made the dictionary’s word of the year.
Wilding isn’t just another political pundit – he’s a former solicitor in EU law, former media director of the UK’s Conservative Party and former advisor to then-British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Having coined the term gives him some claim to infamy, he says, but it also gives him a claim to what it actually means. So what does it mean to him?
“It’s a grim word, but it could have been a unifying, positive word,” he says.
“Theresa May could have stood up at the Tory party conference in 2016 and said ‘We voted to leave the EU but we’ll stay in the economic institution’.”
Instead, Theresa May’s red lines have led to this stalemate in parliament, and “a catharsis” from government that have led to an extension, and could lead to a split of the Tory party.
“I’m a realist, but my final conclusion is quite optimistic; it’s that we will never leave – we didn’t leave on 29 March, we didn’t leave on 12 April, and I don’t expect any tricks by 31 October. The general mood is one of despair and frustration.”
Does he regret coining the term ‘Brexit’?
“I wouldn’t have if I’d copyrighted the word.”
Did he look into it?
“You’re damn right I did, but you can’t copyright a word.”
Frank VinciniFrank Vincini
As Cameron’s advisor during the EU referendum campaign, what does Wilding think the UK government did wrong when arguing in favour of Remain?
“By that time, in 2012, I was getting to know that the British government had no strategy with regards to the EU,” Wilding says.
“I suddenly saw the Conservative government was simply sleepwalking with regards its EU policy. Cameron and parliament were ignorant of the EU and how it worked.”
Wilding is now the director of a pro-Europe pressure group ‘British Influence’, and has taken a legal challenge that argues that parliament must separately give permission before the British government can pull the UK out of the European Economic Area (which the UK is part of as a member of the EU).
He said that underneath the euro crisis and the migrant crisis, an anti-EU sentiment was building, and unless Britain had a serious positive strategy in relation to it, it would backfire on them.
“But as Cameron once said to me, ‘Everything is tactics and not strategy’.”

When the EU referendum campaign had begun, Cameron had already won the Scottish Independence referendum in September 2014, which he had begun with quite a laid-back approach (the final result was 55% against Independence to 44.7% in favour).
Scottish Tory MPs went to Cameron’s office at one stage during the campaign to warn him: “I’ve got to tell you, this is not going well”, but Wilding says he told them “Oh don’t worry, it will be fine.”
Just how close the referendum could be did dawn on Cameron eventually. Just two days before the vote, he travelled to Aberdeen, Scotland in an unscheduled trip, and madean emotional pleato Scottish voters: “Vote to save our United Kingdom.”
Two years on, he would make the same mistake with the EU referendum – only this time, he didn’t salvage the government’s position at the last moment, Wilding says.
“The Conservative establishment had an arrogance that they could win everything through fear and through ignorance of high-diplomacy, while its opponents were playing on emotion and patriotism.”
Wilding said that Cameron’s pollster had said to him during the EU referendum campaign: “We won the Scottish referendum by fear, we won the general election by fear, we’ll win this one by fear.”
Northern Ireland
After the use of the term ‘Brexit’ exploded in the wake of the EU referendum, a debate began of what the Irish translation for ‘Brexit’ should be. The three options are:
The most commonly used one is Breatimeacht; ‘Sasamach’ implies only England is leaving the EU, and ‘Bréalú’ is too politically charged.
But the word ‘Brexit’ itself – although a natural progression from ‘Grexit’ – it isn’t quite accurate either, as it implies only Britain is leaving the EU, ie, England and Wales.
Or is it prophetic? Because Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU, will Brexit lead to the break-up of the UK?
“I remember I was debating Ukip,” Wilding says, “who were foaming at the mouth about Brexit, and I said to them ‘Be careful what you wish for, that threatens the UK’, and they all dismissed it as ‘Project Fear’.
He says that MPs handling of Brexit has been revealed Westminster as “incompetent” and “arrogant”, drawing a comparison to The Emperor’s New Clothes.
“If I was in Northern Ireland or Scotland, I would be looking on at Westminster and say that my loyalty and respect to the great mother of parliament has gone.
So what happens next?
“This is a horrible crisis to be living though, but it is no different from other political crises that the UK has suffered,” Wilding says, citing ‘the Irish question’, or the Irish Home Rule movement, as one of those crises.
After forecasting in January that there would be an extension, he’s predicting that the Tory party will lose a large number of seats in the local elections, that a new centrist party will emerge, and that we’ll get another extension by 31 October – ultimately leading to no Brexit at all.
“What I expect to happen is what others don’t expect. We’ll be in a political meltdown.
“First, the local elections on 2 May. Those are going to devastate the Conservative party; they’ll lose 2,000 of their 4,600 seats, and Brexiteers will then turn on May.”
That is the conclusion of pollster Lord Hayward,who added the caveatthat if May passes her deal before the elections, there will be a “a Brexit benefit” and “a clear deficit if not”.
He says that either the Tory party, the Labour party, or both parties will split and will lead to “a new centrist party emerging”. And is this new centrist party The Independent Group? “Yep.”
“I can’t see the Tory party sticking together, and Labour are playing a clever game, but not a very attractive one.”
He says that the long extension has people wondering what Theresa May actually stands for now. “The battle for the soul of the party has already begun.”
In his 2012 column, Wilding wrote that “history has a habit of punishing drift”.
So, now that we have six months of Brexit breathing space, what is the UK’s easiest option?

https://www.thejournal.ie/commonwealth-ireland-4562003-Mar2019/,"WITH BREXIT THROWING all kinds of seemingly outlandish political equations into the mainstream, one Irish example that previously could not be countenanced is now being openly discussed.
That is the question of Ireland joining The Commonwealth, most likely in the context of a united Ireland.
With reunification now seen as a potential future outcome that politicians are being forced to consider, the issue of integrating northern unionists into a united Ireland is one that would be paramount.
One method that’s been suggested to aid this transition would be Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth.
Speaking to the Fine Gael National Conference last weekend, DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said hehoped Ireland would join the Commonwealth.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald toldTheJournal.ielast year that rejoining the Commonwealthwas something that could be discussed as partof discussions on a united Ireland.
McDonald said on Tuesdaythat it was not something she was personally in favour of while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said itwas “not something that’s on the agenda”.
But in the situation where a united Ireland was a real possibility and joining the Commonwealth was indeed ‘on the agenda’, what would this look like?
Firstly, what’s perhaps most relevant to Irish people is that rejoining the Commonwealth would not automatically mean that Queen Elizabeth II (or any future monarch) would become head of state.
The Commonwealth is currently made up of 53 counties, 31 of which are themselves republics, and only 16 of the countries have the British Queen as head of state.
Joining the Commonwealth alone would not change Ireland’s constitutional status and the country would likely retain its president as head of state.
(Presuming that this was agreed in a hypothetical united Ireland scenario).
South Africa, for example, is one Commonwealth member with a directly elected president.
But while Britain’s queen is not automatically the head of state of its members, she currently holds the position of Head of the Commonwealth.
It essentially puts her as head of the association, which itself also has a secretariat and a Secretary-General.
Her position is not hereditary but it was agreed at a meeting of Commonwealth leaders last year that Prince Charleswould succeed his mother in this position.
In practice, The Commonwealth also does not have economic or trade remit, despite what some Brexiteers may say, and therefore would it not conflict with Ireland’s EU membership.
Two members of the Eurozone (Cyprus and Malta) are also members of the Commonwealth and therefore this would not pose a problem for Ireland.
A number of other countries have also left and rejoined later, something which would suggest that this wouldn’t be an issue either.
Instead, Ireland would have to make an expression of interest in joining and this would be assessed by the Secretary-General and then the member countries at its next meeting.

Changed utterly
The position of the British monarch in the Commonwealth has changed greatly and is very different to when Ireland left in 1949.
When the country declared itself a republic it essentially ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth because it broke the connection with the British monarchy.
India also did the same the following year, but the Commonwealth had adopted a new charter by this time.
The new charter dropped the word ‘British’ from the Commonwealth’s name and the allegiance to the crown was removed.
This form of words allowed India to remain a member as a republic and this is considered to be the beginning of what’s referred to as the ‘modern Commonwealth’.
It meant that countries which were not British dominions could join the organisation and that is the basis by which countries can now join.
According to thecriteria for membership laid out in 1997, countries that meet the principles of membership can join even if they were never part of the British Empire.
Instead what is required is that they have have had a constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member. For example, Rwanda and Mozambique are both members having had no British colonial links.
In the years following the birth of the ‘modern Commonwealth’, the organisation’s primary role was about fostering democracy amongst its members and promoting standards of good governance.
Its opposition to apartheid led to South Africa leaving in 1961 but during this period it also struggled to find a relevance.
Professor Philip Murphy, Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, says this has been an ongoing problem for the organisation.
“The Commonwealth has never had a very clear purpose, it’s assumed certain purposes at particular times. In the 60s, 70s and 80s it was very much focused on anti-racism and battling apartheid in South Africa, and really completing the process of decolonisation.”
Murphy goes on to say this lack of a direction has meant that the Commonwealth has in some ways reverted to a focus on the British royal family because it has found it difficult to get attention otherwise.
Something which, he says, may make Irish acceptance of rejoining more difficult.

“It’s also, paradoxically in a way, been taken over by the link with the royal family over the last 30 years or so,” Murphy says.
“In terms of popular perception nowadays, and the Commonwealth secretariat knows this, the only way you’re only going to get media attention for the Commonwealth is if it’s a story linked to the Queen or Prince Charles or Meghan or Harry.”
Furthermore, Murphy adds that Brexit has also added to the perception of the Commonwealth being a kind of old imperial club.
“Certainly the way that it has been used in the Brexit debate by the right-wing in Britain has the certain kind of nostalgic whiff of going back to old Commonwealth friends, ie the Empire. It’s not helpful for the Commonwealth’s attempts to define itself as a post-imperial international organisation.”
“You’ve got to distinguish in a way between the kind of constitutional reality and perception,” he adds.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-drivers-licence-ireland-4552108-Mar2019/,"THE ROAD SAFETY Authority (RSA) has told those living in Ireland who have a UK drivers licence to swap it for an Irish licence sooner rather than later.
As the Brexit deadline approaches, so does the prospect of a no-deal.
The authority said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit the driving licence of a UK licence holder living in Ireland will no longer be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue driving on that licence.
Fianna Fáil transport spokesman Robert Troy said RSA confirmed to him a demand of up to 500 applications per day was being seen in relation to the number of people applying to switch their UK licence to an Irish one.
“In the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement in place, the driving license of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive in Ireland on that licence,” chief executive Moyagh Murdock states in a letter to Troy.
The RSA confirmed toTheJournal.iethat the numbers are up, but they are making a lot of process and working its way through the applications.
A spokesperson for the RSA sid that in 2018, 6,500 people swapped for an Irish licence. So far this year, 11,000 licences were physically produced.

As of yesterday, the RSA said it is working on producing 4,000 licences at the moment. About 500 applications are being received each day. They added that about 600 applications were processed yesterday alone.
The spokesperson said that those with a UK licence need to swap it over as soon as possible, as it will be invalid in a no-deal scenario. If there is a deal, there is nothing to worry about, they added.
“It is better to be safe than sorry. Get your application in now and we’ll swap it over,” they said.
The RSA said that anyone living in Ireland for longer than a year are meant to surrender their UK licence and get an Irish licence, however they said that many people have not done this.
In order to tackle the high number of applications, the Licence Exchange section of the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) has had its operation increased six-fold since 11 March.
Murdoch said that 20 RSA staff have been assigned to licence exchange, as well as 11 Abtran staff to assist in the processing of UK licensing applications.
As of 12 March, waiting times for the swapping of licences were down to 7.5 days.
The RSA toldTheJournal.iethat they are “ploughing through” the applications, with licence exchanges being prioritised.
The spokesperson concluded by appealing to those with UK licences to “be prudent” and get their applications in.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-8-4442239-Jan2019/,"May cut a disappointed figure in the House of Commons this evening.parliamentlive.tvparliamentlive.tv
THERESA MAY SUFFERED an historically crushing defeat in the House of Commons this evening.
The Brexit deal her government negotiated with the EU was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs,202 votes to 432 to be exact. A majority of 230.
As Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed out in response, it was the worst defeat for a British government in parliament since the 1920s.
Corbyn was actually understating it, tonight’s result was far worse still than those votes from almost a century ago.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Her defeat represents the worst for a government in modern UK political history. Such a defeat would be bad during run-of-the-mill legislation, nevermind one of the most important issues in recent memory.
And thisshellackingis particularly sore because of the actions of her party members.
May’s huge defeat isn’t just a product of losing her majority in the disastrous 2017 snap election, it’s also a product of being unable to command to the support of the seats her party did win.
In tonight’s vote, 118 of her Conservative party colleagues voted against her deal. That’s over a third of her parliamentary party and is a new record for the party.

In 1997, 95 Tories voted against John Major’s post-Dunblane gun control legislation. May’s government now holds that dubious record.
But while all that is unprecedented, what is also so is that May will likely survive. For now at least.
Whereas a UK parliamentary defeat would usually precipitate a PM’s resignation or a general election, neither are on the immediate horizon.
An anti-Brexit demonstrator cries outside of parliament.PA ImagesPA Images
May tomorrow faces a no confidence vote tabled by Labour, but the DUP and the chief Eurosceptics in her party have already said they will support her
It means that in all likelihood she’ll limp on, possibly remaining as Prime Minister as the UK requests an extension of Article 50.
In that case, it could leave the ball in her court.
Influential Tories are already saying that the next move is to seek more concessions from Europe.Boris Johnson said this eveningthat the result represents “a massive mandate to go back to Brussels” and renegotiate.
But May knows as well as anyone that the EU is square against watering down the backstop nor renegotiating the deal.
Her choices could then be threefold: a no-deal Brexit, a second vote or a general election.
For May, the first sounds like a nightmare and the latter two would probably be better served with a different leader.

https://www.thejournal.ie/duty-free-brexit-4514601-Feb2019/,"TODAY THE GOVERNMENT moved to protect the status quo of duty-free rules between Ireland and the UK in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
At the turn of the millennium, the European Union abolished duty-free and tax-free sales on all air and sea routes within the trade bloc.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe brought two extra measures to Cabinet today, which seeks to protect the current system.
The two amendments to be included in the Brexit omnibus Bill at Committee Stage relate to duty-free sales at ports and airports, and the operation of the VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and the UK, post Brexit.
The retail scheme relates to people who are resident outside the European Union who make purchases of goods in the EU. The scheme allows for a refund of the VAT charged on these goods.
The government states these changes are necessary to protect Exchequer revenues.
The committee stage amendments will be published on Thursday.
Duty-free shopping
Since the UK voted to leave the EU, there has been speculation about the re-introduction of duty-free on air and sea routes between Ireland and the UK after Brexit, with onereport statingthat it could inject an extra €45 million each year into the local economy.

The report commissioned by the Irish Duty-Free Alliance (IDFA), a lobby group that represents stakeholders in the local travel retail market including airports, airlines, ferry operators and retailers, found that the restoration of duty-free sales between Ireland and the UK alone could lead to an extra €45.4 million in annual travel retail sales, excluding airline revenue.
The change would also support another 450 jobs in the country, the analysis found.
However, today’s amendments seek to ensure that the status quo is maintained in the case that the UK does not agree to the withdrawal agreement.
Tonight, the Dáil began its debate on the Brexit omnibus Bill which includes proposed legislative changes that will be needed if the UK crashes out of the EU.
The measures, which Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said he hopes will remain sitting on the shelf, deal with issues ranging from education, health to transport.
Votes
UK Prime Minister Theresa Maytold Westminster todaythat on or before Tuesday 12 March, a meaningful vote will be held on her withdrawal agreement with the EU. If parliament votes in favour of that, the UK will leave the EU with the deal in place.
If that withdrawal agreement is voted down, there will be another vote on Wednesday 13 March. This time, MPs will be asked whether or not they want to leave the EU without a deal.
If the House of Commons votes against a no-deal Brexit, however, there will be yet another vote held.
On Thursday 14 March, she said the government will table an amendment to seek a “short, limited extension to Article 50″. Extending Article 50 would mean that the UK does not leave the EU on 29 March, as it is currently set to do.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the plan that will avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit is “very rough and very preliminary”.
Speaking to reporters at the Fine Gael National Conference in Wexford today, the Taoiseach reiterated that if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, then “difficult discussions” will be needed with the European Commission and the UK on the border issue.
“First of all you would expect the British government to stand its commitments in the December 2017 declaration where they agreed they would maintain full regulatory alignment with the European Union if that was necessary to avoid a hard border.
“We know from the UK government’s own plans that if we did end up in a no-deal scenario that they would treat Northern Ireland separately from day one,” Varadkar said.
Last night, Tánaiste Simon Coveneysaid there have been no formal discussionswith the European Commission about how to prevent a hard border in Ireland, though he said they have “thought about” it.
The only way to avoid it would be to have regulatory alignment, but he said the they are still advocating for the backstop.
Today, Varadkar described the plan to avoid the hard border was “a sketch” at this stage, pointing out the regularity alignment, which is contained in the backstop, is what it looks like.
“The more and more you get into it, the more and more it looks like the backstop. That’s how we ended up with the backstop in the first place.”
Pressure is mounting on all sides at the deadline dates for Brexit are pushed out. However, questions about the possibility of a hard border remain.
Theresa May has said a third vote on her Brexit deal may not happen next week if there is insufficient support to approve it.
It was agreed on Thursday that date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if the deal was passed.

However, if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
In a letter to MPs yesterday evening, May said she would only bring her withdrawal agreement before the House of Commons if there was sufficient support for it.
May laid out four “clear choices” facing Parliament:
“If it appears that there is sufficient support and the speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week and if it is approved we can leave on May 22,” May wrote to MPs.
But she said if there was not sufficient support or the house rejected it, Britain could ask for another extension and take part in the European Parliament elections, adding: “I strongly believe that… would be wrong”.
Speaking to Virgin Media News this evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he has some sympathy for May, but not when it comes to politics.
“I’ve enormous sympathy for her and enormous respect for her. Being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at this time is an exceptionally difficult job, especially with the divided parliament and a divided government,” Varadkar said.
“At the same time, let’s not deny an obvious truth. This problem, Brexit, is entirely one of their own creation,” he said.

‘Anything is possible’
Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Friday at the close of the EU summit, EU Council President Donald Tusk said: “Until April 12, anything is possible.”
Brexit protesters are set to march in London today demanding a second referendum. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would join while deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has said he would back the Prime Minister’s deal but only if she agrees to hold a referendum on it.
“The EU’s decision to postpone things until at least 12 April has opened a window and those of us who oppose Brexit must seize the chance it offers,” Scotland’s Sturgeon said.
The ‘Put It To The People’ march is due to start at midday and will finish at the Houses of Parliament.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said there have beenno formal discussionswith the European Commission about how to prevent a hard border in Ireland while the DUP hascriticisedthe UK government, and called the delay to the date by which the UK leaves the European Union “a humiliation”.

THE BBC’S BREXIT coverage has been “distinctly lacking in curiosity and depth” about Ireland, former Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer has said.
Writing in Propsect Magazine today,Damazer has saidthat BBC interest in Ireland waned after 1998 and that the broadcaster “missed the Irish dimension” of the Brexit campaign.
“The BBC Ireland correspondent’s job was once a big deal—on air almost every day. Sometime after the Good Friday Agreement, interest waned,” writes Damazer.
“That may be why the BBC missed the Irish dimension of Brexit in the campaign and for a long time afterwards”.
Once Prime Minister Theresa May had her outline deal drawn up with the EU in late 2017…”it was greeted as a Westminster triumph with only minor genuflections towards the Irish conundrum that it left nakedly unresolved,” Damazer has said.
As a result, “Dublin-based journalism got barely a look in. Overall the coverage has been distinctly lacking in curiosity and depth about both the Irish economy and Irish politics”.

‘A decision easily reached’
Similarly, Damazer writes that coverage of Germany has “never been a big deal” for the BBC except for the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and that tensions between the UK and Germany have been “left up in the air”.
Damazer was BBC Radio 4 controller between 2004 and 2010. Five year later, he joined the BBC Trust – the broadcaster’s governing body – which had oversight of the BBC’s editorial performance during the Brexit referendum.
In today’s essay, ‘How Brexit broke the BBC’, he also critcises the Trust’s decision to “give broadly equal time” to the Remain and Leave campaigns.
“It was a decision easily reached, and yet it sowed the seeds of some of today’s difficulties”.
“Because many senior Remainers, in particular, were unprepared for the sheer volume of Brexit voices that the half-and-half policy would introduce to the airwaves”.
Britain is set to leave the European Union on 29 March.
EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested, however, that European leaders would be open to a short “technical” delay in Britain’s departure from the EU to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final withdrawal deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-may-talks-4481275-Feb2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will arrive in Dublin today, for talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as she continues to try to seek concessions on the Irish backstop.
It comes after both leaders held talks in Brussels earlier in the week, with both Ireland and the EU refusing to entertain dropping the backstop from the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This backstop that would ensure no hard border in Ireland was agreed in the withdrawal agreement between May’s government and the EU before Christmas, but that was voted down heavily in the House of Commons last month.
Since then, May has changed tack and, with the support of her party, has gone back to try to convince Brussels and Dublin to drop the requirement of the backstop.
All this has heightened the threat of a no-deal Brexit, with the UK’s set leaving date from the EU of 29 March now looming large on the horizon.

Varadkar will meet May this evening, where they will both have dinner together.
“It’s an opportunity as well to discuss the situation and work together to chart a way forward,” he said.
Varadkar added that the UK can request a Brexit extension, but speaking about the backstop issue, he said alternative arrangements for the Irish border can be explored but this cannot result in the deletion of the backstop.
Dominating reports around the talks this week were the remarks made by European Council president Donald Tusk on Wednesday, when he said that there’s a “special place in hell” for those who pushed for Brexit without a plan.
“I’ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely,” Tusk said.
Speaking yesterday, Minister for Foreign Affairs described Tusk’s comments as “a little provocative” but said they were borne of frustration.
“I think it’s a reflection on the EU side that with little more than 50 days to go before Britain leaves the European Union, that we still don’t have a clear plan coming from the British government in terms of what they want,” Coveneytold Bloomberg.

Corbyn talks
Back in the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to May to outline changes to her deal that would be needed for his party to support it.
Corbyn reluctantly met with May last week after parliament voted to reject her Withdrawal Agreement.
In the letter, which Corbyn has published, the Labour leader said changes to May’s “red lines” were needed. Among them that the UK must enter into a customs union with the EU.
“We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,” Corbyn writes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/impact-of-no-deal-brexit-on-northern-ireland-4514836-Feb2019/,"THE IMPACT OF a no-deal Brexit in terms of trade and business would be “most severe” and last longer in Northern Ireland, according to a document published by the British government.
A reportreleased todayexamines the implications Britain leaving the European Union without a deal would have on business in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The document notes: “Overall, the cumulative impact from a ‘no deal’ scenario is expected to be more severe in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and to last for longer.
“This is because of Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances, including in particular its geographical position as the only part of the UK with a land border with the EU, and the current lack of an Executive in Northern Ireland.”
There has been no sitting Assembly in the North for over two years, when power-sharing collapsed over the Renewable Heat Incentive or‘cash for ash’ controversy.
In today’s report, the British government reiterates its commitment to “avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in any scenario”. It plans to shortly publish further details on its immediate and temporary arrangements for trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event of a no-deal scenario.
The report notes that the British government would need to “work urgently” with the Irish government and the EU “to find any sustainable longer term solution”.
A no-deal scenario is expected to cause “disruption to closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland”, the British government warns.
“Northern Ireland is particularly vulnerable given its high proportion of, and reliance upon SMEs (75% of all private sector employment) and the number of businesses who trade directly with Ireland (Northern Ireland’s largest international export market),” the report states.
A separate report released earlier this month found that six in 10 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the North think Brexit will havea negative impacton their businesses.
Impact on border region and crime
The document released today notes that the agri-food sector is “a disproportionately large part of Northern Ireland’s economy and located predominantly in border/rural areas”, adding: “It is particularly vulnerable given its reliance on cross-border supply chains in the production stage and in finished products.”
The British government has warned that several other areas could also be affected, including the single electricity market (SEM), which covers the island of Ireland; cross-border cooperation on crime and security; and the potential for community tensions to be heightened.

The British government says it is committed to restoring an Executive in Northern Ireland but warns that this “would become more challenging” in such a scenario.
The government has already published predictions of the impact of a no-deal scenario on economies in the North and the UK. This analysis estimates that the UK economy would be 6.3-9% smaller in the long-term (after around 15 years) than it otherwise would have been when compared with today’s arrangements, assuming no action is taken.
A no-deal Brexit is estimated to shrink the below economies as follows:
The report notes that this analysis does not account for any short-term disruptions, which would be likely to have additional short and long-run economic impacts in an immediate no-deal scenario.
“While the analysis draws on a robust set of tools and evidence, there is an inherent uncertainty around this type of economic analysis.
“The results are therefore presented as ranges, and should be interpreted with caution. EU Member States are also expected to face economic risks following a no-deal exit,” the document adds.
Backstop
Speaking in Belfastearlier this month, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that people living in Northern Ireland and the Republic are understandably “anxious” about Brexit as it is there many of the effects will be most keenly felt.
Today she said the House of Commons will hold a series of meaningful votes in the coming weeks to decidewhat form Brexit will take, including a potential vote on whether to seek to extend Article 50 and delay leaving the EU.
May is struggling to get a Brexit deal over the line. The draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the EU was rejected by the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 last month.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deak, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-delay-4551168-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is set to formally request that Brexit be postponed.
May is due to write to the European Union, likely asking it to agree to extending Article 50 until 30 June.
A three-month extension would mean Britain doesn’t have to take part in May’s European elections; the new European Parliament is set to convene in July.
Other EU member states are expected to consider her request at a summit in Brussels tomorrow.
However, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker today said a decision is unlikely to be reached this week, meaning a second summit may be needed next week.
Juncker told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that the remaining 27 EU members states’ hands are tied until the political indecision in London is resolved.
“As long as we don’t know what Britain could say yes to, no decision can be taken on our side either,” he said.
Juncker insisted the deal on the table is the EU’s final offer.
“Nothing more can be done, we’ve reached the end of the road,” he said.
Juncker said May needs to present Brussels with an agreement approved by the British parliament as well as “a clear timetable”.
Britain is currently set to leave the EU on 29 March, just nine days from now.
‘Constitutional crisis’
May’s appeal for an extension comes amid doubt over whether or not the House of Commons will vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
The planned vote was thrown into doubt on Monday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Bercow said MPs from both sides of the House had expressed concerns to him about being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.

Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
May’s official spokesman yesterday agreed there is “a crisis” afoot but blamed MPs who didn’t back the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the deal – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.
The majority of MPs (413)last week votedin favour of extending Article 50 for three months, with 202 voting against the government’s motion.
‘Blazing row’
Some people have argued that postponing Brexit is somewhat pointless as European leaders have said the deal struck between Britain and the EU cannot be renegotiated, while hardline Brexiteers view it as a tactic to stop the process altogether.
There was a “blazing row” at a British Cabinet meeting yesterday, according to Sky News, with some ministers reportedly saying any delay must be brief — meaning there is the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal at the end of June.
As the crisis rumbles on, a number of opponents are said to be eyeing up May’s job. Former Foreign Secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson is one of the frontrunners – something that could further split the Tories, with some MPsvowing to quit if he becomes leader.
‘No appetite’
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, meanwhile, has said there is “a lot is concern” among EU member states about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50.
Speaking after Cabinet yesterday evening, Coveney said: “The disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months or another whatever period of time is something that I think people will need convincing on.”
Coveney added that it has been “very clear” there is “absolutely no appetite” from the EU to reopen negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Negotiations to get the DUP and other MPs, including some within May’s own Conservative Party, onside are ongoing behind the scenes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/chlorinated-chicken-woody-4521381-Mar2019/,"THE US AMBASSADOR to the UK has attacked what he described as a “smear” campaign against American food, dismissing criticism about its produce as “myths”.
Woody Johnson said in an articlepublished in the Daily Telegraphthat US food products are safe, and that scare stories about “chlorine-washed chicken” and “hormone-pumped beef” are being used to mislead the public.
The comments come amid claims from Brexiteer politicians that they will seek trade deals with other countries, including the US, when the UK leaves the bloc.
This led to claims that the UK would abandon EU food standards and a be open to importing food items with differing standards.
The most publicized example was the possible importation of chlorinated chicken.
Chlorinated chicken – or chlorine-treated chicken – refers to chicken carcasses that have been treated with antimicrobial rinses to remove harmful bacteria. The practice is common in the US but banned in the EU.
But speaking to The Telegraph, Johnson dismissed such talk as scaremongering.

“You have been presented with a false choice: either stick to EU directives, or find yourselves flooded with American food of the lowest quality,” Johnson wrote.
Johnson says American producers use “scientific” and “technological” tools to feed a growing global population, in contrast to the European Union’s “Museum of Agriculture.”
When asked about allowing the import of such chicken in 2017, Environment Secretary Michael Gove flatly denied that it would not be allowed, saying that the UK would not “dilute our high animal welfare standards” in pursuit of a trade deal.
The UK’s National Farmers Union had also raised concerns about US practices, saying trade deals shouldn’t allow imports produced “to lower standards than those required of British farmers.”
While the president of the union, Minette Batters, did not dispute that chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef were “safe,” she said other factors were worth considering in the debate about whether it should be allowed.
“Our consumer has demanded high standards of animal welfare, we’ve risen to that challenge,” shetold BBC News.
“He (Johnson) is right to make the point that food security is crucially important, we would say the same. But all we’re saying is: ‘Produce the food to our standards and we’ll have a trade deal’.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/consumer-rights-post-brexit-4520150-Mar2019/,"CUSTOMERS WHO BUY from British shops should check what their consumer rights, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)has said.
It’s also warned that ordering from non-EU businesses carries a Vat rate of €22 or more (plus shipping). You also legally have to pay import charges such as customs or excise duties on items you buy from outside the EU, which are valued at €150 or more.
As part of the EU, Ireland’s consumer rights come from the Consumer Rights Directive (CRD), which means that in most cases, you can cancel your order within 14 days of delivery. We’re also exempt from tariffs and customs costs as Ireland is part of the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market.
But once the UK leaves the EU, Irish customers ordering from UK-based businesses will no longer automatically have access to these rights. If the business they are ordering from is in the EU, then your rights will not change because of Brexit.
Advertisement
If a shop in Ireland is owned or run by a UK chain, all your consumer rights will be exactly the same when you buy from a shop in Ireland despite Brexit.
To check where a business is located, the CCPC advises not to rely too much on the website’s domain name (for example, .co.uk).
The CCPC advises that in general when buying from a website outside the EU, it is very important to read the terms and conditions on the website, and ask:
If you buy something before the 29 March, the day that the UK is due to leave the European Union, your 14-day cancellation period under the CRD may no longer be valid if you try to cancel your order.
If you buy something from a UK-based business before Brexit that has a fault, or if it is not delivered, you may not have access to redress using the European Consumer Centre or the European Small Claims Procedure after Brexit.
More information is availablehere on the CCPC website.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/brexit-law-simon-coveney-4509258-Feb2019/,"IT’S BEING DESCRIBED as an omnibus bill, a mega bill and a landmark bill.
Yesterday I published the legislation the government will bring through the Oireachtas over the next three-weeks to prepare us for a hard Brexit.
In simple language, it’s the Irish Brexit law.
It contains the things we will need to do in legislation to protect our citizens, businesses and country if a no deal Brexit comes to pass at the end of March.
Brexit is bad news, a hard Brexit is really bad news.
We have things we can do without new laws like get our ports, airports and supply chains ready with the hundreds of millions of euro in supports the government has already made available to agribusiness and small business.
We have things the EU is doing like making sure the planes keep flying, the trucks keep driving across the UK and security and police cooperation remains really strong. Ireland will be an EU member after Brexit and that brings important stability and support too.
However we also have laws we need to change and that’s what this work in the Oireachtas will be all about.
The Brexit bill is the result of a lot of really hard work from our teams across government. They have toiled away in nine government departments to identify what will need a legal fix in a disorderly Brexit. The Taoiseach’s Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney General’s Office have overseen the preparations.
Advertisement
The bill is designed to keep things the same, because Brexit threatens many things that have worked for decades on the island of Ireland.
Let me give you five examples of what this bill does and why we need such a big piece of work to safeguard Irish citizens.
1) Healthcare: The bill gives a legal basis for us to fly transplant patients to the UK for surgery, and for cataract operations for people living in the South to be done in Belfast.
2) VAT: In law the U.K. will become a 3rd country overnight and for Irish businesses they would need to pay their VAT on the spot for every deal done in the U.K. This would add to their upfront costs and bury them in admin and paperwork so we’re changing the law to allow them do what they do today – Add it all up and pay their VAT once every two months.
3) Welfare: This is a big one. It affects over a hundred thousand people in Ireland.  The Irish and the British have been living together and working together for years. This bit of the bill ensures pensions and welfare payments continue uninterrupted on March 30th no matter what.
4) Students: They need their grants to keep going. This law ensures Irish students in the U.K. and British students here will keep their payments.
5) Business: This bill gives more power to Enterprise Ireland so they can help Irish companies to export to more countries around the world.  This works. Ten years ago our exports to China was €100 million, now it’s close to €1 billion.
There’s loads more in the bill and it will be debated heavily in the Oireachtas over the next couple of weeks.
As I said yesterday I hope this work is made redundant and the Irish Brexit bill, and all the hard work that went into it, sits on the shelf in my office.
The EU and the UK are working to give reassurances to Westminster that the backstop would be temporary if it was used. No one wants to trap the UK in the EU, but Brexit is their policy and they have responsibilities to Northern Ireland and Ireland. Westminster is the only place that can take no deal off the table.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-meps-hard-border-ireland-4408483-Jan2019/,"WE’RE JUST MONTHS away from Brexit, and the EU and Ireland have said publicly that there are no plans to have a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said at the launch of theIrish government’s no-deal Brexit plansthat there were no plans to build a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, or plans for any customs checks; Taoiseach Leo Varadkarrepeated these assertionsthe next day.
But the European Commission has suggested that there will need to be “simplified border controls” – such as documentation – on live animals and animal products travelling between the EU and the UK.
So which one will it be – here’s what three Irish MEPs think about the likelihood of a hard border, and other thoughts on the UK’s departure from the EU.
Do you think there will be infrastructure along the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland after 29 March?
Mairéad McGuinness:”It is very important for Ireland that the UK Parliament – as well as the European Parliament – ratifies the Withdrawal Agreement. The Agreement provides an insurance policy in the form of the backstop for the border, but it is also a necessary precondition for negotiating the future relationship.
“If a no deal scenario arises, An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has repeatedly said that the Government will not place any physical infrastructure on the border.”
Martina Anderson:”We do not want to see any infrastructure on the border or any hardening of the border. We do not want to see a border on the island of Ireland at all.
“Sinn Féin has worked hard in Europe to ensure there will be no hardening of the border and made the issue centre stage in the Brexit negotiations.
“Businesses and the thousands of people who cross the border every day to work, study and socialise cannot be subjected to any return to a hard border. The backstop option agreed by the British government avoids the need for physical infrastructure on the border – it must be maintained.”
Do you think there will be additional customs checks at ports and airports between Northern Ireland and the UK?
Mairéad McGuinness:”Under the Withdrawal Agreement, if the backstop had to kick in, there would be a single UK-EU customs territory. So there would not be any customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as there are none today.

“That said, the backstop explicitly states both the UK and EU’s desire to avoid controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland. Provisions are made in the text to have checks instead take place in the market or on business premises, carried out by the UK authorities.
“There is also a provision to extend the transition period rather than having the backstop come into force – maintaining the status quo of all EU law continuing to apply across the UK for an extra year or two.”
Brian Hayes:”Not in the short run.
“But everyone should recognise, that the first thing both the UK and Irish Government agreed, notwithstanding their differences on the backstop, was the continuation of the Common Travel Area. It’s a really important guarantee to allow free movement between both islands.
How much of a loss is the UK to the European Union?
“The UK is a large member state which has made a significant contribution during its 40 years of membership.
“The UK leaving will be a loss to the EU – but the UK will also lose out on the collaboration that the EU enables.”
“This is a fundamental right we will lose as a direct result of the Tory Brexit.”
Brian Hayes:“An enormous loss.
“The loss of their nett €13 billion contribution to the EU Budget is not fully appreciated at the moment especially as the next MFF will be negotiated next year. 60% of all capital market activity is run through the city of London. The loss to the EU will be massive around building a real capital markets union for the EU without the UK.”
Mairéad McGuinnessis a Midlands-North-West MEP for Fine Gael and the Vice-President of the European Parliament. She’s also a member of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee and the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
Martina Andersonis a Sinn Féin MEP for Northern Ireland. She was convicted in 1986 of conspiring to cause explosions in England, and was released in November 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In May 2007, Anderson became one of the first Sinn Féin members to join the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
Brian Hayesis a Fine Gael MEP who was Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 2011 until 2014, which is the year he was elected to the European Parliament. He’s a member of the European Parliament’s Economic & Monetary Affairs Committee, Development Committee and Budgetary Control Committee. In 2018 he announced that he would not contest the European elections that will be held this year.
Independent MEPs had been asked to give their views for this article, but hadn’t responded at the time of publication.

FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has said that France and Ireland are the EU countries most-directly impacted by Brexit, and reaffirmed France’s support to Ireland in negotiations.
“Please allow me to say again that we will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people no matter what happens because this is the solidarity is the very purpose of the European project,” Macron said in a joint press statement with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Paris (he also tweeted it out later).
Macron also addressed the possibility of granting the UK another delay to the Brexit date, saying that it shouldn’t be “taken for granted”.

Varadkar is in Paris meeting with Macron to discuss Brexit and a number of other issues; the European Council are due to meet on 10 April to discuss the next steps, two days before the UK is due to leave the EU.
So far, the UK parliament has rejected Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times, and rejected a dozen other possible options. At the moment, the UK will leave the EU on 12 April with no deal, something that the Taoiseach described today as “particularly difficult for Ireland”.
Varadkar also repeated that if there was an extension, that would mean the UK would take part in the European elections, and there should be a “clear purpose and a clear plan” for why it should be permitted. He added that the EU wanted to avoid “a rolling extension”.
“It’s very much the case that the UK is consumed by Brexit, but Ireland and France and the EU shouldn’t be consumed by Brexit,” he said, echoing comments made by Macron, where he said that the EU should not “be hostage to a political crisis in the United Kingdom”.
“I don’t think that relations between Ireland and France have ever been as good as they are now,” Varadkar said, thanked France for its solidarity with Ireland.
Varadkar is in Paris for a meeting with Macron; on Thursday he will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the latest Brexit developments.

THE UK WASN’T even supposed to be voting in the European elections, but now that it has the results could be very consequential indeed.
As expected,Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party got the largest share of the voteand seats, seemingly taking a huge chunk of Conservative voters and even some Labour ones too.
He also virtually eliminated his former party Ukip.
The Remain-backing Liberal Democrats will come in in second, followed by Labour and then the Green Party, relegating the Conservatives to fourth.
So what do the results mean and what does it mean for Brexit?
A game changer for Farage?
Nigel Farage looking pleased with himself this morning.Jonathan Brady / PA ImagesJonathan Brady / PA Images / PA Images
For a party launched only six weeks ago, the result can only be seen as a success.
The party is set to send the largest UK contingent the European Parliament where it will no doubt endeavour to provide a headache for the EU politicians. Just as French President Emmanuel Macron warned, hence his skepticism about the Brexit extension.
The Brexit Party benefited from a clarity of message and the comparative dithering by the two largest parliamentary parties, but it’s also not a surprise they did well.
Ukip won the most seats in 2014 and the European Parliament vote is probably the most relevant place for UK Brexit supporters to register their euroscepticism.
Arguably, the most significant effect the Brexit Party vote may have is on the Conservative leadership race. Especially, given their newMEPs may only be temporary.
Over the weekend, the Conservative race was being pitched as a battle between hard and soft Brexiteers. This result for the Brexit Party could embolden the latter.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
For Farage, he’ll be hoping to do with the Brexit Party what he couldn’t do with Ukip.
That is, to make a dent in the House of Commons under the unforgiving first-past-the-post system.
Speakingthis morning to LBC, Farage said his priority is now on the upcoming Peterborough by-election and the next general election.
“I’ve already got a lot of people applying to be general election candidates and I’ve got to start vetting them, interviewing them and getting them ready for the next election whenever that may be,” he said.
A win of sorts for remain?
PA ImagesPA Images
The Liberal Democrats have had breakthrough nights before but this time round was something even better for the party. The LibDems have come second in vote share and will have the second-largest contingent of MEPs.
They can legitimately claim to be the biggest pro-Remain party and have already been doing so. Leader Vince Cable said their message was “clear, honest and unambiguous”.

“We have shown ourselves as the strongest Remain force in British politics. Thank you to everyone who put their faith in us. We will stand up for you and keep campaigning to stop Brexit,” hetweeted.
Sky NewsSky News
One of the major debate points following yesterday’s result has been about what the percentage votes tell us about the numbers of Leave and Remain voters in the UK.
It’s far from a perfect calculation because the positions of Labour and the Conservatives are less clear, but if Labour is added to the Remain column and the Conservatives are added to the Leave column it gives a 53-46% lead for remain.
(This excludes the votes from Scotland and Northern Ireland which are not confirmed yet)

Can Corbyn cling on for his much-wanted general election?
The majority of Labour MPs support remain and last night’s result may just see the party tilt more clearly towards favouring a second referendum.
The argument against this has been that this may alienate Brexit-supporting Labour voters. Last night’s kicking may have changed minds about this.
The party’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said as much in a series of tweets this morning.
After an initial tweet that seemed to suggest he was in favour of a second referendum, he quickly followed it up with another saying hist first preference was for a general election.
Can’t hide from hit we took last night.Bringing people together when there’s such a divide was never going to be easy. Now we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader & threat of no deal, we must unite our party & country by taking issue back to people in a public vote— John McDonnell (@johnmcdonnellMP)May 27, 2019John McDonnell MP/ Twitter

So people are absolutely clear what I am saying.Of course I want a general election. But I realise how difficult this is to secure.I will do anything I can to block no deal Brexit. So yes if,as likely GE not possible, then I support going back to the people in another referendum— John McDonnell (@johnmcdonnellMP)May 27, 2019John McDonnell MP/ Twitter

This debate clearly throws more doubt on the position of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
While Corbyn had proved a divisive figure in the party, Labour’s healthy performance in the 2017 general election had brought him some goodwill.
That has all but run out now following two bad elections in a row and a Brexit strategy of constructive ambiguity that is clearly not working.
Corbyn’s argument would probably be that this strategy is designed specifically for a general election but this ignores the fact that he has no power to force one.
It also ignores the fact that Brexit is the issue oftheday and appearing weak on it can prove to be curtains for your career. Just ask Theresa May.
The end of Yaxley Lennon?
Josh Halliday / TwitterJosh Halliday / Twitter/ Twitter
Far-right figure Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, received just 2.24% of the votes in North West England, putting him in eighth place in the constituency.
The founder of the anti-Islam English Defence League was jailed for contempt of court last year and said he was running for the European Parliament as a way to “fight back”.
If that was the case, he had very little support for his fight.
Robinsonwas recently banned from Facebookfor “calling for violence targeted at Muslims” and he blamed this for his loss in the election.
“Trump ran his campaign on social media, Brexit was won on social media. I’m banned on social media. So my ability to fight a fair campaign is gone,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-mega-bill-4506203-Feb2019/,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has outlined the provisions of a variety of new laws that will be enacted if there is a no-deal Brexit.
The 15-part bill covers the provision of electricity, bus and train services, and pension and welfare payments across the island of Ireland post-Brexit.
It also provides third-level grants for students if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.
Coveney also said some ministers’ St Patrick’s Day visits may be shortened or curtailed as the government prioritises the Brexit legislation in the coming weeks.
“We will make appropriate decisions in relation to St Patrick’s Day and quite frankly everything else,” Coveney said.
He said it was very unlikely the Taoiseach’s annual visit to the White House would be affected, however, noting the event’s importance in terms of maintaining US-Irish relations.

Speaking at Government Buildings this morning, Coveney began the press conference by reiterating that the backstop represented the outcome of a fair negotiation between EU and UK.
“The backstop is a result of a fair negotiation, it was designed by the EU and the UK together, and it will not be jettisoned at the last minute,” he said.
The drafted Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected by the House of Commons, with most MPs opposing the deal over the backstop, which would provide for an EU-UK customs union if no other trade or customs agreement is struck that would avoid a border on the island of Ireland.
Because of this, with less than 40 days until the UK leaves the EU, a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely than ever.
What’s in the bill?
The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, or the ‘mega bill’, as it has been dubbed by the Tánaiste, was signed off by Cabinet earlier this week and covers nine different government departments, incorporating 16 pieces of legislation.
Among the things it provides for is facilitatingtrain servicesbetween Dublin and Belfast, andbus servicesthat travel across the border, ensuring people will not be stopped for checks.
Currentpensions and welfare paymentswill continue as they are now post-Brexit.
It also facilitates agreements between Ireland and the UK to ensure Irish and UKstudentswill not be liable for foreign fees and provides for SUSI grants.

Legislative changes will allow for Common Travel Areahealthcarearrangements (so that children in the North can access healthcare services in Dublin, for example), andbusinesseswill receive extra support and investment from Enterprise Ireland, which will receive extra powers from this legislation.
Today, the Irish Independent reports that Dubliner cheese has received €6 million from Enterprise Ireland as part of EU state aid funding to prepare Ireland’s vulnerable agri-food industry for Brexit. It reports that shifting its production from cheddar to mozzarella (half of Ireland’s cheddar exports go to the UK).
The amendments also allow with the facilitation of all-islandelectricityservices; if there’s a no-deal Brexit, “any issues of non-compliance with EU law can be addressed” on a temporary basis by the laws included in this bill.
Pilot Exemption Certificates, held byseafarers,have also been extended from one year to three years. Those who work in Irish harbours can apply for those certificates up to 29 March, even if their existing Exemption Certificate may not have expired.
Speaking about the no-deal legislation, Coveney said it was the product of “a root and branch trawl of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight”.
Timeline
Just 5 weeks out from Brexit day, the government has a tight deadline to get the legislation passed in time.
Opposition leaders will be keen to inspect the detail ahead of the debate on the legislation which is due to dominate Dáil proceedings next week.
The government plans to have the Bill passed in the Dáil by 8 March, before it heads to the Seanad, where it is hoped it will pass by 15 March.
It is envisaged President Michael D Higgins will sign the Bill into law on Friday 29 March - the deadline for the UK to leave the EU.

“Our focus remains on the UK ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement, which was concluded following intensive negotiations between the UK and the EU,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in a statement today.
“However, for the last two years we have also been preparing for the possibility that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. We are doing all we can to avoid a no deal scenario, but we need to be ready in case it does happen.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said this week that the government will be relying on the “goodwill” of those on the opposition benches to ensure a speedy passage for the legislation.
The Taoiseach has indicated that if extra days and hours are needed to ensure the legislation passes, then the Houses will sit out-of-hours.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney will be leading the legislation through the Houses.
He maintains that if there if Britain crashes out, then all parties – in Ireland, Britain and the EU – will face a difficult time ahead in terms of managing the consequences.

https://www.thejournal.ie/anna-soubry-not-safe-brexit-4554893-Mar2019/,"BRITISH MP ANNA Soubry says that she can’t go home to her constituency this weekend because of the seriousness of Brexit related death threats that she has received.
The Independent Group member revealed that the police told her husband that they are “frightened” for her safety.
Soubry, who quit the Conservative Party last month, made the remarks a day after UK Prime Minister Theresa May criticised MPs for failing to implement the result of the Brexit referendum in a scathing TV statement.
The politician took issue with May’s comments revealing that she was facing “very, very serious death threats, especially when people know your home address”.
“When a senior police officer tells your partner that if it was his wife in the situation that I am in he would say ‘I am frightened for her safety’ I think that tells you everything.”

Soubry, who supports remaining in the EU, added that many other MPs have also received threats including her TIG colleague Chuka Umunna.
Several other MPs raised safety concerns following May’s comments. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told Sky News that he was confronted on a street in his constituency.
“When I said he was an MP he then started to get rather irate, called me a traitor, saying that I was one of the ones trying to stop the will of the people,” he said.
In the days before the referendum in June 2016 Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by Thomas Mair, a white supremacist.
Speaking in Brussels tonight Theresa May declined to apologise for her comments but she did take a softer approach with MPs.
“There are passionately held views on all sides of this argument. And yes, as I said, last night I expressed frustration but I know MPs are frustrated too,” she said.

Although the House of Commons hasn’t voted for anything specific, they have decided that the UK needs more time to ask how it wants to exit the bloc.
The decision gives May yet another reason to hold a vote on her Brexit withdrawal deal, with 413 parliamentarians voting in favour of delaying Brexit, with 202 voting against.
It was the first victory of the week for the embattled Prime Minister, and showed she has a small grasp on the increasingly rebellious Conservative Party.
Among those who opposed the Prime Minister’s extension were Cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (who, bizarrely, had argued in favour of the motion in the debate earlier today).
The government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote.

Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (an ex-Brexit Secretary) also voted against the extension, but the original Brexit secretary, David Davis, voted to back May’s motion and delay Brexit.
It’s now up to the EU to agree to grant an extension, and it needs the agreement of all EU Council members – ie the leaders of remaining 27 EU countries – to sign off
Some of the headlines from tomorrow’s newspapers include the phrases “Cabinet split”, “boosts May’s hand”, “just a little more time”, and “one last roll of the dice”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-brexit-corbyn-4487313-Feb2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Feb 2019

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has dismissed the opposition’s plans to deal with Brexit, telling Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that she was opposed to keeping the UK in some form of customs union with the EU.
This refusal of Corbyn’s Brexit plans effectively closes off another possible way that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided, with just 46 days left now until the UK is set to leave the EU.
However, with May needing all the support she can get from all sides of the House of Commons, she did indicate a willingness to make a concession on environmental and workers’ rights.
It comes as yet another week of debating and voting is set to take place this week, after the parliament roundly rejected a Brexit deal May had sealed with the remaining 27 EU leaders.
MPs are set to vote again on Britain’s Brexit options on 14 February. But a member of May’s cabinet pledged yesterday to give parliament a further ballot two weeks later – a measure meant to give the premier more time for talks with the EU.
Her meetings in Brussels on Thursday made no breakthrough and fears of a no-deal scenario that gridlocks trade are running high.
May’s housing minister James Brokenshire insisted yesterday that the government had a clear strategy and timeline aimed at getting an agreement that Britain’s splintered parliament can pass.
“What gives certainty is a deal, and that’s why we want to see people getting behind us, getting behind this process that we now have,” Brokenshire told the BBC.
He pledged to give parliament a fresh vote on Britain’s options by February 27 if May does not come back with new concessions before then.
In the vote this week, MPs are set to have their say on amendments that could limit May’s options and give parliament a broader say over the Brexit process.
Brokenshire’s promise of another vote two weeks later is designed to discourage lawmakers from binding the government’s hands this week.
It is also meant to postpone a revolt by cabinet ministers who want to take a no-deal Brexit off the table for good.
‘My deal or worse’
The opposition Labour party has denounced May’s strategy as time-wasting aimed at forcing parliament to vote through a deal at the last moment.
Advertisement
“We shouldn’t be put in a position where the clock is run down and the prime minister says it’s either my deal or even worse,” Labour’s Brexit pointman Keir Starmer told The Sunday Times.
There are few signs of concessions coming May’s way from Brussels.
May’s Brexit minister Stephen Barclay is set to meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier this evening while foreign minister Jeremy Hunt will visit Paris and Warsaw this week.
May is set to meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker again before the end of the month.
The sides are stuck on the issue of how to keep the Irish border open after Britain leaves.
Brexit backers in May’s party think the so-called backstop arrangement in the current deal would keep Britain indefinitely tied to EU rules.
The DUP also argues that it will splinter the North from mainland Britain.
But Brussels calls the arrangement essential for both keeping the border open and preserving the European Union’s integrity.
May has been trying to win a legal assurance giving Britain the right eventually to drop the backstop and negotiate its own trade deals.
Speaking this afternoon, the EU’s Barnier said that the withdrawal agreement and backstop remain to best solution to avoiding a disorderly Brexit and that there is very little time left to settle a final Brexit deal.
If PM May is ready to budge on some of her “red lines” by agreeing to a customs union for example, Barnier said that Brussels would be ready to change the wording of a political declaration on future ties that accompanies the deal. Barnier also reiterated the importance of there being no hard border in Ireland.
While stressing that he does not want to interfere in British domestic politics, Barnier said that he has been studying a letter that Labour opposition leader Corbyn sent PM May last week.
May has rebuffed Corbyn’s call for London to seek a permanent customs union with Europe, but suggested further talks to try and build more cross-party support for a withdrawal agreement.
Barnier did not engage with Corbyn’s plan in detail, he said this afternoon, insisting his job was to deal with the British government, but he said that the opposition position was “interesting in tone and substance.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/impact-of-brexit-on-business-4486557-Feb2019/,"ALMOST SEVEN IN 10 (68%) small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Republic of Ireland think Britain leaving the European Union will have a negative impact on their businesses.
This figure rose by 5% in the last quarter of 2018.
A similar number of SMEs in Northern Ireland (62%) fear the same outcome, according to figures released today. This number remained unchanged in the last half of 2018.
The AIB Brexit Sentiment Index for the fourth quarter of 2018 also found that 35% of SMEs in the Republic and 40% in the North that had planned to expand or invest in their business have either cancelled or postponed investment plans due to Brexit.
In terms of the possibility of a hard border returning between the Republic and Northern Ireland, only 10% of SMEs in the North believe this will happen. However, this figure rises to 27% in the Republic.
The survey, which questioned 500 SMEs in the Republic and 200 in the North across a range of sectors, also found the following:
The Brexit Sentiment Index baseline is zero, with a potential range from +100 to -100. For Q4 2018, the index registered a score of -41 in the ROI, unchanged from Q3; and -31 in Northern Ireland for Q4 2018, compared with -35 in Q3 2018.
SMEs operating in the food and drink sector are most pessimistic (-53), ahead of retail (-45) and tourism (-42).
Catherine Moroney, Head of Business Banking at AIB, said despite the fact so many businesses are concerned about the impact of Brexit, just 8% have engaged in formal planning to deal with the outcome.

The survey found that the majority of SMEs (64%) believe their working capital requirements will stay the same in the next three years, while just over a quarter (26%) feel that they will require additional working capital as a result of Brexit.
Moroney said this is “particularly concerning as Brexit, whether hard or soft, will inevitably result in the need for increased working capital to manage businesses cost pressures or possible price inflation should Brexit eventuality result in the UK leaving the EU customs union”.
Backstop
Speaking in Belfastlast week, British Prime Minister Theresa May noted that people living in Northern Ireland and the Republic are understandably “anxious” about Brexit as it is there many of the effects will be most keenly felt.
May is struggling to get a Brexit deal over the line. The draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the EU was rejected by the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 last month.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deak, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of 29 March.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said the British government may seek an extension to Article 50 in a bid to secure a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-travel-brexit-no-deal-4433585-Jan2019/,"IN THE PAST few weeks before the Brexit deal, we’ve seen headlines about 89 trucks in a tailback at Dover, shipping companies with no ships, and about permissions to fly planes.
Next week, the Irish government is planning to announce its transport plans if there is a no-deal Brexit, the same week that the House of Commons is due to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement.
So why the focus on traffic, on land, sea and in the air? It’s been suggested that the Port of Dover test – carried out a week before the crucial vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement – was aimed at scaring MPs into voting for the unpopular deal to avoid the uncertainty of a no-deal scenario.
The British government has said it was testing the practicalities of a no-deal Brexit – which would mean more custom and regulatory checks at ports and airports – now that leaving with no deal seems increasingly likely.
Traffic delays are also the most tangible effect of a no-deal or hard Brexit, and give locals around ports and airports a preview of what could be in store immediately after the UK leaves the EU, as things begin to settle down.
Planes
With regards to airspaces, there’s little consensus on what planes can fly where after Brexit happens.
London and Brussels are making contingency plans that will allow UK carriers to continue flying to EU countries even if the Withdrawal Agreement is never approved.
But these are bare-bones arrangements that don’t allow British airlines to conduct intra-EU flights – meaning, as a passenger, you can fly from London to Paris and back to London without extra checks, but can’t fly on from Paris to Munich or another EU destination.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus’ parent company IAG has been told this month that its plans to continue flying around Europe after Brexit won’t work. European carriers have to be 50% EU-owned and controlled to be allowed to fly within the bloc, which will be a struggle for the company.
IAG were going to cite trusts and companies to get around this, according to the Irish Times, but it’s not certain that this will get them the approval they need.

The UK has spent more than £100 million on chartering ferries to mitigate the risk of “severe congestion” at the port of Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The government has struck deals worth €117 millionwith British, French and Danish ferry companies that would allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to use other ports on England’s south coast to prevent a bottleneck at Dover.
“This significant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s no-deal Brexit planning,” said a department spokesman.
This includes a company called Seaborne Freight, which was awarded a £13.8m contract despite having no ships, and whose terms and conditions on its website were copied and pasted from a food delivery firm.
“It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any meal/order,” the company’s website stated,according to the Guardian.
Trucks
This was the latest On Monday, 89 trucks took part in a government exercise for coping with possible Channel gridlock causedby a no-deal Brexit, assembling on a disused airport runway that could be turned into a giant lorry park.
Nearly 100 lorries descended on Manston airfield in southeast England, which has been identified as a possible holding facility under contingency plans for leaving the European Union without a divorce agreement on 29 March.
As part of the test, the vehicles then made two trips in convoy to and from the Port of Dover along a route far less used by trucks than the main highway from London.
“Today’s trial cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks being held at Manston airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” said Richard Burnett, head of the Road Haulage Association.
The exercise was also held with the hope of preparing locals for the traffic that would be created around the Port of Dover by a no-deal Brexit.
On Thursday,Sky News brokethe story that Honda was planning to halt production for six days after 29 March, when Brexit is scheduled to happen.
The UK manufacturing branch of Honda said that it had been assessing “how best to prepare for any disruption caused by logistics and border issues”after Brexit, and decided it would pause production until an outcome from the deal has been achieved.

Instead, the United Kingdom and European Unionagreed a flexible Brexit extensionuntil 31 Octoberfollowing marathon talksin Brussels. It was a move that, curiously, didn’t feel as urgent as previous decisions with Brexit. Perhaps fatigue was setting in.
But a big decision it was – the flextension gives UK Prime Minister Theresa May extra wiggle room to get her Brexit deal over the line. It means that she now has until Halloween to get her MPs to agree to the withdrawal deal. But it also means that the UK might have to start preparing to take part in the European elections.

https://www.thejournal.ie/andrea-leadsom-resigns-4647325-May2019/,"UK CABINET MINISTER Andrea Leadsom has quit Theresa May’s government, heaping more pressure on the beleaguered British Prime Minister.
Leadsom was the runner up in the Conservative leadership contest when May became leader in 2016 and until today served as Leader of the House of Commons.
In astatement this evening, Leadsom says she stayed in Cabinet “to shape and fight for Brexit” but “no longer believes that our approach will deliver on the referendum result”.
Leadsom said she had taken the decision to resign “with great regret and with a heavy heart”.
The senior minister says May’s latest proposal risks “undermining our Union” and will not deliver “a truly sovereign United Kingdom”
As part of a strategy to attempt to win support in the House of Commons,May tied the passing of her Withdrawal Agreementto an MPs vote on the holding of another referendum.
The decision enraged many within her own Tory party who pointed to the agreed policy that they would deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum.
In her statement, Leadsom said she had made some “uncomfortable compromises” up until now but cannot continue to support May.

“I no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum result, for the following reasons,” she wrote.
2. I have always maintained that a second referendum would be dangerously divisive, and I do not support the government willingly facilitating such a concession. It would also risk undermining our Union which is something I passionately want to see strengthened.
3. There has been such a breakdown of government processes that recent Brext-related legislative proposals have not been properly scrutinised or approved by Cabinet members.
4. The tolerance to those in Cabinet who have advocated policies contrary to the Government’s position has led to a complete breakdown of collective responsibility.

Leadsom made reference to the European elections being held in the UK tomorrow and said she had “considered carefully the timing of this decision”.
This latest departure has placed more pressure on May on a day in which her own departure appeared to be immement.
May will meet her party’s backbench 1922 Committee on Friday.
Only last week, the 1922 Committee said that a timetable for May’s departurewould be announced next month.
May had survived aconfidence vote of her parliamentary party in December. Under the rules of the 1922 Committee, another confidence vote in her leadership could not be called within in a year.
A poll ofConservative Party members last weekfound that former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is their overwhelming favourite to lead the party after May steps down.
Johnson has already stated that he will contest a leadership contest and Leadsom’s departure will be taken as a sign that she will also.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that she is preparing to make a “bold offer” to MPs in one final attempt to get them to back her Brexit deal.
May said that when she brings the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before parliament early next month, it will come with a new package of measures attached that she hopes can command majority support.
“I still believe there is a majority in parliament to be won for leaving with a deal,” May wrote in The Sunday Times newspaper.
MPs have rejected the deal May agreed with Brussels three times. This has led to the date of the UK leaving the EU being pushed back, first from 29 March to 12 April and then to 31 October.
The bill is needed to ratify the divorce agreement struck with the European Union.
On Thursday, May agreed to set out a timetable for her departure following the vote in the week beginning 3 June, regardless of whether MPs back her deal at the fourth time of asking.
It is thought that she will trigger a contest for the leadership of her governing Conservative Party once the bill either falls or completes all of its stages through parliament.

‘New and improved’
“When the Withdrawal Agreement Bill comes before MPs, it will represent a new, bold offer to MPs across the House of Commons, with an improved package of measures that I believe can win new support,” May said in the Times.
“Whatever the outcome of any votes, I will not be simply asking MPs to think again.
The bill is expected to include new measures on protecting workers’ rights, future customs arrangements with the EU, and on the use of technology to avoid the need for border controls between the UK and Ireland.
It will not, however, seek to re-open the withdrawal agreement, which Brussels repeatedly insisted could not be re-negotiated, despite many MPs voting it down due to concerns about the Northern Ireland backstop issue.
May is expected to set out the details of her proposals in a speech later this month.
Her latest “bold offer” comes ahead of the European Parliament elections, which will be held in Britain on Thursday.
The opinion polls make dire reading for the Conservatives, with Nigel Farage’s newly-formed Brexit Party forecast to win the most seats, ratcheting up the pressure on May.
The latest survey has put Farage’s single-issue party way ahead on 34%, with the Labour Party on 20%, the pro-EU Liberal Democrats on 15% and the Conservatives on 11%.","8.31am, 19 May 2019",

CHANGE UK, BRITAIN’S breakaway anti-Brexit party, appears to have imploded just weeks after its formation, following the resignation of six of its 11 MPs today.
The party was created by disillusioned MPs from the Conservative and Labour parties, and promised to forge a new pro-European path in British politics.
But it failed to win any seats in last month’s European Parliament elections – earning just 3% of the vote – and was divided over how closely it would work with other parties who want Britain to stay in the EU.
Leader Heidi Allen was among the six MPs who quit today. She was replaced by Anna Soubry, a fellow former Conservative known for her outspoken opposition to Brexit.
Allen had suggested supporters vote tactically to maximise the pro-European vote during the elections, a decision Soubry described afterwards as “bizarre”.

Soubry said she was “deeply disappointed” at the resignations, but said her party would keep working towards future elections.
“Now is not the time to walk away, but instead to roll up our sleeves and stand up for the sensible mainstream centre ground which is unrepresented in British politics today,” she said in a statement.
Allen and fellow ex-Conservative Sarah Wollaston, and former Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith and Chuka Umunna will now sit as independents in parliament.
“We know the landscape will continue to shift within the political environment and have concluded that by returning to sit as independents, we will be best placed to work cross-party and respond flexibly,” they said.

BRITISH ELECTRIC APPLIANCE pioneer Dyson will switch its headquarters to Singapore this year due to booming Asian demand andnotbecause of Brexit, the company said today.
The group, founded and owned by serial entrepreneur and vocal Brexit supporter James Dyson, last year announced it would produce electric cars in Singapore.
The firm stressed that Brexit was not a factor behind the decision to ditch its corporate base in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, western England, in favour of Singapore.
Dyson, famed for its cordless vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and fans, now has its sights set on electric vehicles – particularly in Asia.
“An increasing majority of Dyson’s customers and all of our manufacturing operations are now in Asia; this shift has been occurring for some time and will quicken as Dyson brings its electrical vehicle to market,” it said in an earnings statement.
A prototype Dyson electric vehicle is in the works for 2020, followed by a product launch in 2021.
‘Not related to Brexit’
The Singapore move “is not related to Brexit”, chief executive Jim Rowan told reporters on a conference call, noting there was only a “negligible” tax benefit.

“We don’t see any issues regarding Brexit,” he said, adding that Dyson’s manufacturing capacity, as well as the majority of its supply base, is in south-east Asia.
“We are a global technology company,” Rowan insisted, adding that it would continue to invest in home market Britain.
Dyson had already announced last October that it had picked Singapore for its first electric car plant, sparking criticism from some quarters that its Brexit-backing billionaire founder had not invested more in the UK.
But the group also said in March that it would open a second research and development centre in a former Royal Air Force airfield in Hullavington, southwest England.
Meanwhile, Dyson said that 2018 underlying profit – as measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) – surged one third to €1.2 billion (£1.1 billion).
Turnover, or sales, rose by 28% to stand at £4.4 billion on growing global appetite for cutting-edge technology.
“Globally, enthusiastic owners are demanding high-performance products so we are deepening out operations and technology investments to meet their needs,” added Rowan.
James Dyson, who owns 100% of the company he founded in the 1970s, has revolutionised household appliances with his bagless vacuum cleaners, bladeless fans and air purifiers.

This morning,the Daily Telegraphfirst reported that the contract was terminated by the UK government after an Irish company that was backing Seaborne Freight withdrew from the deal.
A Department for Transport spokeswoman told the Press Association:
“Following the decision of Seaborne Freight’s backer, Arklow Shipping, to step back from the deal, it became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements with the government. We have therefore decided to terminate our agreement.
Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Telegraph that the Irish government should confirm that it hadn’t intervened in the incident, or “obstructed” the UK’s no-deal Brexit plans.
Arklow Shipping and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have both been contacted for comment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-northern-ireland-visit-4475791-Feb2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will visit the Northern Ireland tomorrow to attend a meeting with local businesses and community groups.
The full details of the trip are yet to be released but it is understood May will also deliver a speech on Brexit during her visit.
It has yet to be confirmed if she will visit the border or make a trip to the Republic of Ireland.
The trip to the North comes asMay’s government meet todayto discuss alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop with a working group including Eurosceptic MPs, as three days of talks begin today.
‘Alternative arrangements’
The Alternative Arrangements Working Group – with Leave and Remain MPS – will meet for the first time today after the House of Commons voted for May to seek alternative arrangements to the backstop.
Advertisement
EU officials have insisted that the deal – rejected by British lawmakers – is not open for renegotiation.
But May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she would be “battling for Britain and Northern Ireland” in her efforts to get rid of the agreement’s unpopular “backstop” provision.
“If we stand together and speak with one voice, I believe we can find the right way forward,” she said.
Downing Street said it had established “an Alternative Arrangements Working Group” to mull the backstop issue starting today, and added that “there are a number of ideas on this, including a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit”.
The so-called backstop is intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border with Ireland, but Brexit supporters fear it will keep Britain tied to the EU’s customs rules.
MPs voted last week to send May back to Brussels to renegotiate the clause, suggesting that her deal would then be able to pass after it was roundly rejected in parliament last month.
‘Reassurance’
Speaking in Brussels today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he welcomes May’s visit to the North tomorrow, stating that the people of Northern Ireland need “reassurance” from the British government right now.
Touching on the issue of re-opening the withdrawal agreement, he said 18 months was sent negotiating the deal. “Of course we want to provide assurances and clarity to the UK to assist the ratification process on the UK side,” said Coveney, however he added that from the Irish perspective, some of the core issues, particularly around the backstop, there have already been a series of compromises around UK red lines.
When asked if May’s Alternative Arrangements Working Group is endeavouring on a pointless search, the Tánaiste said that within the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement, alternative arrangements or alternative solutions to the backstop are allowed.
However, the problem has always been in that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny, he said.
“We certainly haven’t seen any that have,” said Coveney, adding:
“We spent well over a year looking at different ways of providing the guarantee of no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland, which protects an all-island economy, that reinforces a peace process, many, many hours I can tell you was involved in coming up with a legally credible and pragmatic solution to that problem and in that process we looked at lots of different alternative ideas and alternative arrangements and so on and I have yet to hear any new thinking that goes beyond what has already been tested and that is the issue here.”
“What Ireland is being asked to do from some in Westminster is essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and the EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking,” he said.
He said remains very clear – the withdrawal agreement was agreed between all parties.
“We expect them to follow through on that commitment.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-my-generation-has-only-known-peace-on-this-island-but-im-afraid-thats-about-to-change-4536794-Mar2019/,"DESPITE GROWING UP just 10 minutes drive from the border with Northern Ireland, I never felt its influence on my life in any major way.
As a millennial kid growing up in Monaghan, my big concerns were the same as most other teenagers in a hopeful ‘Celtic Tiger’ Ireland.
Unlike my folks, I could expect to go to college, get a decent job and travel freely without the expectation of violence or injustice.
I didn’t care who was Protestant or who was Catholic or whether someone was from the North or the South and I never needed to.
The ‘border’, in my mind wasn’t much more than an arbitrary line we drove over on our way to pick up cheaper heating oil, booze or clothes from Topshop.
I’d notice the signs turning from green to white, kilometres to miles, green and orange to red and blue – and then back again without much fuss.
I had just a few vague memories of trips to Newry or Armagh town as a kid before the Good Friday Agreement; the barbed wire and soldiers with guns leaning in the window of the car, my mother and grandad falling silent as we went through the checkpoint, the feeling of tension and oppression, the violence and anger in the air.
These aren’t pleasant memories, but they aren’t particularly traumatic ones either.
The traumatic stories were ones I heard from family; memories of the Monaghan bombing, friends killed and wounded, beatings, shops refusing to serve Catholics, raids at border checkpoints and many near misses with often merciless soldiers.
But mostly, the tales of ‘The Troubles’ my family told were laced with hints of nostalgia. Humour would be carefully woven through what were objectively miserable stories.
I’d feel grateful for the sacrifices that were made for the peaceful world I got to live in, never really connecting with the deep trauma that lay just beneath the surface of the people I loved.
Advertisement
It’s that sense of naive nostalgia felt by many young people along the border that frightens me now.
The young people who are at Brexit’s mercy, have no living memory of the war or the violence and trauma that came before us. We don’t fully understand how precarious and precious our peace is or how high a price our parents and grandparents paid for it.
But if the hard border comes, we’ll see armed police and maybe even soldiers on windy country back roads that we used to pass through freely.
Our cars will be searched, we’ll lose employment opportunities as trading routes are cut off and our town will once again dwindle into economic despair.
The freedom to decide our own futures and to escape outdated identities like ‘Nationalist’ or ‘Unionist’, ‘Southerner’ or ‘Northerner’ will be taken from us. We will once again have to decide what side of the line we stand on.
Without the living memory of the trauma of war to immunise us, many will be sucked into a renewed violence that’s bred from despair, disempowerment, mistrust and paranoia.
We need to do everything in our power to stop any kind of border being erected because it is going to create the conditions for violence and division to flourish.
We’ve already seen letter bombs sent to London and car bombs in Derry in response to the mere threat of a hard border.
The values we’ve held dear since the Good Friday Agreement can only hold strong if the foundations are in place to bend us towards reconciliation, forgiveness, trust and faith in a shared and flourishing future.
As the people who’ll suffer through Brexit’s consequences, it’s time for us to make ourselves heard by decision makers in Ireland, north and south, the UK and the EU.
Already more than 73,000 people across the UK and Ireland have signedan open lettertelling Theresa May to take our peace process off the negotiating table.
Will youadd your nameto our petition and publicly stand up for an Ireland of peace and hope rather than one of violence?

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-no-deal-bbc-fact-check-4632847-May2019/,"BREXIT PARTY LEADER, Nigel Farage, has claimed that he coined the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” and used it repeatedly during the 2016 Brexit referendum when campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.
In recent months, Farage has been one of the most prominent advocates of a no-deal Brexit, which would see the UK leave the EU without an agreement and would instead trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
But is this claim true?Did Nigel Farage coin the phrase no deal is better than a bad deal?
During an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday 12 May Nigel Farage was quizzed on the history of his advocacy for a no-deal Brexit during and subsequently following the 2016 referendum campaign.
Pressed by presenter Andrew Marr on why he didn’t campaign for no deal during the campaign itself, Farage said: “In the referendum itself, I was the one that coined the phrase ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’, which of course is pretty obvious.”

Following further questioning, Farage said: “No deal is better than a bad deal – I was using [that exact phrase] every day for the last two weeks of that campaign.” When Andrew Marr told him that he couldn’t find a public record of him using that exact phrase during the campaign, Farage disputed this and suggested Marr should look closer.
The phrase has become increasingly prominent during the negotiationsbetween the UK government and the EU, with Farage and other high-profile Brexit supporters urging UK Prime Minister Theresa Mayto walk away from the EUwithout an agreement rather than accepting what they perceive as an inferior deal.
May herself used the phrase during the Brexit negotiations, most famously in a speech atLanchester House in January 2017. However, this month she distanced herself from the idea that it was better to leave the EUwithout a deal.
Critics of Farage and his fellow no-deal supporters have argued thatthey have shifted positionfrom arguing that achieving a deal with the EU would be straightforward to advocating for a no-deal Brexit.
Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), campaigned for the UK to leave the EU during the 2016 referendum. Before and during the campaign, Farage was bullish about the prospects of the UK achieving a deal with the EU.
In a clip from the Andrew Marr Show in November 2015, played on the programme on Sunday, Farage advocated for the benefits of a negotiated exit with the EU and suggested that the UK would have little difficulty securing its own tailored deal: “Iceland and Switzerland can get deals that suit them. We can do something far far better than that.”
He also said: “Norway chooses its own deal. We will choose our own deal.”

Regarding the referendum campaign itself, a search of the LexisNexis database for the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” in UK national newspapers between 15 April 2016, when the referendum campaign officially launched, and 23 June, the final day of campaigning, returnedzeroresults.
When it comes to the origin of the phrase, the first appearance of “no deal is better than a bad deal” in UK national newspapers came inJuly 2016andcan be creditedto property developer and Brexit campaigner Richard Tice. In an article on 25 July 2016, British newspaperThe Sunquoted Tice as stating: “When it comes to negotiating Brexit, no deal is better than a bad deal.” Tice is the current chairman of the Brexit Party and worked on the Leave.EU campaign in 2016.
However, the phrase did not originate in relation to Brexit and waswidely used before 2016. For example, various commentators and politicians used the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” in relation tothe 2015 Iran nuclear deal. For instance, then-British Foreign SecretaryPhilip Hammondsaid: “There is going to have to be some give or take if we are to get this done in the next few days… No deal is better than a bad deal.” Donald Trump also used the phrase to announcehis opposition to the dealon Twitter in July 16 2016.
Farage did however use a version of this phrase during the referendum campaign to compare no deal to the UK’s current EU membership. On3 June 2016, he said “Even if our friends in France and Italy decide to cut off their noses to spite their faces…it will better than the rotten deal we have now.” And on8 June 2016, he said “no deal is better than the rotten deal that we’ve got at the moment.”
He continued making this claim after the referendum in aninterview with RTpublished on 28 June 2016, where he considered the possibility of no deal following unsuccessful negotiations with the EU: “If this didn’t work, if we reach the worst case scenario of no deal being on offer, no deal is better for us than the rotten deal we have now and very bad for them.”
Farage also used a version of the phrase in aspeech to the European Parliamenton June 29 2016, when he told his fellow MEPs that “even no deal is better for the United Kingdom than the current rotten deal.”
So while Farage did make several references to the idea that a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to EU membership during and immediately following the referendum, there is no evidence that Farage publicly used the specific phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” to refer to a hypothetical future deal between the UK and the EU following a successful Brexit vote during the campaign itself.
TheJournal.iehas contacted Farage and the Brexit Party asking him to provide evidence to support his claim. However, neither Farage nor the party responded for this FactCheck.
It is clear that the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” was not coined by Nigel Farage and was used widely before the 2016 Brexit referendum.
There is no evidence that Farage publicly used the exact phrase during the referendum campaign between April and June 2016. He did use a version of the phrase to suggest that a no-deal Brexit outcome would still be better than continued EU membership, but he did not coin the phrase and did not use it to suggest that a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to a negotiated exit from the EU during the campaign period itself.
As a result, we rate the claim that Nigel Farage coined the phrase “no deal is better than a bad deal” and used it repeatedly during the Brexit referendum campaign:Mostly FALSE
While Nigel Farage did not coin the phrase or use the exact wording “no deal is better than a bad deal” during the referendum campaign, he did suggest that a no-deal exit would be better than continued EU membership and as a potentially preferable outcome if negotiations with the EU produced an unsatisfactory deal.
As per our verdict guide, this means: There is an element of truth in the claim, but it is missing critical details or context. Or, the best available evidence weighs against the claim.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bertie-ahern-brexit-committee-4491336-Feb2019/,"FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has insisted repeatedly to a House of Commons Brexit committee that Finchley is not the same as Belfast, saying that such an assertion is “constitutionally incorrect”.
He said that Brexit had thrown up the future of Northern Ireland into doubt, that “young people have grown up in a safer place because of the Good Friday Agreement”, and that “nobody wants to see a hardening of that border”.
He told theUK’s Exiting the European Union Committeethis morning:
“I wondered had I turned into Rip Van Winkle, who fell asleep for 20 years and woke up to find out that everything had changed.”
When asked about how the Irish people reacted to suggestions that Ireland could join up with the UK and leave the European Union as well, he said: “Not very well.”
He also asserted that “I said there was a difference between Dublin and Belfast… but I also said that there’s a difference between Belfast and Finchley.
“What frustrates me and others is there’s a view that Northern Ireland is so intrinsically linked to the UK in a way that [supersedes] the Good Friday Agreement, and that’s the bit that really upsets us.”

He said that on his way to the committee that a man stopped him and “didn’t say good morning to me, didn’t say goodbye to me”, but gave his view on Brexit and Northern Ireland, as people tend to do.
Ahern added that it was his view that if it wasn’t for Brexit, the Northern Ireland institutions “would be up and running again”.
He was also asked about Irish people’s view of the backstop, and said that it was “one of those rare moments” where the other parties in Ireland, the people of Ireland and Irish businesses support the government’s handling of Brexit, and the backstop.
He added: “It doesn’t need loads of pages, but I understand people need to do their job.”

Sammy Wilson referred to the “rhetoric of the current Taoiseach”, and apparent threats he says that Leo Varadkar made by “turning off lights, stopping planes, sending troops, and building Berlin wall around the border”.
He asked the former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach if he found that rhetoric helpful at this time, and Ahern replied:
“Well you know how much I love all the parties in Northern Ireland, and how much I love all the parties in the south of Ireland. What I’ve spent my life doing, is trying to make sure we have a love-in of all of us, so rhetoric from anybody at anytime isn’t helpful.”
When asked about the effect of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland, Ahern referenced possible job losses, and the impact on trade.
“It’s always the issue that the overall figures mightn’t look too horrific, but when you look at the small indigenous famers and small employers, it would be devastating,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/withdrawal-agreement-bill-brexit-friday-4646706-May2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be published on Friday, after weeks of calls for the exact legal text to be revealed.
If parliament passes it, the UK will be out of the EU by the end of July, she told the House of Commons. It’s still not clear when a vote on the bill will be held.
“We need to take decisions, not to duck them,” she said urging the House of Commons to vote for her Brexit deal which has been passed by the EU but thrice-rejected by MPs in the House of Commons.

May announced “ten changes” to the current Brexit deal yesterday in an effort to win MPs’ support for her deal and pass it through the UK parliament, but it was almost immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers and the DUP.
May said that the ten-point offer would “protect British jobs by seeking as frictionless trade as possible” with the EU, and keep “much-needed certainty by keeping up-to-date with EU agri-food regulations that would avoid checks at the border”.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the deal today, saying it satisfied no one. “Her ten-point plan is riddled with contradictions,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-of-commons-brexit-4530788-Mar2019/,"PRIME MINISTER THERESA May’s much-maligned withdrawal agreement, delaying Brexit or crashing out without a deal?
Yet again, this week will see the spotlight squarely on Westminster with MPs set to determine the course of the UK’s future with a series of crucial votes on Brexit.
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
There are a number of different ways it could go, so here’s the possible paths with the Brexit endgame set to get under way.
So here we go again.
After lengthy, prolonged negotiations Theresa May’s government secured a withdrawal agreement with the EU. This deal contains the provisions for the Irish backstop – the measure that would avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
May’s withdrawal agreement has proven unpalatable for the DUP, hardline Conservatives and the opposition parties.
She delayed a vote on this deal in December when it became clear she wouldn’t have the votes to pass it in the House of Commons. Nothing in the agreement changed, and it was roundly defeated in a vote in January.
Despite numerous talks with the EU since then, little has changed in the withdrawal agreement with the Irish government and Brussels refusing to back down on the backstop.
Nevertheless, MPs will vote again on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement on Tuesday 12 March.
Her deal was crushed in the January vote by a majority of 230.
Here are the scenarios for the meaningful vote.
Somehow, someway she manages to get the vote through parliament despite the previous thumping defeat. If this happens, then the UK will have finally ratified the withdrawal agreement with the EU.
Short of the UK holding a second referendum and opting to stay in the EU, it’s the best result for Ireland as it prevents a hard border with Northern Ireland and the economy take the hit that is feared would happen if there was a no-deal Brexit.
If May somehow wins, the subsequent votes that are outlined belowwill not take place.
As expected, May loses the vote.
If it’s by a small margin, it could convince the Conservative leader to try to entice opposition Labour MPs with further concessions to try twist the numbers back on her side.
If the vote is lost by a significant margin, then that is the death knell for the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement.
And, if it’s lost by a sizeable margin, MPs will be voting again the next day.
If May loses the meaningful vote, then MPs will get the chance to vote on whether or not they’d like to leave the EU without an agreement on Wednesday 13 March.
A no deal would be the worst case scenario for Ireland, paving the way for the return of a hard border andhitting the Irish economy hard and fast.

It is the favoured option of the likes of the European Research Group headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg which believes a no deal wouldn’t be bad for the UK.
However, the appetite for a no-deal Brexit is limited to only a small number of MPs. Indications so far are that this vote will certainly not pass.
Here are the scenarios for the vote on a no-deal Brexit.
This is unlikely to happen. But if it does, it provides a mandate from the House of Commons for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.
It’s likely further attempts could be made to prevent this from happening following the vote, but how that would work remains to be seen.
By now we’re running out of options. If this option is chosen – as expected – then MPs will have rejected the deal on the table, and also leaving without a deal.
Given these choices, they will be asked to vote again the following the day on the last remaining option at this time.
Article 50 was the mechanism through which the UK triggered its withdrawal from the EU. It set a time limit of 29 March to negotiate all the necessary arrangements with the EU before it left.
If we reach this vote on Thursday 14 March, it will mean that these arrangements have not been agreed upon.
By then, it will be just over two weeks until the UK is due to leave the EU.
Theresa May has said that MPs will be given the chance to vote on extending Article 50 by a number of months in a bid for more time to break the impasse.
Brexiteers will oppose any delay but if it makes it this far, it will have become apparent that there no one can agree on any deal passing.
This one is difficult to predict, although it appears likely that there would be enough numbers in the Commons to pass this one.
Here are the scenarios in this one.
This would be truly farcical. It would mean that, in the space of three days, parliament voted a) against the only deal on the table, b) not to leave without a deal on 29 March and c) against extending this 29 March deadline.
At the very least, this would buy May and the UK some time. What she does with that time, however, is unclear. After lengthy talks, the EU and the Irish government has refused to back down.
Extending Article 50 is unlikely to change that but it could allow May more time to make concessions to sway either the Brexiteers in her own party and the DUP, or those on the opposition benches.
If it gets to this point, then it will be a case of the UK kicking the can down the road yet again.
May will be left with a more few options in this scenario – she could call a general election, she could step down as leader and prime minister. If she does step down it could also be a case of jumping before she’s pushed, as the Brexiteers furious at any delays to Brexit may try to oust her.
If Article 50 is extended, then it will create more uncertainty as the UK will remain in the EU for a further period without a way forward in sight.
Whatever happens, we’re set for another week of high drama in Westminster.
It may not be possible to accurately predict exactly what will happen, but we are sure to get a lot ofthis:

https://www.thejournal.ie/insurance-green-cards-brexit-4516751-Feb2019/,"ONE MILLION GREEN Card forms and electronic application templates have been issued to insurance providers by the  Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.
The figure was revealed at a special briefing organised for members of the Oireachtas.
In January, motorists were told they would require aninsurance Green Cardto drive in Northern Ireland and the UK in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
Brexit is meant to officially happen on 29 March but — having previously rejected the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck by the British government and the EU — the House of Commons tonight overwhelmingly backed a proposal that couldallow Brexit to be delayed.
The MIBI has advised motorists who plan on driving in Northern Ireland and the UK immediately after 29 March to begin applying for their Green Cards from next week, in case a no-deal scenario materialises.
Those who plan on travelling after that period have been advised to contact their insurance company or broker one month in advance of their expected travel date.
Currently, Irish-registered vehicles that travel within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU Motor Insurance Directive. However, a no-deal Brexit would see the UK withdraw from this directive, meaning Irish motorists will require a Green Card to travel there.
WhileMIBI guidelinesstate that there is no charge to obtain a Green Card, some insurers say that fees may apply when customers order them.
Penalties
Green Cards are documents which provide proof of insurance cover to law enforcement agencies in the relevant country. The MIBI has warned that motorists who drive in Northern Ireland or the UK without a Green Card, if no Brexit deal is agreed, “could possibly be subjected to the penalties for driving uninsured after that date”.

If a deal is reached, the cards will not be necessary. If Britain seeks to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit, which looks increasingly likely, the need for the cards would also be delayed.
Speaking after the Oireachtas briefing, David Fitzgerald, Chief Executive of the MIBI, said: “We still hope that Green Cards will not be required and that the UK will reach an agreement with the EU on an orderly Brexit.”
Fitzgerald said that under a no-deal Brexit, Irish insurance documentation “may no longer be recognised by the law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland or the rest of the UK”. He noted that penalties for driving in these countries without insurance include having your vehicle seized at the side of the road, fines and impoundment.
“We don’t want to see that happen to motorists with valid insurance and we urge anyone who thinks this may impact them to apply for a Green Card in sufficient time,” he said.
‘Breach of Good Friday Agreement’
The potential need for Green Cards has been criticised by many politicians. Sinn Féin TD Gerry Adams today said there is “an absence of information” about if and how the Green Card system would be implemented, and what powers An Garda Síochána and the PSNI would have if they stopped a driver who didn’t have a Green Card.
“The government must urgently put the case to the European Commission to waive the green card requirement,” Adams said.
Robert Troy, Fianna Fáil’s Spokesperson on Transport, noted that around 13,000 cross-border journeys are made by those driving heavy goods vehicles and light goods vehicles every day.
“There are thousands of people who cross the border every day for work, school, college, medical appointments and to simply visit family or friends. It is imperative for these people that they can continue in their daily lives without impediments,” Troy said in a statement.
Minister for Transport Shane Ross previously said it is not clear if motorists will be prosecuted for failing to carry Green Cards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Earlier this month he told the Oireachtas Transport Committee: “If there is a no-deal Brexit, Irish-registered vehicles entering UK territory, including Northern Ireland, will be required to carry a Green Card, a document which proves that they have motor insurance.
“Likewise UK citizens wishing to take their UK registered motor vehicles into Ireland will also require a Green Card.”

SO, WHAT IN heavens happens now?
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, negotiated over a period of two years between her officials and the EU,has been rejectedfor the third time in three months.
Despite intense lobbying by the Prime Minister’s team, the deal was defeated by a majority of 58; her deal was previously defeated by 230 votes, and then by 149 votes.
As her deal is defeated, the default leave date is now 12 April.
If her deal had been approved, the UK would have left the EU under the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May, the day before EU elections begin.
After her vote was rejected by 344 MPs, May said exasperatedly: “I fear we are reaching the limits of the process in this House”.
So whatarethe options, and how likely are they?
More indicative votes
On Monday, April Fools’ Day, the UK parliament will hold a second day of indicative votes;the last round of votes held on Wednesdayresulted in the parliament rejecting all 8 options put forward.
Commons Press OfficeCommons Press Office
But some of those options – such as a Customs Union which was only rejected by six votes – may have a chance of being approved by MPs now that May’s deal has been rejected.
It was negotiated with the European Union that if May’s deal was rejected, the UK would have to decide what was to happen next.
After the result in the House of Commons, European Council President Donald Tusk said that he was calling an emergency meeting of EU heads of state on 10 April.
It’s intended that the UK will suggest what should happen next to the EU, and the European Council’s 27 leaders will discuss whether to approve that option on 10 April (with the UK due to leave the EU two days later, remember).
Frank AugsteinFrank Augstein
Another extension
The option to extend Article 50, which would mean delaying the date the UK is due to leave the EU, has already been taken (Brexit day was meant to be today).
But UK and EU politicians are worried about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, so in order to avoid that, they might give the UK another longer extension in order for them to get their House in order.
Another extension would most likely mean that the UK would remain in the EU during the European elections that are being held between 23 and 26 May (Ireland’s election is on 24 May). Theresa May has said that this would almost certainly mean that the UK would have to take part in European elections.
The EU has said that this would have to happen because if the UK were to remain in the EU but not take part in the election, there’s a fear that they could be vulnerable to legal challenges taken by citizens in the UK who want to exercise their right to vote.

If they did take part in the European elections, Nigel Farage has indicated that he would run as a Brexit Party candidate, as would other pro-Brexit advocates. This would mean a stronger pro-Brexit presence in the European Parliament, which neither side wants but could well happen.

The Withdrawal Agreement
Renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement is the suggestion made by some of those who have been voting against the deal: including the DUP, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, and ERG member Steve Baker.
They are calling for the backstop specifically to be renegotiated, with Baker saying that there were many elements to the Withdrawal Agreement that were bad, but claimed that the backstop “means we’ll indefinitely be trapped”.
The likelihood is quite low though. Leading figures of the European Union have said that the negotiation is finished, and they can only provide legal assurances on what has already been agreed.
“The European Council has agreed unanimously that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be re-opened,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in the immediate aftermath of the deal being rejected, repeating comments Theresa May made to the House of Commons minutes before.
It’s also possible that the Withdrawal Agreement could be put forward for a fourth vote next week…
Based on conversations I've had, feels as though May will give it one more try next week and if that fails she will ask for a long extension and possibly call a general election. She would come under huge pressure to quit though— Gordon Rayner (@gordonrayner)March 29, 2019Gordon Rayner/ Twitter
Based on conversations I've had, feels as though May will give it one more try next week and if that fails she will ask for a long extension and possibly call a general election. She would come under huge pressure to quit though
Theresa May told parliament after her deal was rejected that she would still push for an “orderly exit” on 22 May; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn then pushed her to accept that her Brexit deal isn’t good enough to pass, and should be left to one side.
She didn’t really do that.
Instead, one of the likely scenarios being put forward is that if a customs union gets a majority in the House of Commons on Monday, May could put her deal back to a vote – with an amendment that a customs union could be included as part of it.
It would then be for the European Council to approve a deal with a customs union, an option which they would be happy with as the EU wants as close a relationship as possible with the UK.
General election, second referendum, and revoking Article 50
If a longer extension is granted, a general election and a second referendum are increasingly likely, as the UK establishment would have the time to organise them.
Commons Press OfficeCommons Press Office
Earlier in the week, May promised that she would step aside if her deal was passed today, sparking talk of who her successor could be. If there wasa Tory leadership, it could take up to 6 weeks from start to finish.
Ageneral electioncould also be called: this could rearrange the numbers in the House of Commons enough so that there would be a clear majority for a type of Brexit. If a snap election was called, it would take around two months to organise.
In 2017, a snap election was held on 8 June after Theresa May called for it on 18 April (it was this election that lost May her majority in the House of Commons and led to a coalition with the DUP…)
Afteran online petitiongathered almost 6 million signatures, questions have also been raised on whether the British government couldrevoke Article 50, thereby undoing the entire Brexit process.
A European court has already decided that the British government has the power to do this, but May has so far refused to entertain the idea, saying that it would weaken people’s trust in democracy if she were to unilaterally reverse what the majority of the British public voted for.

No deal
A “no-deal scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario”, the European Commission has said in a statement after the vote.
Despite the majority of MPs voting against a no-deal Brexit, the default position is currently that on 12 April at 11pm, the UK will leave the EU without a deal. There are a number of serious ramifications of that, forIreland especially.
And even in a no-deal scenario, the UK would still have to hold negotiations with the EU eventually about its new relationship, so even in the walk-away scenario, they would still need to hold negotiations to try to strike a deal.

DOZENS OF BRITISH MPs have written to London’s police chief to warn about a “deteriorating public order and security situation” around parliament, after Brexit supporters assailed pro-EU figures there on yesterday.
A cross-party group of 55 lawmakers sent the letter to the Metropolitan Police commissioner after prominent Remain supporting MP Anna Soubry was called a “Nazi” by the protesters during live TV interviews near parliament.
The Conservative lawmaker and at least two pro-European Union commentators were then pursued and harangued by the group as they made their way through the area.
“We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the parliamentary estate,” the MPs’ letter to police chief Cressida Dick stated, noting similar incidents last year.
“An ugly element of individuals with strong far right and extreme right connections… have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public.”
Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said the issue was discussed at today’s weekly cabinet meeting.
“Cabinet condemned the unacceptable and disgraceful treatment of Anna Soubry outside of parliament yesterday,” the spokesman said.
“The prime minister said this was not how debate should be conducted in our country.”

‘Briefed to intervene’
Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said in a statement that it was assessing “if any crimes have been committed” following a reported public order offence.

Asked by reporters whether labelling someone as “a Nazi” was a criminal offence, Taylor said:
He added the force would “deal robustly with incidents of harassment and abuse” which could be criminal, and that officers had been “briefed to intervene appropriately where they hear or see breaches of the law.”

Earlier today, Soubry accused the Met of ignoring the increasing levels of abuse hurled at politicians and journalists.
The MP told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme that protestors were regularly “roaming around Westminster intimidating people going about their lawful business”.
There was a noticeable police presence around parliament today, particularly on the College Green site where media outlets carry anchored live coverage and conduct interviews with MPs and commentators.
Several police trucks were seen parked up, while pairs and clusters of officers stood at different points around the perimeter of the laws.
Political tensions are heightened in Westminster ahead of a crunch vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal next week.
Harry Todd, 27, a campaign organiser for the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave group protesting at Westminster daily since early December, said: “We have condemned the behaviour because it was unacceptable”.
Todd added he welcomed a more forceful police response.
“I want everyone to feel safe when they’re protesting,” he said.

“Indeed every time we seek an extension to this process we diminish faith in our political system and the good people, from all political parties, who serve within it,” Heaton-Harris wrote.

Speaking yesterday aftera marathon day of talks with her Cabinet colleagues, Theresa May said she wanted an extension to the Brexit deadline in order to agree a deal.
May said she would seek talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in order to facilitate this and there were suggestions that May could pursue a softer Brexit, such as the inclusion of a customs union arrangement, as part of these talks.
During last night’s statement in Downing Street, May said that although she believed the UK could “make a success” of no-deal in the long run, leaving with a deal would be preferable.
In his resignation letter, Heaton-Harris said that while he would have preferred to leave the EU with May’s deal, he believes the UK “would have swiftly overcome any immediate issues of leaving without a deal and gone on to thrive”.

“It has been a privilege to work with some quite brilliant civil servants in my Department and across your government. They have moved mountains to prepare our country for leaving the European Union without a negotiated deal,” Heaton-Harris wrote.
“Unfortunately, I do not believe the briefings you have received on these matters recently have received on these matters recently have reflected all they have achieved or the preparations out European partners have made,” he wrote.
Other resignation
Earlier today, assistant government whip Nigel Adams also announced his resignation.
“I believe we have two great challenges. We must deliver the Brexit that the people voted for. And we must prevent the calamity of a Corbyn government. Sadly, I fear that we are now at risk of simultaneously failing in both,” Adams wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister.
Following yesterday’s cabinet, this morning I’ve been to Downing Street & resigned my position as UK Govt Minister for Wales & Govt Whip.

“At Cabinet yesterday, there was an opportunity to get onto the front foot for once. However, by legitimising and turning to Jeremy Corbyn, to assist you at this crucial stage, rather than being bold, is grave error,” he said.
A front page story in today’sDaily Telegraphreported that May was “ignoring the will of her Cabinet” by seeking Corbyn’s help instead of pursuing no deal and that “a full-scale Tory rebellion” could follow.
May’s director of communicationsdenied the story this morning.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-tusk-long-brexit-delay-4584323-Apr2019/,"EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk has urged the bloc’s leaders to allow Britain to delay Brexit for up to a year.
The bloc agreed last month to postpone Brexit day, originally set for 29 March, and set 12 April as the new deadline under certain conditions.
Britain has until Friday to approve the existing withdrawal agreement, to change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or to crash out of the EU without an agreement.
May has asked the remaining EU countries for another postponement that would extend to 30 June, hoping to secure an alternative deal from the opposition negotiations and Parliament in a matter of weeks.
Other European leaders are expected to respond to the delay request during Wednesday’s summit in Brussels.
May will head to the EU summit on Wednesday seeking to secure the Brexit extension until 30 June.
‘Flextension’
Speaking of the 30 June date, Tusk has said the evidence of recent months gave “little reason to believe” divided British lawmakers would ratify a divorce deal by then.
“This is why I believe we should also discuss an alternative, longer extension,” Tusk wrote in a letter inviting EU leaders to Wednesday’s Brexit summit.
Under this so-called “flextension” arrangement, Britain could leave the EU as soon as parliament ratified the withdrawal agreement.

“Importantly, a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability by removing the threat of constantly shifting cliff-edge dates,” Tusk wrote.
Berlin and Paris
Today, May made a trip to Berlin and Paris to speak with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron about allowing her more time to get her divorce deal approved.
During her meetings with both Merkel and Macron, leaders discussed the request for an Article 50 extension.

Speaking of the meeting with Merkel, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister outlined the steps the government is taking to bring the Brexit process to a successful conclusion, and updated Chancellor Merkel on the ongoing discussions with the opposition.”
May also updated Macron on ongoing talks with the opposition Labour party.
The UK government today acknowledged that it will not have secured a Brexit compromise with the Labour party before Wednesday’s summit.
Senior ministers met with top figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s party today.
“We have had further productive and wide-ranging talks this afternoon, and the parties have agreed to meet again on Thursday once European Council has concluded,” a spokesman said.
“We remain completely committed to delivering on Brexit, with both sides working hard to agreeing a way forward, appreciating the urgency in order to avoid European elections,” they said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/best-april-fools-jokes-4572074-Apr2019/,"IN THE ERA of fake news and the ongoing descent of politics into farce, it can be harder and harder to distinguish real stories from April Fool’s jokes.
This morning, readers ofTheJournal.iewoke up to a headlinesuggesting Theresa May was set to appear on Eastendersto address the nation about Brexit – which would hardly seem outlandishin light of some storiesthat have come out of the UK recently.
In fact, one might be led to think that April Fool’s jokes could be on the way out, but if anything, this year has shown the possibilities are as strong as ever.
Here are ten of this year’s best efforts from Ireland and abroad.
Three more Luke Kelly statues – Irish Daily Mail
In January, Dubliners got to celebrate one of their most iconic sons, when not one, but two Luke Kelly statueswere unveiled in the capital.
For its gag, The Irish Daily Mail claimed that a further €10m had been allocated for three more bronze statues of the singer.
The newspaper quoted Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who said he wanted one of the statues to be located in Santry, on the north of the city, and also claimed other cities were seeking Luke Kelly statues of their own, including Newcastle, Auckland, New York and Cork.
Bend in The Spire – Dublin Chamber
Business group Dublin Chamber issued a press release expressing concern over an increasingly prominent bend in The Spire on Dublin’s O’Connell Street.
The group claimed it had received numerous from concerned local businesses about the issue, which it believed was the result of very strong winds.
The story was (knowingly) picked up by a number of news outlets, including The Irish Mirror.
Alien skulls found on Irish coast – Dun Laoghaire Coast Guard
Dun Laoghaire Coast Guard also got in on the act, claiming that gardaí were tasked to Dun Laoghaire’s inner harbour after the discovery two alien skulls in low water.
The group claimed that one of the skulls had washed out to sea by the time they arrived, but that the second was recovered by the Coast Guard Unit, as the RNLI searched for the missing one.

Clocks go forwardagain -The Sun
Meanwhile, The Irish Sun capitalised on the move to summer time in Ireland over the weekend.
The aptly named paper said a landmark European Parliament meant thta clocks would go forward again this week, despite recent EU studies claiming that changing the clocks twice a year was damaging to health and energy.
Bob Geldof as a “healing tsar” – The Guardian
There was no shortage of Brexit-related material for April Fool’s this year, either here or across the water.

The Guardianclaimed that singer Bob Geldof was being considered as a “healing tsar” for country amid its ongoing political woes.
One insider was quotes as promoting Geldof’s credentials saying that because the Dubliner had brought the country together with Live Aid, he could do it again.
Commemorative Brexit stamps – Isobel
News companies weren’t the only ones to capitalise on the ongoing madness surrounding Brexit.
Branding company Isobel said it had commissioned a book of Brexit stamps, including images of Theresa May, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, which it claimed had to be pulled.

April Fool’s banned – The Daily Telegraph
The Daily Telegraphwent for a wider news approach for its joke.
The paper claimed that all British April Fools’ gags would be banned from next year because the public could no longer differentiate between “reality and farce”.
It claimed a statute from 1653, reportedly banning the issuing of false reports, would be used enforce the law.
Martin Brennan for Sligo County Council – The Irish Daily Star
The Irish Daily Star capitalised on recent satire by Steve Coogan, using a character who appeared on Alan Partridge’s fictitious BBC programmeThis Timesinging rebel songs.
The paper claimed that up to 50 people had signed a petition calling for Martin Brennan, who sang Come Out Ye Black and Tans and the Men Behind the Wire at the close of the show, to run for local elections in Sligo.
Foot-long shortbread – Walker’s Shortbread
Biscuit company Walker’s were also among those to get in on the act.
The company claimed it had produced an “innovative new edition” to its shortbread fingers range: pure butter tallbread, 30cm in length.
The biscuit – three times longer than the original – claimed to ensure that “even the loftiest of biscuit lovers are left satisfied”.

James Comey 2020 – James Comey
The former FBI director hinted in a cryptic Twitter post that he was set to run for the US presidency in 2020.
To be honest, we’re not even sure this one is fake.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-corbyn-4434316-Jan2019/,"UK LABOUR LEADER Jeremy Corbyn has called for general election to be held in order to “break the deadlock” around Brexit.
Corbyn said that Theresa May’s Conservative minority government “cannot command a majority in the House of Commons” and that an election was needed to break the impasse.
May faces a crucial vote next week on her proposed Brexit deal, but is facing an uphill battle to get the deal through parliament, with significant opposition from both within and outside of her party.
May already cancelled a vote on the deal before Christmas, after it became apparent she didn’t have the support to get it through.
The main sticking point for Brexiteers, within her own party and the DUP, is the provision of a Northern Ireland backstop in the deal. This backstop would avoid a hard border in Ireland but also keep the UK in regulatory alignment with the EU.

Without a deal, the UK is set to go crashing out of the EU when the deadline on 29 March is reached.
In a speech, Corbyn said that Labour would move a motion of no confidence in May and the government when they judged “the best chance of their being success when we do that”.
“Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock,” Corbyn said in a speech yesterday.
“This political chaos cannot go on. The only way forward, the only way out of it, would be a general election.
Corbyn said that his party had no confidence in the government and that they “honestly believe the best way forward is a general election”.
Yesterday, it was reported that May was considering making important concessions to the opposition Labour party to try to secure the support of some of its MPs.

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-bercow-deadlock-house-of-commons-4575560-Apr2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons has reached a tie on an amendment to a bill that proposes to hold more indicative votes on Monday.
There was a 10 minute delay before the votes were announced to confirm the tie. The results were then announced, revealing that 310 MPs voted for more indicative votes on Monday, and 310 voted against it.
The House Speaker John Bercow had the deciding vote, and voted against the amendment to the business motion, quoting precedent.
He said that the precedent was in 1993… “and I’ll believe that it was appertaining to the Maastricht Treaty Bill”.

The Maastricht Treaty Bill was the implementation of a treaty on the European Union into British law. Opposition to Maastricht led to the foundation of the Anti-Federalist League which ultimately led to the creation of Ukip.
Alastair Campbell, a Remain-supporter and former spokesperson for Tony Blair, told Sky News that the vote outlined the scale of the divide in the House of Commons.
The Yvette Cooper motion, the main motion of the evening, was then passed immediately after this vote, by a majority of 1. The final tally was 312 to 311. The motion would force the Prime Minister to ask the EU for an extension to stop for a no-deal Brexit.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Cooper said that “I could never have imagined that 9 days out from Brexit day we still don’t know what will happen.”
“We have been warned that food prices would go up by 10% in the event of no-deal,” she said, advising that this should be avoided.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-to-meet-michel-barnier-in-dublin-for-brexit-talks-ahead-of-eu-summit-4581218-Apr2019/,"EUROPEAN UNION CHIEF Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his team will travel to Dublin later today to hold talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
Barnier arrives in Ireland ahead of this Wednesday’s European Council meeting which will decide if the UK will be granted a further extension.
The bloc agreed last month to postpone Brexit day, originally set for 29 March, and set 12 April as the new deadline under certain conditions.
Britain has until Friday to approve the existing withdrawal agreement, to change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or to crash out of the EU without an agreement.
May has asked the remaining EU countries for another postponement that would extend to 30 June, hoping to secure an alternative deal from the opposition negotiations and Parliament in a matter of weeks.
Other European leaders are expected to respond to the delay request during Wednesday’s summit in Brussels.
According to the Department of An Taoiseach, the main purpose of Barnier’s visit is to show solidarity with Ireland, similar to German Chancellor AngelaMerkel’s visitlast Thursday.
Barnier is believed to be interested in the Taoiseach’s views in advance of this week’s European Council meeting.
Varadkar has indicated that he is open to an extension for the UK but it would need to be accompanied by a plan that doesn’t focus on renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement but rather on its future relationships.
At government buildings later today, Barnier will hold talks with Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe to take stock of developments in London as well as looking at the extent of Ireland’s no deal preparations, according to a government spokesperson.
‘We need to get a deal over the line’
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday conceded that concluding a Brexit deal with the main opposition will need “compromise on both sides” as she faced criticism for being inflexible.
The embattled leader opened negotiations this week with the Labour Party in a bid to end months of political crisis over her divorce deal struck with European leaders last year but repeatedly rejected by MPs.
However, after several days of talks, Labour complained May’s team were rigid over her plan, while the talks sparked fury among some Conservatives who detest involving leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn.

“We need to get a deal over the line and that’s why we’ve been looking for new ways to find an agreement in parliament – and that means cross-party talks,” May said in a video recorded at her country retreat Chequers.

On the prospects of reaching a deal, the prime minister added: “It’ll mean compromise on both sides.”
May will head to the EU summit Wednesday seeking to secure another Brexit extension, until June 30.
EU members, who must unanimously back any further delay, are growing increasingly impatient at the dysfunction in Westminster and want a clear plan to resolve it.
Depending on what May proposes, they could offer just a shorter postponement – or a longer period of up to a year.
‘Prepared to move’
Negotiations between May’s government and Labour are set to resume this week after a weekend of exchanges “clarifying our position”, according to shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey.
One of the Labour team in the talks, she told the BBC the lack of compromise so far was “disappointing” but the mood was “quite positive and hopeful”.
“We are currently waiting for the government to come back to us now to state whether they are prepared to move on any of their red lines,” Long Bailey said.
Labour is pushing for a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU, including participation in a customs union.
May has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals around the world.
Andrea Leadsom, a senior Brexiteer in her divided cabinet, said the government was talking to Labour “through gritted teeth”.
She would not confirm if senior Tory eurosceptics would now accept a customs union, and hinted she would back a no-deal departure over a long delay.
“For me, whatever we deliver, it has to be Brexit,” she told the BBC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-of-commons-backstop-4467288-Jan2019/,"LAST NIGHT, A majority of the House of Commons voted in favour of an amendment that proposes replacing the Irish backstop with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.
The Brady amendmentgarnered the support of 317 MPs, with 301 voting against it, in what was the most clear example of what kind of Brexit the UK parliament wants.
After the vote, Theresa May said she would take this mandate back to Brussels and use it as a crowbar to try to reopen the sealed Withdrawal Agreement, which the EU has repeatedly said it would not do.
Reports indicated that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told Theresa May that efforts to reopen the deal would be fruitless; a spokesperson for European Council president Donald Tusk said something similar after the vote.
Two amendments to extend Article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline were rejected last night; the idea of “delaying Brexit”, even to secure an orderly exit and avoid crashing out, is seen by MPs as an unfavourable option and unpopular with Brexit voters.
The EU would also have to approve a request for an extension, it’s not enough for the UK to just want it. It’s been reported that the EU would have to be shown that the UK had a clear idea of why it wanted an extension – to hold a second referendum or to hold another Commons vote, would be two possible options.
Another amendment was also approved last night – this was the Spelman amendment that rules out a no-deal Brexit. This is impossible to do legally without agreement from the House of Commons on what kind of deal it does want.
The amendments passed last night also hold no legal weight – they are a symbol of political will intended to strengthen Theresa May’s hand in directing Brexit.
So what the hell is next?
Theresa May is speaking to the opposition, her own MPs, and will speak to EU leaders about what is possible.
According toReuters, 27 EU ambassadors are due to meet today to discuss Brexit, and May will speak to Donald Tusk by phone this afternoon.

Another debate and vote is expected in the House of Commons on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement; Theresa May told MPs last night that this would happen by 13 February.
If a deal is not passed then, it’s almost certain that we’ll be facing a no-deal Brexit, which the government warned yesterday wouldstunt Ireland’s economy, stifle trade and threaten a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
The backstop in the House of Commons
In today’s edition of Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the backstop wasn’t the only issue in the Withdrawal Agreement that was problematic. This supports the views of some commentators, particularly in Ireland, that the House of Commons would find another problem other than the backstop.
When asked what alternative arrangements there would be to avoid a border, Theresa May answered that technologies would be used, to which Jeremy Corbyn replied:
“What new technologies does she think will emerge in the next 58 days?”
This isn’t the first time technologies have been referenced as a way of maintaining a frictionless border on the island of Ireland. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said in March last year that a“whole load of new technology”could solve the border problem.
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that the free movement of people back and forth across the border could be solved by Oyster-card, or Leap-card like technology.
But during herBelfast speechgiven on20 July last year, the Prime Minister indicated that technology solutions couldn’t work to avoid a hard border:
Speaking on RTE’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that the EU was being asked to forfeit the backstop in favour of wishful thinking.
In a ‘state of the union’ speech given by Coveney at the IIEA this afternoon, he said that the concept of alternative arrangements “is not a new one”.
“…there are currently no alternative arrangements, which anyone has put forward, which achieve what both sides are determined to achieve – to avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, and to protect the all-island economy, North-South cooperation and the Good Friday Agreement.”
“And we need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty, and not just wishful thinking,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-no-hard-border-4441795-Jan2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has been expanding on her earlier comments that there was never a hard border on the island of Ireland during the Troubles.
Speaking at an event in London earlier, Foster reiterated that her party believed there was no need for a backstop provision to form part of the UK’s deal to exit the EU.
“As someone who lived through the Troubles we never had a hard border. There were 20,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland and they couldn’t hermetically seal the border in Northern Ireland so it is a bit of a nonsense, frankly, to talk about a hard border,” Foster said.
BBC Northern Ireland’s political editor Mark Devenport, speaking to her afterwards, put it to the DUP leader that many people would remember having a much harder border during the period of the conflict.
“Yes but it was for completely different reasons,” Foster said.

Both the Taoiseach and UK Prime Minister Theresa May have repeatedly said there can be no return to the borders of the past in the wake of Brexit.
Thebackstop provision, which is included in the Withdrawal Agreement struck between May’s government and the EU, is an insurance policy designed to avoid border infrastructure in Ireland “unless and until” another solution is agreed.

The Troubles
Many routes between the Republic and the North were closed at the height of the Troubles, with smaller roads either blocked, spiked or blown up by the British Army. Full-scale military checkpoints were erected on many of the main routes that remained.
Routes along the length of the border began reopening from the 1990s – with the last few roads and bridges being repaired and reopened around a decade ago. 275 land border crossings now exist between the North and the Republic – more than along the whole of EU’s eastern border.
The debate around how to define a hard border was discussed recently by the UK Parliament’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which observed:

THE UK GOVERNMENT has announced that there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
A statementreleased this morningsaid the “unique social, political and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland must be reflected in any arrangements that apply in a no deal scenario”.
“This government is committed to the Belfast Agreement and to do everything in our power to ensure no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
“Today we are confirming a strictly unilateral, temporary approach to checks, processes and tariffs in Northern Ireland. This would apply if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March.
“The UK government would not introduce any new checks or controls on goods at the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, including no customs requirements for nearly all goods.
“The UK temporary import tariff announced today would therefore not apply to goods crossing from Ireland into Northern Ireland.
The measures, the statement said, “do not set out the position in respect of tariffs or processes to be applied to goods moving from Northern Ireland to Ireland”.
In order to protect biosecurity on the island of Ireland, the statement said, border inspection posts would be needed to inspect animals and animal products from countries outside the EU entering the North.

Tariffs for the rest of the UK
While there will be no tariffs imposed by the UK on goods moving across the land border into Northern Ireland, tariffs will also not be applied to around 87% – up from 80% at present – of imports in a no-deal Brexit to the rest of the UK under a temporary scheme.
The tariffs on various goods where they will be applied are presented by the UK government as a percentage of the “most favoured nation” (MFN) – this is the tariff imposed by the EU on imports from countries that they do not have a free trade agreement with.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will become one of these countries. Currently, no tariffs are paid on the import of goods from Ireland into mainland UK, for example, but that would change in a no-deal.
Tariffs will apply to goods such as beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products. This will help to “support farmers and producers who have historically been protected through high EU tariffs”,the Guardian reported.
In the case of beef, for example, the tariff imposed will be 53% of this MFN. The tariff applied to butter will be 32% of the EU MFN, poultry meat will be 60% and lamb will be the full existing EU MFN tariff rate.
Other products that will remain subject to tariffs are finished vehicles, certain ceramics, fertilisers and fuel, and bananas, raw cane sugar and certain kinds of fish.
“If we leave without a deal, we will set the majority of our import tariffs to zero, whilst maintaining tariffs for the most sensitive industries,” UK Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said.
Irish Farmers’ Association president Joe Healy said that the beef industry, in particular, “will not survive the kind of tariffs being talked about”, given how much is exported from Ireland to mainland UK.
“We export over 50% of our beef to the UK.  If this is subject to tariffs, it will be a ‘direct hit’ of almost €800m on the sector,” he said.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee agreed a no-deal would be disastrous for Irish farmers.

She said that it was up to the UK now to ensure that it had solutions in place to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
“We have always said we would need to have very difficult conversations,” she said. “We need to have those now. We need to avoid getting to the point where there would be any imposition of tariffs.
No deal vote
The announcement comes as MPs prepare to vote later today on whether the country should leave the EU without a deal in just over two weeks. The House of Commons overwhelmingly rejecting a draft divorce agreement last night.
Last night’s votecame in the wakeof last-minute measures announced on Monday night by British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Speaking immediately after the vote, May told MPs that the government would now hold a debate and vote today on whether the UK should leave without a deal.
If a no-deal option is voted down tonight, the government is planning another Commons vote tomorrow on whether or not they want an extension to Article 50. That will only happen in the event that today’s vote shows support for a deal.
However, May last night warned that “voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face”.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said it is a “matter of great personal regret” that the UK will not leave the EU on time with a deal, with a deal and that it is “high time” for MPs to make a decision.
May was speaking at Downing Street this evening after earlier writing to European Council President Donald Tusk seeking a brief delay to Brexit, tellingthe House of Commonsshe had asked him for an extension until 30 June.
“Two years on, MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, we will not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me,” May said in her statement.
May said she is on the “side” of the public now which wants the parliament to get on with Brexit and stop the in-fighting. She said “it is now time for MPs to decide”.
“It is high time we made a decision. So far parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,” she said.
May said she will continue to work “night and day” to get MPs (including the DUP) to vote for her deal so the UK can leave the EU by 30 June.
“I am not prepared to delay Brexit later than the 30 June,” she said.

The Prime Minister also touched on the question of holding a second Brexit referendum, outlining that the UK government “asked you the question and you gave us the answer”.
Possible short extension
Responding to May’s earlier letter, Tusk said he believes that a short extension to Article 50 would be possible, but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the House of Commons.
“In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days, I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons,” Tusk told reporters this afternoon.
His comments come ahead of a summit of EU leaders getting under way in Brussels tomorrow.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meanwhile said it was time to cut the UK “some slack” on the extension time as there was now a real risk of a no-deal happening by accident.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Varadkar addressed the issue of the extension, stating that the Irish government has always been open to an extension, “if there is a purpose to it”.
“I don’t have a definitive view on how long an extension would be… [but we] would prefer to see this resolved sooner rather than later,” he added.
He told the media that it is his understanding that May is due to speak to address the British public tonight, adding that this will be an “opportunity for her to set out her plan and timeline as to how an extension would work”. Varadkar said it is important that “we hear from her”.
The European Commission, meanwhile, had advised EU leaders that a shorter delay until 23 May (the date of the European elections) or a much longer one until at least the end of 2019 would be preferable.
In his comments at 4pm, Tusk sounded more positive about the 30 June date saying it “has its merits” but creates “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”.
He said that he wouldn’t hesitate to call an emergency EU summit next week if the meaningful vote did not pass.

Ahead of his statement, Tusk said he had just come off a phonecall with the prime minister.
He was also speaking by phone to Leo Varadkar today, and in Dublin the Taoiseach told reporters at Government Buildings that the proposed length of the extension would be discussed in detail at tomorrow’s summit.
Leaders wanted to hear May’s plan, he said. “We understand it’s not as simple as just securing ratification of the withdrawal agreement by parliament, she’ll also have to put enabling legislation through the Commons and the Lords.”
Varadkar said the “only red line that I’ve ever set down is that Brexit should not lead to a return of a hard border”. The Taoiseach added that he still believes a no-deal Brexit is unlikely.
“There is a risk of no-deal happening by accident and that would be a real tragedy,” said the Taoiseach.
It had been expected May could hold a third vote on the twice-rejected deal this week ahead of tomorrow’s summit, but a series of events – not leastan unexpected interventionby the speaker of the House of Commons – scuppered that plan.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-judgement-day-4536136-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Mar 2019
THE HOUSE OF Commons will be the stage today as British MPs will vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, a day after she secured new assurances from the EU that may give her a chance of getting her deal passed.
It remains to be seen whether the new guarantees will be enough to sway Brexiteers within her own party and the DUP to back her Brexit deal.
Leo Varadkar had been due to travel to Washington, but remained in Dublin this morning.
The Taoiseach said that the new arrangements made do not change the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop, and the “doubts and fears” raised by Brexiteers can be put to bed.
He told reporters: “I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons.”
Varadkar added that what has been agreed “reiterates our wish to have as close as possible a future relationship with the UK”.
Chief among the guarantees is on the Irish backstop – the solution that would keep Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU trade rules and thus negate the need for a hard border in Ireland.
The new guarantees say that every effort will be made to ensure the Irish backstop never needs to be enacted and measures through which any attempt to make the backstop apply indefinitely can be legally challenged.
Speaking last night at a joint press conference, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that the existing withdrawal agreement had not changed, but the guarantees given to the UK “complements the withdrawal agreement without reopening it”.
“In politics sometimes you get a second chance, it is what we do with this second chance that counts because there will be no third chance,” Juncker said. “There will be no further interpretation of the interpretation. No further assurances on the reassurances if the meaningful vote fails [today].”
May, however, claimed that “legally binding changes” to the withdrawal agreement had been secured.
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” May said.

Meanwhile, there is uncertainty whether this will change the legal advice given to the UK government by its attorney general Geoffrey Cox.
Channel 4 news anchor Jon Snow said a source had told him the legal world is aware that the attorney general said “no” to the validity of May’s new EU deal, and has been told to find a way to say yes to it.
This was met with a bizarre tweet in reply by Cox himself, who said simply “bollocks”.

Labour has announced it will vote against the deal, and said the prime minister had “failed”.
“This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament,” said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Brexit hardliners from May’s Conservative Party and the DUP have said they will scrutinise the documents that have been agreed.
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said this morning that he believes the new arrangements appear to “fall short” of what May has promised, but added that his party would reserve judgement until they heard the Attorney General’s advice.
It will take a major turnaround for May to get this deal through parliament, after it lost by a majority of 230 votes in January.
The vote is due to take place at around 7pm this evening.
Another defeat would set the stage for additional votes in parliament this week that could postpone Brexit and possibly reverse it in the months to come.
If she loses the vote, May has promised to give MPs a vote tomorrow on whether Britain should simply leave without any deal at all.
If MPs would defeat the “no-deal” scenario, it would be followed on Thursday with a vote on requesting a delay from the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-new-brexit-deal-4645547-May2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 May 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa Mayhas revealedthe details of her new Brexit plan, calling it a “significant” and “serious” offer – but some MPs aren’t happy.
As part of her new Brexit strategy, May said that although she didn’t think there should be a second referendum, that MPs will get a vote on whether the Brexit deal should beput to the people in a vote.
The statement was given this afternoon, following the collapse of talks with the Labour party on Friday. For weeks, May’s Cabinet and Labour have tried to find a Brexit both sides want in order to get some type of Brexit deal through the UK parliament.
The current draft Brexit deal, negotiated between Theresa May’s officials and the EU, has been rejected by MPs three times in three months. Rebel Tories have voiced opposition to the Northern Ireland backstop, which would leave the region under some EU rules in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
What was promised
May said that although it was “not possible to replace backstop in Withdrawal Agreement”, she said the government would be placed under“a legal obligation to seek to conclude alternative arrangements”to the Irish border issue by December 2020.
She said that she had also listened to unionist concerns about the backstop, and said that should backstop come into force, the British government“will ensure that Great Britain will stay aligned with Northern Ireland”.
The Stormont Assembly would also have to get cross-community agreement “for new regulations which are added to the backstop”.
May said that these were “significant further changes to protect integrity of the UK”, and was a “bespoke solution that answers all parts of community in Northern Ireland”.
Those are two of ten points in May’s Brexit plan: the rest include seeking“as close to frictionless trade in goods with the EU as possible while outside the single market and ending free movement”.
There would also be a“custom compromise”from the Government for MPs to decide on to break the deadlock, and a vote for MPs on whether the deal should be subject to areferendum.

May also promised toenshrine workers’ rightsin a new bill that would retain the rights on par with EU rules, and also saida new independent environment watchdogwould be set up.
The Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be published in the next few days, she added.
Reaction
This is expected to be May’s final attempt to break the Brexit impasse before she has to set out a timeline for her departure and make way for a new Tory leader.
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has already said he would go for the leadership. Earlier today, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would not be putting his name forward, but would back Johnson in a leadership contest.
In response to May’s offer today,Rees-Mogg saida no-deal Brexit was his preferred option:
“The Prime Minister’s latest proposals are worse than before and would leave us bound deeply in to the EU. It is time to leave on WTO terms.”
Johnson has this evening tweeted that he would not support the new version of the deal, having voted for it the last time it was put to parliament.
“The Bill is directly against our manifesto – and I will not vote for it. We can and must do better – and deliver what the people voted for,” he said, rejecting the idea of any customs union or second referendum.
With great reluctance I backed MV3. Now we are being asked to vote for a customs union and a second referendum. The Bill is directly against our manifesto - and I will not vote for it.

Echoing these comments, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed May’s latest plan.
“I listened carefully to the PM’s speech on the govt’s revised terms of Brexit,” Raab tweeted.
“I cannot support legislation that would be the vehicle for a second referendum or Customs Unions. Either option would frustrate rather than deliver Brexit – and make out clear manifesto promises,” he said.

A number of other MPs are similarly unimpressed:

The DUP has also expressed dissatisfaction with the proposals.
“We will examine the legislation closely when the bill is finally published but the fundamental flaws of the draft Withdrawal Agreement treaty itself remain unchanged,” DUP parliamentary leader Nigel Dodds said.
Other key quotes from May
Although she dodged questions about her leadership and when she would depart, May revealed how difficult the process has been:
She said that transferring the simplicity of ballot paper to complexity of relationship of 27 nations was “harder than anticipated”.
She said that she’s tried to compromise, “sought changes MPs demanded, offered to leave the job I love earlier than I would have liked”, but still hasn’t managed to deliver Brexit.
“If just 30 MPs had voted differently we would be leaving the EU,” she said, referring to the last vote, where her Brexit deal was defeated by 58 votes.
May said today:

SINN FÉÍN HAS withdrawn its request for a full recount of ballot papers in the European election constituency of Ireland South.
The party had called for the recount last week after a partial vote re-check left Green Party Senator Grace O’Sullivan just326 votes aheadof outgoing MEP Liadh Ní Riada.
Some 756,000 ballot papers were expected to be recounted, before the party withdrew its request this evening.
The process was expected to determine who would take the fifth and final seat in the 12-county constituency: the ‘Brexit’ seat will become active once the UK leaves the European Union.

Fine Gael’s Seán Kelly and Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher reached the quota in the original count.
Independents4Change TD Mick Wallace looks set to take the third seat, and Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune as well as O’Sullivan and Ní Riada had been vying for the fourth and fifth seats.
Ní Riada has now released a statement congratulating O’Sullivan on her election to Europe.
“I am happy that the democratic process has delivered the clarity we sought given that the initial difference was so tight,” Ní Riada said.
“I want to sincerely thank Returning Officer Martin A Harvey and his terrific staff for their diligence and hard work.
“We ran a hard fought campaign and we left everything on the pitch. Unfortunately, we came up short this time around. I want to express my undying gratitude to my office staff, my campaign team and every member of Sinn Féin and those who voted for me.

“I am incredibly proud of my term as an MEP. I always did my very best to deliver for constituents and to defend Ireland’s interests in the European Parliament. Over the past five years, Sinn Féin’s team of MEPs have stood up for equality, social justice and democracy. I am honoured that I was part of those efforts.
“For now, let me wish those elected for the coming term of the European Parliament all the very best for the work ahead.”
It was initially stated that the recount could take up to 28 days, and cost up to €1 million, but additional staff had been recruited to speed up the process.
The withdrawal of the recount request by Sinn Féin means that the count to determine the final seat will resume tomorrow, when Ní Ríada’s votes will be distributed to the remaining candidates.

https://www.thejournal.ie/share-schemes-brexit-3-4434326-Jan2019/,"
MAJOR COMPANIES LIKE Halfords and B&Q are sounding the Brexit alarm over the future of save-as-you-earn (SAYE) share options schemes for “modest earners”.
SAYE schemes allow an employee to save money to buy shares in the company they work for at a discounted rate at a later date. Such shares could yield a future gain that would be subject to capital gains tax.
In a letter to the Department of Finance – signed by Halfords, Sage, fashion retailer Next and Kingfisher, the retail group behind B&Q, and a number of others – the firms warn that their SAYE schemes, which are administered through Yorkshire Building Society, could cease if passporting rules are lost after Brexit.
In such an event, employees’ funds would be returned to them and the option to buy shares is gone.
Gill Brennan, chief executive of the Irish ProShare Association, which has been involved in the lobbying efforts, said the change would impact “modest earners”.
She explained that the scheme is used by ordinary earners looking to save and invest in shares for a potential profit.
“We’re not talking about people on six-figure sums here,” Brennan said. “We’re talking about people who are earning the average industrial wage, who are trying to put some money away.”
Yorkshire Building Society is one of three institutions administering SAYE schemes in Ireland, along with Barclays and Ulster Bank.
Gill BrennanIPSAIPSA
Without a remedy, Brennan said, Ulster Bank would be the only bank left carrying out the scheme, which could be “wiped out”.
She added that the Exchequer would be affected as shares that would be subject to capital gains tax are never exercised.
“It’s a loss for employers because they won’t be able to offer one of their key benefits in retention tools. It’s a loss all round because a decision was made in Westminster,” she said.

“There’s unfairness around it. It’s a decision made in another jurisdiction that affects ordinary Irish workers without them even knowing.”
Remedies
Brennan and representatives from Yorkshire Building Society and Barclays Bank met with Minister of State, with responsibility for financial services, Michael D’Arcy in the first week of December last year.
Brennan said one option is to introduce some legislation that would “allow Yorkshire Building Society and Barclays to continue passporting out of the UK and into Ireland for this specific reason”.
That throws up its own challenges, as from Europe’s vantage point, it could be construed as state aid, she said.
Brennan added that she is not sure what would need to happen on the UK side of things, pertaining to legislation, to make such a deal happen.
Another potential remedy is allowing accounts to be transferred from one institution to another in a way that is seamless for the employee.
A spokesperson for Revenue toldForathat it “will need to await the final outcome of negotiations between the EU and the UK to determine the implications, if any, for certified contractual savings schemes, post Brexit”.
Brennan said she would like to see banks like AIB and Bank of Ireland offer SAYE administration.
“It’s interesting to note that the Irish banks, particularly those owned by the taxpayer, AIB and Bank of Ireland in particular, are not offering this service,” she said.
A spokesperson for AIB could not comment on whether the bank is considering these services. Bank of Ireland did not return requests for comment in time for publication.
“Banks and morality don’t go very well in the same sentence but I do feel there is a moral obligation upon the banks to do something around this,” Brennan added.

THE DUP’S JEFFREY Donaldson has said he would like to see Ireland back in the Commonwealth.
Addressing an audience at the Fine Gael National Conference today, there was a large applause when he said:
“I do hope we can come to a day when the Republic will join with many other (nationals) in the commonwealth recognising that we have overcome a lot of adversity and it would be good.”
He added that the Commonwealth is a place where “Ireland’s voice should be heard and I would like to see that happen”.
However, when asked about whether it is a possibility, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said it was not on his agenda, and effectively ruled it out.
When asked if it was on the table, he said: “I don’t think so.”
Coveney explained away the applause from the audience stating that people were merely wanting to show Donaldson “some warmth”, stating that people understand that was a “big deal” for the DUP MP to attend today.
He said some within the Fine Gael party have been making a case for Ireland to join the Commonwealth, name-checking Senator Frank Feign.
“I think there is some support within the party to looking anew at the Commonwealth, but probably not a majority support at this stage. Like many things in Fine Gael, we have an open mind,” he said.
Earlier in the day, when asked about Brexit, Donaldson said he does not expect his view on the draft Brexit deal to change.
“I’m not here to change anyone’s view and don’t expect my view to change either.
During his address to the Fine Gael National Conference, he said:
“I would say to my friends in Fine Gael, let’s try to work this out.”

He acknowledged there is a difference of opinions, stating: “We are on different sides on Brexit, that’s for sure”.
Backstop concerns
Donaldson said there is a need address concerns around the backstop in order to move forward.
Earlier in the day, when answering reporter’s impromptu questions, he said:
Donaldson said the DUP’s message today is “yes, we are facing challenges” such as Brexit, but in the end “the most important thing is building human relationships”.
“We need to do better,” he said, referring to building and sustaining relationships on the island of Ireland.
The DUP MP spoke about Ireland’s “shared history”, stating “we face some challenges… in dealing with Brexit in a way that avoids calamity, but in the end we will always face challenges, what is important is the human relationships and about building those relationships .. and that is what we need to do better”.
“There are many who see Brexit as getting in the way of that when we could look back at many points in our history and see similar moments. It is how we respond to these challenges that determines how we go forward.
“We have our concerns in particular about the withdrawal agreement, the backstop and we are trying to work our way through that and get an agreement with the UK government to move forward, that assures everyone. That is really important because moving forward on the basis that you haven’t got the broadest consensus possible often means you often don’t move as far as you would like to move. I would say to my friends in Fine Gael lets try to work this out.”

There were tense talks between Donaldson and Coveney in the lobby of the hotel this afternoon, though there is no doubt the politicians knew their discussions being held in such a public space would draw attention, which it did.
There had been rumours that the DUP had been softening its stance towards May’s twice-rejected Withdrawal Agreement and could be preparing to vote for it next week for the third Meaningful Vote.
Yesterday, Deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds criticised the UK government, and called the delay to the date by which the UK leaves the European Union “a humiliation”.
On Thursday, it was agreed that the date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if British Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was passed; if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
The DUP, whose 10 MPs are supporting May’s government, said she had missed an opportunity to put forward new proposals to change the Withdrawal Agreement.

More recently, France held itsfirst ever survivalist expo in Paris. Organisers said they were responding to demand in a country where a string of terror attacks had led to a growing lack of faith in the state’s ability to keep people safe.

Here in Ireland, those with an interest in survivalism say they’ve had no particular upsurge in interest in the years since the Brexit vote.
Last spring’s extreme cold weather focused some minds, however. And, further back, Frank Deegan ofthe Irish Survivalist Groupsays there was a huge spike in interest in the movement in the wake of the economic crash of 2008.
Said Deegan:
The prevailing sense of crisis following the economic crash may have inspired people to consider getting back to basics. Across society, Deegan said, people who were laid off or had hours cut also found themselves with more free time then they knew what to do with.
But social media sites like Facebook, than in its infancy, also helped people with an interest in survival skills and equipment find each other. The Irish Survivalist Group, which Deegan co-founded, now has more than 2,000 members on Facebook.
So what does it mean to be a survivalist in Ireland?
As Deegan explained, in addition to working personally on their own skills his group’s members arrange regular meetups of up to 30 or 40 people, heading out to the wilderness with no tents or equipment “to get to know each other and talk about various aspects of survival”.
Many survivalists here make a clear distinction between themselves and people who would primarily consider themselves ‘preppers’.
As Shayne Phelan of the Wicklow-basedEagle Ridge Survivalput it:
“A prepper is maybe somebody who has no survival skills, who has no bushcraft skills but has gathered an awful lot of food or water or whatever they deem necessary should a day come…
The prepping movement, which has its roots in the US, gathered momentum stateside in the wake of natural and financial disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the global financial crisis.
The rise ofdoomsday preppers– US families who take the lifestyle to the extreme by turning their homes into mini-fortresses full of food, fuel, generators and military grade survival equipment – may have imbued the term with some negative connotations on this side of the Atlantic.

But, as Deegan put it, there’s a wide variety of people in Ireland interested in survivalist activities. Many Irish preppers also take an interest in building up their outdoor skills.
“There is a fair few guys who are preppers and they would have storage of food, water, diesel and petrol. There’s a few of the guys went all out into the prepper part of it.
Sven Ridgway, who runsthe Irish Prepper and Bushcraft Storein Macroom, opened his shop after noticing an increase in interest in the area around five years ago.
“I’d have a good range of wood-preparing equipment, as in tomahawks and axes and knives – knives are often used for batoning wood,” to prepare a fire, he explained.
The shop also stocks a range of ex-military gear – clothing and backpacks – alongside items like portable cookers, lamps and other camping equipment.
In addition to more casual customers dropping by for a new backpack or water bottle, there’s “a lot more” interest in prepping in recent years too, Ridgway said.
“As I watch there’s more and more Facebook pages cropping up and Youtube channels cropping up and people talking about all sorts of scenarios.

Explaining some of the terminology of the survivalist world, Ridgway outlined how he could advise customers on how to stock an appropriate ‘bug-out bag’ or ‘get home bag’ – a rucksack packed with essentials needed to get by in the wild, or to hike home in the event of a major emergency or weather event.
“So a good knife, a multi-tool … maybe a little crowbar, enough food for three or four days … you can buy meals ready to eat, like the MREs, so all that type of thing.
“I would advise people on what they needed for a bug-out bag or a get home bag all the way up to a ‘Shit’s Hit the Fan’ bag and what’s known as the ‘End of the World as We Know It’ bag – a full size backpack where you would carry your life with you almost.”
It goes without saying that not all of the shop’s customers would be preparing themselves or their households for an expected world-ending catastrophe.
On a more mundane level, he said he sold his entire stock of old-style paraffin lamps last spring during the prolonged cold weather of the Beast from the East and Storm Emma.
The extreme weather of last March, say the survivalists, may have made people realise just how fragile their comfortable lifestyles were.
“A lot of people say we’re really only nine meals removed from total anarchy,” said Phelan,who runs courses on bushcraft and survivalfrom his base near Roundwood.

Deegan, who lives in South Kilkenny, said neighbours in his area sought him out for advice during the freezing weather in the aftermath of Storm Emma.
And while he insists there’s been no particular increase in concern among his group’s members amid the continuing barrage of shrill Brexit headlines, he says there’s one simple step anyone can take to prepare their household in the event of a sudden shortage of supplies in the shops or another weather crisis.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bob-geldof-brexit-4440114-Jan2019/,"ROCK STAR AND charity campaigner Bob Geldof today has described Brexit as a “misguided” and “dangerous” example of English nationalism.
Dublin-born Geldof has made London his home since the 1980s andfrequently gives his opinion on political mattersin the UK.
Speaking as he accepted an honorary doctorate in Limerick today, Geldof said he is “passionately against” Brexit.
He added that the current government in the UK is the “worst” he has seen, “bar none”.
“It throws everything up in the air between the two islands,” Geldof said.
“I don’t think the English recognise this in themselves – There is a big anarchic streak that runs down the spine of being English – whether it’s Francis Drake, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher.”
Geldof also told reporters he recently “had a row” with  “an extremely senior government politician” over Brexit.

“(The politician) said, ‘I thought you’d show more loyalty to your adopted country’, and I had to stand back from this (and think) – do I have to smack him or what, you know?”
“And I said, but you don’t understand – what I’m doing is fighting with everything I have for my adopted country, and he was trembling with rage and went off.”
Geldof said the current Brexit deal is “a properly serious mistake” and “an expression of English nationalism”.
“I can’t stand nationalism. In Ireland, we know where it leads to,” he added.

Irish horse racing trainer Ted Walsh has also shared his views on Brexit this evening, saying that Irish people will end up paying for the UK’s decision.
“It’s the English again, and there’ll be fellas saying ‘those so-and-sos look where they have us again’, they have us on their bended knees once again, and that’s going to cause more aggravation,” Walsh said.
“They’ve been a good nation but they’ve invariably been able to kick us up the rear end whenever they’ve wanted to.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-end-of-may-uk-front-pages-react-to-brexit-latest-4564428-Mar2019/,"MPS VOTED AGAINST eight motions in the House of Commons yesterday evening in an attempt to indicate a majority for what type of Brexit they want and break the deadlock.
Among the suggestions rejected were leaving the EU without a deal, and revoking Article 50 to avoid a no deal.
Speaking after the vote, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons that the failure to garner majority support from MPs for any motion strengthened the view that it was “necessary to back the Withdrawal Agreement” struck between the EU and Prime Minister Theresa May.
Meanwhile, May has pledged to step down as PM for the next round of Brexit negotiations. So, let’s see what spin the UK’s newspapers have put on the latest developments.
The Times has a sombre looking May leaving Parliament last night.

The Daily Mirror has opted for “The End of May”, referencing the PM’s likely departure date.

Meanwhile, the Metro also shows May leaving Parliament following last night’s vote and runs with the headline: “Vote Brexit and I’ll Exit”.

The Financial Times runs with: “May offers to resign in final plea for rebels’ backing on Brexit deal.

The Daily Express asks “What more does she have to do?”

On May’s offer to resign in a last-ditch attempt to get her Brexit deal approved, the Daily Mail asks: “Will her sacrifice be in vain?”

And finally, “Parliament finally has its say” the Guardian says, referencing last night’s rejection of all eight amendments.
“No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-business-fears-4538704-Mar2019/,"TENS OF THOUSANDS of Irish businesses have been told they haven’t registered to move goods to and from the UK after Brexit, with uncertainty continuing on what the landscape will look like once our closest neighbour eventually leaves the EU.
Although we now know it’s more likely that the UKwon’tbe leaving the EU as originally set out on 29 March, this persistent uncertainty has forced many companies to trigger expensive contingency plans, business groups say.
The no-deal tariff planspublished by the British government was just the latest in a string of announcements that caused alarm in Ireland earlier this week, but Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in Washington that a package of measures to support Irish businesses will be approved by Cabinet next week.
The Taoiseach told businesses that the government “has your back on Brexit” but firms have also been warned to step up their preparations with Brexit remaining a major threat for many.
EORI
An Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) is something that businesses must register for if wish to move goods to, from or through a non-EU country.
When the UK leaves the EU, businesses will need an EORI to move goods to, from or through the UK. As of the beginning of this month, however, over 60,000 businesses who may need one hadn’t got an EORI.
If the UK was to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March – which was ruled out by MPs earlier this week – it would have meant uncertainty for businesses that don’t have an EORI.
It is clear from the statistics that businesses were becoming increasingly aware of the need to step up their Brexit plans since the start of this year.
In the whole of 2018, there were 2,976 registrations for an EORI. In January and February 2019, there 2,617.
Last month, Revenue advised that there were around 100 applications per day, with applications in February up 330% on January.

And, since January, Revenue has written to around 84,000 businesses – who from its records show they recently had at least some level of trade with the UK – and encouraged them to do a Brexit impact assessment for their business.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, in responding to a parliamentary question, also released a breakdown of the amount of businesses which don’t have an EORI written to by Revenue by county.
Dublin had by far the most with over 14,000 businesses. Next was Cork with 6,183. Donegal and Galway had over 3,000 businesses contacted by Revenue.
Only Carlow, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly and Roscommon had less than 1,000 businesses without an EORI.


‘Worrying’
The Irish Small-Medium-sized Enterprise Association (Isme) has said it is “worried at the low uptake of EORI numbers”, adding that they are “very east to get”.
“There’s also low take-up of the start-to-plan vouchers, which we understand from InterTrade Ireland is in the high hundreds only,” a spokesperson said.
In a survey carried out by Isme of its members for the first quarter of this year, 68% of firms said they had not yet completed a Brexit readiness plan.
Meanwhile, customs arrangements are the biggest cause of concern for SMEs, with over 60% saying it was a major worry when the UK leaves the EU.
Business group Ibec, meanwhile, has said that no matter what Brexit scenario Ireland is ultimately faced with, it is important to have the appropriate preparations in place.
Arnold Dillon, Ibec Head of Strategic Campaigns, toldTheJournal.ie: “Brexit uncertainty has now forced many companies to trigger expensive contingency plans. Taking a ‘no deal’ cliff edge off the table is the priority, but business also needs clarity on how a ‘no deal’ outcome would be managed on the ground, from day one.
Related ReadsSky News poll shows Brexit has damaged UK's reputation for majority of Irish people
Dillon added that it was urgent that the Irish government make provisions to introduce State aid measures for businesses most impacted by Brexit.
“A ‘no deal’ Brexit would present an unprecedented economic challenge that would demand immediate state aid intervention to save businesses and protect jobs in certain sectors and business that are particularly exposed,” he said.
Leo Varadkar’s government has already signalled it would aim to secure EU backing to support businesses at risk financially.
In January, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys met with European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
“The focus of our meeting centred on the severe challenges Irish businesses, especially SMEs, would face when the United Kingdom left the European Union,” she said. “The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stood ready to act urgently to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish firms.”
The European Commission has already given State aid approval for national investment in Irish cheese producers the Carbery Group to the tune of €65 million.
“This test case demonstrates what we want to do for the food sector,” Humphreys said.
Speaking yesterday in London, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said Ireland will wish to avoid a series of “rolling cliff edges” if the UK requests a delay
“I believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges… particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability, we need to be aware of that,” he said.
Uncertainty may remain, but Irish businesses now have some time to put the necessary provisions in place while the government takes its own steps to offer support until the UK finally leaves the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/clones-monaghan-brexit-border-4482206-Feb2019/,"THE PEOPLE OF Clones never imagined they’d end up learning so much about the inner workings of the Brexiteer wing of the Tory party. Or that they’d have to keep quite so up to date with the machinations of Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and their supporters.
Alongside the weather and the exchange rate, views on the latest Westminster dramas are now go-to conversation openers in the Co Monaghan town of around 1,700 people, nestled around a kilometre from the border with Fermanagh and with multiple cross-border and cross-community links.
Local businesses were given a “shocking eye-opener” at a large-scale meeting with a Revenue representative in recent weeks, veteran Sinn Féin councillor Pat Treanor said, chatting over a cup of tea in the centre of the town.
The local Enterprise Office and other agencies have also been attempting to prepare businesses for whatever transition takes place – either on 29 March or at some yet-to-be-decided point in the future.
A local trader said the community felt it was stuck in ‘Groundhog Day’ as political leaders – apparently jammed in a messaging loop – continued a seemingly never-ending cycle of summit meetings and parliamentary votes.
Another man working in the town, asked to describe the mood, reckoned there was “a heightened sense of what the f***”.
There are eight roads in and out of the Co Monaghan town of Clones – five of which run into Fermanagh.Daragh Brophy / TheJournal.ieDaragh Brophy / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
The Revenue service said last month it was not planning for customs posts along the border. It is, however,preparing for a massive increasein import and export declaration forms – in the region of 20 million, compared to last year’s figure of around 1.7 million.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, the relationship between towns on either side of the border would shift from free trade and shared customs rules to the most basic international rules, with trade taking place underWTO tariffs.
And in spite of politicians insisting there will be no reimposition of a border between the two jurisdictions many locals who spoke toTheJournal.iethis week said that if the talks ended without a deal, border checks would be inevitable.
“I’d go back across the border 50 or 60 times a day just doing ordinary business,” said Liam Strain, a busy local vet.

Strain’s business has already been hit with increased costs. Like many veterinary practices in the area, he’s had to open a second premises on the far side of the border to prepare for separate regulatory regimes post-Brexit.
Vets have also been sent information on vaccinations and animal transport, and what to do in the event that the UK effectively becomes a ‘third country’. Aside from setting up additional premises, however, Strain said it’s hard to know how else to prepare.
Professional concerns aside, Strain said people in the area remained hugely concerned about possible disruptions to daily life.
“People that are not from the border think that you cross the border to go on your holidays – but it’s just day to day living, going across the border. It’s going to be an impediment if there’s going to be stoppages. If there’s going to be any difference in the price of a product north or south, where it can be smuggled, that will eventually end up in some class of a checkpoint.”
Eamon Fitzpatrick, who spoke alongside Strain in the yard of his fuel and hardware business on the outskirts of the town, said there were widespread concerns border posts could lead to heightened tensions.
“For all that has been gained in the last 20 or 30 years it’s going to be lost again.

Said Strain: “The Troubles and that whole thing to the generation below us is like us whenever we were younger talking about the Second World War – because they just don’t understand it.
“It reminds me of asking my father what it was like during the Second World War.” He added: “That’s great.”
At the height of the Troubles, just one of the five roads into Fermanagh from Clones remained open. Any traffic wishing to pass had to go through a full military checkpoint – often resulting in long delays.
This former ‘Concession Road’ is now dotted with businesses every few miles. Countless botharíns run off it to either side – but at the height of the IRA’s campaign in the 1970s and 80s these routes were spiked, blocked with concrete blocks or blown up by the British Army.
Routes along the length of the border began reopening from the 1990s – with the last few roads and bridges being repaired and reopened just over a decade ago. 275 official land border crossings now exist between the North and the Republic – more than along the whole of EU’s eastern border.
Fitzpatrick’s own yard would straddle the EU-UK border after Brexit. WhenTheJournal.ielast visited the area around18 months ago– and still over a year after the 2016 referendum – he said the continuing uncertainty was the main problem.
Related ReadsCommissioner says there's no plan to move 600 gardaí to border - but what WILL happen?'It's impossible to completely predict what might be in short supply and what might be in ridiculous oversupply'
Not much has changed in the last year-and-a-half, he said. Strain agreed. The perpetual uncertainty was having a chilling effect on business in the area, he reckoned – citing one business he knew of that had been planning a major investment in the area but decided to put plans on hold due to Brexit fears.
Both said they’d heard of major international retail brands that had decided against investing in sites in the town as the negotiations lumbered on.
As the possibility of a no-deal exit increased in recent weeks, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoewarned thata disorderly Brexit would be an “unprecedented event in recent economic history” with exporters and food producers being hit heaviest by tariffs at first, and a sharp decrease in job creation.
Monaghan and neighbouring Cavan have the highest level of exposure in the case of any scenario where the UK leaves both the common market and the customs union,business group Ibec has warned.
Eamon McCaughey, whose family run the Matthews newsagent and store in Clones, said he was concerned about the impact on employment in the area. Echoing the views of all the locals we encountered he said “the fear of the unknown” was consuming the area.
“Our town here, we’ve come through so much. You go back to the 1950s, the railway closed and that was a big blow to the town. After that then there was emigration.
“Then what really, really set the town off was the Troubles. We didn’t know our neighbours. You couldn’t travel from one side to the other… There was mistrust.
Many locals spoke of concerns that border posts could lead to an increased threat from dissidents along the border – something former PSNI chief Hugh Orde alluded to last week, when he said that any officials posted to the area “by definition [...] would become a target”.

Pat Treanor, the Sinn Féin councillor, said he hoped cross-community relationships had developed to a degree that made a return to violence unthinkable.
“When people talk about going back to the past … nobody wants that,” Treanor said, as we spoke at a drop-in and support centre for former republican prisoners in the centre of the town.
“Most of the people I would talk to, the hope would be that politics has developed far enough that we can resolve this through political dialogue, negotiations, peaceful protests … all of that type of stuff.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hammond-brexit-compromise-4580014-Apr2019/,"
THE UK CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has said the government had “no red lines” in talks with the main opposition party to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit.
“Our approach to these discussions with Labour is that we have no red lines,” he told reporters at a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest.
“We are expecting to exchange more texts with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process and I expect we will reach some form of agreement,” Hammond added.
Senior ministers are negotiating with Labour leaders in a bid to find a compromise to end months of political crisis and allow Britain to leave the European Union smoothly after 46 years of membership.
But after three days of discussions, Labour said yesterday it was “disappointed” by the failure to offer “real change or compromise” to Prime Minister Theresa May’s unpopular Brexit divorce deal.
MPs have rejected her agreement finalised with European leaders last November three times, delaying Britain’s original 29 March exit date and throwing the process into chaos.
Ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday, May was forced to ask for another extension, until 30 June, to prevent the country crashing out the bloc next Friday.
However with European leaders growing increasingly impatient at the paralysis in Westminster, they could offer just a shorter postponement – or a longer period of up to a year.
The other 27 EU nations must give unanimous backing to any deadline extension.
If there is any longer extension to Brexit,then it will mean that the UK must hold European Elections in May.
This is also proving unpalatable to many Conservatives that – three years after voting to leave the EU – the UK would be electing new parliamentarians to Europe.

Education Minister Nadhim Zawahi told BBC’s Today programme today that it would be a “suicide note of the Conservative Party if we had to fight the European elections”.
Holding the elections would pose an “existential threat” to the Conservatives and Labour as it would be an admission they’d failed to deliver Brexit, he added.
Flexibility
Hammond, who backed remain in Britain’s 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible, urged his divided Conservative colleagues to show flexibility.
“We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions,” he said.
Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU that includes participation in a customs union.
The prime ministers has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States.
But after Brexit hardliners in her own party repeatedly refused to back her plan over fears it would keep the country too closely aligned with Europe, she last week turned to Labour – infuriating many Conservatives.
Labour’s home affairs spokeswoman Diane Abbott said her party was engaged in the talks “in good faith”, but May’s team appear unwilling to compromise.
“There is concern that the government doesn’t want to alter the political declaration,” she told the BBC, referring to the part of May’s deal outlining the future relationship with the EU.
“The government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far.”

SALES OF NEW cars in January were down almost 13%, compared with the same month last year.
There were 32,374 191 car registrations last month, down from 37,023 in January 2018 – a 12.6% reduction –according to figuresreleased by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) today.
Sales of Light Commercial Vehicles (vans) were down 16.3% (5,650) compared with January last year (6,753), and HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) registrations were down 11.4% (356) in comparison to January 2018 (402).
There were monthly declines in new car registration figures last year, something SIMI puts down to “the substantial impact of Brexit”.
Used car imports in 2018 reached the highest level on record – 100,755 – accounting for 44.5% of the total car market in 2018. Used car imports for January 2019 (9,006) saw a very slight decrease 0.6% on January 2018 (9,061).
Electric vehicle registrations increased significantly with 811 registrations in January 2019, which is more than for the whole of 2017 and over 60% of the total for the whole of last year.

SIMISIMI
While electric vehicle numbers are still relatively low, they are showing strong growth – increasing from less than 1% of the market last year to a 2.6% market share in January this year.
Diesel continues to be the market leader in 2019 with a 49% share, despite an 8% decline on January 2018. Petrol has grown to 40% and hybrids currently account for 7% of the new car market.
Top five
The top five most popular car brands were Hyundai (3,815 units, down from 3,925), Volkswagen (3,224, down from 3,580), Ford (3,156, down from 3,732), Toyota (2,815, down from 4,380) and Nissan (2,639, down from 2,870).
SIMISIMI
Jim Power, economist and author of the SIMI Report, said, based on these figures, the annual new car market could decline from 125,422 to around 110,000, a decline of 12.3%. He added that used imports look set to reduce marginally to around 98,000.
“However, in the event of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, sales would be weaker, and in the event of a deal and the removal of uncertainty, sales could match 2018. In overall terms, the coming months are likely to be characterised by deep uncertainty,” Power said.
Brian Cooke, Director General Designate of SIMI, said the figures are “clearly disappointing but not surprising”.
He also noted the impact of Brexit and a weak Sterling, stating: “While we hope the EU and UK’s negotiations result in agreement that allows for free trade, the likelihood of no deal is increasing by the day.”
Cooke said the motor industry is “ramping up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit”, adding that it is crucial the State “fully clarifies the trading conditions in the event of no agreement being reached”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-delayed-vote-4510448-Feb2019/,"LAST UPDATE|24 Feb 2019
LEO VARADKAR HAS said Ireland is not “playing chicken” with the UK as Theresa May confirmed that she will not put a so-called meaningful vote to parliament in the coming week.
Addressing reporters in Egypt, the Taoiseach said the Irish position on Brexit has not changed since day one and that it is the UK’s issue to fix.
He said: “The decision on when this vote happens in the House of Commons isn’t under my control. I haven’t had a chance to speak to Prime Minister May yet. I will today or tomorrow.
“Let’s not forget this March 29 deadline is a self imposed deadline. It is one that the United Kingdom has imposed on itself. Nobody in Ireland of the EU is threatening no deal.
“This is a situation the UK has created for itself so we are not playing chicken, we are not playing poker, we are just standing by our position which has been solid from day one,” he said.
May said that negotiations with Brussels are continuing and that she intends on bringing the latest deal to the House of Commons by 12 March.
Speaking in Sharm el Sheikh, May said she doesn’t see the point in extending Article 50 – something which would give the UK more time to exit the EU.
She said: “I was in Brussels last week. Ministers were in Brussels last week. My team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels on Tuesday.
“As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that that happens by March 12.
“But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March 29.”

May faces a number of problems from within her own party.
Earlier this week  three British cabinet ministers warned that Brexit should be delayed if the UK parliament doesn’t approve a deal.
Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark said it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay Britain’s departure rather than crash out of the EU on 29 March with no deal.
The three ministers acknowledged British Prime Minister Theresa May’s “extraordinary determination and resilience” in working on a deal to leave the EU.
Addressing this today, May said: “We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.
“Now, often people talk about the extension of Article 50 as if that will actually solve the issue. Of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.
“Extension of Article 50 doesn’t solve the problem.
“There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not.
“And that will be a decision for every member of Parliament across the House.
“Every member of the Commons will have to face that decision when that point comes.
“The Government will be bringing back, working with the EU, and will want to put a deal to the House of Commons in a meaningful vote.”

THE HOUSE OF Commons has been suspended as a result of a water leak in the building.
Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle made the decision to temporarily stop proceedings during a backbench business debate.
The debate was interrupted by the sound of leaking water.
The House of Commons press office said the leak was “urgently dealt with and has now been isolated”.
“The House of Commons maintenance team is currently assessing the damage,” it said.
A number of MPs began tweeting about the leak, with Labour’s Justin Madders writing: “In the Commons chamber and can hear rain dripping in through the roof, Parliament really is broken.”

Tory MP Neil O’Brien tweeted that the water was coming into the chamber from above.
“Leak alert! A lot of water is flowing into the chamber of the Commons from above. Think it is coming in from the press gallery appropriately,” O’Brien wrote.
Meanwhile, fellow Conservative MP Julia Lopez tweeted that there was a “very noisy torrent of water coming in from the ceiling”.
“Is this a Biblical flood coming to wash us all away?” she said.

The House of Commons press office also confirmed that this was not a sewage leak.
This incident comes after a group of protesters entered the public gallery in the House of Commons in Westminsteron Monday eveningand stripped semi-naked while MPs debate a series of motions on where Brexit goes next.
The group – calling themselves Extinction Rebellion – said they were doing so to draw attention to climate and ecological issues, and promised further action in the coming weeks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bertie-ahern-tony-blaire-op-ed-4591693-Apr2019/,"FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair have written a joint op-ed calling for a second Brexit referendum.
In the op-ed, published in the Irish Times, they describe Brexit as “the most serious threat to peace in the North and to the union in our lifetime”.
The pair open the article by describing how they both signed the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which sought to bring an end to the Troubles.
They say that due to this, they feel “duty-bound” to write an op-ed about their thoughts on the current Brexit situation.
Theresa May and her colleagues in parliament “must learn from previous mistakes” and use the newly-approved flextension “to encourage calm amid the chaos”, they say.
They go on:

They say that nobody should compare the tragedy of the Troubles to Brexit, “but as the rhetoric becomes stronger, the language more divisive and inflammatory, the divisions in the Tory and Labour parties more evident, the necessity for calm matters even more”.
They also write about the need to move behind social media discussions, and of the need to understand the feelings of British citizens.
Ahern and Blair say it is time “to elevate the discussion above individual interests to the collective, to expand the definition of “us” and shrink the definition of “them”.”
They also say that: “There is no variation of Brexit that can strengthen the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.”
They also say they believe that the Good Friday Agreement will survive Brexit.
The pair say there is a time for a “confirmatory referendum” and that “the people of the UK, should have the final say”. They said people should be asked “if now, knowing all that they do, they still wish to proceed, on whatever basis is agreed by government and parliament”.
A second Brexit referendum has been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May.
Last week May was forced to ask EU leaders for a second Brexit extension. It culminated in delaying the last date by which the UK can leave the EU from 12 April to 31 October.

BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE today arrested a man waving a St George’s English flag who spent the night on the roof of London’s St Pancras rail terminal, forcing the suspension of Eurostar trains.
Services between London and continental Europe were suspended for several hours because of the trespasser.
“A 44-year-old man has this morning been arrested for trespass and obstruction of the railway, having spent the night on the roof of St Pancras Railway Station,” British Transport Police said in a statement.
A police spokesman confirmed the man had been waving an English flag in an apparent act of protest.

The incident happened a day after thousands of protesters massed outside the British parliament, many of them waving English and United Kingdom flags, in protest against Brexit being delayed.
“We have suspended all services to and from London St Pancras this morning, due to a trespasser on the tracks outside of St Pancras,” a Eurostar statement said.
The company later said services had resumed.
Yesterday evening, the police had said that a man was “in a precarious position” at the London terminal.

THE FIRST WEEK of 2019 in the House of Commons has been a tumultuous one – particularly for the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
With British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal due before the House of Commons next week, five days of debates on Brexit scheduled, and a number of tense amendments related to the deal already passed, it would be easy to miss this story in a whirlwind of Brexit-related news.
It all centred around a vote on a Withdrawal Agreement amendment whichpassed on Wednesdayby 308 to 297: if Theresa May’s deal fails to pass through the House of Commons next Tuesday, MPs voted to give the Prime Minister just three days after this – so until Friday – to bring forward her alternative plan.
The ‘Greive’ amendment, tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, reduced the original timeline from 21 days to just three, putting more pressure on May’s government and infuriating her Tories.
As House Speaker, it’s Bercow’s job to umpire the extraordinary and unruly debates in the House of Commons, and deciding whether legislation and amendments are worthy of coming before the House.
Bercow chose this amendment to be put before the House of Commons, against the advice of his own clerks (which surround him in the photo above looking displeased).
Where they disagreed was over the meaning of the word “forthwith”: up until now, theCommons’ Standing Orders‘ references to motions being put to the House “forthwith” have meant that they cannot be amended. But Bercow has gone against this, and decided that it means theycanbe amended, but cannot be debated upon.
Nigel Farage summed up the outrage against the decision neatly, when he said thison LBC on Wednesday:

The amendment is also seen as both infuriating Theresa May’s government, and putting pressure on people to vote for her deal; with just three days to come up with an alternative plan, is that guaranteed to be better than the Withdrawal Agreement, which went through years of negotiations?
Bercow, aged 55, has been House Speaker since June 2009; he's also an MP for Buckingham.Jessica Taylor / UK ParliamentJessica Taylor / UK Parliament/ UK Parliament
Dominic Grieve took a different view. The barrister and Queen’s Counsel said in response to the controversy:
“The Standing Orders of the House are very complex and very archaic. My view is that in tabling this amendment is that I did it in good faith, on the basis that I wanted the Speaker and indeed the House authorities to consider it as a possibility of being selected, and they told me it is selectable.
So what does Bercow himself say?
When the House voted in favour of the amendment, Bercow argued that that it was proof that his decision was validated.
“If we only went by precedent, manifestly nothing would ever change,” he said.
He also faced accusations of sporting a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker on his car. During a debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Tory MP Adam Holloway said:
“We’ve all noticed in recent months a sticker on your car making derogatory comments about Brexit. This is a serious point about partiality. Have you driven that car with the sticker there?”
After calling for order amongst the outcries from MPs,Bercow responded:
“There was a factual error in [the honourable gentleman's] opening remarks, I’m sure it was an inadvertent error and I mean that most sincerely, but it was a factual error.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-sheep-farmers-brexit-4319473-Jan2019/,"SHEEP FARMERS IN Northern Ireland are struggling to try and prepare for Brexit; they’re breeding lambs for the coming spring in the hope that there will be some sort of deal by 29 March, when the UK are scheduled to leave the EU.
So far, there’s a stalemate between the EU and the UK over agreeing on a backstop for Northern Ireland, which has left the possibility of a no-deal scenario very likely.
That’s created a problem for a lot of industries in Ireland and Northern Ireland. In October,a UK Brexit committee were toldthat sheep farmers were wondering whether they should breed lambs for the spring because there might be less of a market to export lambs to.
But Edward Adamson, the Northern Ireland said regional manager for the UK’s National Sheep Association, said that he doesn’t know of anyone who isn’t “putting rams out”, or breeding for the coming season.
“If they’re keeping the rams in and there’s a deal at the end of it, that would be an even worse situation.”
He added that breeding this autumn was curtailed a bit because “Brexit was looming over us”.
Currently, around 40% of lambs in the North are exported to Ireland.By November 2017, 388,517 sheep had been imported from Northern Ireland and the UK to Ireland. In 2015, 335,349 were imported from Northern Ireland alone.
Around 80% of Northern Ireland’s lambs are exported, so if there’s a hard Brexit, there will be nowhere to store lamb, and no one to buy it.

“There’s no way we can eat our way out of the problem,” Adamson says.
So as it stands, there’s nowhere to store lamb meat, and if there are cold stores built it will reflect on the price of lambs, Adamson adds.
So what are farmers doing to prepare? They’re looking at their costs, but Adamson says “I don’t think they could prepare” at this point.
The problem is mirrored in Great Britain, where the UK exports 40% lamb meat, with 96% of that going to the EU.
“We’ve a huge amount of meat and we don’t know where will it go after Brexit,” a spokesperson for UK sheep farmers said.
“It’s a difficult position to be in, we don’t have any outgoings and nowhere to sell. There’s so much uncertainty.”
The UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been requested to build more cold storage units, so that lambs that have been slaughtered can be stored. But they’ve yet to respond to those calls.
Adamson said that he’s asked a number of farmers in Northern Ireland about the possible benefits, and said that he hasn’t heard of any.
He says that claims that the sheep farming industry will be wiped out if there’s a hard or no-deal Brexit is exaggerated, but that it will hit the industry hard.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-brexit-border-4453106-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Jan 2019
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the Irish government cannot accept “promises” from those that oppose the withdrawal agreement and the backstop that the Northern Ireland border issues “will be alright on the night”.
The Taoiseach made his comments after the European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said today that it’s “pretty obvious” that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Margaritis Schinas said the EU stood behind the Good Friday Agreement and Ireland in its negotiations, but that a no-deal would entail the return of a hard border.
“If you like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it’s pretty obvious, you will have a hard border,” he said.
The Irish government has always maintained the importance of avoiding the return of a hard border throughout negotiations, while Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly pledged to avoid a return to “the borders of the past”.
If Britain leaves without a deal, however, it would have no trade deal with the rest of the EU, necessitating some kind of customs checks and infrastructure.
Standing firm
Speaking in the Dáil, Varadkar said the Irish government stand firm on the ensuring the backstop as is contained in the agreement is honoured.
He said no other solutions are being put forward by those that are opposed to the deal, stating that they are only making promises to come up with a solution in a couple of years time.
He said that is not acceptable to the Irish government, “which is why we have been so firm”.
Varadkar said a “real dilemma” occurs if there is a no-deal, stating that Ireland will be part of the EU and will have obligations to protect the single market.
In that scenario, all parties will have to negotiate full alignment to avoid border infrastructure, which the Taoiseach said is already contained in the withdrawal agreement.
He said there is a reason the withdrawal agreement took two years to negotiate – “it is hard to do”.
‘Alright on the night’
“We can’t give that up for a promise that it will be alright on the night… we have to stand by it,” said the Taoiseach.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said it would become difficult to prevent border infrastructure on the island of Ireland without a Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Speaking to the media this afternoon, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said:
He added that the Irish government will not support the reemergence of border infrastructure but it’s “very very difficult” to ensure without a deal.
Coveney said without a withdrawal agreement it becomes very difficult to prevent border infrastructure in Ireland and maintain integrity of EU customs area.
“What we are saying is we will work to avoid a hard border in all circumstances, with the Commission and the British government,” he said, adding that there are “solutions and a mechanism” to deal with this comprehensively.

“We would be very foolish not to hold on to that,” said Coveney.
“If we end up in no deal Brexit scenario there will be a build up to that which will take some time… we have made it very clear we are not planning for reemergence of border infrastructure and we will have to find a mechanism with the British government and the EU that protects the EU single market and customs union, in terms of its integrity ,” he said.
Coveney said the “only credible” way to avoid a border is through a customs union and regulatory alignment, which is something to be worked on “even in a no deal scenario”.
He said the Irish government has been “firm” in the last week in terms of advocating for the withdrawal agreement that took two years to negotiate. Those that are objecting to it need to be honest with people about what their solutions would be, said the Tánaiste.
May’s Plan B speech
The EU Commission’s spokesperson said today he had learned nothing new from Theresa May and her government, since the prime minister laid out her “plan B” on Brexit to the House of Commons yesterday.
The spokesperson also expressed frustration as journalists questioned him over the next steps in the negotiation.
“In all honesty, I have a terrible sense of deja vu in all these exchanges,” he said. “There is nothing else that I can meaningfully say.”
Yesterday, May told parliament she would seek changes to the Brexit deal her government had already agreed with the EU.
Schinas said he wouldn’t speculate on a plan B because the EU is “for plan A, which is set out by the withdrawal agreement”.
The EU has also backed Ireland on the issue of the backstop – which would prevent a hard border in the Northern Ireland by keeping regulatory alignment with the EU – which has proved such a thorny issue in Westminster.
Yesterday, European Commission Chief Negotiator Michel Barniertold RTÉ Newsthat he ruled out any bilateral arrangement between the UK and Ireland to remove the backstop.
Brexit ‘mega’ Bill
Separately, Coveney said the Heads of mega Brexit bill to prepare for no-deal Brexit will be published on Friday.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today briefed opposition party leaders on Ireland’s contingency plans and omnibus Brexit Bill.
Fianna Fail’s Micheál Martin has previously criticised the Taoiseach and government for their lack of preparedness for Brexit as the end date of 29 March approaches.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald toldTheJournal.ietoday that the British government approach has been to demand a Brexit on their terms and to run down the clock.
“Last week I reiterated to Theresa May that the Withdrawal Agreement and the Backstop represented the absolute bottom line and could not be undermined or dismissed.
“I also took the opportunity to remind the British Prime minister of her obligation to set the date for a unity referendum,” she said, adding:
“Europe has made clear that there will be no reopening of the agreement and no bilateral arrangement.
“Dublin cannot blink on this matter and I will tell the Taoiseach that he must stand firm in the face of British pressure.”

RTÉ - IRELAND’S NATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MEDIA/ YouTube
SARAH MCTERNAN WILL represent Ireland at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Israel in May, RTÉ has revealed.
McTernan, who came third in The Voice of Ireland 2015, will perform the song ’22′  in the second Eurovision semi-final in Tel Aviv on Thursday 16 May.
The song was penned by Janieck, Marcia “Misha” Sondeijker and Roulsen,
She previously competed to represent San Marino at last year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon with a song called Eye of the Storm, however, she failed to qualify.
‘Full steam ahead’
The 24-year-old  from Scariff, Co Claretold RTÉthat representing Ireland in the contest is like “an early birthday present”.
“My 25th birthday is next Monday and if you’d told me last year that I’d be chosen to represent my country at Eurovision, performing the song for the first time on Dancing with the Stars this Sunday, and then flying to Tel Aviv on my birthday to record a postcard, I would have told you – you were crazy,” she said.
McTernan has a 2.5-year-old daughter, Mia, who she says is her biggest fan.

“My Mom, Nana, family and friends are super excited for me – they’re shocked and very proud. I can’t wait to teach my biggest fan – my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Mia – all the lyrics to 22,” she said.
So here we go 🎉I’m delighted to announce that I will be representing Ireland in The@eurovisionthis year, You can catch the song ‘22’ on its first airplay on Ryan Tubridy's radio show at 9am, I will be interviewed by the lovely Jenny Greene on 2FM at 12:30pm and Ray Darcy at 3pic.twitter.com/uLty2KNCqc— Sarah McTernan (@Sarah_McTernan)March 8, 2019Sarah McTernan/ Twitter

Over 430 songs were submitted to RTÉ for consideration with Irish Head of Delegation Michael Kealy accrediting the volume of entries to Ryan O’Shaughnessy’s “great” performance in Lisbon last year.
Politically tense
Israeli singer Netta was crowned winner at last year’s contest. Her win immediately sparked controversy over 2019′s competition, the first time in 20 years that Israel will play host.
Israel previously hosted the Eurovision in 1979 and 1999. The country won the competition in 1978 with Ireland’s Colm Wilkinson placing fifth with ‘Born to Sing’.
In 1998, Israel came first again in the Eurovision when Dana International won with ‘Diva’ while Ireland’s entry ‘Is Always Over Now?’ performed by Dawn Martin came ninth.
Two years after Eurovision 1999, the Irish Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) was established to raise awareness about the Occupied Territories and Israel’s continued occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act showdiplomacy was requiredas RTÉ management responded to calls from both sides of the political divide between June and December last year – before and after Ireland confirmed its participation in this year’s competition.
The Eurovision final takes place on Saturday 18 May.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-the-irish-will-have-to-operate-the-border-this-time-and-we-are-not-ready-for-that-4561910-Mar2019/,"AS WE RAPIDLY approach the cliff edge of Brexit, with the real possibility of Britain crashing out of the EU, perhaps even within days,  we are faced with the stark reality of a renewed border on the island of Ireland.
It is becoming increasingly clear that irrespective of the manner in which Britain exits the European Union – deal or no deal – we will be forced to re-introduce border controls within Ireland.
But this time, unlike during the Troubles – it will be the Republic’s turn to operate the border.  The EU will insist on that in order to protect the integrity of the single European market.
During the Troubles, the British Army operated a series of permanent vehicle checkpoints and mutually supporting observation towers and listening posts along the length of the Irish border.
In South Armagh alone, the British Army operated 13 such installations.
In the border counties of Armagh, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the staggering financial cost of such infrastructure was only overshadowed by the enormous human cost.
53 RUC Officers and more than 120 British soldiers were killed in this sensitive border area.
Hundreds were seriously wounded along with dozens of innocent civilians killed and maimed during Operation Banner – the British Army’s longest ever military campaign which lasted from 1969 to 2007.
In total, 3,500 people lost their lives during this period, with tens of thousands seriously injured.
In 2006, as a journalist specializing in security and defence, I was invited to one of the last British Army patrols of Operation Banner.
I accompanied members of C Company, 39thInfantry Brigade and elements of the 25thRegiment Royal Engineers as they patrolled from Bessbrook Mill to the notorious ‘Golf Four Zero’ Observation Post, atop Croslieve Hill, overlooking the border crossing point south of Newry.
I was also transported by British Army Air Corps Lynx helicopter to the nearby observation towers of ‘Romeo One Three’ and ‘Romeo Two One’ at Camlough and Glassdrummon, overlooking the breathtaking scenery and surrounding hills of Cloch Og, Tievecrom, Creeveceeran, Sugarloaf Hill and Drummocakavall.
Each of these border positions and their ugly military designations – with blast walls and barbed wire fences – despite their state of the art imaging and eavesdropping technologies proved completely ineffective at policing our porous border.
In a point that is especially significant for a generation who no longer remember the Troubles – this border infrastructure simply became a visual symbol of division and hatred.
The infrastructure and the people who operated it, supported or serviced it, became de facto targets.
Earlier in the Troubles, in the early 1990s, I had a brief experience of patrolling the border as a member of the Irish Defence Forces.
In what was termed ‘Aid to the Civil Power Operations’ or ATCP Ops, I participated in Irish military operations in support of An Garda Siochana in the border area.
At that point, the Irish Army had approximately 1,800 troops permanently deployed in support of border operations in eight barracks and military installations along its length.
In 2019, on the eve of Brexit, the Irish Defence Forces have just two military posts along 300 miles of a twisting, turning border with over 300 crossing points.
Recent reconnaissance and mapping of the border, carried out by the Irish military authorities, estimate that there are approximately 13,000 individual movements of freight and goods, daily, across the border.
On a weekly basis, there are almost a quarter of a million individual journeys across the proposed frontier by ordinary citizens going about their business.

Given the porous, meandering nature of our border, which corresponds with no recognizable physical feature and erratically splits townlands, neighbours and individual farms its idiosyncratic nature renders it almost impossible to monitor or police.
The Irish border, a completely artificial and arbitrary political construct, when activated, becomes an impenetrable safe haven for smuggling, criminality and inevitably,  terrorist activity.
As we are confronted with this emerging existential threat to our internal security – compounded by the increasing inter-communal tension that will accompany it within Northern Ireland, the Defence Forces is already on its knees.
At its lowest strength for decades, the Defence Forces, through budgetary starvation and appalling pay and conditions, including the lowest wages in the entire public service – is simply unable to patrol or monitor any border on this island, hard or soft.
Apart from the loss of the corporate and operational capacity to secure a border here, morale within our armed forces has never been lower.
According to a survey carried out by Amarach, for the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO), 79% of Lieutenants and Captains in the Irish Army plan to leave the organisation.
This is a shocking finding compounded by figures submitted by the military authorities to the Public Services Pay Commission which show serious pre-existing shortfalls in officer numbers – at just 55% of strength in the Army, 78% in the Naval Service and 77% in the Air Corps.
In addition to this exodus among officer ranks, key skills among non-commissioned personnel including explosive ordnance disposal, information technology and engineering are haemorrhaging from the organisation to the extent that the Defence Forces are finding it difficult to meet overseas commitments or operating our fleet of 8 coastal patrol vessels in our territorial waters.
Apart from security concerns on the ground here in the event of Brexit, another pressing defence issue will immediately arise with regard to the security of our airspace.
Again, due to a lack of investment in suitable aircraft along with the loss of pilots and air support crew, the Irish Air Corps are not capable of patrolling or monitoring Irish air space.
As a consequence, in January 2015, a memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation was reached between the Irish and British governments to permit the Royal Air Force (RAF) to monitor and patrol Irish airspace.
This MOU was formalized in 2016 in an agreement which allows the RAF to ‘identify, pursue and interdict’ hostile aircraft within Irish airspace.  These agreements were reached as EU members and they will lapse with Brexit.
In the last number of years, Russian TU-95 Bear bombers along with TU-160 Blackjack bombers have regularly entered Irish controlled airspace – where 75% of transatlantic air traffic passes en route to the USA and Europe – in order to exploit this major gap in the EU’s air defence systems and to test RAF reaction times off the Irish coast.
Despite the danger posed to international air traffic and civil aviation by these incursions, Ireland is the only country among the EU27 member states that have no primary radar systems capable of monitoring our airspace for military aircraft flying without transponders.
Given that this gap in our air defences is currently filled by the RAF, questions need to be asked about what will happen after Brexit.
Back on terra firma meanwhile, the existential threat posed by Brexit and a hard or soft border is a clear and present danger to Irish society.
The dissident paramilitary groups and ‘organised’ crime networks that will exploit any border on this island are already ramping up their activities here.  In Northern Ireland alone, paramilitaries have carried out over 220 separate shootings in the last four years.
They have also carried out almost 50 separate bomb and incendiary attacks during the last two years – including the recent parcel bomb attacks on London.
In the Republic, criminal gangs continue to use gun violence to bolster their drug operations with dozens of execution-style killings in the feud and non-feud related acts of terrorism in the last number of years.
In this context, the emerging security threats posed by Brexit, require a major investment on the part of government into an Garda Siochana – in terms of vehicles, information technology and numbers of personnel – along with a major investment in our armed forces, particularly in the area of pay and conditions in order to halt the imminent collapse of our Defence Forces operational capacity.
It will not be enough to recruit customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with a border on this island.
Brexit will critically alter the economic, social, political and security conditions in Ireland for decades to come.
There may be distinct advantages to this, including the inevitability of a united Ireland, but in order for this transition to take place peacefully and for the security conditions necessary for prosperity and continued economic growth – Ireland needs a major investment in policing, defence and security.

Addressing an audience at the Fine Gael National Conference yesterday, Donaldson said he would like to see Ireland back in the Commonwealth.
There was a large applause when he said: “I do hope we can come to a day when the Republic will join with many other (nationals) in the Commonwealth recognising that we have overcome a lot of adversity and it would be good.”
He added that the Commonwealth is a place where “Ireland’s voice should be heard and I would like to see that happen”.
However, this afternoon Taoiseach Leo Varadkar toldRTÉ’s The Week in Politicsthat joining the Commonwealth is “not something we’ve given any consideration to as a government”.
“It’s not something that’s on the agenda, at the moment anyway”.
Varadkar explained that he believed Ireland could “re-empower and boost” the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, such as the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British Irish Council.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney was also asked about to possibility yesterday, to which he said it was not on his agenda.
When asked if it was on the table, he said: “I don’t think so.”

Coveney explained away the applause from the audience stating that people were merely wanting to show Donaldson “some warmth”, stating that people understand that was a “big deal” for the DUP MP to attend today.
He said some within the Fine Gael party have been making a case for Ireland to join the Commonwealth, name-checking Senator Frank Feign.
“I think there is some support within the party to looking anew at the Commonwealth, but probably not a majority support at this stage. Like many things in Fine Gael, we have an open mind,” he said.
Brexit
Speaking of Brexit during his interview, Varadkar said he should not interfere with the United Kingdom’s internal politics and that “people understand why I can’t do that”.
He added that “whoever the prime minister is, we will work with that prime minister”.

Varadkar added that the government had ensured that it has had good links with the UK government, not just at the Taoiseach/Prime Minister level.
He went on to say that the UK is now “consumed” by Brexit.
“Even after they leave and let’s assume they leave with a withdrawal agreement in a few weeks time, they will spend two or three years consumed what the future relationship is like,” Varadkar said, adding that it is important that Ireland is not consumed or defined by Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-fishing-no-deal-brexit-4585405-Apr2019/,"THE EU HAS said that it’s prepared to allow UK boats to fish in its waters until the end of the year if the UK reciprocates, according toa no-deal Brexit plan published today.
Various UK politicians have pledged to “take back its waters”, meaning that they would ban non-UK boats from fishing in its waters, or give UK boats first preference to fish. The UK has claimed that its fisheries is one of its strongest cards in the Brexit debate.
Ireland is concerned that if the UK does claim back its waters in this way, that a large number of EU boats that fish in British waters will use Ireland’s waters instead.
Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed today said that he had “emphasised the real risks of a concentration of fishing into Ireland’s 200 miles fishing zone by EU fleets if they are excluded from UK waters”.
The EU Commission today issued its contingency plans which sets out how fisheries would be managed in a no-deal Brexit, in relation to Ireland ans seven other EU member states.
The plan, which was agreed with Ireland and seven other EU member states, recognises that fisheries is “one of the most immediately critical issues” in a no-deal Brexit.
In the contingency plans published today, it was stated:

“As a contingency measure, the European Union has adopted the necessary legal basis for the authorisation of EU and UK vessels to continue to fish in each other’s waters, until 31 December 2019, while respecting the agreed terms of the 2019 fishing opportunities regulations, agreed when UK was still a member state.”
But if the UK does not grant EU boats access to its waters, the plan is to compensate fishermen who “have a significant dependence on UK waters”:
The no-deal Brexit plan outlines the serious knock-on effect that the UK claiming its coastal waters back could have on the EU’s fishing industry:
“Loss of access to the waters of the United Kingdom may increase pressure on stocks in EU waters, and it may have serious socio-economic consequences for those EU vessels that are heavily dependent on access to UK waters, as well as for those whose traditional EU fishing grounds may see increased activity due to displacement of fishing effort.”
The plan adds that there is “a risk that the resulting intensified fishing pressure in EU waters could irreversibly impoverish marine resources, by depleting fish stocks and damaging the ecosystem”.
There’s also a concern that there’s “a risk of disputes arising between various fleets and vessels on the fishing grounds in EU waters because of ‘overcrowding’.”
Under the heading ‘recommended action’ that could be taken, the EU says that its members could use the “current UK catches from EU27 waters, the biological capacity of stocks to cope with increased fishing pressure in EU27 waters, potential alternatives for spreading fishing pressure, uptake of quota, and the economic impact for the vessels concerned”.
Minister Creed stated, “We now have identified and agreed, co-ordinated and fully prepared measures that will be immediately available to address a no-deal Brexit situation, if the UK were to decide to deny EU vessels access to UK waters.
“We have now agreed that the Irish fleet would not be disproportionately impacted and have ensured that each Member State impacted would take a fair share of the pain.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-jr-brexit-4551231-Mar2019/,"THE SON OF US President Donald Trump has said that UK Prime Minister “ignored advice” from his father and was now leaving the British people in limbo over Brexit.
Writing a piecein this morning’s Daily Telegraph, Donald Trump Jr said that Theresa May needs to “honour that promise” to British people that the nation would leave the EU on 29 March.
“With the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead,” he said.
Trump Jr’s comments come with less than 10 days now until the official date the UK is due to leave the EU.
However, after House of Commons Speaker John Bercowruled out holding a third meaningful vote on May’s much-maligned Brexit withdrawal agreement, the prime ministeris set to formally request that Brexit be postponed.

Other EU member states are expected to consider her request at a summit in Brussels tomorrow.
As well as claiming May had ignored the advice of President Trump, Trump Jr said May is ignoring the will of the British people too.
“Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost – exactly as the European elites were hoping,” he said. “Some pro-Brexit politicians even suggest that Mrs May herself is trying to sabotage Brexit, by insisting that Parliament agree to a deal that essentially keeps Britain bound to the EU indefinitely.”
Trump Jr said this situation is important to note for Americans because Brexit is an example of how “established elites will try to subvert the will of the people” when given the opportunity.
“In a way, you could say that Brexit and my father’s election are one and the same – the people of both the UK and the US voted to uproot the establishment for the sake of individual freedom and independence, only to see the establishment try to silence their voices and overturn their mandates,” he added.
He added that the people of the UK and US must reaffirm their decisions in previous elections and “stand up for themselves against the global elite”.
The end of the article lists Trump Jr as executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

House of Commons Speaker John BercowPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
FOUR AMENDMENTS HAVE been selected ahead of tonight’s House of Commons vote on whether to extend Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
MPs are due to vote again in the House of Commons this evening at 5pm and will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
If the government’s motion is passed, the UK would not leave the EU on 29 March. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the motion will ask politicians to vote on a ‘short, limited, technical’ extension to Article 50 until 30 June, a day before the new EU parliament begins.
However, it would have to ask the EU if it could do so.
MPs had submitted 10 amendments to the motion, four of which have now been selected by House Speaker John Bercow for MPs to vote on.
The amendments will be voted on before the Prime Minister’s motion; if they’re passed, they will be added onto that motion, and that motion will be voted on at the end. This means that the Prime Minister’s motion may be dramatically altered, by one or all four amendments, the time MPs vote on it.
The four amendments are:
Amendment B was not selected, which aimed to reject a second referendum on the basis that it would be “divisive and expensive”.
Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk has said he will ask EU leaders to be open to allowing a “long extension” to Brexit if the UK needs time to rethink its leaving strategy.

Tusk tweeted that he “will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.

During my consultations ahead of#EUCO, I will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its#Brexitstrategy and build consensus around it.
Tusk’s comments come ahead of tonight’s vote. As president of the European Council, he will be the host of a 21 March summit in Brussels that may be asked to decide whether to push back Britain’s 29 March departure from the Union.
May said that to get such an extension, there would have to be a deal in place, and that the only deal on offer is the current Withdrawal Agreement.
She said that parliament needs to accept that the only other option open to them if that motion is rejected is to opt for a much longer extension.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said a long extension is most likely and that Ireland won’t be an obstacle to an extension – but some other member states will be “quite demanding”.
He added that he got a courtesy call from his UK counterpart before they published theno-deal tariff plan yesterday morningand that the plan galvanised the EU to continue to back Ireland and the backstop.
The House of Commonslast night voted against a no-deal Brexitwith 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time. A total of 278 MPs voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
During last night’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as May had proposed.
A total of 312 voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while 308 voted against the amendment.

The trial of a government plan to hold lorries in the event of post-Brexit disruption at the former Manston Airport sitePA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
DOZENS OF TRUCKS took part in a UK government exercise for coping with possible Channel gridlock caused by a no-deal Brexit, assembling on a disused airport runway that could be turned into a giant lorry park.
But haulage groups labelled the exercise “too little too late” and “window dressing”, while a local MP said the plan was “too complex” and would create “enormous confusion” for lorry drivers.
Nearly 100 lorries descended on Manston airfield in southeast England, which has been identified as a possible holding facility under contingency plans for leaving the European Union without a divorce agreement on 29 March.
As part of the test, the vehicles then made two trips in convoy to and from the port of Dover — A 32 kilometre journey — along a route far less used by trucks than the main highway from London.
“Today’s trial cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks being held at Manston airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” said Richard Burnett, head of the Road Haulage Association (RHA).
“It’s too little too late — this process should have started nine months ago. At this late stage it looks like window dressing,” he added.
The RHA are among the industry bodies advising the transport ministry and local officials ahead of Brexit, and helped attract truckers to the one-day trial.
A ministry spokeswoman said 89 trucks participated at a cost of £550 (€610) per driver, or £48,950 for the whole fleet.
“We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU.
“However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal,” she said.
Toby Howe, senior highway manager at Kent County Council, told AFP the government was considering holding up to 6,000 lorries at Manston, “if necessary”.
Howe said the aim of the exercise was to work out how quickly the trucks could leave the airport and how long it would take them to arrive in Dover.
‘Least worst option’
But Charlie Elphicke, the local Conservative MP for Dover, criticised the plan as “too complex” and residents have voiced concern about traffic jams.
Dover handles some 10,000 heavy goods vehicles every day and there are concerns that increased checks on the border will create congestion on roads in the county of Kent.
It currently takes only two minutes for a truck to complete the formalities.
A mere two-minute addition would cause jams of more than 17 miles (27 kilometres) in Dover and similar chaos in Calais and Dunkirk, the Port of Dover warned on its website.

The Freight Transport Association, which also liaised with hauliers for the trial, said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was of “vital importance”.
“Using Manston can never be a ‘good’ arrangement,just a part of the least worst option in the event of the ongoing disruption at Dover that no deal… would cause,” it added in a statement.
Meanwhile at the nearby port of Ramsgate, dredging is under way to prepare the harbour for use in case of delays at Dover after 29 March.
A solitary dredger was at work in the harbour on Monday, piling up spoil on the dockside.
The truck park stood empty, unused for several years.
“It’s a bit of a fiasco,” said Ramsgate resident Peter Elston, 63, a retired train driver walking his dog along the cliffs overlooking the port.
“It’s much too late. I can’t see it happening by the end of March, I can’t see it working but it would be brilliant if it did.”
Peadar Kelly, 47, a cab driver, said he had mixed views as the port would bring jobs and investment but change the quality of life.
He said Ramsgate felt quiet “like the end of the universe”, whereas Dover had become “a passing-through area.”
Katie, 30, said: “They thought they’d definitely get a deal and didn’t need to do preparations and now they realise they have to do something.
“It’s all so chaotic.”
Meanwhile, Parliament returned from its Christmas break this morning to debate and – most likely – defeat Prime Minister Theresa May’s unpopular EU divorce deal.
May and the other 27 EU leaders agreed on a draft in November designed to keep the process as orderly and undamaging as possible.

It took nearly two years to negotiate and has managed to upset just about everyone in British politics.
May survived her party’s resulting no-confidence motion but was forced to abort a December vote on the pact after admitting it would lose by a “significant margin”.
There are few signs that much has changed since.
May returned empty-handed from a subsequent EU summit she had hoped could address the concerns of her disgruntled Northern Irish coalition partners.
Vote to go ahead
Brexit-backing MPs in her Conservative party are still in revolt while opposition Labour leaders are angling for new elections.
Related ReadsMay says MPs who don't back her Brexit deal risk damaging democracy
May insisted yesterday that the vote will go ahead as planned on or around 15 January.
The formal debate kicks off in parliament on Wednesday.
But she also warned the deal’s defeat would put Britain “in unchartered territory (in which) I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen”.
London has been swirling with rumours about how exactly May intends to avoid Britain crashing out of the bloc without any trade or other arrangements in place.
One idea mentioned by advisers involves the government simply re-introducing more or less the same version of the draft over and over again.
May refused to rule out the possibility of a second or third vote in parliament when pressed about it in a BBC interview yesterday.
Other reports said she intends to invite her party’s most vocal opponents over for private drinks today and Wednesday.
The arm-twisting will be accompanied by a new government campaign designed to prepare Britons for the full impact of a disruptive no-deal scenario.
But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said reports that he and other EU sceptics could be persuaded by May’s arguments about a calamitous no-deal Brexit were “wishful thinking”.
Most Conservatives either “think that these fears are exaggerated or that (it) is a price worth paying for leaving the shackles of the European Union,” he wrote in the Sunday Express.
Involving parliament
May outlined a formal plan of action yesterday that included the possibility of giving parliament a bigger say in a new round of trade talks with Brussels that begins once Brexit enters into force.
These “future relationship” negotiations will also try to resolve the prickly issue of keeping the Irish border open while preserving the integrity of the EU.
The temporary solution laid out in the draft withdrawal agreement does not suit Northern Ireland’s tiny Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that props up May’s government.
“There’s a number of ways which we’re looking to see how we can involve parliament in a greater way in the future,” May told the BBC.
She also promised to continue to seek “further assurances from the European Union” about the border issue ahead of next week’s vote.
The DUP wants a binding guarantee from Brussels that Northern Ireland’s trade with the rest of Britain will not be subjected to any types of checks.
May spent part of her holidays ringing up EU leaders about possible concessions. Brussels has made clear it will cede nothing before the vote.

A Conservative Party leadership contest will officially get underway when May’s resignation kicks in next month and reports indicate that the party intends to have a new leader in place before the end of July. She will remain as Prime Minister until her successor is appointed.
Towards the end of her speech May quickly broke down before leaving the podium with major British newspapers featuring a “broken” May on their front pages today.
The Daily Telegraph features an emotional May with the headline “Boris makes Brexit vow in Push for No 10″.

The Times runs with “It all ends in tears”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-vote-john-bercow-4564435-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|28 Mar 2019

THE HOUSE OF Commons will debate and vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal tomorrow at 2.30pm, it has been confirmed.
But there was confusion in the parliament after Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom said that House Speaker John Bercow’s call for substantial changes would mean that this wouldn’t be a ‘Meaningful Vote’.
It had been unsure whether Bercow would allow a third vote on May’s deal, after stating before that it would have to be substantially different.
But a workaround has been found as the two previous votes were on the draft Withdrawal Agreementandthe Political Declaration on the Future Relationship; tomorrow’s vote will only be on the Withdrawal Agreement.
“The motion is new, substantially different,” Bercow has told parliament, adding that he would accept amendments to the Brexit deal.
But MPs were confused as to whether it was legally acceptable to split the two documents; Bercow said that it wasn’t a matter for him to decide whether it was legal, only whether it was orderly.
One MP pointed out that the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration were “two horns on a goat’s head” and cannot be separated. Bercow replied that it was a political issue, but not an issue for him as chair.
The Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said that the motion was “perfectly reasonable and perfectly lawful”, adding that “we could not let the time to expire tomorrow” without giving a chance for MPs to vote whether to allow May’s deal and avoid a no-deal Brexit.
The vote will take place on the original date that the UK was due to leave the EU, at 11pm on 29 March. This has been pushed back to 12 April if the deal is rejected, and 22 May if May’s deal is passed tomorrow.
Negotiations are ongoing behind the scenes in a bid to get May’s deal over the line – the third attempt at doing so. May is making last-ditch attempts to get MPs to back her Brexit deal, having offered her resignation in return for support.
Leadsom said earlier today that the government was trying to secure permission for a third vote from Bercow.
“We recognise that any motion brought forward tomorrow will need to be compliant with the speaker’s ruling and that discussion is ongoing,” Leadsom told the chamber.
Bercow yesterday cast fresh doubt over the holding of a third vote.
“There should be no misunderstanding, I wish to make clear that I do expect the government to meet the test of change.
“They should not seek to circumvent my ruling by means of tabling either a notwithstanding or a paving motion, the tabling office has been instructed no such motion would be accepted,” he said.
Indicative votes
Last night, MPs rejected eight Brexit options put to them in a series of indicative votes.

The votes were, as the name suggests, indicative, but not legally binding.

The proposals with themost supportwere a UK-wide customs union with the EU and a second referendum.
Brexit minister Steve Barclay said the inconclusive outcome “strengthens our view that the deal our government has negotiated is the best option”.
‘Prepared to leave’
May yesterday told the Conservative Party she would step down as leader if they backed her deal.
“I know some people are worried that if you vote for the Withdrawal Agreement, I will take that as a mandate to rush on into phase two without the debate we need to have.
“I won’t – I hear what you are saying,” May told Tory backbenchers at a meeting of the 1922 Committee.
As a result, a number of Eurosceptic MPs performed a u-turn including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson — a likely contender to replace May — who told fellow MPs he would now support the deal.
However, May’s offer may not be enough to win round some hardliners, including a group of Conservatives reported to call themselves ‘The Spartans’ who are still holding out — as is the Democratic Unionist Party.
The DUP said the backstop plan in the deal to keep open the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic poses an “unacceptable threat” to the United Kingdom.

The opposition Labour and Scottish National parties are also against the deal.
No deal
Britain was due to officially leave the EU tomorrow. The European Council last week agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if MPs back May’s deal this week.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
The European Commission on Monday said it has completed preparations for a no-deal Brexit, noting “it is increasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-vote-2-4434775-Jan2019/,"WHAT EXACTLY IS in store for British Prime Minister Theresa May, during the week where her Brexit Withdrawal Agreement comes before the House of Commons?
On Tuesday,639 MPs will voteon whether to approve or reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal on the terms upon which they will leave the European Union (there are 650 MPs, but four don’t vote and seven Sinn Féin MPs don’t take their seats in Westminster).
The vote was first scheduled to be held before Christmas, on Tuesday 11 December, but was cancelled because Theresa May didn’t have the support to pass her deal.
She needs the support of 320 MPs: the Tories have 315 elected members, and the support of 10 DUP MPs. But after over 100 MPs voted against her during the motion of confidence in December, it looks likely that her Brexit deal won’t pass next week.

If it doesn’t pass, the options are both endless and equally implausible: further negotiations; extending Article 50; a general election or a Tory leadership challenge; a second referendum or a no-deal Brexit have all been floated as possible scenarios.
And Theresa May won’t have much time to choose one of these options either –an amendment voted for earlier this weekmeans that she will have justthree daysto come back to the House of Commons with a new plan.
If the vote fails, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has threatened to table a motion of no confidence in the government, which could make the decision for May if she loses that as well.
Meanwhile, the UK is still scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March. In Brussels, the President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi will present its annual report to EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, of which Brexit will be among the issues discussed.
The vote on the Withdrawal Agreement is scheduled to take place from 7pm onwards on Tuesday evening.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-black-hole-uk-front-pages-4586792-Apr2019/,"NO ONE IS surprised that Brexit isn’t happening this Friday, though the 31 October deadline may have raised a few eyebrows.
Early this morning,it was confirmed that the UK would be given a flexible extensionup until the 31 October, meaning the UK could leave the EU before then if it approves British Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal.
Although the arrangement avoids a no-deal Brexit in less than 48 hours from now, it wasn’t quite what Theresa May wanted – she had asked for an extension until 30 June.
European Council President Tusk also didn’t quite get what he wanted, as he had intended that there be a flexible extension of up to a year. But French President Emmanuel Macron, tired of talking about Brexit, and eager to avoid a Brussels summit every two weeks to discuss an extension, pushed to narrow the time being given.
The extension also means that the UK will have to prepare for the European elections, with the intention that none of the candidates who are elected will take their seats for long.
So how is all this being perceived in the UK press?
Starting with The Telegraph, its front page says that Tories “plan to move against PM after elections as she ‘begs’ Europe for help” – but how many times have we heard of Tories planning a leadership challenge at this stage?

Even more interesting than their front page, is the Telegraph’s political cartoons…

The Guardian reports that Europe listened to May – “and said no”.
It reports:
It also reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel argued for a flexible extension until 31 December, and that the threat of the Uk taking part in European elections would encourage some to vote for Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement.
The Times and the Metro draw a comparison to the black hole photo – someone had to do it.

The Metro says that “the EU appears as far, far away as this black hole”, and begins its story with: “It’s a gaping void that sucks in energy with an irresistible force”. Fitting.
The Times reports that Theresa May has pledged to stay on as Prime Minister during this year’s extension, despite telling her MPs previously that she wouldn’t fight the next general election.

Some papers, meanwhile, didn’t even mention Brexit as their front-page story, or mention it at all.

THE FINAL DAY climax of the Premier League title race marked the end of a campaign that also featured a number of memorable quotes from start to finish.
Here are 10 of the best:
“I can’t wait to get out of it, if I’m honest. I think we’ll be far better out of the bloody thing. In every aspect. Football-wise as well, absolutely. To hell with the rest of the world.”
– A combative Neil Warnock vents his ire about Brexit in January
“That puts it into perspective — yes, we’ve got relegated, but life is far more important.”
– Warnock on the tragic death of Argentinian striker Emiliano Sala, Cardiff’s record signing who never got to play for the club after he was killed in a plane crash on January 21 while en route from Nantes to Wales
“I won more Premierships alone than the other 19 managers together. Three for me, two for them. Respect!”

– Jose Mourinho loses his cool in a press conference after back-to-back defeats early in the season. He was sacked by Manchester United in December.
“The title race is like Highlander. Only one of us will be there at the end.”
– Jurgen Klopp uses a typically colourful cinematic comparison in April of their duel with Manchester City, referring to the tagline of the 1986 film.
“I’m 51 years old so I have never experienced a war. We are really blessed in our generation, but the past showed us that as long as strong partners are together, Europe is a much safer place.”
– Klopp takes a different line to Warnock on Brexit.
“At the end Liverpool play right now without pressure because they know it is not in their hands… We have the pressure because we can’t lose, because it is in our own hands.”
– Pep Guardiola ups the ante on Liverpool ahead of the final weekend
“Liverpool are one of the strongest teams I have faced. They have everything. They have good tactics, they have great defensive strength, they have very good high pressing and they have a very good counter-attack.”
– Guardiola heaps praise on Klopp’s side in April
“You know what you are, you know what you are.”

– The normally placid Mauricio Pochettino rants at referee Mike Dean after a 2-1 defeat by Burnley in February. It earned him a two-match touchline ban
“How is your future? Is The Sun happy with you or not?”
– Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri jokes with a newspaper reporter after being asked if he was nervous about his future after a 2-0 victory over Spurs at the end of February
“When confronted with a tragedy, all people are different, with different reactions. I proposed different things to help everyone with different support.”
– Claude Puel may have been sacked later in the season but he gained a huge amount of respect for the way he handled the aftermath of the death of Leicester City’s Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in a helicopter crash on 27 October.
“Back to back… I think it was the hardest, most tough Premier League ever. Liverpool was exceptional. I don’t mean to rub it in, it is what it is, they didn’t deserve to lose.”
– City captain Vincent Kompany after a 4-1 win over Brighton on the final day clinched the title.

A majority of 413 MPsvoted last nightin favour of extending Article 50, with 202 voting against the government’s motion.

The motion proposed seeking an extension until 30 June and noted that if the House passed the Withdrawal Agreement by Wednesday then the three-month extension would be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
The vote isn’t legally binding and the EU must agree to any extension. Some people have argued that delaying Brexit is largely pointless as European leaders have said the deal struck between Britain and the EU cannot be renegotiated.

THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL has agreed to delay the date by which the UK leaves the European Union by almost two months if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the UK parliament next week.
If the agreement is not passed by the House of Commons the new deadline will be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward to the European Council before that date.
At that point the UK will face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or else exiting the EU without a deal.
Following lengthy discussions in Brussels the 22 May deadline was unanimously agreed upon by the 27 leaders of the European Union’s member states as a number of possible rumoured deadlines circulated ahead of, and during, the meeting today.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May had sought an extension until the end of June.
The UK had been legally obliged to leave the European Union on 29 March (next Friday), two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May, which sets the Brexit process in motion.
Speaking at a press conference after the agreement was announced the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU is ready for all outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit.

He said:
He added that the meeting has left him more optimistic about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.
Theresa May refused to select her favourite of Tusk’s four options when asked about it in her own press conference, however she reiterated that she will not countenance revoking article 50.
The British leader welcomed the EU’s decision to delay Brexit and said the British parliament now has clear choices about what to do next.
“I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision,” she said.
It had been argued that there would be legal implications of granting an extension to article 50 beyond the European elections.
Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan had said previously that the EU’s legal advice is “there would be European elections in the UK if an extension was granted beyond 23 May”.
The draft Withdrawal Agreement next week has already been rejected twice before – first by an historic majority of 230 votes, and then by a majority of 149 votes.
It’s expected that a third ‘meaningful vote’ will be held next Monday or Tuesday. If the deal is rejected for a third time, it’s not clear what would happen next.
French President Emmanuel Macron was among those who said that a vote against Theresa May’s deal would lead to a no-deal Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-vote-house-of-commons-brexit-4442092-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|15 Jan 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has suffered a crushing parliamentary defeat tonight in a historic vote over the Brexit deal.
May’s bid to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons was defeated by a margin of 202 to 432, a majority of 230.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no confidence motion in the immediate aftermath of the bombshell result being announced.
The motion will be debated and voted on tomorrow evening – but with the DUP and Eurosceptic Tories rowing in behind the Prime Minister she looks all but assured to survive.
Reacting to her defeat in the House of Commons, May said that MPs have established what they are against  but not what they are for.
“I ask members on all sides of the house to listen to the British people who want this matter settled,” she said.
Corbyn then confirmed that the no confidence motion, telling MPs:
“This is the greatest defeat for a government since the 1920s in this house. This is a catastrophic defeat for this government. After two years of failed negotiations, the House of Commons has delivered its verdict on her Brexit deal, and its verdict is decisive.”
May’s government only has a majority in the Commons with the support of the DUP, so their ten votes will be crucial in any confidence vote.
In a statement the party’s leader Arlene Foster indicated DUP MPs would back the embattled prime minister.
“We will work with the Government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus. Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the Government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal,” Foster said.

Reacting to May’s defeat this evening, EU Council President Donald Tusk suggested that there may be few solutions remaining that involve the UK leaving the EU, tweeting:
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned that the vote increased the chances of the UK crashing out with no deal.
“I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up,” Juncker, said after the vote.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas today raised the possibility of further talks while ruling out a full re-negotiation of the text.
“I am sceptical that the agreement can be fundamentally reopened once again,” Maas said.
Here, the Government has saidit will continue to intensify preparations for a disorderly Brexit.

Hardline Brexiteers and Remainers oppose the current agreement for different reasons and many fear it could lock Britain into an unfavourable trading relationship with the EU.
Opposition to the agreement forced May to postpone the vote in December in the hope of winning concessions from Brussels ahead of the planned 29 March Brexit date.
The withdrawal agreement includes plans for a post-Brexit transition period until a new relationship is drawn up, in return for continued budget contributions from London.
Without it, and if there is no delay, the UK will sever 46 years of ties with its nearest neighbours with no agreement to ease the blow.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-mps-no-deal-4533098-Mar2019/,"AHEAD OF THE series of vital votes on Brexit in the coming week in Westminster, Northern Irish businesses have written to MPs and warned how local firms are “hugely exposed” to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
Urging politicians to take a no-deal off the table, the group of 50 businesses asked MPs to “consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit”.
Separately, the UK’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has told the BBC that if the House of Commons – as expected – refuses to pass Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, then it opens up the possibility of a second referendum.
However, the hardline Brexiteers have signalled that they won’t back May’s proposals which include the Irish backstop, and said it will be defeated in the House on Tuesday.
Crunch time
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher with the potential for three crucial votes this week.
Advertisement
On Tuesday, MPs will get the opportunity to vote again on the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement. It was heavily defeated in January, and not a great deal has changed with the deal with the EU since that point.
On Wednesday, if May’s deal is voted against, MPs will then vote on whether to leave the EU without a deal. If this is also defeated, a vote will be put to the house on Thursday on whether to delay Brexit.
With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit not yet off the table, Northern Irish businesses have urged MPs not to support this option.
In its open letter – signed by more than 50 businesses – it says: “Although Brexit has not yet happened, the negative economic impact is already starting to bite in terms of the private sector’s ability to invest.
We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Responding to the letter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said it is clear there is a “coordinated attempt to railroad MPs into accepting the toxic, union destroying, NI economy damaging deal, which the prime minister had previously agreed with the EU”.
Hard stance
Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that if Brexit didn’t happen, it would be “devastating” for the Conservative party.
Related ReadsExplainer: What on earth is going to happen in Westminster next week?
He also said it was essential the UK seizes its opportunity to leave with Theresa May’s deal on 29 March because “there is wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit”.
“If you want to stop Brexit, you only need to do three things,” he said. “Kill this deal, get an extension and then have a second referendum. Within three weeks those people could have two of those three things… Quite possibly the third one could be on the way.”
Two leading Brexiteers, meanwhile, have said that delaying Brexit would cause “incalculable” harm to the public’s trust in politics and the democratic process.
DUP MP Nigel Dodds and Tory MP Steve Baker, writing in today’s Sunday Telegraph, said that delaying Brexit would mean that “democracy would be effectively dead”.
Both said that May’s deal would be soundly defeated on Tuesday, and delaying Brexit now would be costly for businesses who’ve prepared for a 29 March exit date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/housing-crisis-brexit-4482671-Feb2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS been urged to rethink its Rebuilding Ireland policy in light of Brexit and “apply more dynamic thinking” to solve the housing crisis.
Areport by the Oireachtas Housing Committeehas been critical of the government’s approach to solving the housing crisis. It has raised a number of concerns relating to construction in Ireland post-Brexit.
The committee highlighted that it is concerned that the current housing policy may not be robust enough to withstand the potential impacts of Brexit and whether Rebuilding Ireland can “remain as the current blueprint for tackling the issues of housing and homelessness”.
Construction concerns
The committee warned that delays in construction completion times could occur if there are changes to the Customs Union following Brexit.
It warned that in the case of a no-deal Brexit, construction products could be subject to more customs checks at the Irish border.
“This is of particular concern to the committee as witnesses explained that these changes could have negative effects on the housing market,” the report said.
Since the committee held its meetings in November, the government has published its contingency plans for Brexit. Included in these plans is the expansion of Dublin and Rosslare ports for increased customs checks.
The committee has welcomed these plans, but said they should be “acted on as soon as possible to ensure interruptions to the supply chain following Brexit are minimal”.
The committee said it is of the opinion that the availability of skilled construction workers is another factor that could impact significantly on construction project completion times following Brexit.
Advertisement
In its evidence to the committee, Proporty Industry Ireland (PII) outlined that Ireland will need a minimum of 80,000 workers in the construction sector in the coming years.
It said that its position is that “attraction and retention of talent is one of the biggest issues facing the construction industry at present”.
The labour market has traditionally relied on fluidity between the UK and Ireland to fill skill gaps, something that is true in the construction sector, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) outlined to the committee.
“The committee is concerned that changes to the Single Market, which allows for the free movement of people throughout the EU, will make it more difficult to fill the skills shortage in the construction industry following Brexit,” the report said.
‘More dynamic solution’
The committee noted that while Brexit is a concern for the housing sector, it agreed with witnesses that “more must be done to address the current dysfunction in the housing sector”.
The committee is of the opinion that if this was addressed the sector would be less vulnerable to one-off shocks such as Brexit.
It added that while Brexit will create some additional barriers, it is of the opinion that most of the weaknesses highlighted exist regardless.
“It believes that these issues need to be addressed if Ireland is to develop a robust housing sector capable of meeting current and future demands,” it said.
The committee recommended that housing protections such as Rent Pressure Zones need to be strengthened to protect tenants from being adversely affected by sharp increases in housing demand.
It also recommended that the Department of Housing should develop contingency plans for the short to medium term impacts on housing in the years following Brexit.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4′sToday programmereaching an agreement on issues such as the Ireland-Northern Ireland border will take some time, meaning an extension to Article 50 could be needed.
Hunt said the British government plans to assure the European Union it won’t use the border as a backdoor into the internal market and will demonstrate unconditional support for the Good Friday Agreement.
“If we ended up approving a deal in the days before 29 March then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation, but if we are able to make progress sooner than that might not be necessary.
“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen,” Hunt said.
On Tuesday, a majority of the House of Commons voted in favour of an amendment that proposes replacing the Irish backstop with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.
The Brady amendment garnered the support of 317 MPs, with 310 voting against it, in what was the most clear example of what kind of Brexit the UK parliament wants.
After the vote, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would take this mandate back to Brussels and use it as a crowbar to try to reopen the sealed Withdrawal Agreement, which the EU has repeatedly said it would not do.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has told May efforts to reopen the deal would be fruitless, and a spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk said something similar after the vote.
‘Delaying Brexit’

Two amendments to extend Article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline were rejected on Tuesday night; the idea of “delaying Brexit”, even to secure an orderly exit and avoid crashing out, is seen by MPs as an unfavourable option and unpopular with Brexit voters.
The EU would also have to approve a request for an extension, it’s not enough for the UK to just want it.
It’s been reported that the EU would have to be shown that the UK had a clear idea of why it wanted an extension – to hold a second referendum or to hold another Commons vote, would be two possible options.
Another amendment was also approved on Tuesday – this was the Spelman amendment that rules out a no-deal Brexit. This is impossible to do legally without agreement from the House of Commons on what kind of deal it does want.
The amendments hold no legal weight – they are a symbol of political will intended to strengthen May’s hand in directing Brexit.
Backstop
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the deal cannot be renegotiated. Varadkar previously aid a proposal for Stormont to have a veto over conditions attached to the backstopwould not be acceptable.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-cabinet-memo-4644269-May2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY is to tell his Cabinet colleagues of the need to continue preparations for a no-deal Brexit scenario.
While there has been a pause on Brexit news for a number of weeks, UK Prime Minister Theresa May saidover the weekendthat she is preparing to make a “bold offer” to MPs in one final attempt to get them to back her Brexit deal.
May said that when she brings the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before parliament early next month, it will come with a new package of measures attached that she hopes can command majority support.
Over the weekend, Coveney ruled out any renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Returning to the issue of Brexit today, the Tánaiste will bring a memo to Cabinet with a discussion on the current situation in Westminster likely to take place.

The memo, which will outline of the state of play in Brexit, is being brought against the backdrop of the breakdown in talks between the Conservatives and Labour in London.
Leo to meet Jeremy Corbyn
In light of the talks breaking down, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to have his first official meeting with British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Dublin in the next few weeks.
Coveney has previously stated that the collapse of Brexit compromise talks between the Conservatives and Labour in the UK was “a very negative” development for both Ireland and the EU.
Today’s Cabinet discussion will focus on the need to continue preparations in both the public and private sectors for a no-deal scenario, and the need for Irish businesses to obtain anEORI customs numbersin order to continue trading with the UK in a no-deal situation.
The Taoiseach and Tánaiste are set to emphasise that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation given its crucial role in protecting the peace process, the Common Travel Area, and avoiding any hard border.
They are also likely to point out that there is scope for further discussions between the EU and the UK, but only as part of talks on the future relationship.

IN JANUARY 2017 Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness announced his resignation as Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland bringing the, once-promising, power-sharing arrangement with the DUP to an acrimonious end.
In the two years since there has been:
During that time, the DUP became a vital prop keeping Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in power in the House of Commons and Martin McGuinness passed away.
Meanwhile, talks attempting to resolve the crisis have proved futile, the gates of Stormont remain shut and it doesn’t look like the padlocks will be removed anytime soon.

So, who is running the North?
With no functioning government for more than two years, the North is effectively being run by unelected civil servants who are operating with limited resources.
Westminster has twice passed budgets since the devolved institutions collapsed however it has stopped short of imposing direct rule from London.
The region has a recent history of being under direct rule. The latest period ran from 2002 until 2007 and it was in place for 26 years from 1972 until 1998 during the Troubles.

As the two-year anniversary passed on 9 January, both parties made positive sounding statements about supporting restoring the assembly but the political realities have not shifted and a deal looks as far away as ever.

Why can’t they agree to share power?
There have been several aborted efforts to reopen Stormont in the past two years. The most recent round of discussions got underway when Karen Bradley was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in January 2018.
A draft deal appeared to have been approved by all sides but itdramatically fell throughon Valentines Day. Sinn Féin blamed the DUP for the break down while the DUP said it could not agree to a standalone Irish Language Act, as was sought by their republican counterparts.
Language has routinely been a flash point between the two parties. Sinn Féin has been seeking the introduction of an Irish language Act (Acht na Gaeilge), which would give Irish equal status with English, for more than a decade.
While prominent DUP politicians havemocked Irishin the Northern Assembly and, party leader, Arlene Foster hasarguedthat there should be a Polish language act instead because she claims that more people in Northern Ireland speak Polish than Irish.

The two parties also, of course, have polar opposite views on the UK’s exit from the European Union.
Sinn Féin has called for a referendum on Irish unity in the event of a no-deal Brexit and it wants Northern Ireland to remain in the EU, while the DUP wants to leave and has insisted that the North must be treated exactly the same as the rest of the UK following the withdrawal.
What happens now?
In a bid to break the deadlock, Bradley announced in September that assembly members’ salaries were beingslashedby almost £14,000. She also ruled out calling an election despite being required to do under legislation.

“I have not believed and do not now believe that holding an election during this time of significant change and political uncertainty would be helpful or would increase the prospects of restoring the Executive,” she explained.
With the two largest parties at loggerheads over the role of the Irish language and on the opposite sides of the Brexit divide it appears as if they waiting to see how the UK’s withdrawal from the EU plays out before returning to local governance.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rte-brexit-financial-impact-4501952-Feb2019/,"RTÉ COULD ENJOY an advertising boost if UK-based channels are blocked from access to the Irish market in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
However the State broadcaster also warned that its “precarious” financial position was likely to take a further hit overall if the UK goes crashing out of the EU in late March.
In a briefing prepared for government officials and obtained byTheJournal.ie, RTÉ said a no-deal Brexit would likely create an “immediate and sharp decline” in its commercial revenue.
This would have a “very severe impact” on its already unstable financial state, the broadcaster added, after losing up to €6 million per year in potential commercial income since the Brexit vote due to reduced UK advertising budgets and the weaker pound.
“Like many sectors of the Irish economy, advertising in Ireland, particularly TV advertising, is heavily intertwined with the UK,” it said.
“Given the likely broader economic consequences of a ‘no deal’ scenario in both the UK and Ireland, there would likely be significantly increased risks to the broader advertising market.”
RTÉ said the shock would “threaten the viability” of its dual-funding model, which pairs commercial income with public funding from the licence fee.
RTÉ recorded an underlying deficit of €6.4 million last year, down from the €19.4 million loss it recorded in 2016.

But its commercial revenue, much of which comes from advertising, fell to €151.5 million from €158.2 million the previous year. This was offset by a €7 million increase in licence fee income.
RTÉ director general Dee Forbes has been pushing for the licence fee system to be overhauled, previously claiming that the broadcaster was missing out on €60 million in annual funding due to fee evasion and unnecessary exemptions.
However in the briefing document, RTÉ said significant restrictions on the availability of UK-based channels in Ireland in the case of a no-deal Brexit could benefit it and other local broadcasters due to increased viewers and advertising income.
“There are now over 50 channels that sell Irish advertising broadcasting in Ireland, many hosted in the UK and broadcast here on Sky, and many more channels that are accessible to Irish audiences,” it said.
RTÉ director general Dee Forbes and Finance Minister Paschal DonohoeRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Passporting rights
Hundreds of channels, including those from US media giants like Discovery and Disney, currently use their UK broadcast licences to reach audiences elsewhere in Europe under EU passporting rights.
In the case of a no-deal Brexit, they would need to obtain a licence in a EU member state or risk ‘going dark’ when the 29 March deadline passes.
Sky, which dominates the Irish pay-TV market,has contacted broadcasterswhose channels it carries to confirm their post-Brexit plans, although a spokeswoman said the company had no concerns about its ability to continue showing its full suite of channels.
Meanwhile, at least two international broadcasters are reported to be looking at Ireland as their post-Brexit EU bases with one already applying to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for a licence.
Related ReadsBrexit 66 days out, but Irish government says there are 'absolutely no preparations for a hard border'
The BBC has reportedly been in talks with both Irish and Dutch officials about the possibility of obtaining a local licence to avoid a potential Brexit blackout.
In its briefing document, RTÉ also flagged increased production costs and operational disruptions as headwinds if the UK failed to strike a favourable Brexit agreement.
“Large productions in Ireland, particularly TV drama and feature films, now typically involve cooperation and coproductions relationships with international productions companies, broadcasters and funders, many of whom are UK-based,” it said.
This raised questions about future investments in Ireland from British broadcasters, particularly with the lack of certainty surrounding trade and European funding rules.
RTÉ added that its operations would also “likely become more complex”, including for outside broadcasts that required cross-border or UK travel.
It said that security “particularly in Belfast and in Northern Ireland” was another possible concern.
“All of these elements combined mean that RTÉ (and its independent production suppliers) will be placed under a range of additional burdens as a result of a ‘no deal’ Brexit,” the broadcaster said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-9-4513794-Feb2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that the House of Commons will hold a series of meaningful votes in the next few weeks to decide what form Brexit will take, including a potential vote on whether to delay Brexit.
It comes as her talks with the EU have so far failed to reach any breakthrough on the Irish backstop, which is vehemently opposed by members within her own party and the DUP.
She told the house today that, on or before Tuesday 12 March, a meaningful vote will be held on her withdrawal agreement with the EU. If parliament votes in favour of that, the UK will leave the EU with the deal in place.
If that withdrawal agreement is voted down, there will be another vote on Wednesday 13 March. This time, MPs will be asked whether or not they want to leave the EU without a deal.
If the House of Commons votes against a no-deal Brexit, however, there will be yet another vote held.
On Thursday 14 March, she said the government will table an amendment to seek a “short, limited extension to Article 50″. Extending Article 50 would mean that the UK does not leave the EU on 29 March, as it is currently set to do.
It has been reported that this would only be extended to late June/July.
She also said that her government would today publish a paper assessing the UK’s readiness for a no-deal Brexit.
“I believe if we have to we’d ultimately make a success of a no deal,” she said, to derision from the opposition benches. May added her preference is for her withdrawal agreement to pass through the House of Commons in the first vote on or before Tuesday 12 March.

The Prime Minister also took aim at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who yesterday signalled his backing for a second referendum.
She said: “He has gone back on his promise to honour the referendum… It would bring us right back to square one.”
Corbyn shot back that May’s further delay to a meaningful vote on Brexit was “grotesquely reckless” and was a “deliberate running down of the clock”.
“The withdrawal agreement is not being reopened,” he said. “She’s kicking the can down the road, but the road is running out.”
Corbyn added that if May’s deal in the first meaningful vote is approved, then it should be put to a “confirmatory” public vote.
Labour reaction in Ireland
Meanwhile, Labour party leader Brendan Howlin told reporters today that after meeting his UK counterpart in the UK Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend, he is pleased that Corbyn is now backing a new public vote on the Brexit deal.
He said the withdrawal agreement on the table is the best deal – but added that if there is “a real prospect” that the UK might not leave the EU after a second referendum, then the Irish government should “not be so wedded” to the idea of the withdrawal agreement “that they lose sight” of what a second referendum might achieve.
Howlin said the push for a second referendum is it will give the British public a chance to be presented with the final deal that has been negotiated and the choice to remain in the EU.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/seaborne-freight-contract-4489089-Feb2019/,"THE UK’S TRANSPORT Secretary Chris Grayling is coming under pressure after it was revealed that his department had spent public money on the Seaborne Freight contract.
The British government awarded contracts worth £103 million to three companies to operate ferries in a no-deal Brexit scenario. They were Brittany Ferries, DFDS, and Seaborne Freight.
Seaborne Freight, which was incorporated in April 2017, was later discovered to own no ships. It was also revealed that the terms and conditions on its website also seemed to be copied and pasted from those related to a food delivery company.
At the weekend, it was announced that the £13.8 million contract awarded to Seaborne Freight was to be terminated.
National Audit OfficeNational Audit Office
A Transport spokesperson said that Seaborne had an Irish backer, Arklow Shipping, which had “suddenly and unexpectedly” withdrew its support last week.
“At the time of the award, we were fully aware of Seaborne’s status as a startup business and the need for Seaborne to procure vessels and port-user agreements in order to deliver a service,” Grayling explained to the House of Commons yesterday.

He said that he had “to refrain from saying anything” about plans to obtain ships, as it could have increased the prices for the vessels they had intended to purchase. Grayling said that as of last week, there were “firm options for ships”.
“However late last week, despite previous assurances, Arklow Shipping suddenly and unexpectedly withdrew their backing from Seaborne. In light of this, and after very careful assessment, I took the decision to terminate this contract.”

Grayling also indicated last night that no public money had been spent on the Seaborne contract.
But last night,a report by the UK’s National Audit Officeshowed that at least £800,000 had been spent analysing the three contract bids:
This has increased pressure on the transport minister over the disastrous contract bid.
The report also showed that military vehicles were considered as an option in the UK’s no-deal planning for ports.
“Recommended that department explores this, recognising that Ministry of Defence may have limited spare capacity,” the report says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-ireland-4471340-Feb2019/,"
THERE ARE LESS than 60 days until 29 March, which is the date by which the UK must legally leave the European Union.
The EU 27 member states have approved the Withdrawal Agreement, which sets out the terms by which the UK will leave the EU. The next stage of negotiations – if we get there – would be about what its post-Brexit relationship would be (that includes trade, customs rules, etc).
But the UK parliament has rejected the Brexit deal, with many Tory MPs citing the backstop as their reason for doing so.
Therefore, if the EU sticks to their word that there will be no renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the UK stands firm on wanting the backstop altered, then we’re in for a no-deal Brexit.
If this happens, it’s the worst case scenario for all countries involved. Here’s what it would mean for Ireland, based on what is predicted about an unprecedented situation.
Some things will be more expensive
In the event of a no-deal Brexit,at 11pm on 29 March, the trade relationship between the UK and the EU will shift from free trade and shared customs rules under the Single Market and the Customs Union, to World Trade Organisation tariffs which are the most basic trade rules.
The implied tariffs on UK to EU exports werepublished byMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe this week: meat, cereals, sugars and sweets, tobacco, processed meat and fish, dairy, eggs, honey, and flour all have WTO tariffs of over 25%.
GIAN EHRENZELLERGIAN EHRENZELLER
Processed fruit and veg, animal feed, cocoa and chocolate, clothes and footwear all have tariffs of over 10%.
Customs checks would also add additional costs for goods being imported to Ireland.
“A lot of attention is being put on the cost of tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” says Shane Hamill, overseas trade manager with Bord Bia, “but not on the price of customs.”
At the DCU Brexit Institute event on Agrifood this week, he said that there could be a customs charge of €25 to €50 per consignment.
“Food and drinks products would have 100% ID checks and 100% documentation checks according to EU rules… physical checks would be carried out on 50% of dairy products.”
In short, this means that products coming from the UK will be more expensive.
A government report found that “Ireland imports considerably more from the UK than any of the other EU-27… with this difference more explicit for imports than for exports.”
UK imports to Ireland account for24% of its total imports, which compares with Ireland making up 13% of the UK’s total exports. The monetary value of those are narrower than expressed in percentage terms, though: imports to the UK are worth over $18.4 billion.
Department of FinanceDepartment of Finance
Tariffs will hit Irish businesses that rely on exports to the UK: by 2023,there would be an estimated 55,000 fewer jobsunder a no-deal Brexit and the economy will be growing at a slower rate.
Medicines should be fine
The Oireachtas health committee heard this week that the HSE’s Brexit planning group has been putting contingency plans in place since 2017. The heads of a bill that would allow for a continuation of treatment abroad and cross border treatment schemes have already been drafted.
Department of Health Secretary General Jim Breslin said that the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been working to ensure the supply of medication is secure.
He said the pharma industry has assured the authority that it will have sufficient stocks to “bridge any initial issues” at ports. Breslin said there is no need for hospitals to increase orders or for doctors to issue any additional prescriptions.
A small number of companies in the UK that supply the Irish market have not yet made the necessary regulatory changes, but the HPRA has said it will have sufficient alternatives available in many cases.

And regulators here and in the UK are already putting systems in place to ensure qualifications for medical staff remain workable. After Brexit, the UK will be third country and workers will lose the automatic recognition of their qualifications in EU countries.
Breslin said the Nursing and Midwifery Board here will ensure applications from nurses trained in the UK will be dealt with in the current timeframe.
Planes are a grey area
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Some flight operators could lose their licenses to fly in Europe if too large a proportion of the company is registered or based in the UK – including Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus’ parent company IAG has been told this month that its plans to continue flying around Europe after Brexit won’t work. European carriers have to be 50% EU-owned and controlled to be allowed to fly within the bloc, which will be a struggle for the company.
IAG were going to cite trusts and companies to get around this, according to the Irish Times, but it’s not certain that this will get them the approval it needs.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, IAG said: “We are confident that we will comply with the EU and the UK ownership and control rules post-Brexit.”
Meanwhile, London and Brussels are making contingency plans to allow UK carriers to continue flying to EU countries even if the draft withdrawal agreement is never approved – but these are bare-bones arrangements that do not allow British airlines to conduct intra-EU flights.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that “a skeleton arrangement” would be put in place: this would ensure that planes could fly out of British airports by maintaining the safety certification beyond 29 March on a temporary basis.
“It becomes a much more different business model for non-EU aircraft coming out of the UK… it is not a pretty picture,” said Coveney.
Non-EU airlines flying from Britain would only be able to fly in and out, or point-to-point (this means they could fly to Paris and back to London again, but not to Paris and onto Madrid). That means fewer options for Irish consumers.
Phone charges will also change for the UK: if you’re near the border, be careful of extra roaming charges as the free roaming introduced through an EU directive won’t apply for those in Northern Ireland.
The border is even more grey
A defaced road sign welcoming motorists to Northern Ireland.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
For Ireland, the border area is the most confusing part of a no-deal Brexit.
The EU, UK and Ireland have all committed to avoiding a border, including in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But it’s difficult to see how this can be done if Northern Ireland and Ireland are two different jurisdictions in relation to customs checks and regulations.
But, in the European Commission’s published plans for a no-deal Brexit, it had this interesting line about animal checks between the EU and UK:
“In case of no-deal, simplified border controls (limited to documentary checks, for instance) will apply to live animals and animal products coming from a Member State but transiting through the UK.
The value of the EU’s Single Market is the high standard of goods being able to be shared between multiple countries – if a third country (ie, the UK) were able to introduce goods to that market below the standard that the EU deems acceptable, it taints it.
So this suggests that there would have to be some checks or infrastructure at the border; although MPs have suggested that checks could be carried out at the point of origin instead of at the border itself.
For the past year, the EUhas been working on estimationsfor what different types of borders for the island of Ireland could cost, but weren’t willing to share the details of those costs. If there were to be a border, it would have to be built by Ireland and reimbursed by the EU, it is understood.
The Irish government has denied that there are any plans to build a border on the island of Ireland.
Revenuehas also saidthat it’s not planning for customs posts along the border with Northern Ireland, but are preparing for a massive increase in import and export declaration forms.
It’s expecting an increase from 1.7 million last year to in the region of 20 million after Brexit. Land has also been acquired around Dublin Port and airports in order to prepare for additional customs and regulatory checks, if it comes to a no-deal Brexit.
There’s alsoa long list of legislationthat will need to be passed in the event of a no-deal Brexit – other proposed bills will have to be put to one side to fast-track Brexit-related preparations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pet-travel-no-deal-brexit-4532710-Mar2019/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT has issued advice to pet owners who plan to travel to the UK with their cat, dog or ferret after 29 March and the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
The Department for Agriculture Food and the Marinehas issued advicethat covers three scenarios: going on holiday in Great Britain with your pet, moving to Great Britain with your pet, or travelling from Great Britain to Ireland with your pet.
In all cases, it’s advised pet owners looking to travel should contact a vet as soon as possible before setting off to make sure all necessary arrangements are in place.
With the UK due to leave the European Union on 29 March, a no-deal scenario is more likely than ever. A series of votes are to happen in the House of Commons next week where it’s hoped will clarify what UK parliamentarians want, in order to break the current political deadlock.
Meanwhile, the UK Attorney General and the EU are trying to hammer parts of the current Brexit Withdrawal Agreement into a shape that would be slightly more pleasing to British politicians, without changing the essence of the deal, which has been approved by the other 27 EU member states, including Ireland.
So, in a no-deal Brexit scenario,if you’re travelling to Great Britain on holidays with your pet and returning to Ireland, your pet dog/cat/ferret must:
*For return to Ireland, you’ll need an EU pet passport (not a UK-issued EU pet passport) or an EU health cert issued by a UK government vet. You willnotbe able to return to Ireland on an EU pet passport issued in the UK, but youshould hold onto a UK-issued pet passport if you have one, as it may have important information about vaccinations and other treatments.

**You must wait at least 30 days after the rabies vaccine was administered before the blood test can be carried out.
This is because if the test is administered in Great Britain after 29 March, the pet would have to waitthree monthsfrom the date the successful rabies titration test was carried out before it can travel to Ireland.

If you’removing to Great Britain with your pet and not returning to Ireland,the situation is mostly in the UK’s hands, so you might need to wait and see what kind of Brexit we get, and what the UK government says you’ll need to enter.
The UK Government have indicated that pet travel rules for entry into the UK may not change for some time after Brexit, but you must check withthe UK authorities for the latest information.
If you’retravelling from Great Britain to Ireland with your pet,your dog/cat/ferret must:
**You must wait at least 30 days after the rabies vaccine was administered before the blood test can be carried out. If the test is administered in Great Britain after 29 March, the pet would have to waitthree monthsfrom the date the successful rabies titration test was carried out before it can travel to Ireland.
***You will not be able to travel to the EU on an EU pet passport issued in the UK, but you should hold on to a UK-issued pet passport if you have one, as it may have important information about vaccinations and other treatments.

“WE ARE APPROACHING the position of a hard Brexit,” according to Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, following today’s Cabinet meeting which focused on Brexit.
This morning, Donohoe said he met heads of Revenue, NTMA, Central Bank and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to discuss their Brexit preparations this morning.
He told reporters that a no deal will have a “sudden, immediate and negative effect”, but added that the economy is prepared and able to withstand a “sudden adverse shock”.
“We are ready to act,” he added in a defiant tone, stating that preparations have been long underway.
His comments come as Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are still deadlocked just a day before a crucial meaningful vote in the House of Commons.
Yet again, this week will see the spotlight squarely on Westminster with MPs set to determine the course of the UK’s future with a series of crucial votes on Brexit.

There are less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney appeared to confirm today that British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Strasbourg this evening, however others state that her travel plans have not been locked down as of yet.
He said he hoped May and Jean Claude Juncker could reach agreement, though he said there are obstacles that still need to be overcome.
Coveney added that this is not a case of the UK versus Europe, stating that “nobody is looking to trap anybody anywhere”.
While the message about the impacts on Ireland were stark, Coveney remains hopeful that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided, though he admits, no one knows what may come.
“We can’t be sure, of course, of anything in Westminster these days,” he said, adding that it is about putting together a package of measures that can give reassurances to the UK.

Speaking to reporters in Dublin earlier today, Varadkar said:
“As I’ve always said, no deal is not a threat that the European Union or Ireland is making. The 29 March is a self-imposed deadline. The UK parliament can take the threat of no-deal off the table at any time.
“If there is going to be an extension though, it has to be an extension with a purpose, and nobody across the European Union wants to see a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions get put off until the end of April, then until the end of May and then maybe until the end of July,” he said.
Varadkar added that the prospect of the House of Commons vote being called off in favour of a new one “misses the point”.
“I do hear some suggestion that the vote may be called off in favour of a new vote as a result of which the House of Commons would tell the EU what they want, that really misses the point. It’s far too late for the UK to tell us what they want.

Deadlock
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
However, despite numerous talks with the EU since then, little has changed in the withdrawal agreement with the Irish government and Brussels refusing to back down on the backstop.
Downing Street has said that talks between the EU and UK are still deadlocked, theBBC has reported.
It said that May spoke with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last night after a weekend of negotiations failed to find a breakthrough.
While there were reports that there would be delays, it is understood that MPs will tomorrow vote again on May’s Withdrawal Agreement.
There are a number of different ways the vote could go. We’ve laid out all the possibilities here:
‘Dreadful’
Yesterday, the former Brexit secretary David Davis said Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal is “dreadful” and, in a way, worse than the UK’s current EU membership.
“Frankly this deal is worse than current membership in one sense because we can’t get out of it,” he told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
He said that it was “a dreadful deal on many, many counts”, but added that if the UK could leave the backstop whenever it chooses, that it might be “rescuable”.
“I would love to be able to vote for it, if she gets the ability to pull out,” he said.
Davis said that EU leaders were “shocked” after the deal was rejected, and “that the language changed”.
“The tenor of the language changed. Mr Varadkar’s language changed, Mr Juncker’s language changed, Mr Tusk’s… and then all of a sudden, three Cabinet ministers said ‘You’ve got to take no-deal off the table’, ‘You’ve got to have an extension’, and then it went back to being hard again.”
Davis also said that he’s not hoping for a no-deal Brexit, but that it needs to be kept as a viable option “because it’s what keeps bringing the European Union back”.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier repeated on Friday that the bloc could offer a legally binding statement confirming the backstop was only meant to be temporary.
But this offer from Barnier is unlikely to be enough.
“It is inevitable this unchanged withdrawal agreement will be voted down again,” two senior Brexit-supporting MPs, Steve Baker and Nigel Dodds, warned yesterday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-is-brexit-advancing-the-cause-of-scottish-independence-from-the-uk-4525351-Mar2019/,"GIVEN THE CALAMITOUS state of the UK’s negotiation of its withdrawal from the European Union, the fairly comprehensive Brexit referendum result in Scotland, and the relatively small gap in the opinion polling evidence on Scottish independence, you could be forgiven for wondering – ‘what are the Scots waiting for’?
However, closer inspection of the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) handling of Brexit, considered alongside some of the tensions on ‘home turf’ exposes a real strategic paradox for the SNP.
The SNP leaderNicola Sturgeon regularlysays that she will announce plans for a second independence referendum, but has yet to do so.
During the independence referendum in 2014, Scots were warned that by voting in favour of independence they would be putting at risk their membership of the EU and the SNP won the Scottish Parliament election on a manifesto commitment that said that if Brexit were to go ahead they would push for another independence referendum.
That is if Scotland were to be ‘dragged’ out of the EU against its will (which it will be), and the views of the Scottish Government or Scottish Parliament are ignored, they would have grounds to demand a re-run of the independence referendum.
But the problem is that support for independence has not really increased beyond its 2014 level of 45% – and the appetite for another vote is fairly low.
Much to the disbelief and angst of many in the SNP’s, they do not appear to be any closer to winning such a vote, even in the extraordinary political times we’re living in.
The reality for the SNP, since 24 June 2016, has been far from straightforward and rife with strategic indecisiveness.
To make sense of this, it’s important to consider the parallel universe the SNP was hoping for as opposed to the one in which it now finds itself.
Challenges
When Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland in 2014, there was supposed to be a well-deserved break from the previous two years of independence-mania.
Her focus was to be on governing Scotland and taking the time (a long time) to examine the detailed reasons for their narrow defeat.
The problem with this strategy was that the membership of the SNP doubled as a result of the independence referendum and many of those members are itching for another ballot.
Nicola Sturgeon shares this woe with any nationalist leader in power – the need to reconcile the two, often mutually exclusive imperatives of governing domestically but advancing constitutional nationalism for your base.
Fast forward to the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, just two months before the EU referendum, and just a year after the unprecedented whitewash result for the SNP in the 2015 General Election.
Nicola Sturgeon is returned as First Minister with a greater share of the vote, albeit with fewer seats, on a manifesto which neatly dealt with the issue of independence.
Whilst the time was not yet right for another vote, if the situation were to materially change, for example by Scotland voting to remain in the EU but the rest of the UK voting to leave, then it would be a different story.
Of course, the problem arose when that material change, well, materialised.
The maths
Rushed into making a political decision in a matter of hours that would ultimately define her career, Nicola Sturgeon fired the starting gun on independence in the hope that the national sense of outrage and injustice would see a surge in the polls for a ‘Yes’ vote on Scottish independence.
But other than a brief increase to 59% the Sunday immediately after the vote, such a surge has not transpired.
Since then the SNP has found itself navigating a set of tricky currents in the ‘Yes’ movement.
There are some within the party who believe the chaos of a ‘no deal’ Brexit could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for many soft Scottish Unionists who voted Remain.
But then there are others who believe that the movement has not learned the lessons from the previous effort, and isn’t prepared for another vote.
The voter arithmetic is very complex.
One of the main problems is that one in three SNP voters actually voted to leave the European Union, and almost a quarter of those voters, knowing the SNP’s policy is for an Independent Scotland to immediately rejoin the EU have now switched their allegiance to a UK outside the EU.
Contrary to initial expectations, the so-called“Yes Leavers”(those who voted in favour of independence from both the UK and the EU) have offset the soft Remain ‘No’ voters who now favour independence in order to stay in the EU.
Those two cohorts have effectively replaced each other, meaning there has been little or no overall swing in favour of independence.
This dilemma explains the same constructive ambiguity on independence that the SNP has used to batter the Labour leadership on its Brexit position – although this ambiguity caused the SNP significant losses in the 2017 snap General Election.
As such, the SNP position on Brexit has evolved alongside its thinking on independence.
At one point, the First Minister travelled to London to make the case for what effectively formed the basis of Tory backbencher, Nick Boles’Norway Plus model,which envisaged that Britain could leave the EU but remain in the single market.
But when that proposal eventually got to the House of Commons some Scottish National Party MPs refused to back it.
Now the SNP’s favoured Brexit route is another referendum or People’s Vote.
Many in the party are deeply uncomfortable with this position given that it’s a slippier slope than Ben Nevis on a cold day because of the likely difficulties in successfully negotiating a Scottish withdrawal agreement from the UK.
Scottish Independence in the context of Brexit is Nicola Sturgeon’s Schrödinger’s Cat – it’s both alive and dead depending on who you ask.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has delivered a last-ditch attempt speech to the House of Commons ahead of tomorrow’s crucial Brexit vote.
On the eve of the vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, May is looking likely to lose the vote, with an audit by the Guardian predicting she will lose by423 votes to 216.
Tory MP Gareth Johnson also todayresigned as the government whip.
Speaking to the House of Commons this evening, May urged MPs to “give this deal a second look”.
“No, it is not perfect and yes it is a compromise but when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this house tomorrow and ask did we deliver on the country’s vote to leave the European Union, did we safeguard our economy, our security and our Union or did we let the British people down?” May said.

Earlier today, the president of the European Council Donald Tusk and president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker published their “reassurance” letters to May.
On the backstop,Juncker and Barnier saidthat if the backstop were to come into force that it would be a “suboptimal trading agreement for both sides”.
The letter also says that the Withdrawal Agreement and backstop “do not affect or supersede the provisions of the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement… in any way whatsoever”.
It also does not “extend regulatory alignment with European Union law in Northern Ireland beyond what is strictly necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland”.
Speaking to the House this evening, May acknowledged that some MPs would like a unilateral exit mechanism or a solid end-date for the backstop.

However, she admitted the EU would not agree to put a time limit on the backstop.
“The EU would not agree to this because they fear that such a provision could allow the UK to leave the backstop at any time without any other arrangements in place and require a hard border to be erected between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” May said.
“I have been very clear with them that this is not something we would ever countenance, that the UK is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast Agreement and would never allow a return to a hard border.”
She went on to describe the backstop as a “last resort”.

Backstop worries
In an effort to soothe Brexiteers’ concerns about the timeframe of the backstop, the EU leaders confirm that the backstop would be temporary:
“The European Council also said that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered (sic), it would only apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided.”

May told MPs in the House this evening that the best way to avoid a hard border is through sorting out the future relationship.
She said that it is her “absolute conviction” that Britain can turn the “political declaration” agreed with the EU into legal text and avoid the need for the backstop.
Speaking this evening about tomorrow’s vote in the House of Commons, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that he hoped the vote would pass but that he did not wish to interfere.
“I don’t think it would be in Ireland’s interest for me to be interfering in their internal politics,” Varadkar said, adding that he has “no desire to threaten the union”.
Varadkar went on to say that he believes a no-deal Brexit is “unlikely” but that the government must be prepared nonetheless.
“We will be prepared, but I’m not going to say to you that everything is going to be fine, of course there will be interruptions and negative impact but we’ll be as prepared as we possibly can be.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-confidence-vote-3-4444209-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Jan 2019
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has delivered a nighttime Downing Street speech, saying it is her duty to deliver Brexit.
May’s address was carried live on BBC, Sky News and ITV at 10pm, three hours after her government survived a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons.
The motion of no confidence was tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn but it was defeated by 306 votes to 325, a majority of 19.
In her address, May said this result allowed her government to “focus on finding a way forward on Brexit.”
She also acknowledged that the British public is becoming increasingly concerned about the Brexit deadlock.
“I understand that to people getting on with their lives away from Westminster, the events of the past 24 hours will have been unsettling,” she said.
“I believe it is my duty to deliver on the British people’s instruction to leave the European Union and I intend to do so.”
May also outlined that she wants to work with other parties in parliament to plot a way forward.
“So now that MPs have made clear what they don’t want, we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want,” May said.
“That’s why I’m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward. One that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament, this is now the time to put self-interest aside.”
“I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour party has so far chosen not to take part, but our door remains open. It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,” May added.
Speaking earlier in the House of Commons when May first spoke about involving other party leaders, Corbyn said that she must first rule out a no-deal Brexit before he takes part.
“The government must remove, clearly, once and for all the prospect of a no-deal Brexit from the EU and all the chaos that would come from that,” Corbyn said.
Speaking before Corbyn in the Commons, May said that she was “pleased that this house has expressed its confidence in the government”.

The motion of no confidence was tabled after the UKgovernment was roundly defeated in the voteon May’s proposed Brexit Withdrawal Agreement last night.
In last night’s vote, May lost by 230 votes after a third of her Conservative Party’s MPs voted against her deal, but in tonight’s vote the Tory rebels backed her.

May also regained the support of the DUP’s 10 MPs who back her government as part of a confidence and supply agreement.
The DUP voted en masse against the Withdrawal Agreement but party leader Arlene Foster confirmed last night that they would back May in tonight’s confidence vote.
The DUP’s Nigel Dodds MP said after the vote that it demonstrated the importance of the confidence and supply arrangement.
Contingency plans
Meanwhile in Dublin at tonight’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the government will continue to hold their position and nerve in relation to Brexit.
The Fine Gael leader said we should have a better indication of the UK’s position by next Monday.
He said contingency planning is now being implemented and encouraged all businesses to engage with it.
The Taoiseach added the government does have authorisation to use public funds to help industry sectors that are left exposed if a hard Brexit occurred.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said European leaders have made it clear they will not facilitate a change to the Withdrawal Agreement and the EU will respond as a collective when the UK’s position is clearer.
After last night’s defeat, May is required to present some form of plan B to the Commons by Monday.
Since 1900 there have been only three occasions when a government has lost a vote of confidence – twice in 1924 and once in 1979. The last time a confidence motion was formally tabled in the Commons was in 1993.
Then, too, it was due to a row over Europe and Conservative prime minister John Major won by 40 votes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/angela-merkel-leo-varadkar-northern-ireland-4577142-Apr2019/,"ANGELA MERKEL WAS given a history lesson about Northern Ireland from people who live along the border region while visiting Dublin today.
Ahead of the formal meeting, Merkel and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar participated in a roundtable discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the border area.
The 15 member panel comprised Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists, from the border region north and south.
Members of the public who live along the border area shared their personal experiences and perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on border communities and businesses.
These included a peace worker in Belfast who lost close family members in a bomb attack, a Unionist farmer and haulier from Inishowen in Donegal and a GP from Inishowen who now lives in Derry.
Some of the people had direct personal experience of the conflict before the Good Friday Agreement.
Aware of what is at stake
Speaking alongside Varadkar this afternoon, Merkel said a solution to maintaining an open border must be found, stating that she is aware of what is at stake.
The Merkel visit attracted the world’s media to Dublin, with many caught up in their country’s own concerns in the Brexitshambles.
Pool Picture / Rollingnews.iePool Picture / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
The German journalists (after being left in dismay at how it can take 45 minutes to travel through Dublin traffic to Farmleigh) asked about what their Chancellor thought of UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans along with a domestic issue surrounding some famous paintings.
Meanwhile British journalists were wondering what Merkel thought of the play-acting in Westminster (although one British journalist in the press room seemed rather concerned on the telephone while discussing the possibility that Irish potatoes wouldnot be allowed to be imported into the UK).
The impact on real lives
But the Northern Ireland community group were clear. They believe one message is the most important.

“This impacts on human beings”, they told reporters.
Standing in the pouring rain outside Farmleigh House, the seven-strong group said that is the message they want Merkel to take back to Europe.
While economics might be important, the human aspect and life on the border regions should be protected, they said.
That is the message that should be conveyed to the European Council meeting next week and should be “central” to any discussions about reaching a solution to the impasse.

Peter Sheridan, chief executive of Co-operation Ireland and a former assistant chief constable with the PSNI, who mediated the meeting said the Chancellor absolutely understood the personal messages that people gave her.
”You also couldn’t help but be impressed about the range of people around that table today who were there speaking about their own personal experiences.
“I have no doubt that the chancellor went away well-informed about the impact and the ‘people part’ of this, not just the technical part of it – we’re trying to put people in the middle of all this.
Seriousness of the border issue
Patricia MacBride, a Magistrate in Derry, and a former Commissioner for Victims and Survivors of the Northern Ireland conflict, said it was clear from their meeting with Merkel today that she understood the seriousness of the border issue.
“Particularly given her own experience prior to German reunification,” she said, adding that during their meeting with the chancellor it was clear she also understood the challenges a hard border can bring.
It was an experience that Merkel mentioned later in the press conference with Varadkar.
“I personally come, after all, from a country that for many years was divided by a wall,” the Chancellor said.
Journalist and broadcaster, Dearbhail McDonald, who also attended today, said Merkel obviously did not tell the group how Europe plan to proceed going forward in the Brexit talks but said the chancellor took away with her the importance of the customs union and single market, in terms of the North.
Merkel later described the meeting with those living in Northern Ireland as “moving”, stating that she learnt about what it “means for their life” living on the border, adding that it will “encourage” her to ensure the “peaceful” Good Friday Agreement is upheld.
She said today’s meeting was a very “important experience”. Will it be something she carries with her into the European Council meeting next week. We will have to wait and see, as Brexit goes down to the wire.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said undoing any of the progress made in Northern Ireland in recent years would be “an absolute horror”.
Speaking in Belfast this afternoon, May said she remains committed to the Good Friday Agreement and against a hard border returning between the North and the Republic of Ireland.
“I’m here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the UK Government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.”
May said her commitment to preventing a hard border is “unshakeable”.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald was critical of May’s speech, saying she and the Conservative Party have put the “demands of Brexiteers” above the needs of people in Ireland – north and south.
A spokesperson for the Irish government was more positive about the speech, but raised concerns about “unrealistic expectations regarding what can be achieved” in relation to the backstop element of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.
In her speech, May said she was 12 years old when the Troubles in Northern Ireland began and was 41 when the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was signed in 1998.
She said violence has not been eliminated in the North but has been reduced to levels not deemed possible in the past. She said she is committed to getting the Northern Ireland Executive back up and running – over two years after it collapsed in January 2017.
May said undoing the progress made by political parties and members of the public alike would be “an absolute horror”. She added that she wants to keep working with people from across the political divide to further strengthen the relationship between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.
“I want to work closely with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Irish government to strengthen the bilateral relationship we have built,” she said.
May spoke about the shared history of the UK and Ireland, and cited the inclusive way the Easter Rising centenary was commemorated as an indicator of how far relations have progressed in recent years. She also described a joint bid by the UK and Ireland to host the 2030 football World Cup as “tantalising”.
Backstop
May said Britain leaving the European Union poses “unique challenges” to Northern Ireland and she knows people living there and in the Republic are understandably “anxious” about the outcome of Brexit – as it is there many of its effects will be most keenly felt.
She said the backstop element of the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the EU was needed as an “insurance policy” to guarantee no return to a hard border in the event of a deal not being reached before the official withdrawal date of 29 March.
May said she “fought hard to make the case for the deal as it stands” but has accepted that Members of Parliament will not back it unless legal assurances are made in terms in of the backstop. The deal was rejected in the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 last month.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Last week, a majority of the House of Commons voted in favour of an amendment that proposes replacing the backstop with unspecified “alternative arrangements”. The Brady Amendment garnered the support of 317 MPs, with 310 voting against it.

Irish unity
In a statement released this evening, McDonald said May’s speech was a “step backwards” and “full of old rhetoric and no solutions”.
“Last week in Westminster, Theresa May effectively binned the Withdrawal Agreement that she negotiated,” the Sinn Féin leader said.
“This agreement included the backstop that she knows is essential to protect our agreements, our economy and the rights of citizens. Mrs May acted in bad faith.
McDonald noted that a majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU (55.8%), saying May “does not speak for the people of the North in relation to Brexit”.
“The Good Friday Agreement must be protected in all of its parts. And in the event of a hardening of the border, the people of Ireland must be given the opportunity to remove it through an Irish unity referendum,” she said.
McDonald and other Sinn Féin representatives are due to meet May in Stormont tomorrow.
A spokesperson for the Irish government welcomed May restating her commitment to avoiding a hard border.
“Her statement about the need to recognise shared identities in Northern Ireland was especially welcome,” they noted.
However, the spokesperson added that the government still has “concerns about unrealistic expectations regarding what can be achieved regarding the backstop”.
“The EU position is clear and not for changing. There is scope to adjust the political declaration but not the Withdrawal Agreement,” they said.
David Trimble
Former First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble is planning to take the British governmentto court over the backstop– claiming it would undermine the Good Friday Agreement by imposing a ‘top-down’ bureaucratic structure on the island of Ireland.
A spokesperson for the former Ulster Unionist Party leader, now a member of the House of Lords, said last night that he planned to initiate judicial review proceedings to ensure that the backstop protocol “is removed from the Withdrawal Agreement”.
Speakingto BBC Radio 4′s Today programmeTrimble said he was concerned at the way the agreement “turns the Belfast Agreement on its head”.
“The bit of the agreement you have to handle with care is cross-border arrangements, and we have to do that successfully.
Trimble, who received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside SDLP leader John Hume for his work on the 1998 agreement, said that the backstop had originated as a result of fears in Brussels that “Ireland could become a back door whereby goods that don’t meet their regulatory standards come in”.
Speaking today, May noted that the Good Friday Agreement enshrines the “consent” principle whereby Irish people have their say over any constitutional changes, adding that this will ”forever be honoured” by the British government.
Varadkar and his EU counterparts have repeatedly said the Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated. The Taoiseach previously said a proposal for Stormont to have a veto over conditions attached to the backstopwould not be acceptable.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of 29 March.
Last week, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the British government may seek an extension to Article 50 in a bid to secure a deal.

THE EUROPEAN UNION is prepared to give Britain further Brexit guarantees to help a divorce deal through the British parliament, the bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in an interview published today
“We can find guarantees to confirm, clarify, guarantee the goodwill and good faith of the Europeans with commitments which would have real legal force,” Barnier said in comments published in several European newspapersincluding Die Weltin Germany and Les Echos in France.
Barnier also suggested European leaders would be amenable to a short “technical” delay in Britain’s departure from the EU, scheduled for 29 March, to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final divorce deal.
The British parliament rejected the original Brexit deal hammered out by Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders.
With the Irish backstopbeing the biggest obstacle to agreement in parliament, Barnier said there was “misunderstanding” over the proposed backstop deal.
He said it would not
“Limiting it in time or introducing a unilateral exit clause would call into question its credibility,” the EU’s top Brexit negotiator insisted.
The backstop “will end either when we have a global agreement on the future relationship, or a specific agreement with Ireland,” he said, assuring it “was never the wish” to bind Britain to European trade rules indefinitely.
Meetings next week
Barnier said he would meet Britain’s Brexit minister Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox next week to discuss options.
A Brussels source said those talks could take place in the Belgian capital on Tuesday.

“There is a way that the British (parliament) could vote, between now and March 12th, with these guarantees of our good faith, It will be up to them to fulfil their responsibilities,” Barnier said.
In 2017, the UL invoked Article 50 of EU law, triggering a two-year countdown to Brexit that ends at 11pm on 29 March
It is on course to leave without an agreement after British MPs in January overwhelmingly rejected the divorce deal May struck with the EU late last year.
The embattled leader is now seeking changes to the pact which she hopes will be enough to get it through parliament by 12 March 12.
In a revised strategy unveiled this week, May vowed that if her deal is rejected, lawmakers will vote in the following days on whether to leave without a deal or delay Brexit.
But European leaders have warned any postponement would come with conditions.
Barnier suggested a short delay could be acceptable.
“The European institutions will do whatever is necessary on their side but the British have told us in the past that they will need two months to ratify” the deal.
“It would then require a simple technical extension.”
While Britain is yet to request a delay, “I don’t think there would be any objections in principle” from the other 27 EU nations, Barnier said.
However, any delay “must serve to solve a problem, not merely to postpone it and remain at an impasse.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-barnier-backstop-deal-4524009-Mar2019/,"FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has set out plans to overhaul the EU in following the UK’s decision to leave the bloc.
In an opinion piece published inThe Guardianand 27 other newspapers, Macron outlined his vision for Europe’s future, urging reform of its passport-free Schengen area and setting up a new agency “for the protection of democracies” against cyber-attacks and fake news.
It comes just weeks before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.
“Never since the Second World War has Europe been so necessary. And yet never has Europe been in such a danger,” Macron wrote.
In January, Macron had suggested that the Brexit campaign – which saw Britain vote to leave the EU – was “manipulated from the exterior by a lot of what we call fake news”.
Writing in his opinion piece, Macron said: “Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples’ need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world. It also symbolises the European trap. The trap lies not in being part of the European Union; the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it.
Macron, who has made no secret of his plans to form a centrist, pro-Europe alliance to stave off populist and nationalist movements which have been gaining ground across the continent, also suggested reforming the 26-member Schengen area which allows free movement between members.
All those who want to belong to Schengen should accept both stricter controls on outer borders and a common asylum policy for migrants, he said.
He also suggested Europe should also share a common border force, along with a joint office for dealing with asylum demands.
Crunch talks
Macron’s letter comes as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is to meet with Britain negotiating team for further talks on the Irish backstop, as the clock continues to tick down the divorce deadline.
The meeting comes after Barniersaid on Saturdaythat the EU is prepared to give Britain further Brexit guarantees to help a divorce deal through the British parliament.

The British parliament rejected the original Brexit deal hammered out by Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders.
His statement has raised some hope that both sides can finally reach a solution, including the Irish backstop -the biggest obstacle to agreement in parliament.
In his comments, Barnier said there was “misunderstanding” over the proposed backstop deal.
“Limiting it in time or introducing a unilateral exit clause would call into question its credibility,” Barnier said.
The backstop “will end either when we have a global agreement on the future relationship, or a specific agreement with Ireland,” he said, assuring it “was never the wish” to bind Britain to European trade rules indefinitely.
Barnier is today due to meet with Britain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit minister Stephen Barclay for talks at 4pm today.
“We’re now at a particularly critical stage in these negotiations,” a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May said yesterday.

‘Running the show’
Cox’s presence today is seen as central to the meeting. This is because he will ultimately offer a legal opinion on the Brexit deal and the backstop that could determine whether key MPs in the UK parliament will approve the accord.
Earlier disfavourable advice by Cox was viewed as a contributing factor in the defeat of May’s deal by MPs in January.
“Cox is running the show,” a senior EU source told AFP.
Despite the defeat in January, EU leaders have continuously insisted that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Talks in Brussels are focused on drafting a separate document to calm doubters in London.
Also raising hopes are the softening positions of several hardline Brexit supports in May’s Conservative party who have dropped their remand that changes to the backstop be made to the withdrawal treaty itself.
However, most of them are continuing to push for a time limit or exit clause to the backstop, and have set up a team of lawyers to scrutinise anything that Cox brings back from Brussels.

https://www.thejournal.ie/petition-brexit-article-50-signatures-4555005-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
MORE THAN TWO million people have signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched yesterday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
At the time of updating this article, the petition had just over 2,002,343 signatures.
It was started by Margaret Anne Georgiadou, whotold the BBC: “I became like every other Remainer – very frustrated that we’ve been silenced and ignored for so long.
She said the petition “didn’t do very well for a week”.
“I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,” she added.
The British Parliament’s petitions committee tweeted that the rate of signings is the “highest the site has ever had to deal with”, after the website briefly crashed earlier.
A House of Commons spokesman said the technical difficulties on parliament’s e-petition website were caused by “a large and sustained load on the system”.

The rate of signing is the highest the site has ever had to deal with and we have had to make some changes to ensure the site remains stable and open for signatures and new petitions. Thanks for bearing with us.
The petition comes as the European Council agreed to delay the date by which the UK leaves the European Union by almost two months if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the UK parliament next week.
Following lengthy discussions in Brussels, the European Council has now agreed to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week.
If the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until 12 April 2019 and “expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European Council”.
The UK had been legally obliged to leave the European Union on 29 March (next Friday), two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May, which sets the Brexit process in motion.
If a petition on the website gets more than 100,000 signatures, the Parliament is meant to consider it for debate.
The government is expected to respond to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures.
Data on the website shows the petition’s strongest pockets of support are in north London, Bristol and Brighton – all Remain hotbeds during the 2016 referendum.
There were also strong pockets of support in countries with large British diasporas, including more than 8,000 from France and more than 4,000 from Spain.
It is the third most popular e-petition since parliament launched the website in 2011.
A 2016 petition calling for a second EU referendum should the winning vote and turnout not reach a certain threshold received the most signatories at almost 4.2 million.
A petition to prevent US President Donald Trump from making a state visit to Britain reached 1.9 million signatures.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-brexit-advice-theresa-may-4542345-Mar2019/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has said he gave British Prime Minister Theresa May advice on “how to negotiate” Brexit but that she “didn’t listen” to it.
Trump made his comments while speaking to reporters during his meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar the Oval Office in the White House.
Trump said that he will stay out of the Brexit negotiations but hopes that the discussions work out.
He said he’s surprised how badly the talks have gone and added that May has failed to follow his advice on how to handle the negotiations.
“I gave the Prime Minister my ideas on how to negotiate it and I think you would have been successful. She didn’t listen to that and that’s fine. She’s got to do what she’s got to do,” Trump said.
“I think it could have been negotiated in a different manner, frankly. I hate to see everything being ripped apart right now,” he said.
He said both sides are very “cemented in” and he called it a “tough situation” and a “shame.”
Looking to the Taoiseach, Trump said Brexit was “tearing countries apart” and added that he was surprised “how badly” it has gone since the UK referendum.

Varadkar pushed the issue of an EU-US trade deal, but the US president launched a scathing attack on Europe stating that they have been very difficult to deal with.

Trump went on to say that he doesn’t think another Brexit referendum would be possible “because it would be very unfair to the people that won”.
The president’s comments came as MPs are due to vote again in the House of Commonsthis evening at 5pm. They will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
The House of Commonslast night voted against a no-deal Brexitwith 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time. A total of 278 MPs voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
During last night’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as May had proposed.
A total of 312 voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while 308 voted against the amendment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-food-4528746-Mar2019/,"https://soundcloud.com/the-explainer-podcast/how-will-brexit-affect-the-food-that-you-buy/s-BohiS
HOW WOULD BREXIT affect Irish fridges, shelves, and shops?
We’re just three weeks out from the 29 March, the date by which the UK is due to leave the European Union, and a no-deal Brexit seems more likely than ever. Although companies are steering clear of speculation, there is a fear about what exists now as a free-flowing and open market could shudder to a halt, at least briefly, because of Brexit.
Ireland, of course, has a close business and trading relationship with the UK, which means Brexit, particularly the uncertainty that it’s brought, has threatened it.
Of particular significance are the Irish businesses that export to the UK, and rely on that UK market to a significant degree: if that market is closed off to them, or becomes less lucrative to export to, then that could threaten businesses to the point of collapse. This means that some foods produced and distributed inside Ireland could be at risk.
So what foods should we be worried about? In short, fresh produce – like agrifoods, fruit and vegetables – that Ireland imports through the UK. This could mean that there is a short period immediately after a no-deal Brexit where these foods could be in short supply.
Ireland also imports quite a bit of confectionery and baked goods from the UK, but because this is preservable it shouldn’t be a problem to source post a no-deal Brexit in the long run – although it could become more expensive.
The UK landbridge
The UK landbridge consists of the roads and ports Irish trucks use to get products to the EU, and vice versa. Around 150,000 Irish trucks use the landbridge a year; two-thirds of Irish goods exporters make use of the UK landbridge to access continental markets.
A further 53% of Irish goods exports (measured in volume) to all countries other than the UK are transported via the UK.
Evergreen, Wexford Street.Gráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ieGráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Meats and other ‘perishables’are massively reliant on the UK landbridge. Although it’s more expensive than circumventing it, it’s also much faster: it takes less than 20 hours from Ireland through Great Britain to the EU, according to a report by theIrish Maritime Development Office(Nov 2018).
Dublin to France would double to 40 hours for direct roll-on, roll-off services. And if there are delays, it will affect the food we import and export.
If there arechecks at Dover-Calais, and they take 80 seconds to carry out, that means the tailback of trucks will be “unrecoverable” – if they take 40 seconds, then there will be no change to the free-flowing system we have currently.
But Irish hauliers have said that it’s“unreasonable”to expect that no-deal Brexit checks would take just 40 seconds.
Tariffs
If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it will mean a number of products could be hit by tariffs, which is a tax imposed on goods or services from other countries in order to favour home industries.
Ireland’s biggest exports,beef and cheese,are at particular risk(of the 90% of Irish beef that is exported, 47% goes to the UK, and 87% of Irish cheddar cheese is exported to the UK).
The expectation is that the UK’s trading relationship with other countries would revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – meaning a set standard of tariffs (though they would have to apply to join).
The items that carry the highest import tariff rates under WTO rules are meat (49%), cereals (45%), sugars and confectionery (42%), and dairy products (31%). Here’s a list of the tariffs by commodity, meaning the extra cost of importing:
WTO tariffs, by itemWTO tariffs, by item
Forbread, 95% of all flour used actually comes from the UK, so importing that would carry tariffs in a no-deal Brexit.Breadmakers have warnedthat if there is no deal, tariffs could result in prices increasing by between 10% and 15%, as breadmakers would be paying €172 extra per tonne of flour they import.
Gerald Cunningham, president of the Flour Confectioners and Bakers Association, toldTheJournal.iethis when asked if it would mean there would be a shortage of bread: “I’d like to think that the shelves will be full, we don’t want to panic and put more pressure on bread-making businesses.

The all-island economy
Flour, cheese and the meatindustries are all based on north-south cooperation.
“Every year 400,000lambsgo South, and 400,000pigsmeet them and go North,” Irish Farmers’ Association presidentJoe Healy said at its AGMthis year, adding that the organisation’s support was for the backstop to remain.
A UK committee was told that farmers in the North were so worried about the Republic of Ireland being closed off to them because of Brexit that they had considered breeding less lambs for this season.
If farmers in the North can’t send lambs down here, because of checks or because it just doesn’t make financial sense for them anymore, there could be a surplus in the North:
“We can’t eat our way out of the problem”,as one representativetoldTheJournal.ie.

Guinness is also another all-island-of-Ireland product: although it’s brewed at St James’ Gate, it’s then transported up to Belfast where it’s packaged, and some of it is then brought back down to Dublin for export.
Diageo tolda UK Business committeethat 18,000 of its trucks cross that border a year, “so even small hold-ups to process those truck movements would be really unwelcome”, it also stated in an annual report that it has no intention to change its supply chain because of Brexit.
CSOCSO
In 2017, Ireland imported over 72,000 tonnes of potatoes, 62,000 tonnes of cheese, 72,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish and almost 70 million litres of water.
Almost 10,000 tonnes of tea and over 21,000 tonnes of coffee were imported in 2017.
Most of these are non-perishable goods, so if there is a delay, it’s reasonable to assume that the supply chain will catch up with itself eventually.
Shane Hamill of Bord Bia said that companies are going to try to offset costs as best they can.
“You’ll see a lot of companies reformulating their products, shifting their ingredients in order to manage any cost increases.
Fishwould also become more expensive. ANetherlands report on fishing in the EUsays that if the United Kingdom “completely closed its marine areas, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium would be affected the most”.
Shutterstock / Andrii Spy_kShutterstock / Andrii Spy_k / Andrii Spy_k
“The most visible impact of Brexit on fish consumption would be expected in Ireland (more than 4% decline), followed by UK. The change in consumption is directly linked to the changes in consumer prices… The strongest increase of fish prices occurs in Ireland, where consumer prices of fish products would grow by more than 9%.
Fish production would also decrease, according to the same report.
An interesting note onpotatoes and potato seeds:Michael Creed, the Minster for Agriculture, Food and the Marine told the Dáilthat seed potatoes are banned from entering the EU from third countries.
Traders have been forewarned about this, he said, and all advice to Irish growers is to ensure that UK seed is supplied before the end of March in order to facilitate the 2019 planting season.
“There will then be at least another 9 months before the 2020 planting season for the European Commission to consider requests from the UK for amendment to Annex III of the Plant Health directive based on a detailed scientific justification as to why the amendment is warranted,” he said – so they’re putting that off for later.
A good by-product of Brexit, however, is that it may get people thinking about how they get their food so cheaply and so quickly.
“I think people are starting to pay a little bit more attention to what is on their shelves,” Shane Hamill says, “so there’s certainly a new appreciation not only for how the food arrives and how quickly it takes, but also where it’s coming from and that’s probably a good thing.”

THE TÁNAISTE AND Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney expressed annoyance today at Britain’s continued failure to ratify a deal on its orderly withdrawal from the European Union.
“Of course there’s frustration,” Coveney told reporters after more talks in Brussels with EU colleagues.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May thinks she might be able to get a deal signed with EU leaders in November past the British parliament if it is reworded.
But EU leaders, as Coveney noted, insist this is a non-starter and that, in particular, a guarantee of no hard border between Ireland and the UK must stay.
“My job is to try to protect Irish interests and the Irish people through Brexit which is not an Irish policy,” he said after the ministerial meeting.
“We are spending hundreds of millions of euro in Ireland preparing for a no-deal Brexit to try to protect Irish citizens,” he added.

“We don’t want to have to do that. Of course we want a solution here. And yes, there’s frustration,” he said.
“We have less than 40 days to go until the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union and we still don’t know what the British government is actually asking for to actually get this deal ratified.”
Earlier, Coveney had met chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for an update on the talks.
Later, Barnier was due to meet Britain’s latest minister for Brexit, Stephen Barclay, who is preparing the ground for May to return to Brussels later this week.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt had insisted on arriving at the meeting that Britain’s support for the Northern Ireland peace deal was “unconditional”.
Both London and Brussels would have to show flexibility to find a reworked Brexit deal that could get past the House of Commons, he said.
“But what we need is trust and vision on both sides, because what’s at stake here is Britain’s relationship with its European neighbours for the next 25 years.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-brexit-deal-4531460-Mar2019/,"THE EU’S CHIEF Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has offered the UK a new Brexit deal which would see it leave the customs union but keep parts of the backstop which would ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.
In a number of tweets sent this afternoon, Barnier said the UK has been offered a way to exit the “single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border”.
Barnier added: “The UK will not be forced into customs union against its will. The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement.”
However, it is thought that the DUP, which props up Theresa May’s Conservative government, will not accept the deal as it effectively differentiates between the North and Great Britain – a red letter issue for the DUP.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, in response to Barnier’s tweets, said the ball is in the UK’s court.

He said: “We were and remain happy to apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland, if they want to go back to that. It doesn’t have to trap or keep all of Great Britain in the single customs territory for a prolonged period, or at all.”
The British parliament is set to vote this Tuesday on May’s existing deal with Brussels after rejecting it by a historic margin in January.
May told an audience of factory workers in the North Sea fishing port of Grimsby that Britain may never split off from the other 27 nations if Brussels failed to help her now.
The deal “needs just one more push to address the final, specific concerns of our parliament,” May said.
“Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/construction-brexit-housing-crisis-4524909-Mar2019/,"RESEARCH BY THE Construction Industry Federation (CIF) has raised concerns that Brexit could hamper the response to the housing crisis by making construction more expensive.
The survey gauged the Brexit preparation of CIF members and found significant concern about spiralling costs in both the supply chain and in penalties due to Brexit induced delays.
It found that 42% believed that Brexit will have an immediate negative impact on their businesses.
“In the immediate term post-Brexit, the supply-chain will be extremely challenged to absorb costs and many companies have already been struggling with increasing input and labour costs in the industry with minimal cost recovery,” CIF director general Tom Parlon said in a message to members.
“With house building so tenuous outside the greater Dublin area, even minimal Brexit-driven increases could be the difference between securing development finance or otherwise,” Parlon added.

In further CIF warnings that accompanied the survey, the importance of the building sector in dealing with Ireland’s housing crisis is stressed and it is noted that it is critical that the industry is “both Brexit ready and proof”.
As well as the potential problems thrown up by an increase in costs, the CIF has also warned that Brexit could pose a problem in the access to skilled workers.
The survey of members found that just under a quarter feared problems in assessing the required talent after Brexit.
“A reduction, however limited, in an already small pool of skilled workers, will cause huge strain in an industry with a decade-long pipeline of activity,” the report states.
Business group Ibec said in January that between 80,000-100,000workers would be needed to meet government construction targetsand estimated that there is a shortfall of between 60,000 to 80,000.
Ibec suggested that there would need to be a significant growth in the number of non-Irish construction workers coming here to bridge that gap.
In its report, CIF said it did not envisage an influx of construction workers coming from the UK post-Brexit and that an increased demand for workers “will intensify the war for labour and talent in the sector”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/farming-ireland-post-brexit-4464940-Jan2019/,"THE PRESIDENT OF the Irish Farmers’ Association Joe Healy has asked the government to make commitments to support farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Farming is one of the sectors most vulnerable to Brexit as many agri-foods are exported to the UK, and many Irish farmers operate on an all-island economy basis. For example, around40% of Northern Ireland’s lambsare exported south of the border, and although milk is produced in Northern Ireland,the factories that make it into cheeseare located in Ireland.
Speaking at the Irish Farmers’ Association’s (IFA) AGM, Healy said that beef farmers  were particularly vulnerable and needed support. Factories have blamed the devaluation of sterling for poor prices for meat, but as it recovers, don’t readjust the price, he said.
“… beef farmers are ‘losing their shirts’. Farmers need €20 per head for every 5c kilo in reduction”.
When asked what specific supports they needed, Healy replied:
“We need to know that they are there to support farmers in the case of a no-deal Brexit but also that they’re open to understanding and appreciating the concerns that are there at the moment that beef farmers in particular are experiencing.
Healy said that Ireland exports 87% of its cheddar cheese to the UK, and of the 90% of Irish beef that’s exported, 50% of that goes to the UK.
“Every year 400,000 lambs go South, and 400,000 pigs meet them and go North,” he said, adding that the backstop had to remain unless the UK can offer something better.
Healy has said that he’s met Ireland’s EU Commissioner Phil Hogan twice in the past 10 days to discuss measures for a “crash out Brexit”, and to highlight the uncertainty that’s affecting farmers.
He said that they were looking for financial help, aids for private storage facilities, and some control on the price for agri-products.
He said that there is still a hope that there will be a deal, but even if there is that “we’ll still see farmers continue to lose a lot of money”.
When asked if farmers felt like sitting ducks in relation to Brexit, Healy said “absolutely”.

The UK is due to leave the European Union on the 29 March – exactly two months away. Despite over two years of debates and negotiations with the EU, it’s looking increasingly like the UK will leave with no deal.
This is because the UK parliament rejected the deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May, and MPs can’t seem to find agreement for an alternative plan.
Among the most contentious issues in the deal is the Irish backstop: a mechanism so that a hard border will not reappear on the island of Ireland because of Brexit.

Apart from Brexit, Healy also discussed reports that the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy payment would be cut by 5% and voiced the IFA’s opposition to it: “A cut is a cut.”
He said that although it was being touted as a win, as the cut could have been greater, he added that the 5% cut represented a much greater loss to farmers in earnings – closer to 15%.
“We’ve stated quite clearly that an Irish commissioner and a Minister for Agriculture cannot allow this to happen,” Healy said.
Ireland’s Phil Hogan is the EU commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, and is in charge of reforming the payment.
A significant part of the EU’s budget is used to give grants to farmers to subsidise their work, and to ensure sustainable food production as well as support rural development.
As a country with a strong agriculture sector, Ireland benefits massively from this, but other EU countries oppose the costly grants and are looking to reduce it significantly.
Healy also said that farmers were disappointed with Leo Varadkar’s comments about eating less meat, saying that the IFA had always advocated a balanced diet.
“Farmers are being told that we should give up producing meat and milk and instead produce fruit and nuts. We won’t be getting rid of our livestock. We produce the best food in the world, naturally, from animals grazing in fields.”
He added:

THE EU WILL “stand fully behind Ireland” no matter what happens with Brexit, chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said today during a visit to Dublin.
Barnier arrived in Ireland ahead of this Wednesday’s European Council meeting which will decide if the UK will be granted a further extension.
The bloc agreed last month to postpone Brexit day, originally set for 29 March, and set 12 April as the new deadline under certain conditions.
Britain has until Friday to approve the existing withdrawal agreement, to change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or to crash out of the EU without an agreement.
May has asked the remaining EU countries for another postponement that would extend to 30 June, hoping to secure an alternative deal from the opposition negotiations and Parliament in a matter of weeks.
Other European leaders are expected to respond to the delay request during Wednesday’s summit in Brussels.
May will head to the EU summit on Wednesday seeking to secure the Brexit extension until 30 June.
Meanwhile, the British government has today set 23 May as the date for European Parliament elections, but said it never intends to hold them as it hopes to have left the EU by then.
A spokeswoman said the formal “day of poll order” had been laid in parliament, but added: “It remains the government’s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before 22 May, so that we do not need to participate.”

Barnier’s visit
According to the Department of An Taoiseach, the main purpose of Barnier’s visit is to show solidarity with Ireland, similar to German Chancellor AngelaMerkel’s visitlast Thursday.
During his visit today, Barnier also warned Britain that, in case of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would not open trade talks until the question of the Irish border had been resolved.
“We would not discuss anything with the UK until there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as citizens’ rights and the financial settlement,” he said.

All three issues are covered by the withdrawal agreement, which was struck between British and EU negotiators in November but has been rejected by the British parliament.
The EU has opposed any renegotiation of the divorce deal but Barnier today said an accompanying political declaration on future trade ties could be reworked “extremely quickly”.

The UK government is currently in talks with the Labour Party on a possible compromise to the situation, which could include a customs union.
However, Corbyn said today that he was still waiting for May to alter her approach.
“Talks have to mean a movement and so far there has been no change in those red lines,” he said, adding that his team would speak to her ministers tomorrow.
Varadkar’s stance
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has express support for the cross-party talks in London.
“I sincerely hope that it’ll be possible to build sufficient consensus to enable ratification of the withdrawal agreement,” he said.
“We’re open to extending the deadline to allow these discussions to run their course.”
Varadkar also spoke by phone with May this evening, who spoke about her recent letter to European Council President Donald Tusk seeking an extension of the Article 50 deadline, and her ongoing preparations for Wednesday’s Summit.
The Taoiseach repeated his openness to an extension of the deadline during the phone call.
He also spoke over the phone with Dutch Prime Mark Minister Rutte, Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel and Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.
Alongside her phone call with Varadkar, May today began a last-minute visits to Paris and Berlin as she prepared for Wednesday’s make-or-break summit.
She is meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow, in what her spokeswoman said was an attempt to set out “the rationale” for a further short delay.

The prime minister’s up now.
She says now is the last opportunity to deliver Brexit. She indicates that getting this deal through means that the UK can leave the EU before the end of May.
“If we do not vote for this motion today, people will ask ‘why did you not vote for Brexit?’,” she says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/angela-merkel-leo-varadkar-brexit-4576079-Apr2019/,"ANGELA MERKEL IS set to meet Leo Varadkar in Dublin today to discuss Brexit.
The German Chancellor and Taoiseach will hold a meeting in Farmleigh House this afternoon.
Ahead of their formal meeting, they will participate in a roundtable discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the border area.
Members of the public will share their personal experiences and perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on border communities and businesses.
Some of the people due to attend have direct personal experience of the conflict before the Good Friday Agreement.
“It is important to hear their voices as we work together to deal with the challenges that Brexit presents,” a statement from the Taoiseach’s office said.
Merkel has vowed to “fight until the last hour” to avoid a no-deal outcome — something which could have a huge impact on the island of Ireland.
Speaking at a press conference in Berlin yesterday, Merkel said an orderly Brexit would be “in interest of Britain but also in our interest”. She added that a hard border could affect “peace in Ireland”.
Her meeting with Varadkar comes amid ongoing talks between the British government and the Labour Party.
MPs yesterday voted in favour of a Brexit delay that would avoid Britain crashing out of the European Union on 12 April.
With options running out, Prime Minister Theresa May switched course and invited Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for talks yesterday in a bid to forge a compromise that avoids a chaotic no-deal departure from the EU in eight days’ time.
Negotiating teams for both sides are due to meet again today for a full day of discussions.
May’s withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by parliament and patience is wearing thin in Brussels as the deadline to end Britain’s 46-year EU membership nears with no agreement in sight.
May said on Tuesday she would seek another “short” Brexit extension at an EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on 10 April.

313 v 312 on bill
In a rushed parliamentary bid to avoid Britain leaving the EU without a divorce deal next Friday, MPs voted by the narrowest of margins late yesterday in favour of draft legislation that would force the government to seek to delay Brexit.
The vote passed by just one — 313 votes in favour and 312 against — in the lower House of Commons and the bill will now pass to the upper House of Lords for final approval today.
“We are disappointed that MPs have chosen to back this bill,” a government spokesman said.
“If passed, this bill would place a severe constraint on the government’s ability to negotiate an extension and reflect this new date in UK statute books before April 12.”
The EU would have to agree to any form of extension.
Earlier yesterday evening, MPs voted 310-310 to hold more indicative votes on Monday. House Speaker John Bercow had the deciding vote, andvoted against the amendment, quoting precedent.
First talks ‘constructive’
May said yesterday’s talks with Corbyn were “constructive”, suggesting she might be prepared to bend her previous principles and listen to proposals for much closer post-Brexit trade relations with the bloc than many Conservatives are prepared to accept.
Both sides showed “flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close”, a spokesman for May’s Downing Street office said.
“We have agreed a programme of work to ensure we deliver for the British people, protecting jobs and security,” he added.
However, Corbyn said: “There hasn’t been as much change as I expected but we will have further discussions … to explore technical issues” today.
He told May Labour wanted a customs union with the EU, access to its single market and raised “the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or leaving on a bad deal”.
If the talks between the government and Labour fail to reach a compromise that both can support, May hopes the two sides can come up with mutually acceptable options that would be put up for binding parliamentary votes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-visit-2-4665361-Jun2019/,"THE UK SHOULD strive for a no-deal Brexit with the EU and refuse to pay the agreed £39 billion (€45 billion) divorce bill, US President Donald Trump has said.
Trump also said that Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage should be sent in to negotiating his country’s exit from the European Union.
Trump made the statements in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper ahead of the president’s state visit to England.
The comments cone after Trump told The Sun he thought former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would make an “excellent” prime minister to take over from Theresa May.
May is due to step down on 7 June after failing on multiple occasions to get her EU Brexit leaving bill through parliament.
“I like Nigel a lot,” Trump said of Farage. “He has a lot to offer”.
State visit
Trump is to embark on a three-day visit from tomorrow, during which he will meet Queen Elizabeth II and have talks with May.
He’s due to arrive in Ireland on Wednesday to spend two nights at his Doonbeg resort.A tight security operation is in placefor Trump’s Ireland visit, with protests also planned.
In his interview with the Sunday Times, he urged the UK government to follow his rule book in negotiating deals when it came to Brexit.
“If they don’t get what they want, I would walk away… If you don’t get the deal you want, if you don’t get a fair deal, then you walk away,” he said.

On the divorce bill – the UK’s liabilities as it leaves the EU – Trump said:
Trump said that a future trade deal with the US would make up for lost trade with the EU and that he would “go all out” to help them get a deal.
Conservative split
Brexit was due to have happened in March this year but as been pushed back twice as the UK parliament on a number of accusations failed to pass measures to actually leave.
The Conservative party under May and the parliament are split over what sort of Brexit they want: either a total break from the EU, or a closer relationship that implies accepting EU rules on trade and immigration.
The issue of the Irish backstop – the measures needed to ensure that there will no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland – has been one of the most contentious issues.
After failing repeatedly to get her vision of Brexit passed, May has been forced to announce she will step down on Friday.
More than a dozen Conservative MPs have thrown their hat in the ring to take over as party leader and prime minister, with Boris Johnson seen as an early favourite.
Large protests are planned during Trump’s visit to London.
The mayor of the capital, Sadiq Khan, said today in a piece in The Observer that the US president was “one of the most egregious examples” of a growing global threat from the far-right.
Khan said Trump’s “divisive behaviour flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon – equality, liberty and religious freedom”.
He added that populist politicians such as Farage and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban “are using the same divisive tropes of the fascists of the 20th century to garner support, but are using new sinister methods to deliver their message”.

DUP BREXIT SPOKESPERSON Sammy Wilson dismissed a severe warning by the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service that unemployment could rise significantly if there’s a no-deal Brexit.
David Sterling issued the warning in a letter to the country’s political parties, in which he outlined the “severe consequences” to Northern Ireland of a no-deal Brexit.
He also claimed that the scenario would result in “additional challenges for the police” if the UK’s departure from the bloc appeared to be unfair to those most affected by it, according to a report inThe Guardian.
“These consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply,” he wrote.
“This point is well understood by the business community.”
Appearing before theNorthern Ireland Affairs Committeetoday, Wilson said that Sterling’s comments were a “scare tactic”, and inferred that it was politically motivated.
“If you look at the studies that have been made about the impact of a no-deal – I don’t care if he’s the head of the civil service or Santa Claus, it really doesn’t matter – the fact of the matter is he’s got it wrong.”
He added: “There may well be an impact of a no-deal, but government has got fiscal and monetary measures to deal with it.”

Sterling said that Northern Ireland’s economy would be particularly impacted, as 75% of all private sector employers were small- or medium-sized enterprises, many of which would close or relocate.
Meanwhile, the country would experience increased food and energy prices, as well as the loss of programmes such as the European Health and Insurance Card and the Erasmus scheme.
“Our advice to the UK Government has consistently been that no deal would have profound and lasting social and economic effects, and that there are very limited actions that could be taken to mitigate these,” he added.

Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Sterling’s letter had laid out the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland in “very stark terms”.
“The analysis from the Civil Service points out in very stark terms just how much of a catastrophe a no-deal crash will be for the North of Ireland,” she said.
“Given our unique vulnerabilities, the collective assessment of the government departments here is that the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North of Ireland will be ‘longer and much more severe’ than anywhere else.”
O’Neill called on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservative Party to avoid a no-deal Brexit and listen to the business and farming communities as they guide the UK out of the EU.

The British Prime Minister said that if her deal was not backed before a European Council summit on Thursday, the UK would “not leave the EU for many months, if ever”.
Writing in today’sSunday Telegraph, May claimed that a “short technical extension” of Article 50 would be required beyond March 29 Brexit to avoid a no-deal Brexit, a scenario thatMPs voted against in the House of Commonsthis week.
That extension is expected to be voted upon by the remaining 27 EU members at this week’s council meeting in Brussels.
“That is not an ideal outcome – we could and should have been leaving the EU on March 29,” she said.
“But it is something the British people would accept if it led swiftly to delivering Brexit. The alternative if Parliament cannot agree the deal by that time is much worse.”

May warned that if MPs did not pass her deal before that EU summit, it would mean having to negotiate another withdrawal deal, requiring a much longer extension of Article 50.
This would force the UK would to partake in European Parliament elections in May, three years after voting to leave the EU, something May said would be a symbol of the failure of British politics.
“The idea of the British people going to the polls to elect MEPs three years after voting to leave the EU hardly bears thinking about,” she said.
“There could be no more potent symbol of Parliament’s collective political failure.”
Appealing to MPs to back her deal, May acknowledged that she would have to do more to convince them if she was to secure a majority for it, which she said was “the only way through the current impasse”.
“All this makes the choice now facing MPs clearer than it has ever been,” she said.
“If Parliament can find a way to back the Brexit deal before European Council, the UK will leave the EU this spring, without having to take part in the European elections, and we can get on with building our future relationship with the EU.
“If it cannot, we will not leave the EU for many months, if ever.”

Speaking today, two of May’s top ministers warned that the Prime Minister might not even hold a third vote on her deal unless she secures support from within the Conservative Party.
“It would be difficult to justify having a vote if you knew you were going to lose it,” international trade secretary Liam Fox told Sky News.
“We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues… are prepared to support it so that we can get it through parliament,” finance minister Philip Hammond said on the BBC.
However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rubbished suggestions that his party would support the deal, calling it a “blindfold Brexit that… [would] do enormous damage” to the British economy.
Instead, Corbyn told Sky News that he might support a proposal from within his own party to have a second referendum on Brexit if it is postponed this week.
“It would obviously have to be a credible choice that’s real for those that wanted to vote leave, or did vote leave in 2016, as well as those that voted remain,” he said.

May has said that she will request another extension to Article 50 from the EU, saying that although the UK could “make a success” of no-deal, leaving with a deal is preferable.
After failing to win over enough Brexiteer rebels in her own party to back her withdrawal agreement on three occasions, May’s reaching out to Corbyn has drawn criticism from within the Conservative Party and the DUP.
In any case, Corbyn has agreed to meet the PM. Any plan agreed between him and May would be put to the House of Commons for approval next week with a view to bringing it to the European Council summit next week.
So, let’s see what spin the UK’s newspapers have put on the latest developments.
The Daily Express runs with “It’s Time For National Unity…Over To You Mr Corbyn”.

The Guardian has May at the plinth and runs with the headline: “May calls for talks with Corbyn in bid to save Brexit”.

The Daily Telegraph shows May’s cabinet. Highlighting the division amongst Conservative MPs, it runs with: “Cabinet backs no-deal Brexit – but May turns to Corbyn instead”.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror features a sombre May with the headline: “Help Me, Jeremy”.

The Metro runs this morning with: “It’s Jezz the two of us”, referencing May’s meeting with Labour leader Corbyn.

And finally, The Sun slams the PM by showing Corbyn’s head inside a light bulb above May with the headline: “After 7 hours of Cabinet lockdown, May’s gone soft over Brexit mess. IS THAT YOUR BRIGHT IDEA?”

EVEN AFTER ROLLING out a suite of star-studded shows andretiring the TV3 moniker, Virgin Media’s television advertising sales have been taking a hit for over two and a half years – thanks to Brexit.
A recent return on the Lobbying Register showed that executives from the broadcasting side of the media and communications business were asked to outline how they were preparing for a hard Brexit, at the request the Department of Communications.
According to a note prepared after the meeting, which took place the week before Christmas last year, Virgin Media Television bigwigs outlined several Brexit-related issues that were already impacting the business or causing concern.
The note, released toForafollowing a freedom of information request, stated that the company had told department officials that its “advertising revenue has been decreasing since 2016 as a result of … the Brexit referendum”.
Consolidated financial statements for parent company Virgin Media Inc show that some £14.5 million of the group’s total £1.2 billion turnover for the three months to the end of September 2018 was generated through ‘other’ sources – primarily broadcasting revenue in Ireland.
This figure was down slightly on the £14.6 million recorded in the same category for the same three-month period in 2017.
A spokeswoman for Virgin Media Television told this website that the company “is almost wholly reliant on advertising revenues to fund our commercial operations and invest in local content”.

The meeting in December was attended by Virgin Media Television managing director Pat Kiely and VP of corporate affairs Kate O’Sullivan, who met with Department of Communications officials, including assistant secretary Patricia Cronin.
The note released toForashowed that the television company – which was bought by Liberty Global for €80 million in 2015 – also raised the issue of what impact Brexit might have on its rights to broadcast British programmes.
It questioned whether the UK content that it carries – such as soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale and popular game show The Chase – would continue to be considered as “European works” under EU broadcasting quotas.
According to the documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, the Department of Communications responded to say that “it was its view that the UK content would continue to be considered European works, as this definition is based on the UK’s membership of the Council of Europe”.
Virgin Media Television’s spokeswoman added that the company “has been in contact with all UK licenced broadcasters to ensure they are taking the necessary steps to obtain an EU licence in the event (a hard) Brexit takes place”.
The Department of Communications also requested a separate meeting with State-owned broadcaster RTÉ to discuss Brexit.
In a statement toFora, the broadcaster said that it highlighted that a no-deal Brexit would “impact RTÉ’s delivery of its public service obligations, as well as the execution of its most recently endorsed five-year strategy”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/shane-ross-brexit-4478805-Feb2019/,"PROPOSED MEASURES IN the aviation and road haulage industries will “eliminate the immediate risk” of a no-deal Brexit but will only be temporary, Minister for Transport Shane Ross is set to warn.
Ross is due to address the Oireachtas Transport Committee later today on the latest measures in place to deal with Brexit, with fears of a no-deal intensifying after the House of Commons backed a deal with the EU that wouldn’t include the backstop last week.
The backstop – a mechanism to keep Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the EU and avoid a hard border – is something the Irish government and EU have said is non-negotiable.
Minister Ross will tell the committee today that Ireland’s aviation industry, in particular, is “uniquely exposed by a no-deal scenario due to our heavy reliance on the Ireland-UK air transport market”.
Ireland’s dependence on these aviation links for trade and tourism run into the billions of euro a year.
Landbridge
Ross will also say that he is “very concerned” about the potential for disruption to the UK landbridge.
The so-called landbridge – when Irish exporters transport their goods through the UK on the way to the EU – is relied upon heavily by certain sectors such as agri-food.
Advertisement
A study carried out by the Irish Maritime Development Office determined that 3 million tonnes of merchandise trade with the EU moves between Ireland and the continent via the UK landbridge.
It can take less than 20 hours to transport goods to the EU via the landbridge, but up to 40 via other routes.
“These sectors would be particularly adversely affected by any deterioration in transit times or increase in costs particularly in a no-deal scenario, and these sectors may not be able to opt for the direct maritime routes to the continent, given the longer journey times involved,” the minister will say.
Ross will also point to work from his department to monitor the extent to which agencies at the port of Calais are stepping up preparedness for checks on products from and flowing through the UK.
However, he will also highlight measures taken by the European Commission in the event of a no-deal.
Air access
When it comes to aviation, continued air access between the EU27 member states and the UK in the event of a no-deal – provided the UK reciprocates – will persist for a period of 12 months.
For a further nine months, the European Commission has proposed allowing access for UK hauliers to the EU to ensure basic road connectivity if the UK responds in kind.
“While both the proposed aviation and road haulage EU Commission measures are temporary only, they do eliminate the immediate risk from March 2019 and allow time and space to find alternative and more permanent arrangements,” Ross will say.
He will add that work has been done to establish additional controls at ports and at Dublin Airport. The Office of Public Works is also working to deliver the required facilities for the agriculture, health and customs checks that would be necessary after Brexit.

ACTOR AND REMAIN campaigner Steve Coogan doesn’t believe Brexit will happen, he toldTheJournal.ie.
In an interview to promotehis new film Stan and Ollie, in which he stars alongside US actor John C Reilly (the pair play comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy), Coogan spoke about his fears about the Brexit impact, but admitted he thinks the exit is unlikely to go ahead.
“To me, I think [Brexit is] inevitably going to have a negative impact,” Coogan told this website. “I think it sends out all the wrong signals.”
“I don’t think it’s going to happen to be honest,” he said.
Coogan revealed he’s not so much worried about the impact it will have on him as what Brexit will mean for those less well off.

Tomorrow, British Prime Minister Theresa May willface another votein the Commons on her Brexit deal. If it is voted down –as it is widely anticipated to be– she will have to return next Monday with her ‘Plan B’.
Steve Coogan has spoken publicly about Brexit before. In October of last year, hepaid for busesto take people to London for a mass march that called for a People’s Vote on Brexit.
In an articlehe wrote at the timefor the Independent newspaper, he described Brexit as a “looming disaster for our country” and said that the public had to be given the final say on it.
Coogan, who grew up in Manchester, began his career on the show Spitting Image. It was his creation Alan Partridge, a hapless local radio presenter, that turned him into one of Britain’s most important comedians.
Brexit will get a mention in the next Alan Partridge series, which will be broadcast on the BBC this spring.
Coogan’s co-star John C Reilly was less enamoured by the Brexit chat (preferring to give this reporter a rose from his lapel as a way of ending the interview rather than ending it on Brexit), but did pronounce it “a horrible thing”.
“I hope we never even have to say this word [Brexit] anymore,” said Reilly. “Enough already.”

MPS IN THE House of Commons have once again rejected all of the alternative options put before them in the latest round of indicative Brexit votes this evening – with one option backing a customs union losing by just three votes.
There were only four non-binding options before MPs tonight. A similar effort to reach a consensus on Brexit last Wednesday – when eight options were tabled – also failed.
Here’s how they voted:
As these votes were not binding, Prime Minister Theresa May would have had the option of ignoring them if she so wished.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Nick Boles, the pro-EU Tory MP who had backed the Common Market 2.0 option, resigned the party whip in the immediate aftermath of the results being announced.
May will hold the next meeting of her cabinet tomorrow, and there’s speculation she could yet bring her thrice-rejected withdrawal deal before the House later this week – possibly on Wednesday.
The prime minister did not address MPs in the Commons in the wake of the voting process, but Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said that the country could still avoid a no-deal exit by backing May’s battered deal.
“The default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days’ time” without a deal, he said.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that if May could put her agreement to the House over and over again, other options should be put to votes again too.
Corbyn had attempted to whip his MPs in favour of backing the Customs Union. There were, however, 10 Labour MPs who voted against, swinging the vote against the motion.

(D) Common Market 2.0

(G) Revoke Article 50 if faced with no-deal Brexit
This motion from the SNP MP said that if there was no deal by 10 April an extension should be sought. If no extension was granted by the EU, it mandated the government to put a vote on no-deal to the House of Commons.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will today repeat weekend warnings to MPs poised to reject her EU divorce deal that failing to deliver Brexit would be “catastrophic” for British democracy.
On the eve of tomorrow’s monumental vote in parliament on her withdrawal agreement – forged from 18 months of gruelling negotiations with European leaders – May is set to address factory workers in Stoke, a Brexit-backing city in central England.
The embattled leader, who is widely expected to lose the House of Commons vote by a wide margin, will make a final bid for support by arguing: “We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.
“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,” May is expected to say, according to excerpts of her speech released by her office.
“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote?” she will ask.
‘No confidence in the government’
Britain is set to leave the European Union on 29 March but, with less than 11 weeks left, has yet to finalise the terms of its departure.
May’s deal agrees a 21-month transition period under current terms while the future relationship with the bloc is negotiated, but it has drawn steadfast opposition from both Brexiteers and Remainers.
The prime minister has said rejecting it will throw Britain into “uncharted territory” and put the country at risk of crashing out without an agreement, or even no Brexit at all.
The opposition Labour Party, which favours remaining in a permanent customs union with the EU, has suggested it will seek a no-confidence vote in the government if MPs throw out the plan.
The Observer newspaper reported yesterday that its lawmakers have been told it could be tabled “within hours” of that tomorrow, with the confidence vote to be held the following day.
If the government lose a no-confidence motion, there will be a period of 14 days in which parties can seek to find an alternative working majority in parliament.

If they fail to do so, a general election would be called.
“We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing, but it’s going to be soon, don’t worry about it,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC yesterday.
Corbyn conceded if the party won power, parliament would likely need to delay Brexit beyond 29 March so it could renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.
‘A very British coup’
The prime minister already postponed a House of Commons vote on her plan in December to avoid defeat – and MPs look set to reject it again tomorrow.
Lawmakers who believe it either leaves Britain too close or too distant from the bloc, fired ominous warning shots this week, voting to force the prime minister to quickly set out an alternative plan for Brexit if she loses the vote.
It was her second setback in 24 hours after MPs also voted to deny the government certain taxation powers in a no-deal scenario – in a bid to avoid such an outcome.
The Sunday Times said a group of senior cross-party backbench rebels are now plotting to change House of Commons rules to enable them to override government business if the deal falls.
Described as “a very British coup”, the plan would see May lose control of parliamentary business to MPs, threatening her ability to govern, the newspaper said.
It said Downing Street was “extremely concerned” about the possibility, which could see lawmakers then delay Brexit through new legislation.
Conservative MP Nick Boles, who favours a Norway-style relationship which would keep Britain in the EU’s single market, told the paper he was exploring tactics in the Commons to rule out a no-deal scenario.
“We have a mechanism which will give parliament control of the Brexit negotiations and ensure we do not leave the EU without a deal on 29 March,” he said.
“I am working on ways to achieve that outcome,” Boles said, indicating he would publish the plan tomorrow.

IT’S BEEN ALMOST a year since the Beast from the East covered the country in snow and brought Ireland to a standstill.
Flights, trains and other public transport was disrupted; students were told they had a few days off, and some companies told their employees to stay at home.
But before the snow even hit, it was having an impact. On the eve before the storm hit, stores across Ireland reported that they were experiencing a surge in demand for bread (and other products).
Stores looked to reassure their customers: Tesco, Lidl and Supervaluall asked their suppliersto provide extra stocks to meet the increased demand.
At the end of February, ahead of a snow-ice warning brought on by the Beast from the East and Storm Emma,a spokesman for bread suppliers Johnston, Mooney and O’BrientoldTheJournal.iethat the company had “significantly increased our production to meet the dramatic increase in sales being experienced” due to the “unprecedented demand levels experienced yesterday and today”.
Looking back now, what made us go mad for bread?
“I think it was a bit of a comfort but also a slight bit of panic,” Gerald Cunningham, president of the Flour Confectioners and Bakers Association tellsTheJournal.ie.
“But there’s also the community side of it, and the fear of ‘God, if we’ve no bread what are we going to eat?’ It’s a staple in Irish houses.”
Melanie MayMelanie May
Cunningham said that there is also a “very Irish feel” and a “traditional” element to bread for Irish people that makes them feel they need it in their house regularly.
In a study commissioned for bread week, it analysed why people rushed to buy bread. It found that 40% of people felt reassured by simply having bread in the house, and that sharing bread increased their sense of social solidarity.
The survey, which asked 1,000 adults on the island of Ireland a series of questions about their consumption of bread, found that 95% of those surveyed ate it at least once a week.
Around 30% of people stockpile bread, and 40% have bread in the freezer.

Brexit
This March, breadmakers (and eaters) are facing a new and totally different threat: Brexit.
There are three mills on the island of Ireland, with just one located in the Republic of Ireland – in Portarlington, Co Laois.
Shutterstock / forstbreathShutterstock / forstbreath / forstbreath
However, it only produces retail flour, as in the bags sold on shelves for home baking. With those minuscule numbers, 95% of all flour used for making bread actually comes from the UK.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, tariffs will be placed on these flour imports which could result in a charge of €172 per tonne of flour
This would then have an knock-on impact on the price of bread; Cunningham says the price could rise by between 10% and 15% in a no-deal Brexit scenario.
If this were to happen, bakers could start looking for flour suppliers outside of the UK, which could result in massive job losses to British mills.
As people try to prepare for the worst case scenario, the options for bakers are limited, Cunningham says.
He adds that smaller artisan bakers might be able to stockpile flour ahead of the threat of increased tariffs, but that was more difficult for industrial chains that would need more space.
There’s also the additional difficulty that some flour actually has a shelf life of around 4 months, meaning that if a baker buys flour now to stockpile, that baker has to be sure that all of it will be used in that timeframe.
Sugar imports would also be hit with high tariffs in a no-deal Brexit; although sugar isn’t used in breadmaking, many bakers are also confectionery makers, so would be affected by this, too.
Is Cunningham worried that Brexit will mean more bread shortages and empty shelves, or will they be more full than they are now because bread will be a lot more expensive?
“The main point is that ports need to stay open and free-flowing, the same with the borders,” he says.
“I can’t see a benefit from a hard Brexit… I really would like to think that politicians would see common sense to postpone it and negotiate it properly.
“It’s the uncertainty of it, we’re being asked all the time what’s the policy – we’re just kind of headlining a hard-Brexit scenario.”

Responding to a poll for Claire Byrne Live/Amárach Research, 44% of people said they felt that a referendum on a united Ireland should be held.
However, 35% of people felt that a referendum should not be held, while a further 21% said they didn’t know.
There has been increasing speculation that the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 29 March could eventually lead to the unification of the Republic and Northern Ireland.
In December,Tánaiste Simon Coveneysaid that it would be “difficult” to avoid a hard border if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal, meaning that customs checks would be implemented on goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic.
It’s believed that such a move would lead to calls on both sides of the border for Irish unification, with some arguing that it could allow cross-border business to continue as normal after Brexit and avoid a return to the violence seen during the Troubles.
The poll questions were carried out by Amarách Research for Claire Byrne Live on Monday 21 January.
The Claire Byrne Live/Amarách Research Panel consists of over 1,000 Irish adults.

“I’m honoured they have picked me to stand in the South West, which is where I call home. I went to school there, my father was born in Penzance and we have family dating back to the 1600s in my local village,” she said.
Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is the front runner topping the polls to replace Theresa May as Conservative party leader if she resigns, according to theDaily Mail.
This week, MPs are returning to the House of Commons following the Easter break when official talks between the prime minister and Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn will resume.

BRITISH REGIONAL AIRLINE Flybmi has announced it will cease operations and file for administration, blaming spikes in fuel, carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit.
Parent company British Midland Regional Limited said it had cancelled all flights with immediate effect, and would not be able to purchase, rearrange or reschedule any bookings on behalf of customers.
Flybmi, based in the East Midlands region of England, operated routes to 25 European cities, and had 376 employees based in Britain, Germany, Sweden and Belgium.
“It is with a heavy heart that we have made this unavoidable announcement today,” a company spokesperson said in a statement posted on its website.
“The airline has faced several difficulties, including recent spikes in fuel and carbon costs.

“Current trading and future prospects have also been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process,” the spokesperson added.
Flybmi had been unable to secure post-Brexit flying contracts in Europe and feared it may not be able to continue serving destinations on the continent after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March, according to the statement.
“Against this background, it has become impossible for the airline’s shareholders to continue their extensive programme of funding into the business, despite investment totalling over £40 million in the last six years,” it said.
The airline, which said it carried 522,000 passengers on 29,000 flights last year, operated under codeshare agreements with a host of European partners, including Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines and Air France.
Its flights operated out of Aberdeen, Bristol, East Midlands, London Stansted, Newcastle and Derry in Britain as well as a host of European airports, including Frankurt, Milan Bergamo, Munich, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
In lengthy advice posted online, it told customers not to travel to airports unless they have re-booked flights with alternative providers.
It advised them to seek refunds for their cancelled reservations from credit card companies, booking websites or travel insurance providers.","8.20am, 17 Feb 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/used-car-sales-ireland-2018-4438945-Jan2019/,"IRISH CAR BUYERS imported a record number of used cars in 2018, with a strong Euro driving consumers to hunt for deals in the United Kingdom.
Officials statistics compiled by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry show that 100,755 used cars were imported in 2018, the overwhelming majority of which (95.8%) were imported from the UK.
An analysis by Fexco Corporate Payments found a 59% increase in imports from the UK last year compared with 2017.
The average cost paid for vehicles imported from the UK by individual Irish buyers was €21,612, a 34% rise in the average figure paid in 2017.
According to Fexco, that figure showed that Irish motorists who imported cars directly from the UK ordered higher specification models.
David Lamb,Fexco’s head of dealing,said that Irish consumers were following a trend first noticed by Irish car dealers in the wake of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in 2016.
“For years the cost – and red tape – of importing a UK-registered car into Ireland put off all but professional dealers or the most committed individual motorists,” he said.
“Sterling’s continued weakness has shifted that calculus, prompting ever more Irish motorists to look to the UK for their next car.”

Clear trend
Meanwhile,DoneDeal’s Motor Industry review for 2018also revealed that 640,326 used cars were sold in Ireland during 2018, a 3.6% drop from 664,253 in 2017.
The website’s analysis found that Volkswagen was Ireland’s most popular used car brand last year, with 87,992 Volkswagens changing hands.
The German manufacturer was followed by Toyota (73,834 sold), Ford (71,882 sold), Nissan (49,938 sold) and Audi (37,714 sold).
The analysis also showed the makes and models sold last year that retained their market value the most from when they were bought as new in 2015.
The car that maintained its value the most since 2015 was the Skoda Octavia, which had an average depreciation of 22%, followed by the Volkswagen Golf (27%) and the Ford Focus (36%).
Separately, searches of electric and hybrid vehicles also increased on the site last year, with over 2 million electric car searches taking place on DoneDeal in 2018, compared to just under 950,0000 in 2017.
DoneDeal’s Martin Clancy said that searches for vehicles on the website represented a clear trend when it came to consumer behaviour.
“Electric car searches surged 110% compared with 2017, hybrid searches are up 83% while Diesel dipped by 14% during the same period,” he said.
Clancy added that 20% fewer new diesels were sold via DoneDeal in 2018 compared with 2017, and said just over half of car ads on the website last year were for cars with diesel engines.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leadership-theresa-may-resign-next-leader-conservatives-4649895-May2019/,"CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS, following Theresa May’sannouncement todayof her resignation, could prove crucial in electing the next British prime minister.
The current rules were introduced in 1998, after the landslide victory of Tony Blair in 1997 forced the Conservative Party into a significant period of reflection and reform.
The rules for electing a party leader see Conservative MPs select a choice of two candidates, who are then put to party members who can choose their next leader in a vote.
In each round of voting among MPs, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is knocked out until only two remain.
The length of the contest and other procedures are decided by the 18-person executive of party’s powerful 1922 Committee, which is made up of all Tory backbench MPs and currently chaired by Graham Brady.
We can expect the exact rules and timetable to be announced in the coming days. In 2016, for instance, each candidate had to be nominated by two other MPs.

How Theresa became PM
When Theresa May was elected leader in July 2016, following David Cameron’s resignation in the wake of the Brexit referendum, members did not end up receiving a vote.
Instead, after two ballots of MPs, all May’s competitors had been either eliminated or withdrawn.
In the contest, May competed with a crowded field that included Liam Fox, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom. Boris Johnson was notably absent from the contest, having dropped out of the race whenGove announcedhe was running.
The withdrawal of Leadsom came following an interviewwhere she suggestedthat being a mother gave her a greater stake in the future of British society compared to May – remarks that prompted widespread condemnation.
In 2005, there was a vote among members. Following two ballots, David Davis (who more recently emerged as Brexit Secretary following the referendum before resigning in July 2018) and David Cameron were the two candidates to face party members and Cameron won with 68% of the vote to lead the party and become leader of the opposition.
Today, with so many MPs vying for the leadership position, it’s likely that the Conservative party’s124,000 memberswill ultimately end up deciding who the next British prime minister is.

History lesson
The Conservative Party has not always given members such a significant say in leadership selection and have had a number of different systems for electing a leader since the end of the the Second World War.
An election process was introduced following the party’s defeat at the 1964 general election. However, it remained tightly controlled by Tory MPs. Between 1965 and 1997, the Conservatives used a system of successive ballots designed to maintain as much parliamentary party control as possible and to encourage MPs to elect a candidate who enjoyed broad support across the party. Grassroots members did not have a say.
As for what happens now? We don’t know yet how long the contest will last. Nominations will close in the week commencing 10 June, before voting among MPs begins, with the expectation that there could be a new Tory leader and British prime minister by mid-July.
Boris Johnson is the overwhelming favourite to succeed Theresa May. He hasconsiderable supportamong the Tory grassroots members – even if some of his parliamentary colleagues have vociferously expressed their opposition to a Johnson premiership.
If he can make it through to the last two, he could well be on his way to a meeting with the Queen later this summer.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-hard-border-soldiers-4459271-Jan2019/,"WHEN ASKED WHAT a hard border would look “if things go very wrong” with Brexit,  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said soldiers could return.
During an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos today Varadkar was asked what the border is going to look like “if they screw this up”.
Varadkar said it would “involve people in uniform and it may involve the need, for example, for cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up”.
With the Withdrawal Agreement being voted down by the House of Commons, and no border solutions being put forward by the British, the Taoiseach’s comments are viewed as stark warning as 29 March rapidly approaches.
Fianna Fáil leader Mícheál Martin said that the Taoiseach’s comments represented a significant shift in the government’s rhetoric.
“When the Taoiseach tells an audience in Davos that the Army may have to be sent to the border, he is contradicting everything that we have been told (by him and the Tánaiste) about preparations. It is hard to see how this helps our case.”
While there is much speculation about what form a border between the Republic and Northern Ireland could look like in the case of a no-deal scenario, it is understood the Taoiseach was not talking about sending Irish troops to the border and that it was not a statement of intent.
Staying firm on the backstop
He told Bloomberg Television that the Irish government was standing “firm” on its position on the backstop mechanism to avoid a hard border stating that no other alternatives have been put forward by the UK.

While he said he is open to compromise, if the UK compromise on their red lines, he will not back down on the backstop.
The “objective is to avoid a hard border” he explained, adding:
He said some UK politicians are stating that they are against the backstop but are also in favour of avoiding a hard border – adding that the two don’t marry.
Talk around technologies that do not exist yet is also not a solution, he added.
“No one has been able to show them to me,” said Varadkar, adding that the Irish government will not roll back on the backstop “for a promise to solve it later or talk about technologies that do not exist yet”.
“We have given a lot already… why is it that the country that is being victimised is the one that is always being asked to give,” he asked.
Speaking on the RTE Six One News this evening, Minister of State for Public Procurement, Open Government and eGovernment Patrick O’Donovan said that the Taoiseach was only repeating what had been said before.
He said that it didn’t matter whether the Taoiseach made comments “in Davos or Dingle”, and that what he was saying was that “the border of the past is not what we want to see in the future”.
“The Taoiseach was outlining a position that could potentially happen in a no-deal scenario that we’re not envisaging,” O’Donovan said.
“The Taoiseach was articulating what he’s been saying all along,” he said, adding that they would not return to a border with physical infrastructure that needed to be policed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-donald-trump-capitol-hill-lunch-4542885-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reports from Washington DC:
SLICK, POLISHED AND for everything to go off without a hitch – that’s what Varadkar was hoping for in Washington after thingsdidn’t exactly work out that waylast year.
You may recall the tenor of the domestic headlines exactly 12 months ago today after the  Taoiseach joked at a Capitol Hill lunch about intervening on behalf of Donald Trump in order to stop a wind farm being built near Doonbeg.
This time around, the traditional schedule of Washington events went more smoothly.
Notably, headlines in the international press were dominated by the Taoiseach’s breakfast meeting with Vice President Mike Pence.
Pence, who has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT rights, told Varadkar last year that his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome at his official residence at this year’s St Patrick’s breakfast.
And speaking at the event – which was open to press, in a departure from last year – the Taoiseach gave remarks noting that in modern day Ireland politicians were judged not by their sexual orientation, “skin tone, gender or religious beliefs” but by their actions.
TheWashington Post notedin its piece: “This is the first time that Pence has hosted the partner of an openly gay world leader at his residence, though that may simply be a reflection of their low numbers.”
The headline in The Guardianobserved that Varadkar had delivered “pointed remarks on sexuality”.
The Daily Beast stated: ‘Mike Pence Meets With Ireland’s First Openly Gay Prime Minister’.
Business Insider was a little more direct with it’s headline:
‘The Irish Prime Minister brought his boyfriend to meet Vice President Pence’

Pence, and his sister Anne (Pence’s wife is away at the Special Olympics) welcomed the couple, making small talk in front of the cameras.
There was some speculation over whether Varadkar would mention the issue of gay rights – but his comments on the issue, delivered from a podium as the vice president looked on, were to the point. Pence is deeply religious, so it’s notable that Varadkar rolled out the expression ‘all God’s children’.
He told the guests he had always been fascinated by US politics “in many ways it helped to inspire me to believe in the power of politics to do good because ultimately that is what politics is all about”.
“It helped inspire me to run for office. I also knew at the time that I lived in a country where if I tried to be myself, at the time I would have ended up breaking laws.
“But today that has all changed. I stand here as leader of my country, flawed and human, where I am judged by my political actions and not my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.
“And I don’t think my country is the only one in the world where this story is possible. It is found in every country where liberty is cherished.
Brian LawlessBrian Lawless
Of course, the breakfast was dotted with the usual talk of Irish ancestry, with Pence stating that he yearned to return to his homestead in Ireland, adding that plans are underway for his mother and him to return this year.
The Taoiseach said he was delighted that the vice president had decided to take him up on his invite, and that he would happy if they could visit Ireland. Varadkar also commended Pence’s mother, who still has acúpla focal.
Gaffe free
The Taoiseach managed to avoid the gaffes of last year, limiting the jokes and anecdotes and keeping the mood rather serious in his speech on Capitol Hill.
The lunch is one of only two official occasions each year that the US president visits the Hill.

Taking to the podium, Trump said he had gotten to know his “friend” Varadkar “very well” in recent years, telling the crowd that he could barely believe this was his third St Patrick’s Day as president.

While there were tributes to the Irish diaspora, their hard-work and inspiration to America, the focus, just as it had in the Oval Office earlier, turned to Brexit.
Trump said Brexit is “turning out to be a little more complex than they thought it will be, but it’s all going to work out. It always does.”
He thanked Varadkar for briefing him on Ireland’s position, and said he respected the country’s position.
Earlier, sitting alongside Varadkar at the White House, Trump told reporters that he was surprised at just how badly Brexit negotiations had gone.
He also claimed tohave offered his advice to Theresa May, but said she didn’t listen to it (he didn’t expand on the nature of the advice).
There was notable tension in the air in the White House when Trump let rip into the EU for treating the US “badly”.
“They are willing to talk to us and if they don’t talk to us we are going to do something that is going to be pretty severe economically… they have treated us very badly,” said Trump, who then threatened to tariff European products.
At the lunch, Trump said Brexit had turned out to be a little more complex than expected, but he thanked the Taoiseach for bringing him up to speed.
While the UK’s exit from the EU dominated, Varadkar managed to get one other Irish issue into his speech: the E3 Visa.
The visa is currently only offered by the US to Australian citizens. Because Australians only use about half of their allotment, Ireland is seeking access to the remainder of the unused visas.
“I believe the new E3 visa programme is true to our shared history and offers a chance for a new generation of talented, hard-working dreamers to give something to this great country. I hope that will come to pass,” said Varadkar.
Later it emerged that Trumphad personally spokento the sole senator holding up progress on the issue.

There were some slightly odd, freewheeling comments from Trump later at the traditional shamrock ceremony, when the Presidentobserved of the Irish:
“They’re smart. They’re sharp. They’re great. And they’re brutal enemies!”
Varadkar, in his own speech, congratulated Trump on the “booming” American economy.
“Your ambition is to make America great again, and we can see the results today,” Varadkar said.

In the crowd, that peculiarly Irish-American phrase “top of the mornin’ to ya” could be heard.
But aside from that and Trump’s awkward pronunciation of Varadkar’s title (‘Tea-SHOCK’ … it had been spelt phonetically on the autocue) there weren’t too many cringeworthy moments this year, compared to the last few visits.
Nothing close to, for instance, Paul Ryan andthe Worst Pint of Guinness Imaginable.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-may-good-friday-4450572-Jan2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Jan 2019
THE EUROPEAN UNION’S lead Brexit negotiator has dismissed reports of a bilateral arrangement between the UK and Ireland.
In an interview withRTÉ News, Michel Barnier said the EU negotiated as one team.
Meanwhile, a question mark has been raised over the controversial backstop today, after Poland suggested the backstop could have a five-year limit.
However, it is understood that Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said that does not represent the thinking of other EU leaders.
Barnier told RTÉ’s Tony Connolly that the backstop was agreed as an “all weather” insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, he said.
He added that the focus was now on the future relationship and the political declaration which sketches that relationship.
Earlier today Downing Street rejected a report intoday’s Daily Telegraphnewspaper that Prime Minister Theresa May is considering rewriting a portion of the Good Friday Agreement so she can help get her Brexit deal through.
The prime minister is due to address the House of Commons today to outline the so-called “plan B” on Brexit, after her original deal was roundly defeated last week.
One of the proposals that could form this plan B would be rewriting the historic 1998 Good Friday Agreement to assure Ireland the UK is committed to ensuring no hard border, the Telegraph reported.
Members of her cabinet believe such a plan would avoid having to commit to the Northern Irish backstop – the red line issue for Ireland and the EU which was a key reason May lost the vote on her Brexit deal by such a wide margin last week.
However, after this report emerged Downing Street said that such assertions were incorrect, and the Good Friday Agreement couldn’t be changed.
Downing Street sources have rejected reports in the Daily Telegraph that the Good Friday Agreement could be re-written to avoid the need for a backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement... because it couldn’t be.— David Blevins (@skydavidblevins)January 20, 2019David Blevins/ Twitter
Downing Street sources have rejected reports in the Daily Telegraph that the Good Friday Agreement could be re-written to avoid the need for a backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement... because it couldn’t be.
Changing the deal – which set out a blueprint for peace after decades of violence in the North – is seen as a non-runner for the EU, Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Speaking onMorning Ireland on RTÉ Radio Onetoday, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the agreement was  “not negotiable”.
“Everything that we’re hearing in the last day or two is speculation, and until the Prime Minister actually brings something forward today and we actually hear what it is she has to say, all of this is speculation,” she said.
“But suggestions that we would amend, change, delete, or remove parts of the Good Friday Agreement are not something that we would be considering even looking at.”

Backstop
May must find some way of winning over the Eurosceptics within her own party and the DUP if her Brexit deal is to go through – and some way that avoids the backstop she agreed with the EU is vital for the prime minister.
The Irish backstop, which is referred to in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement as “the Protocol” is a promise that if all efforts to close a deal fail, that there will be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland to avoid a hard border.
This would mean that rules and regulations in Northern Ireland would have to be similar to the EU’s/Ireland’s rules, to avoid customs checks or posts that would make up a hard border.
Graham Brady, who chairs the Conservative MP backbenchers’ group, said he thought May could get her Brexit deal past Conservative rebels if the Irish backstop “can be sorted out”.
“So much of the vote against was from people who simply cannot support a potentially permanent backstop, if that can be sorted out then I think we might get that withdrawal agreement through,” he told BBC radio over the weekend.
He said it was in Ireland’s interests to help Britain leave the EU with a deal, saying they would be far more hurt by a no-deal Brexit that Britain as most of their trade comes through the UK.
What happens today
May will address the Commons today to outline her new plans for Brexit, but has little time to win a consensus with roughly 10 weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the EU.
EU chiefs have so far ruled out renegotiating the agreement, but have signalled they could postpone the withdrawal if May changes her “red lines” on leaving the EU’s customs union and blocking free movement of citizens.
After May sets out her plans for the way ahead, MPs are set to table a series of amendments, to be voted upon on January 29.
