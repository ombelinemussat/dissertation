AWARD-WINNING DUBLIN BURGER restaurant BuJo has asked Dublin City Council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its Sandymount Green outlet.
The firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”.
A restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the Dublin 4 site.
At the time, An Bord Pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”.
BuJo opened in the space in 2017. In a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor RW Nowlan & Associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties.
It stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the Dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”.
“The subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said.
Unlike a traditional takeaway shop, BuJo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates.

BuJo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line:

The crux of Bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003.
It stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”.
In response to queries fromFora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “Dublin City Council are investigating this matter. The Planning Enforcement Section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.”
The spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”.
Separately in recent weeks, Mexican burrito bar Boojum Boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its Dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules.

https://www.the42.ie/tyrone-dublin-league-report-4546910-Mar2019/,"Kevin O’Brien reports from Croke Park
THIS WIN HAS been a long time coming for Mickey Harte.
The Tyrone boss enjoyed his second ever victory against Jim Gavin, with his latest one arriving six years to the day after the first.
On their first outing at Jones’ Road since the All-Ireland final defeat, Tyrone put away an off-colour Dublin by three points in a confident display.
They consigned the Dubs to their third league defeat of the campaign – the most league losses they’ve ever suffered in Gavin’s tenure.
It means the reigning league and All-Ireland champions are out of the race to reach the Division 1 final – the first year since he’s taken charge that they’ve failed to make the decider.
Kerry, Mayo, Galway and Tyrone are left in the running to meet in the final.
This was a performance that Tyrone will file away for later in the summer. They played out the final 20 minutes with a man less after Niall Sludden’s red card, making the win even more impressive.
Their two-man full-forward line of Mattie Donnelly and man-of-the-match Cathal McShane were in electric form, contributing 1-7 between them.
Crucially, Tyrone delivered early ball into their inside duo and it reaped dividends.

Richie Donnelly was excellent at midfield too, and his strong form means Tyrone can afford to leave his brother Mattie further forward.
Dublin’s most dangerous attacker in the opening half was Cormac Costello and rattled in his second goal of the campaign just four minutes into the game.
Worryingly for Dublin, the in-form Whitehall Colmcilles forward limped off shortly before the break with a knee injury. Dublin had already lost John Small by that stage, while Tyrone’s Tiernan McCann only last until 12 minutes when a hamstring problem forced him off.

Tyrone’s energy and appetite for work troubled Dublin in the first period. They blew two early goal chances before McShane eventually capitalised on a quality ball inside by Mattie Donnelly.
It was a move that displayed McShane’s brain and brawn. He initially outmuscled David Byrne and his low finish past Stephen Cluxton was a picture of calmness.
Tyrone led by 1-7 to 1-5 at the interval and the sides went tit-for-tat in the third quarter.
The Red Hand’s inside pair of Donnelly and McShane continued to do damage with nearly ever delivery that went into them.
Tyrone’s use of the advanced mark was excellent as Peter Harte and McShane both scored from the experimental rule. Kilkenny slotted over Dublin’s third point from play of the half in the 62nd minute on a night where their attack failed to hit its usual heights.
A late Mannion free was all they could muster in the form of a comeback as Tyrone defended in numbers and sealed the victory.
Scorers for Tyrone:Cathal McShane 1-4 (0-2m, 0-1f), Mattie Donnelly and Peter Harte (0-1m, 0-2f) 0-3 each, Richard Donnelly and Niall Morgan (0-2f) 0-2 each.
Scorers for Dublin:Paul Mannion 0-4 (0-2f, 0-1m), Cormac Costello 1-0, Ciaran Kilkenny and Dean Rock (0-2f) 0-2 each, Brian Fenton and Con O’Callaghan 0-1 each.

THE DEPARTMENT OF Health on Dublin’s Baggot St has reopened after being evacuated this afternoon.
An envelope full of non-hazardous white powder was sent to the building, prompting the evacuation.
Minister for Health Simon Harris was inside at the time. The minister and all staff in the department were removed to safety. It’s understood the minister was not in the room when the envelope was opened.
The Minister has since thanked the emergency services for their diligence in responding to the issue:

Following the discovery, staff members exposed to the powder were told they have to be ‘cleaned’ and isolated, sources said.
Technicians from the Defence Forces have since confirmed that the powder was non-hazardous and was handed over to the Gardaí, who attended the scene along with Defence Force members at the building on Miesian Plaza, the site of the former Bank of Ireland.
A Defence Forces spokesperson confirmed bomb disposal experts had been deployed this afternoon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/valentines-day-deals-supermarkets-4535989-Mar2019/,"GROCERY SALES INCREASED by 3.5% in the latest retail period thanks, in part, to a bumper Valentine’s trade which saw  the sale of traditional gifts surge.
Traditional Valentine’s Day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was Dunnes Stores which remained Ireland’s top retailer, while Aldi recorded double digit sales growth.
The latest figures show the Irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 February 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the UK finalises preparations to leave the EU.
After a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists Kantar.Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since February 2017.
But it was convenience store Valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a February boost.

He said: “While many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for Valentine’s Day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home.
“Convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in.  Valentine’s Day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.”

The market has also benefited from a weaker pound.
Faughnan added: ” A stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made British imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to Irish consumers.  However, with prices already rising as Britain’s exit from the EU draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year.
“More than €3.5 billion of food is imported to Ireland from the UK, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/museum-programme-4553379-Mar2019/,"A HISTORY OF Ireland’s wars, the Irish pictures of a renowned photojournalist and the impact of rural electrification on the lives of women in the home are some of the main features of this year’s National Museum of Ireland programme.
The NMI today launched its 2019 programme, which will see five temporary exhibitions staged by the museum alongside its usual long-term collections.
The museum said its programme will keep in line with its Master Vision Statement 2018 – 2032 with a commitment to engage diverse and new audiences.
The theme of the 2019 programme of events is “Community”.
The five flagship temporary exhibitions which form part of this year’s programme are:
The First Dáil – ‘Marching on the Road to Freedom: Dáil Éireann 1919′
A new exhibition on display at Collins Barracks since January and running until the end of the year, it commemorates the first meeting of Dáil Éireann on 21 January 1919.
Notable artefacts include the ‘Declaration of Independence’ handwritten by Éamon de Valera; boots worn by Harry Boland during his secret trip to the USA; the seal of Dáil Éireann, used by the first and second Dáil.
(A)Dressing Our Hidden Truths – An artistic response to the legacy of mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries by Alison Lowry
This exhibition is an artistic response to exposing parts of the countries past that were hidden truths for many years, including – the Magdalene Laundries, Mother and Baby Homes, Industrial Schools and rape culture.
It will launch at Collins Barracks next week and run for the remainder of the year.

Henri Cartier-Bresson
An exhibition of 50 images of Ireland – as well as notes, correspondence, original contact prints, and associated artefacts – taken by world-renowned photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson will run at Collins Barracks from May to September.
Kitchen Power: Women’s experiences of rural electrification
An exhibition looking at the impact of rural electrification, and in particular the effect of rural electrification on women in the Irish home in the 1950s and 1960s.
It will run from July this year until May 2020 at National Museum of Ireland – Country Life, in Castlebar, Co Mayo.
Irish Wars
A conference and exhibition commemorating Ireland’s War of Independence and Civil War. The exhibition will open on 3 December this year.
As well as the temporary exhibitions NMI will have its long-term collection spanning archaeology, decorative arts, history, ethnography, folk life and natural history open to the public.
It will also host and sponsor a number of education and community outreach events throughout the year.
‘Preserve and present the stories of Ireland’
Commenting on the upcoming programme, Lynn Scarff – who became director of the NMI in July of last year – said:
“At the National Museum of Ireland, our role is to preserve and present the stories of Ireland and its place in the world and it is with that in mind that we have designed our programme of activities for 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-10-4533012-Mar2019/,"AFTER WEEKS, and months, and years of political wrangling, this week will see the most crucial set of decisions made by British politicians to determine the course of Brexit.
As outlined here, there could be as many as three vital votes in the House of Commons this week with a number of options on the table.
Advertisement
The first option MPs will vote on is set for Tuesday on Theresa May’s much-maligned withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop provision that is so loathed by the DUP and hardline Brexiteers.
If they vote against Theresa May’s deal, MPs will be asked to vote on if they want a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday.
And, if they vote against a no deal, then they’ll be voting again on Thursday on whether to extend Brexit.
So, what do you think?Which vote is most likely to pass in Westminster this week?Poll Results:Vote to delay Brexit(7010)Vote for no-deal Brexit(1623)Vote for Theresa May's deal(556)Not sure(517)Vote for Theresa May's dealVote for no-deal BrexitVote to delay BrexitNot sureVote","10.24am, 10 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-judgement-day-4536136-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Mar 2019
THE HOUSE OF Commons will be the stage today as British MPs will vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, a day after she secured new assurances from the EU that may give her a chance of getting her deal passed.
It remains to be seen whether the new guarantees will be enough to sway Brexiteers within her own party and the DUP to back her Brexit deal.
Leo Varadkar had been due to travel to Washington, but remained in Dublin this morning.
The Taoiseach said that the new arrangements made do not change the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop, and the “doubts and fears” raised by Brexiteers can be put to bed.
He told reporters: “I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons.”
Varadkar added that what has been agreed “reiterates our wish to have as close as possible a future relationship with the UK”.
Chief among the guarantees is on the Irish backstop – the solution that would keep Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU trade rules and thus negate the need for a hard border in Ireland.
The new guarantees say that every effort will be made to ensure the Irish backstop never needs to be enacted and measures through which any attempt to make the backstop apply indefinitely can be legally challenged.
Speaking last night at a joint press conference, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that the existing withdrawal agreement had not changed, but the guarantees given to the UK “complements the withdrawal agreement without reopening it”.
“In politics sometimes you get a second chance, it is what we do with this second chance that counts because there will be no third chance,” Juncker said. “There will be no further interpretation of the interpretation. No further assurances on the reassurances if the meaningful vote fails [today].”
May, however, claimed that “legally binding changes” to the withdrawal agreement had been secured.
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” May said.

Meanwhile, there is uncertainty whether this will change the legal advice given to the UK government by its attorney general Geoffrey Cox.
Channel 4 news anchor Jon Snow said a source had told him the legal world is aware that the attorney general said “no” to the validity of May’s new EU deal, and has been told to find a way to say yes to it.
This was met with a bizarre tweet in reply by Cox himself, who said simply “bollocks”.

Labour has announced it will vote against the deal, and said the prime minister had “failed”.
“This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament,” said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Brexit hardliners from May’s Conservative Party and the DUP have said they will scrutinise the documents that have been agreed.
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said this morning that he believes the new arrangements appear to “fall short” of what May has promised, but added that his party would reserve judgement until they heard the Attorney General’s advice.
It will take a major turnaround for May to get this deal through parliament, after it lost by a majority of 230 votes in January.
The vote is due to take place at around 7pm this evening.
Another defeat would set the stage for additional votes in parliament this week that could postpone Brexit and possibly reverse it in the months to come.
If she loses the vote, May has promised to give MPs a vote tomorrow on whether Britain should simply leave without any deal at all.
If MPs would defeat the “no-deal” scenario, it would be followed on Thursday with a vote on requesting a delay from the EU.

https://www.the42.ie/mick-mccarthy-squad-announcement-4529022-Mar2019/,"IF YOU THOUGHT the naming of bloated provisional squads was solely the preserve of the previous regime, you’re wrong.
McCarthy named a 38-man squad today, featuring fully five goalkeepers (although Caoimhin Kelleher will be with the U21s at the start of the camp so will only be available for the Georgia game).
The manager will then whittle that squad down to a 23-man panel by St Patrick’s Day, as the training camp begins the following day.
One of the reasons his initial selection is so large is because it’s the first.
“I’ve not had to name them before, have I? So if I didn’t name them, they might think I’m not interested and they don’t have a chance of getting in.”
There’s also a pragmatism to naming such a big squad with another round of club fixtures to go ahead: if an injury to a key player pushes in someone from the periphery of the squad, their presence in a provisional squad makes it easier to include them.
Many of you won’t know this, but when the majority of the already-sparse crowd fled for the bars and toilets at half-time of the Northern Ireland game in November, Glenn Whelan was subject to a presentation to thank him for his international service.
The stadium was barely a quarter-full at that point: proof that even the reward for his best work goes unseen.
While that was supposedly Whelan’s final game for Ireland, his retirement lasted a single game.
That retirement call was made by Martin O’Neill, however, as when McCarthy rang Whelan to ask if he had actually retired, he was told, “I haven’t.”
There is no guarantee that Whelan will make the final squad for this double-header, but McCarthy did speak of how he offers Ireland a rare option at defensive midfield.

There are a few other returning faces: David McGoldrick is back after finding himself out in the cold under O’Neill, and Keiren Westwood likewise; Stephen Ward returns, too, as does Aiden McGeady.

The Sunderland winger hasn’t played for Ireland since the 5-1 Episode against Denmark, which he curiously ended as a defensive midfielder.
When McCarthy quit the job after defeat to Switzerland in 2002, he was supported in sections of Her Majesty’s Press. The most vociferous backer was Paul Hayward of the Telegraph, who wrote that “the Republic’s problem is not too little success but too much”, claiming that Irish fans were carting around “delusions of grandeur.”
Given the recent fare, there are very few Irish fans similarly afflicted today.
Of the 38 players in McCarthy’s squad, just 13 are currently playing with a Premier League club. Of that group, two – Mark Travers and Caoimhin Kelleher – are yet to make a senior appearance for their clubs, while Stephen Ward has made one league appearance this season, which is one more than James McCarthy has made thus far this year.
It’s a considerable dilution of the quality available to McCarthy: of the 14 players he used in his final game in charge, for example, all but two played in England’s top flight.
Of the eight strikers included in today’s squad, by contrast, only Shane Long is playing in the Premier League. Ronan Curtis and James Collins are playing in League One, while Padraig Amond supplements his FA Cup heroics with a day job in League Two.
McCarthy bristled, however, at the suggestion that he is now picking a lower standard of player.
I think that’s a little unfair to call them a lower standard of players. I’m talking about players who are playing at their level and are scoring goals. I don’t think that can be easily dismissed.
“Both James Collins and Padraig Amond have had good seasons. And that should be recognised in that I’ve called them up, rather than insulting them, which I’m not going to do.”
Patrick Bamford isn’t in this squad, although having declared his interest in switching allegiances, he may be included in the next squad in June. Will Keane, meanwhile, is injured and nonetheless still ineligible.
Nathan Redmond: yet to declare.Nick PottsNick Potts
Nathan Redmond has yet to declare an interest, while Liam Kelly – who stepped away from Martin O’Neill’s selection a year ago – has yet to show any inkling pointing to a return.

While some think the recruiting of players is an unseemly business, McCarthy won’t be stopping anytime soon.
“England have done it. They’ve chased one of our players and they’ve took him. So it’s not only us doing it. Surely it’s my job here to have the best team possible of players who qualify, and that’s what I’ll continue to do.”
McCarthy also believes that any potential recruits will not have a negative impact on the dressing room.
“Not at all. No. I’ve been in the dressing room when it’s happened, and I’ve actually walked into the dressing room and taken somebody’s place who was born in Ireland.
“I’ve never seen any trouble with it at all.”
Given the size of the squad, there are very few fixtures of previous O’Neill squads absent this time around.
Jon Walters, Michael Obafemi, Ciaran Clark, and Callum Robinson are all out injured, although the latter has returned to training and if he plays for Preston this weekend he may yet be a late call-up.
Colin Doyle, Greg Cunningham, and Darragh Lenihan were regulars in O’Neill squads who failed to make the cut this time, while the manager confirmed that he has scouted Kieran Sadlier but he hasn’t yet done enough to wrestle his way into contention.
Oh, also missing from previous O’Neill squads is Decl- ah, we’re done with that.

https://www.thejournal.ie/iceberg-chile-4545868-Mar2019/,"IN THE SPACE of just two weeks, two large icebergs broke off the Grey Glacier in Chilean Patagonia — a sign of accelerating climate change, experts say.
The Grey Glacier is one of the main sights in the Torres del Paine national park popular with tourists and hikers.
A giant iceberg the size of six football pitches — 8.8 hectares (22 acres) — broke away from the glacier on February 20 and another six hectare piece detached on March 7.
It marks the first time two icebergs of such great size have broken off in such quick succession.
The 270 square kilometer glacier receded by 500 meters , more than half the amount lost over the previous decade.

A smaller iceberg detached in 2017 but Ricardo Jana, a scientist at the Chilean Antarctic Institute, said “the loss of mass over the previous years was definitely smaller than this year”.
Scientists following the glacier’s evolution say it lost around two kilometers in the last 30 years.
A United Nations study in 2018 found that 95% of Chile’s 24,100 glaciers had receded.
Scientists say that unusually warm summer temperatures — up to 31 degrees Celsius in Patagonia — and high rainfall weakened the glacier’s walls.
“The receding of the glaciers coincides with the increased temperatures that we’ve noticed in the region,” said Inti Gonzalez, a glaciologist at the Cequa Foundation that studies geology in Patagonia and the Antarctic.
Higher rainfall also accelerates the glacier melt while raising the level of the eponymous lake where the glacier is found.
The loss of glacier surface also reduces its ability to reflect sunlight, which increases global warming.

AN POST HAS launched two new stamps acknowledging the work of the Irish Coast Guard’s search and rescue operations.
The stamps, designed by Vermillion Design, are based on an original painting by the late Coast Guard volunteer Caitríona Lucas.
Lucas lost her life when the boat she was in capsized while searching for a missing man on 12 September 2016.
In her painting, Lucas has depicted a rescue team working at sea, both in the air and on the water. The scene has been divided into two for the new An Post stamps.
The Irish Coast Guard responds to maritime and inland search and rescue emergencies. It’s main objective is to reduce the loss of life on lakes, waterways, rivers, sea and coastal areas.

Comprising 65 full-time staff and 940 volunteers, the Coast Guard assists on average 4,500 people annually, saving 200 lives and handling 3,000 maritime emergencies every year.
Managing Director of An Post’s Retail section, Debbie Byrne, has said the new stamps “mark important aspects of Irish life” and “acknowledge the service given by members of the Coast Guard to keep us safe when we are in or near the water”.
“We also recognise the families of those Coast Guard volunteers and staff who have lost their lives while serving the Irish people”.
Gerard O’Flynn, National Manager of the Coast Guard’s volunteer branch has said he is “particularly pleased that Caitríona’s work is being honored in this way”.
“We would hope that the Lucas family will take some strength from this recognition”.

The ‘Michael Jackson HIStory Show’, an Australian stage production, was scheduled to appear in Cork, Limerick, Castlebar and Dublin over four days in May.
However, in response to queries fromTheJournal.ie, a spokeswoman for the Cork Opera House issued a statement on behalf of Showtime Australia confirming the tour’s cancellation.
“Showtime Australia, the producers of ‘Michael Jackson HIStory Show’, have cancelled the upcoming tour of Ireland in May 2019,” the statement read.
“Ticket refunds can be sought from the authorised outlet where purchased.”

The spokeswoman for the Cork Opera House also confirmed the show’s cancellation there, and advised ticket-holders to contact its box office for full refunds.
Jackson has hit headlines in the last number of weeks following allegations about the late singer that were in the documentary Leaving Neverland.
Two men - Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 41, claimed they were subjected to sexual abuse by Jackson when they were children.
Both Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson abused them, gained their families’ trust and manipulated them into keeping their sexual relations secret.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gunn-guardians-4545936-Mar2019/,"
MONTHS AFTER BEING fired over old tweets, American director James Gunn has been rehired to direct Marvel’s of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3.
Representatives for the Walt Disney Company and for Gun today  confirmed that he had been reinstated as writer-director of the Marvel franchise he has guided from the start.
Gunn was fired last July over tweets from nearly a decade ago in which he joked about subjects like paedophilia and rape.
The director earlier apologised for the tweets, which he called “unfortunate efforts to be provocative”.
Disney Chairman Alan Horn at the time said Gunn’s words were inconsistent with the studio’s values.
The comments, made from 2008 to 2011, were brought to light by right-wing commentators Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec who combed through Gunn’s social media history after his criticism of President Donald Trump.
But Gunn’s dismissal was passionately protested by many.

Fan petitions circulated online.
The Guardians cast, including Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and other stars, supported Gunn in an open letter.
“Although I don’t support James Gunn’s inappropriate jokes from years ago, he is a good man,” Pratt said.
“I am tremendously grateful to every person out there who has supported me over the last few months,” Gunn said in a statement.
Gunn added a thank you to Disney and said he was excited to “continue making films that investigate the ties of love that bind us all”.
Gunn has since signed on to write and direct the next installment of Warner Bros Suicide Squad for the Marvel rival DC Comics.
That film is to shoot in the autumn and be released in August 2021.
A Disney spokesman declined to comment on when Guardians 3 might go into production.
The first two films have made more than $1.5 billion (€1.32 billion) in worldwide ticket sales.

https://www.thejournal.ie/home-loan-scheme-funding-needed-4523734-Mar2019/,"A FIRST-TIME-BUYERS loan scheme requires a “further tranche of funding” in order to continue.
Concerns were raised today that funds for the government’s Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme have run out.
Under the scheme, a first-time-buyer can apply for a home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property, or to build their own home.
First-time-buyers can borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property, with maximum market values set at €320,000 in the counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and €250,000 in the rest of the country.
Labour Housing Spokesperson Jan O’Sullivan today raised concerns about a directive being issued to local authorities telling them to stop considering applications for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme due to funds for the scheme running out.
“This process is the last resort of many desperate people and families who are trying to buy their own home. We are talking about people who have been declined any other form of loan for a home and may have gone sale agreed.

“The issuing of any directive from the Department of Housing telling councils to stop considering applications sets off alarm bells for those who are considering the Loan Scheme as their last resort or who have already started their applications,” said O’Sullivan.
She added that the notion that funding for such a necessary scheme would even be allowed lapse, and result in applicants being left in limbo, during what is such a stressful period is alarming.
Scheme requires more funding
A spokesperson for the housing minister confirmed toTheJournal.iethat the Housing Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to an extension of the scheme in this regard.
In a statement, they said prior to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan launching in February 2018, an initial tranche of €200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities.
“When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately €200 million over three years.
“From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation,” they added.
When discussions between the two departments conclude, Minister Murphy will be in position to make an announcement on the matter, they added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/king-kong-bundy-4526031-Mar2019/,"PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING LEGEND King Kong Bundy has died aged 61.
The wrestler, whose real name was Christopher Pallies, is well-known for his appearances in the World Wrestling Federation – now WWE – during the 1980s and 90s.
He is perhaps best known for wrestling in the main event of Wrestlemania 2, where he fought Hulk Hogan in a steel cage match.
Fansreacting to his deathrecalled Bundy as an “icon” and a “hero”.

In a tribute to Bundy on its website, WWE said he stood at an impressive 6’4″ and weighed 456 pounds.
“The sight of Bundy stepping between the ropes was intimidating enough, but his crushing offense proved that he was every bit as destructive as advertised,” it said.
Other legends of the industry paid tribute to Bundy, with Hogan saying he was “overwhelmed” by his passing.
Wrestler and senior management figure at WWE Triple H said he was “saddened” to hear of Bundy’s death and called him a “fan favourite”, while Mick Foley said “he was so cool to me when I walked in that @WWE dressing room as an absolute nobody in 1986″.
Bundy had been part of a lawsuit against WWE initiated by a number of former wrestlers which alleged the company hadn’t taken adequate measures to protect them against brain injuries. This lawsuit was dismissed last year.

CBS Evening News/ YouTube
R&B SUPERSTAR R Kelly has denied allegations he sexually abused women and girls in his first public comments since being charged last month.
“I didn’t do this stuff. This isn’t me,” Kelly told CBS This Morning, saying he was “fighting” for his life in an interview to air today. Excerpts were released yesterday.
He dismissed the allegations against him as rumours.
“Whether they’re old rumours, new rumours, future rumours, not true,” said Kelly, who became upset at times during the interview.
Kelly, 52, pleaded not guilty late last month in Chicago to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse.
He spent three nights behind bars and was released after coming up with $100,000 (€88,523), 10% of the $1 million (€885,230) bail set in court.
The sex acts are alleged to have occurred between May 1998 and January 2010, according to prosecutors.
Kelly has been accused of sexual misconduct before.

In 2002 he was charged after allegedly filming himself having sex with a 14-year-old girl. He was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008.
Now he says his reputation is being used against him.
“People are going back to my past, OK? That’s exactly what they’re doing,” Kelly said.
He also addressed a report by BuzzFeed in 2017 that said Kelly had kept women as virtual sex slaves at homes he owns in Chicago and Atlanta.
Kelly denied ever holding anyone against their will.
“I don’t need to. Why would I? How stupid would it be for R Kelly, with all I’ve been through in my way, way past, to hold somebody,” he asked.
“That’s stupid,” Kelly added, looking right into the camera.
The BuzzFeed allegations did not lead to any charges.
In January, a six-part documentary called Surviving R Kelly was released. It alleged he engaged in sexual, mental and physical abuse of girls and women.

Hundreds of thousands of parade-goers turned out for annual events across the country today, when crowds were wowed by musical performances, floats, street-theatre, and pageantry.
In Dublin, more than 3,000 people took part in the capital’s parade, whose theme celebrated Irish storytelling.
Organisers estimated that more than 100,000 overseas visitors joined the home crowd, enjoying around two hours of performances which brought to life various tales and narratives of Ireland and the Irish.
Deirdre O’Kane and Jason Byrne were this year’s Grand Marshals, and highlights included an appearance by President Michael D Higgins and a flyover by the Irish Air Corps, their first time taking part in annual parade.

The parade was a particular highlight for Lord Mayor Nial Ring, who said it was an honour to be able to partake in the event.
“From sitting on my Dad’s shoulders to standing on a ladder to watch the parade I have many fond memories of it,” he said.

“This year I was able to go in the Lord Mayor’s coach and review the festival parade from outside the historic GPO. [I'm] still pinching myself.”
Meanwhile, Olympian Rob Heffernan led events in Cork city, which kicked off at around 1pm.
Organisers estimated that around 50,000 people attended to see more than 3,000 community groups take part to showcase the theme of the stories of Cork.

Speaking at the annual St Patrick’s Day reception at Áras an Uachtaráin this evening, President Michael D Higgins said the day was a time when the global Irish family could “join together to celebrate our Irish culture and heritage”.
“On this St Patrick’s Day, when we celebrate the life of St Patrick… we also celebrate and offer to the world those aspects of our values that make us uniquely Irish,” he said.
“In doing so, let us resolve to build together a fairer Ireland, an Ireland that treasures all of its people equally, and understands that a nation that has truly progressed, is one that encompasses all of its people, regarding the full participation of all citizens as a fundamental right.”

https://www.the42.ie/jack-byrne-2-4551993-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019
THAT MICK MCCARTHY is preparing for his first game in charge of Ireland against the backdrop of an FAI controversy involving a J. Delaney is not the only bit of symmetry with the past this week.
The last time a League of Ireland player was capped in a competitive, senior international for Ireland was back in 1985, the player a ‘Byrne’, playing for Shamrock Rovers.
On that occasion it was Pat Byrne, who came on as a substitute in a 4-1 hammering at home to Denmark, in what was Eoin Hand’s final game in charge.
Mick McCarthy wasn’t playing that day: he had been injured in training, having raced a journalist who had been a persistent critic of McCarthy’s lack of pace. (Hand maintains that the injury happened the following day, and was unrelated.)

That Jack has swapped training at Tallaght for Abbottstown this week means that he may emulate his namesake by appearing against either Gibraltar or Georgia in qualifiers for Euro 2020.
He wasn’t included in McCarthy’s provisional squad, but impressed the onlooking manager in Rovers’ 3-0 win against Sligo at Tallaght last Friday, to the point that McCarthy said he was a contender for future squads in his weekly interview with the FAI website on Sunday afternoon.
Within a couple of hours, Callum O’Dowda was ruled out with a knee injury and Byrne was given a call.

“It’s been a mad couple of days, and I’m still trying to get my head around it”, the Rovers attacker told a press conference.
“I’m delighted for Shamrock Rovers giving me the chance as well.
“No [wasn't expecting a call-up] I just want to do well, get myself back on track and without Rovers and Stephen Bradley, [Stephen] McPhail and the other coaching staff none of this would have been possible so it’s great.”
Jack Byrne has impressed for Shamrock Rovers this season.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
Byrne is still only 22, and is back at Rovers following a series of disappointments after leaving Manchester City. While at the club, Patrick Vieira compared him to Roy Keane and he impressed during a loan spell with Cambuur in Holland.
Although he still had a lot of time left on his contract at City, Byrne wanted to play first-team football, so left for Wigan. The manager who signed him, Warren Joyce, was sacked within weeks, and Byrne drifted for a while with further underwhelming spells at Blackburn, Oldham, and Kilmarnock.
“Yeah, I left Man City and signed a deal with Wigan and two or three weeks later the manager was gone that signed me, but you can’t dwell on these things.
“Sometimes you have to take one step back to take two steps forward and reset. I’m grateful that I am back – touch wood – playing well again.”
He is certainly playing well for Rovers, generally starting on the right of an advanced trio but most effective when drifting centrally. His stunning, curled effort against Sligo capped a performance which moved McCarthy to declare Byrne the “star of the show.”
“I didn’t know he was going to be there”, said Byrne, “and I’m probably happy I didn’t know at the time because you’d probably start doing stuff that you wouldn’t normally do.”

The blooding of domestic players in the cut and thrust of serious international games rarely happens, either. Byrne agrees that his call-up is good news for the other players in the league of Ireland.
“It’s good for the younger players in the league, I’m still only 22 as well but I think it’s good for the likes of Trevor Clarke and Brandon [Kavanagh] at our club as well after getting called up to the U21s.
“If themselves and other young players can see that maybe there is an international pathway there it will be good. A lot of the international teams at the different age groups are made up of League of Ireland players so I think it can only be good for the league.”
Byrne shook hands with every journalist in the room ahead of sitting down to speak, eager to make an impression.
An appearance for Ireland on Saturday would make an historic one.

https://www.thejournal.ie/south-dakota-child-4532260-Mar2019/,"A US WOMAN has been charged with the death of a newborn baby who was found abandoned in a ditch 38 years ago, with police saying they used DNA and genealogy sites to determine she was the baby’s mother.
South Dakota resident Theresa Rose Bentaas was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in the 1981 death of the infant, known as Baby Andrew.
The 57-year-old told authorities last month that she’d hidden her pregnancy from her friends and family and gave birth while alone in her apartment, according to a court affidavit.
Bentaas allegedly said she then drove the baby to the area where he was later discovered, a cornfield ditch in an area called Sioux Falls.
She said she was “young and stupid” and felt sad and scared as she drove away, according to the document.
The baby died of exposure.

Bentaas, who was 19 when the baby died, later married the infant’s father and has two living adult children with him,the Argus Leaderreported.
Retired Detective Mike Webb said authorities used DNA from the baby exhumed 10 years ago and DNA obtained from Bentaas through a search warrant. Webb said the father won’t be charged because he wasn’t involved.
“I couldn’t be more pleased with the results today and the arrest and the closure that we find, as well as the hard work and dedication for the pursuit of justice for Andrew,” Chief Matt Burns said.
In South Dakota, authorities submitted a DNA sample from Baby Andrew to a specialised lab, which found two possible matches using the public genealogical database GEDmatch.
Police constructed a family tree and performed a “trash pull” to collect beer and water containers and cigarette butts at Bentaas’ home.
Results from a cheek swab sample show there’s “extremely strong evidence” to support a biological relationship between Bentaas and the child, according to the affidavit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/large-dogs-courts-4553257-Mar2019/,"A JUDGE HAS told a dog owner who set two large dogs on a woman that he cannot in the future own any dogs bigger than a terrier.
After a trial last month a jury at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court convicted Daniel Molloy (28) with an address at Kevin Barry House, Dublin, of assaulting Ellen Colgan causing her harm on Eccles Street, Dublin. Molloy had denied the charge.
The trial heard that on 17 December 2017, Colgan was out walking her two dogs when she passed Molloy pushing a trolley and walking three dogs. She told the trial that the man seemed to be getting dragged towards her by the animals.
She asked the man if he was “ok” to hold onto the dogs and said he replied: “Go away you stupid bitch or I’ll let them eat you.” She told the man there was no need to be childish and she walked on.
Colgan said that the man came behind her with the dogs before he and the dogs were on top of her. She grabbed the collar of the biggest dog, which she estimated weighed about 40kg.
She said this dog had his mouth around the back of the neck and head of her dog and she heard a voice say: “I told you you bitch.”

Colgan said she lifted the dog up and managed to fling him away. She ran into the reception area of a nearby hospital but was told to leave. She asked for help and explained she was being attacked but she was still not allowed to stay. She said by the time she left the hospital, the man had gone.
The court heard she suffered a bite mark to the back of her leg and needed to get a tetanus injection. Her dog had two puncture wounds and needed an operation.
She said her leg was painful and the bruising was sore but the “emotional side of things is worse”.
Judge Martin Nolan said that he had no doubt Colgan’s enjoyment of life has decreased considerably as a result of the attack.
He said that Molloy had led a blameless life up to this offence and had a difficult background.
He suspended a prison term of three years on condition that Molloy stay out of trouble for that period and obey the instructions of the Probation Services for one year.
He told Molloy that he could keep the two bull terrier mongrels he still owns. He ordered that when these dogs eventually die Molloy cannot replace them with “anything bigger than a terrier”.
He said he was not going to order the disposal of these dogs. The dog that bit the victim was taken into a dog’s home and later died.

DAILY SHOW HOST Trevor Noah has apologised and defended himself against accusations of racism and insensitivity following jokes he made about the India-Pakistan conflict.
In a monologue on the satirical news programme, the South African comedian put on an Indian accent and portrayed a potential war between the two nations in the form of a Bollywood movie.
“If they did go to war it would probably be most entertaining war of all time,” Noah said on the Comedy Central programme
Tensionsbetween the nuclear nations ratcheted in recent weeksfollowing a suicide attack in the disputed Kashmir region that killed 40 Indian soldiers and theviolence that followed.
The loss of life caused some to criticise Noah for making light of the situation and for promoting racial stereotypes while doing so.

Bollywood actress Swara Bhasker tweeted a clip of Noah’s monologue, saying that his stereotyping was “ignorant and racist” and that “Hindi is not gibberish”.
Indian comedian Mallika Dua also criticised the routine, labelling it as “shockingly unintelligent and tone-deaf”.

Despite his defence, Noah apologised for any hurt he caused and responded to Sikander, noting that he has himself joked about his mother’s shooting.
“Actually if you watch my stand up you’ll see that I did make jokes after my mother was shot in the head. As a comedian I use comedy to process pain and discomfort in my world but I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that’s not what I was trying to do,” he posted.

KEITH FLINT, THE frontman of British rave icons The Prodigy, died as a result of hanging, an inquest heard today.
The singer (49) was found dead last Monday at his home in a village in Essex, northeast of London.
Coroner’s officer Lynsey Chaffe told a brief inquest hearing in the Essex capital Chelmsford that a post-mortem examination was carried out on Thursday.
The provisional medical cause of death is hanging, she said, adding that toxicology reports are awaited and the investigation remains open.
“Police attended, all protocols were followed and his death was confirmed as not suspicious,” Chaffe said.
The inquest was adjourned until a full hearing on 23 July.

The Prodigy were one of the most influential acts to emerge from the underground rave scene in the early- to mid-90s.
Flint was originally a dancer with the rave/dance group, but went on to perform vocals on their two biggest hits in the 1990s: Firestarter and Breathe.
His band, founded by keyboardist Howlett during the English underground rave scene at the start of that decade, went on to become a multi-million selling outfit, headlining arena shows and festivals.
They were an extremely popular live draw in Ireland throughout their late 90s-early 2000s heyday, and most recently headlined the closing night of last year’s Electric Picnic festival in Co Laois.
Alongside Howlett and fellow vocalist Maxim, Flint was one of three core members of The Prodigy throughout the group’s 29-year career.
They had recently returned from a tour of Australia and were due to start their first headlining tour of the US in a decade this May.

https://www.thejournal.ie/clare-housing-4540006-Mar2019/,"A NUMBER OF local authorities around the country have taken the decision to stop making loans available to low-income households to help with repairs or improvements,TheJournal.iecan reveal.
One woman who tried to apply for one of these loans says she has been left with no other options for assistance in repairing radiators and old pipes in her home.
Local authority home improvement loans were designed to help owner-occupiers who can not get a loan from a bank or building society for necessary works on their homes.
They are aimed at homeowners whose houses are overcrowded or substandard and who cannot afford to carry out the improvements. In a single-income household, a person is eligible if their gross income before tax is €40,000 or less and a variable interest rate applies to the loans.
One woman in Co Clare toldTheJournal.ieshe tried to apply for this loan, but was told that the council no longer operates the scheme.
Karen*, a mother-of-one, was told the council also does not offer another scheme, called the Improvement Works in Lieu of Local Authority Housing Scheme, which aims to provide funding to improve or extend accommodation.
This would apply, for example, to situations where there are several family members who are on the housing list living in their parents’ home in overcrowded conditions.
Karen said she has been left with no options now to pay for repairs to leaking radiators and old pipes in her bathroom. She has had to cut off the water to a number of the radiators in the house because of the leaks.
“Heatwise in the winter, it has been cold. We have an open fire as well but I work, so it’s not always feasible to have it during the day to heat the place up for the evening when we’re in.
“And because of the leaks in the bathroom we’re afraid to sit in the bath now in case it comes down through the ceiling.”
Karen could not work for a period of time last year due to illness and her mortgage fell into arrears. While she is now back in work, she said there is no extra money after her mortgage payments to cover home repairs.
Because she fell into arrears last year, she now has a bad credit rating and can not get a loan. The local authority home improvement loans were designed specifically for these circumstances.
Karen wrote a letter to Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy about her situation last month. In it she said:
“My house is old and in need of repair. It is well below standard and fast becoming uninhabitable. It’s not a safe environment for my family.
‘Value for money’
A spokesperson for Clare County Council said it no longer offers this scheme because the loans are unsecured.
The council also no longer operates the ‘improvement works’ scheme.
“The issues with the scheme were that the properties in question generally required extensive refurbishment which entailed significant input in terms of financial resources that were not available and did not deliver value for money.
It does operate a number of grants for modifications on medical or age grounds, but this does not apply to situations like Karen’s.
The Department of Housing said that while it provides funding, it is up to local authorities to decide whether or not to operate the schemes.
“I’m afraid the Home Improvement Loan Scheme is a local authority scheme and this would be a matter for each local authority,” a spokesperson said when asked about Karen’s situation.

The department said it does provide funding to councils for the ‘improvement works’ scheme but it is up to local authorities to submit proposals each year for funding.
“On the basis of the need identified by local authorities, the department issues a block funding allocation to each local authority annually for works to be undertaken under the schemes.”
Disparity between local authority areas
TheJournal.ieasked a number of other councils whether they offer these schemes. Some offer neither, some both and a number of councils said they offer one but not the other.
Leitrim County Councilsaid it does operate the loan scheme but has had no applications for it. It used to operate the improvement works scheme but has not operated it in recent years.
Limerick County Councildoes not operate the schemes, though it still provides information on its website on how to apply to the council for the loan scheme.
Roscommon County CouncilandOffaly County Councildo not operate either scheme, though Roscommon’s local authority has information about one on its website.
A spokesperson forLouth County Councilsaid local authorities no longer operate a home improvement loan scheme and that it has not received an improvement works in lieu application “for a long time”.
Kildare County Councildoes not operate the loan scheme but the other scheme is available. However a spokesperson said it has not approved one “for some time, nor has there been the demand”.
Wexford County Counciloffers the improvement works scheme, but not the loan scheme.
Cavan County Councildoes still operate the schemes but said there are currently no live applications in either case.Fingal County CouncilandTipperary County Councilsaid the same – they do operate these schemes but have no current applications on file.
Donegal, Mayo, MonaghanandSligocounty councils said they operate both.
Dublin City Councildoes not operate the loan scheme but it toldTheJournal.ieit does have numerous grant schemes for homeowners. It linked to apage on its websitethat gave details of a number of schemes, but they all apply to individuals with a disability or older persons.
A homeowner in this local authority area in Karen’s position would not be able to avail of any of these schemes.
The council said it does operate the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme but it has “not been availed of much in recent years”.
“There is funding being made available from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and we would envisage an uptake in the interest in the scheme”.
Sinn Féin’s housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin said State bodies will often say a scheme is available “when what they mean is that it’s still on the Statute book”.
“That doesn’t mean the funding is there for them,” he explained.
He said local authorities have to prioritise the limited funds they are allocated by the government each year.
“They tend to prioritise cases where there are specific needs due to disability or if a person is older. There is a clear rationale for prioritising those kinds of works if you have an older person who can’t access their bathroom and need a stair lift or a downstairs bathroom.
“There is a lack of adequate provision for all of these schemes in the overall capital budget.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/man-abused-daughter-barrister-error-4529448-Mar2019/,"A MAN FOUND guilty of abusing his daughter has had his conviction quashed over a factual error in his barrister’s closing speech to the jury, which was not permitted to be corrected by the trial judge.
The man, whose details cannot be published to protect the victim’s identity, pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexually assaulting his daughter in the south-east of the country on 30 and 31 January 2015.
He was found guilty by a jury at Waterford Circuit Criminal Court and sentenced to three years imprisonment with the final year suspended by Judge Eugene O’Kelly on 12 December 2016.
The Court of Appeal quashed the man’s conviction today, holding that the trial judge should have permitted the man’s barrister to reopen her closing speech to the jury, after she had made a factual error on the evidence.
Giving judgment in the three-judge court, Mr Justice Patrick McCarthy said the prosecution case was reliant on the complainant’s uncorroborated evidence. He said the jury also heard evidence from the complainant’s mother and stepfather.
The mother’s evidence was that the complainant had told her, shortly after the incident, that her father had “touched her in the private parts”. The stepfather’s evidence was that the complainant had told him that her father was “trying to touch her in the private parts”.
In her closing speech to the jury, the man’s barrister apparently believed that “the daughter had complained (to her mother) that the dad had simply tried to touch her in the private parts”. However, the mother’s evidence had been that the man had actually touched her in the private parts, Mr Justice McCarthy said.
He said the man’s barrister, in her closing speech to the jury, put emphasis on what she understood to have been the evidence of the complainant’s mother. However, her understanding was erroneous.
‘Significant’ error
Defence counsel told the jury that what the complainant had said to her mother, shortly after the incident, was “radically different” to what the complainant had said to the gardaí two weeks later.

The error was pointed out by the trial judge who said it was “serious” and a “very significant issue”.
He told counsel that it was “such an important feature of your closing speech that the jury may very well have been impressed by it, and of course it’s factually not correct”.
Counsel applied for a discharge of the jury out of concern for the fairness of the trial, but the trial judge refused.
The barrister then asked the judge to permit her to rectify the error by further addressing the jury, but that didn’t happen.
The trial judge gave the jury an accurate account of the evidence and told them that the consistency of the complainant’s accounts was a matter for them to assess. He told them to consider the consistency or otherwise of the accounts the complainant gave to her mother, her stepfather and the Gardaí.
Mr Justice McCarthy said, generally, when counsel makes an error, the client will be “fixed with it and any consequences”. He said counsel would not in general be permitted to resume a speech which has been concluded for the purpose of a correction or due to an omission.
In this case, he said the trial judge should have taken the exceptional step of permitting defence counsel to reopen her speech. He said the trial judge fell into error by refusing the application because of the seriousness and significance of the error and the place it had taken in the defence case.
The credibility of the complainant was fundamental and anything inconsistent with her version of events took on a particular importance, the judge said.
Mr Justice McCarthy, who sat with President of the Court of Appeal Mr Justice George Birmingham and Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy, said the court regarded the man’s conviction as unsafe and unsatisfactory.
The court will hear arguments on whether a retrial will be appropriate at a later date.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IRELAND has issued a fresh warning to livestock farmers as a low flying plane that is collecting data over some parts of the country resumes its flights.
The aircraft equipped with scientific equipment will be flying at low heights over west Cork, Limerick and north Tipperary over the coming months.
The plane will be collecting geochemical and geophysical data on rocks, soil and water as part of theTellus Survey.
Geological Survey IrelandGeological Survey Ireland
The survey began in early autumn 2018 and is 60% complete.
“The data collected for the Tellus Survey will help to sustainably manage the environment, natural resources and protect public health in the future,” Dr James Hodgson, senior geologist and project manager for Tellus said.

“The Tellus team is looking forward to the delivery of new data which, once processed, will be used to help map and understand the complex geology in these areas,” he said.

The plane is able to sense geological properties not apparent from conventional mapping techniques, effectively ‘seeing through’ Ireland’s deep glacial deposits and extensive peat and soil cover.
The aircraft is a white, twin propeller plane, which can be identified by its red tail and black stripe, along with the word ‘survey’ and registration number C-GSGF written across both sides of the plane.

Based at Kerry airport, the plane will be flying at 60 metres over rural areas – about eight times the height of a two-storey house – and 240 metres over urban areas over the next few months, as approved by the Irish Aviation Authority.
In a statement last August, the GSI said: “The sound of the plane is similar to that of a passing lorry but could possibly startle sensitive livestock, such as horses.”
Due to the low-flying nature of the survey, concerned livestock and bloodstock owners are being asked to contact Tellus on 1800 45 55 65.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-northern-ireland-civil-servant-4526033-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Mar 2019
DUP BREXIT SPOKESPERSON Sammy Wilson dismissed a severe warning by the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service that unemployment could rise significantly if there’s a no-deal Brexit.
David Sterling issued the warning in a letter to the country’s political parties, in which he outlined the “severe consequences” to Northern Ireland of a no-deal Brexit.
He also claimed that the scenario would result in “additional challenges for the police” if the UK’s departure from the bloc appeared to be unfair to those most affected by it, according to a report inThe Guardian.
“These consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply,” he wrote.
“This point is well understood by the business community.”
Appearing before theNorthern Ireland Affairs Committeetoday, Wilson said that Sterling’s comments were a “scare tactic”, and inferred that it was politically motivated.
“If you look at the studies that have been made about the impact of a no-deal – I don’t care if he’s the head of the civil service or Santa Claus, it really doesn’t matter – the fact of the matter is he’s got it wrong.”
He added: “There may well be an impact of a no-deal, but government has got fiscal and monetary measures to deal with it.”

Sterling said that Northern Ireland’s economy would be particularly impacted, as 75% of all private sector employers were small- or medium-sized enterprises, many of which would close or relocate.
Meanwhile, the country would experience increased food and energy prices, as well as the loss of programmes such as the European Health and Insurance Card and the Erasmus scheme.
“Our advice to the UK Government has consistently been that no deal would have profound and lasting social and economic effects, and that there are very limited actions that could be taken to mitigate these,” he added.

Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Sterling’s letter had laid out the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland in “very stark terms”.
“The analysis from the Civil Service points out in very stark terms just how much of a catastrophe a no-deal crash will be for the North of Ireland,” she said.
“Given our unique vulnerabilities, the collective assessment of the government departments here is that the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North of Ireland will be ‘longer and much more severe’ than anywhere else.”
O’Neill called on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservative Party to avoid a no-deal Brexit and listen to the business and farming communities as they guide the UK out of the EU.

https://www.the42.ie/joe-schmidt-roof-cardiff-wales-4542088-Mar2019/,"IRELAND HEAD COACH Joe Schmidt would like the roof of the Principality Stadium to remain open on Saturday when his side meet a Welsh side eyeing a Grand Slam.
However, the Kiwi says that the call is out of his hands currently because Wales have directed a special request to close the roof directly to the Six Nations.
Ordinarily, the decision be left solely to the visiting team and Schmidt would rather the fixture remain open air as he says his last visit to the venue, a 2017 loss to Warren Gatland’s men, the turf was slicked up by the sprinklers.
“For us, I think the last time it was closed we arrived there and there was a lot said about making it good for spectators. Then the sprinklers were on for 30 minutes and the ground was very, very damp before the game started,” Schmidt said after naming his side to face the Grand Slam chasers.
“So that probably enters into our minds about which closed is it going to be? Is it going to be closed and wet, or is it going to be closed and dry?

“If it’s closed and wet, we might as well have the roof open and let the rain come in.”
Schmidt added: “Last time we said ‘look, we don’t mind, you choose.’ And they chose closed, but made the field incredibly wet at the start of the game.
“So we’ll probably be happy enough if it’s open anyway. We’ll adapt to whatever conditions the game’s played in.  And if the Six Nations decide that it’s going to be closed, well it will be closed and we’ll play in those conditions.
“And if they decide that it’s open, then we’ll play in those conditions.”
Warren Gatland in Edinburgh.Bryan Keane / INPHOBryan Keane / INPHO / INPHO
Meanwhile, after naming an unchanged side, Gatland repeated the stance that a closed roof would be better for spectators, but also said that the hosts should be permitted to set up their ground however they see fit.
“My only concern is that if it is pouring down with rain then we do have a responsibility to the game as a spectacle,” said Gatland.

“There may be nine million people watching it on TV but I don’t see the point having the opportunity to close the roof, to potentially play in terrible weather conditions.”
He added: “I have made a number of comments in the past about that. It’s our stadium and we should be able to do what we want with it.
“It is not something we have spoken about all week and we just presume Ireland would be like England and ask for the roof to be open.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mark-durkan-fine-gael-european-elections-4523626-Mar2019/,"FORMER LEADER OF the SDLP party, Mark Durkan, is to run as a Fine Gael candidate in the European elections.
He will contest a seat in the Dublin constituency, alongside former Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.
Flanked by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Fitzgerald at a press conference today, Durkan was described as a man to offer “leadership for city, country and Northern Ireland”.
Dublin issues
During the course of the press event, Durkan was fielded a number of questions about Dublin issues, such as the MetroLink. The former SDLP leader was asked whether he had familiarised himself with such issues, seeing as he is running in the Dublin constituency.
He was unable to name four streets in the capital earlier today and admitted that he will remain living in the North.
He replied that he had not arrived at today’s press event under some “falsehood” that he is all “schooled up” on the obvious questions that relate to Dublin. Instead, he said:
Durkan said he is standing on the basis of his experience, and not on answers that he will cram to learn in an attempt to “pull off some bluff”.
Durkan says Varadkar is following through on his promise that the people of Northern Ireland will not be left behind. ‘I recognise this is a big ask for the people of Dublin’ he says, adding that people of the North will have lost their voices in the EU parliamentpic.twitter.com/NtXIQj8One— Christina Finn (@christinafinn8)March 4, 2019Christina Finn/ Twitter

He said Dublin people care about Northern Ireland issues, adding that many Dublin people “resent” the way “in which Brexit has been imposed on their fellow citizens in the north”.

Varadkar said his decision to ask him to run had nothing to do with domestic politics.
“Instead of a border poll, I’m asking the people of Dublin to cast a much more meaningful vote,” said the Taoiseach, stating he wanted to people to vote “as if there was no border”.
Northern Ireland
Durkan said today that Varadkar is following through on his promise that the people of Northern Ireland will not be left behind following Brexit.
“I recognise this is a big ask for the people of Dublin,” he said, adding that people of the North will have lost their voices in the EU parliament, but if he is elected he will ensure all voices are heard, both north and south.
“I’m here because I received what I regarded as a bold, and genuine, and brilliant invitation by the Taoiseach and by Fine Gael,” said Durkan.
“I am not running against Fianna Fáil (who recently announced a policy partnership with the SDLP) or Labour,” said Durkan. He said he hoped that the people of Dublin look at the upcoming European elections as one that has national importance.
This election is an opportunity for voters to make the 24th May a “green jersey day” that can send a message to the Brexiteers.
During the press conference, Varadkar revealed Durkan was considered to fill the Seanad seat, which was eventually taken by Ian MarshalL. The seat was on the agricultural panel and as he’s an “urban Derry dweller” Durkan said he wasn’t the right fit for the job.
The last two Irish European election candidates elected in the South constituency and the Dublin constituencywill not be able to take up their seatsin the European Parliament until the UK has left the EU.
When asked about how irked he would be if he was left in limbo, Durkan said he understood that two MEPs could effectively be left in “quarantine” until after the Brexit stalemate is sorted out, but we should not “distract ourselves with ifs and buts”.
Fitzgerald was asked if she believes her chances in Europe will be clouded by the circumstances surrounding her resignation. The former Tánaiste said her record over the years “is the lens through which people will judge me, not any particular incident”.

https://www.the42.ie/johnny-sexton-ireland-frustration-2-4524796-Mar2019/,"SOME CRITICS HAVE an issue with the manner in which Johnny Sexton expresses his frustration on the rugby pitch, but the Ireland out-half won’t be changing at the age of 33.
Sexton’s latest show of annoyance came as he was replaced in Ireland’s win over Italy in the Six Nations two weekends ago, with the Leinster man visibly upset at his team’s inability to retain the ball in Rome.

The Ireland vice-captain has faced some criticism in the wake of that Ireland victory, with the suggestion being made that Sexton’s visible frustration may add to the pressure felt by team-mates.
However, those within the Ireland camp are well accustomed to Sexton’s mannerisms and deny that it has a negative effect on the players around him.

“No, I don’t think so,” said Ireland fullback Rob Kearney when asked if Sexton’s shows of frustration impact on team-mates.
“That’s Johnny, isn’t it? We’re a little bit used to it. We all get very frustrated and we all show our frustration in different ways. I’ve played with Johnny for 15 odd years now so maybe I’m not the one to ask but, certainly, I don’t think it’s having much of an effect on us.”
Asked if he has often been on the receiving end of Sexton’s annoyance, Kearney smiled.
“Weekly,” said the Leinster 15. “I think we all have.
“I think it’s good, it drives standards among us. Johnny understands the game very well and he’s very clear in terms of how he wants to play it. That’s his way of communicating it.”
Sexton and Ireland are focusing on cutting out the errors that stunted their attacking game against Italy last time out as they prepare for Sunday’s Six Nations clash against France.
Ireland lost their opening round clash with England in Dublin, denting their confidence, but have since recorded wins over Scotland and Italy while remaining short of their best form.

There have been major concerns about Ireland on the outside since the Italy performance, but Kearney says there is belief within Schmidt’s group that a strong showing is coming.
“There’s a lot of excitement, a little bit of nerves and frustration,” said Kearney. “But there’s a huge amount of confidence, as well, in our ability and in the type of game that we know we’re close to producing.
“We’re going to be filled with different emotions during the week but the important thing is that when the weekend comes, there’s a huge amount of excitement to go and play rugby.
“We’re at home in front of our fans in the Aviva playing for our country in the Six Nations, and that needs to be the overriding feeling for us at the weekend.”

PAUL MANAFORT, US President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, has been sentenced to a further three and a half years in prison.
Manafort was first sentenced to four years in prison last week by a federal judge for tax crimes and bank fraud. He was sentenced today on conspiracy charges.
“The defendant is not public enemy number one,” US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in delivering the sentence.

“But he is not a victim either,” the judge said today, adding that the veteran Republican lobbyist had shown little remorse and had lied repeatedly.
His is the highest profile case yet stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
He is one of a half-dozen former Trump associates and senior aides charged by Mueller, who has been investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
Last week’s charges against Manafort were not connected to his role in the Trump campaign, which he headed for two months in 2016, but were related to lucrative consulting work he did for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians from 2004 to 2014.

https://www.thejournal.ie/father-patrick-peyton-documentary-rosary-cia-communism-4550067-Mar2019/,"A MAYO PRIEST whose promotion of the Rosary was secretly funded by the CIA to fight against Communism is the subject of a documentary to be shown on RTÉ One this week.
Fr Patrick Peyton, who was born in Attymass near Ballina, built a huge media presence in the US during the 1940s with his famous slogan “the family that prays together stays together”.
His story will be told in a new documentary narrated by Martin Sheen, ‘Guns and Rosaries’, which claims that the South American leg of his ‘Recite the Rosary’ crusade in the 1950s was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Peyton, who emigrated to the US at the age of 19, contracted tuberculosis while studying for the priesthood in the 1930s, but made a full, unexpected recovery after turning to prayer on his sickbed.
After being ordained in 1941, he began the Family Rosary Crusade, a movement which aimed to get 10 million families to commit to praying the Rosary.
Peyton built up a huge following during the 1940s after popularising the slogan “the family that prays together stays together”, and grew his presence on radio, TV and in Hollywood.
His growing influence soon inspired him to bring the Family Rosary Crusade on the road, and he created an international stadium tour that attracted millions of people across the world.

His efforts eventually came to the attention of the CIA, which the documentary claims secretly funded his crusade as a weapon of devotion to fight Communism during the Cold War.
“The Rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism — the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith,” Peyton once said in a radio broadcast, conscious of the political nature of his crusade.
In 1959, the CIA started to secretly fund Fr Peyton’s Crusade, paying for advertising, promotion and events, with Brazil a particular focus of the strategy.
“I consider the Crusades in Latin America throughout the decade of the sixties as the most significant and the most effective,” Peyton said.
However, his superiors were not pleased by the secret funding, and the matter was brought to the attention of the Vatican before Pope Paul VI ordered Peyton to stop.
As time went on, Peyton’s message became less powerful, and his influence declined before his death in 1992 at the age of 83, but in 2017, Pope Francis moved him closer to sainthood by naming him as ‘Venerable’.
Among those to pay tribute to him in the documentary are former MEP Dana Rosemary Scallon, actor Bob Newhard, and author James O’Toole.
Newhart, one of the last Hollywood actors to work with Peyton, succinctly summed up the Mayo-born priest’s character.
He said: “Everybody knew who he was… and what he was selling.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-deal-third-vote-explainer-4542920-Mar2019/,"AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL Agreement was first defeated in the House of Commons by a historic majority of 230 votes, all the way back in January, Theresa May told her parliament that it wasn’t good enough to vote against something, they had to vote for something.
Last night, they voted against no deal. And tonight, while they haven’t quite voted FOR something, they have at least voted to ask for more time to figure out what to do.
In the midst of the coming process, it’s hoped consensus will at last build behind a plan that a majority of MPs can get behind.
How long that takes is another question altogether.
A majority of413parliamentariansvoted tonightin favour of delaying the date the UK is due to leave the EU, with202voting against the government’s motion.
The motion proposed seeking an extension until 30 June and noted that if the House passed the withdrawal agreement by next Wednesday then the three month extension would be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
Tonight’s vote is a statement of intent, but isn’t actually legally binding.
However, it does give May a legitimate reason to hold another vote on her battered Brexit deal, considering that that proposal was within the evening’s main motion.
As recently as Tuesday MPs voted down her deal by a majority of 149 votes. That wasdespite new assurances from the EU on Monday nightto address Brexiteers’ fears of being trapped in the backstop mechanism.
The new proposals suggested an arbitration system to deal with any disputes that might arise between the EU and UK if the backstop had to be activated.
Brexiteers – including the DUP and members of Tory group the ERG – said on Tuesday that these new assurances didn’t go far enough, arguing that if no one “acted in bad faith” the UK would be trapped in the backstop indefinitely anyway.
They used analysis from attorney general Geoffrey Cox to back up their position: Cox told the House of Commons that his earlier advice – that the backstop could“endure indefinitely”without a time limit or exit mechanism – remained true.

Tonight’s vote, despite it being the first victory of the week for Theresa May, also showed what a slim grasp she has on her party.
Among those who opposed the Prime Minister’s extension were Cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (who, bizarrely, had argued in favour of the motion in the debate earlier today).
The government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote.
Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (an ex-Brexit Secretary) also voted against the extension. The original former Brexit secretary, David Davis, voted to back May’s motion and delay Brexit.
The Conservative MPs who voted against the government motion tonight will not face punishment, as a free vote had been offered by May.

Many Brexiteers fear any extension to the exit date will make Brexit more unlikely (with the prospect of Brexit not taking place at all becoming more likely the longer that extension goes on).
Now what?
It’s now up to the EU to agree to grant an extension, and it needs the agreement of all EU Council members – ie, the leaders of remaining 27 EU countries – to sign off.
Up until now, EU leaders have said that without good reason, there would be no extension.In the wordsof Taoiseach Leo Varadkar:
Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who heads the EU Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, put it more forcefully:
The EU Council is due to meet next Thursday 21 and Friday 22 March; it’s expected that the ‘Meaningful Vote 3′ will be held in the House of Commons before then.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
The likelihood of May passing her deal this time is significantly higher than before as parliament runs out of other options.

They may not like the deal but Brexiteers have argued that the UK has lost its leverage in negotiations in the wake of the votes ruling out a no-deal Brexit at any point (yesterday) and in favour of postponing Brexit day (tonight).
Already, efforts are under way to get Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP on board. Reports have emerged suggesting the ERG and the unionists could be persuaded to change their votes if Cox could offer refined advice.
Asked by the Guardianwhether he would vote for the deal if the DUP were happy with it, ERG leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said:
Arlene Foster, speaking in the US, indicated today that a deal still could be reached, saying: “When you come to the end of a negotiation that’s when you really start to see the whites in people’s eyes and you get down to the point where you can make a deal.”
EU elections
If parliament rejects Theresa May’s deal again, then the UK could request an extension longer than three months in order to avoid a cliff-edge exit at the end of this month.
This could mean that the UK would have to run candidates in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 24 May – something that the prime minister has said she’s dead set against.
An extension until 30 June would mean Brexit happening the day before the new EU Parliament sits. Ukip founder Nigel Farage has already said that he would run as a ‘Brexit MEP’ if the UK was compelled to run candidates.
Earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney spoke of a possible Brexit postponement of 21 months, saying that it would “give a long reflection period for the British political system to look at how they want to approach Brexit again”.
This could mean holding a general election in order to gain a majority in the House for some sort of Brexit, or even holding a second referendum.
Columnist Jonathan Freedland,writing in The Guardian tonight, argues that Theresa May finally has the Brexiteers where she wants them.
“The ERG and DUP either swallow their objections and vote for May’s deal, or they face the prospect of a long delay to Brexit – perhaps for the best part of two years. Given the mayhem on show these past few days, who would bet what might happen to their precious Brexit project between now and 2021? They might lose it altogether.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boeing-questions-ethiopian-airlines-crash-4534157-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Mar 2019
THE DIGITAL FLIGHT data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder from the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed yesterday, killing 157 people, including one Irish person, has been recovered, according to the airline.
The brand new Max 8 plane, being flown by Ethiopian Airlines, crashed just six minutes into its flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi in Kenya, killing all those on board.
The airline this morning announced that it is pulling its fleet of 737 Max from service, just hours after China’s air safety regulator ordered domestic airlines to do the same.
Last October, the same model of plane, operated by Lion Air, crashed in Indonesia, killing 189.
Since the Lion Air accident, the 737 MAX has faced growing skepticism from the aviation community. The program had already encountered problems during development.
In May 2017, Boeing had halted 737 MAX test flights due to quality concerns with the engine produced by CFM International, a company jointly owned by France’s Safran Aircraft Engines and GE Aviation.
While Teal Group expert Richard Aboulafia said it was “too soon to make any kind of meaningful comment,” another industry expert stressed the similarities between the two incidents.
“It’s the same plane. Like Lion Air, the (Ethiopian Airlines) accident took place shortly after takeoff and the pilots signaled they were experiencing problems, then the plane crashed. The similarities are clear,” the expert added, requesting anonymity.
Chinese aviation authorities have also noted the “similarities” between the two deadly incidents.
Boeing said it was “deeply saddened” by the Ethiopian Airlines incident, adding that a technical team would be providing assistance to investigators.
Victims
Eight crew and 149 passengers from 35 countries perished when Flight ET 302 smashed into a field.
The Irish person who was among those who died was last night named as Michael Ryan, originally from Lahinch, Co Clare.
Michael Ryan was Deputy Chief Engineer at the United Nations’ World Food Programme and was based at its Rome headquarters, a spokesperson confirmed toTheJournal.ie.
“All of WFP’s thoughts and condolences are with the families of those killed.”
A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson toldTheJournal.ie: “The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the incident and providing consular assistance.
Also among the dead were tourists, business travellers, and UN staff, including some who worked for the World Food Programme, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The IOM said early indications were that 19 staff members of UN-affiliated organisations died in the crash.
Many were headed for an annual assembly of the UN Environment Programme, which opens in Nairobi today with 4,700 heads of state, ministers, business leaders, senior UN officials and civil society representatives.
Ethiopia’s parliament has declared a national day of mourning today.
According to the airline, Kenya had the largest number of casualties with 32, followed by Canada with 18, Ethiopia nine, then Italy, China, and the United States with eight each.
Britain and France each had seven people on board, Egypt six, and Germany five – though the breakdown was not final.
France’s government later said there were eight French victims.
“Our thoughts tonight are with families of all those lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, including Irish engineer Michael Ryan,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted.
“Michael was doing life-changing work in Africa with the World Food Programme. Deepest sympathies to family, colleagues & friends.”

Speaking to reporters yesterday, the Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said:
“I just want to say I am very sorry to hear about the Ethiopian airline that crashed this morning and I understand from media reports that there is one Irish citizen on that.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that it is a “tragedy” for the families involved.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Theresa May both described the news as “devastating”.
Investigation
Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s biggest carrier, said the search of the crash site had been suspended overnight, but would resume in daylight.
“A committee comprising of Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority and Ethiopian Transport Authority has been set up to carry out the investigations,” it added.
The US National Transportation Safety Board also said it would send investigators to assist.

THESE ARE SOME of the ruminations of Leopold Bloom, as outlined in Ulysses, when he visits Sweny’s pharmacy at Lincoln Place in Dublin on 16 June 1904.

The business described in James Joyce’s iconic novel is still in existence today, but serves a very different purpose.
The pharmacy opened in 1847 and was in business right up until 2009 – but remains largely unchanged since Victorian times. Volunteers, horrified at the thought of losing such a unique gem, swooped in to preserve it.
Now, it is home to a registered charity, holding daily Joyce readings and funding themselves through sales of second-hand books, curios, and the famous lemon soap with Mr Bloom buys in Ulysses.
It has recently faced a rent hike,with the volunteers now appealing for help in meeting the shortfall.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nurses-strike-leo-varadkar-complaints-foi-4539657-Mar2019/,"DYING CANCER PATIENTS, students and Fine Gael voters were among those who wrote to Leo Varadkar to express support for nurses during last month’s strike.
Correspondence to the Taoiseach’s office seen byTheJournal.iereveals some extent of the public support for the nurses during the industrial dispute.
Members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) went on general strike for a number of days in February, protesting against what they felt was a recruitment and retention crisis in the sector.
The government initially refused to accept the unions’ demands for wage increases for nurses, before the Labour Court intervened to avert further strikes on 11 February.
The INMO suspended further plans to strike over three days last month ahead of negotiations with the government on a new contract for nurses.
However, those talkswere referred back to the Labour Court this week, when the INMO branded the government’s proposals “deeply disappointing”.
The union’s executive council is expected to meet again later this month to discuss the issue further.
‘Dismissive attitude’
During the strike, a number of individuals wrote to Varadkar to question why nurses were not being given a pay rise despite politicians receiving their own boost under the Public Service Stability Agreement.
“Stop giving yourself and your fellow members pay increases, then we wouldn’t have a threat of a strike by our nurses,” one person wrote.
Another asked if the Taoiseach had considered how hospitals would function without nurses, saying that Varadkar’s “dismissive attitude” showed that he had not grasped the situation.
“It appears that this reality has not registered with you… I can assure you Taoiseach, the public is not impressed,” they said.

One Fine Gael voter hit out at the Taoiseach for suggesting that nursesshould not be allowed to take Christmas holidaysin the first week of the year, claiming that it was the government’s fault that the health service was not functioning properly.
“This strike could have been avoided…” they wrote.
‘No harder job’
A dying cancer patient also blamed Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris for the “biggest failures” of the health service.

Saying it might be their final opportunity to write to the Taoiseach, the individual praised the work that they had seen nurses do during their time in hospital.
“I see first hand the work nurses have to do,” they wrote.
“They are quite literally run off their feet. I’ve seen nurses miss out on breaks because a patient is dying or because there are a lot of admissions.
“I’ve witnessed stress like I’ve never seen before as nurses do their best to keep the health service afloat. There is no harder job on this planet than nursing, in my opinion.”
The individual claimed that Harris and Varadkar “looked down” on nurses and said it was a “disgrace” that the Government did not hire more to cover wards.
“I’m now terminally ill,” they continued.
“I’m dying. I don’t have long left in this world but I want to thank every nurse in this country who care for people who are sick and people like myself who are reaching the end of the road. Throughout my illness, you’ve been there.”
Government ‘spin’
Nurses themselves also wrote to the Taoiseach to complain about the Government’s stance during last month’s dispute.
One accused the Government of trying to make nurses “public enemy number one” during the strike.
“The government spin on how much nurses earn is ridiculous,” they wrote.
“I earned more as a student… than I do now as a nurse.”

Another told the Taoiseach that his comments about the dispute were “flippant, repetitive and archaic”, while another called Varadkar and his Cabinet colleagues “bullies”.
“I’ve worked in the most dangerous, understaffed conditions imaginable,” they wrote.
“I have cried more times in that job than I care to admit, I have gone home after a shift and had sleep paralysis dreaming about my patients… I demand you explain why I’m not worth it.”
Two local authorities – Sligo County Council and Galway County Council – also wrote to the office of the Taoiseach, after passing motions in support of the nurses at their monthly meetings.

Marks and Spencer has said “this is purely a voluntary proposal”.

No Irish stores were affected as part of the move.
The following day, the retailer announced it was to reduce 200 products by an average of 24% in a bid to compete with discount retailers.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS been urged to make a statement after The Observer published claims that former Taoiseach Enda Kenny offered to use Ireland’s position to lobby on behalf of Facebook on EU data legislation.
Thearticle published detailsfrom a Facebook memo which described Kenny as a “friend of Facebook” and said that the company had a “great relationship” with the former Taoiseach.
The memo claimed that Kenny stated that Ireland’s presidency of the EU provided “the opportunity to influence the European Data Directive decisions” and that Ireland could also influence other member states, “even though technically Ireland is supposed to remain neutral in this role”.
The memo was reportedly contained in court documents as part of a California court case involving Facebook.
Ireland held the presidency of the EUbetween January-June 2013during Kenny’s first term as Taoiseach.

Facebook’s international headquarters are located in Dublin and the article notes the critical role played by Ireland’s data protection commissioner on an EU-wide basis.
In response to the claims made in the article, Fianna Fáil’s enterprise spokesperson Billy Kelleher TD said questions needed to be answered.
“This will require a statement to clarify it (sic) the government and its diplomatic services were being used to lobby other EU member states on behalf of Facebook,” Kelleher tweeted.
Fianna Fáils technology spokesperson James Lawless TD described Kenny’s actions as described by the document as “brazen”.
“The willingness of former Fine Gael, Taoiseach Enda Kenny to bat for Facebook and his brazenness to use Ireland’s position to protect his allies in big tech is indicative of the appalling attitude still held among his party colleagues,” Lawless said.
We certainly need an explanation regarding this matter but we also need a tangible gesture of intent from government that they are serious about appropriately dealing with the giants operating within social media. Our bill can do that and can be prioritised on the legislative agenda if they truly recognise its importance.
Independent MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan described the claims in the article as “extraordinary”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-drink-driving-2-4522124-Mar2019/,"A REPORT INThe Sunday Business Posthas said that the government is to look at whether convicted drink drivers could be given a “limited licence” to allow them drive to work.

THE UK PRIME Minister has confirmed that she has sought to delay Brexit, and said the House of Commons had “indulged itself on Europe for too long” as she seeks to finally secure the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
During a feisty Prime Minister’s Questions this afternoon, Theresa May said she’d written to European Council president Donald Tusk formally asking to delay Brexit until 30 June.
However, an internal briefing memo from the European Commission said this departure date would bring “serious legal and political risks”, ahead of a meeting with EU leaders.
The Commission’s memo has urged instead that EU leaders to choose between a short delay to 23 May or a longer one to “at least until the end of 2019″.
That 30 June date would mean the UK would not need to hold elections to elect representatives to the European Parliament, May indicated, but this is at odds with the EU’s position. The EU says that, like Ireland and all the other EU countries, if the UK is in the EU after 23 May, it’ll have to elect new MEPs.
A European Commission spokesperson said this afternoon that Jean-Claude Juncker “formally warned” May against including a date for extension that is after the EU elections – which take place across EU countries from 23-26 May.
“Withdrawal has to be before 23 May, otherwise we face institutional difficulties and legal uncertainty,” the spokesperson said. “Elections have to be held if extension after 23 May.”

“As Prime Minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June,” May told the House of Commons today.

In her letter to Tusk, May said that it wouldn’t be in the interests of the UK or the EU to hold European Parliament elections.
She told Tusk she had intended to have a third meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement – which has already been rejected twice – but said the intervention of house Speaker John Bercow has “made it impossible in practice to call a further vote” ahead of a meeting of EU leaders tomorrow.

The UK had been due to leave the EU in less than 10 days’ time on 29 March, but May closes her letter seeking an extension of the Article 50 withdrawal mechanism until 30 June.
Speaking in the House of Commons today, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Theresa May of having “no plan” and of plunging the UK into a “full-scale national crisis”.
“She told the house the EU would only accept a delay if there’s a clear purpose,” he said. “What is her clear purpose?”
May said she was seeking an extension and fully intended on another meaningful vote on her Brexit deal.
“The outcome of a long extension [beyond 30 June] would be this house spending yet more endless hours failing to address issues that matter to our constituents,” she said.
Corbyn shot back that for her deal to stand a chance of getting through, May would have to come back with substantive changes.
An Irish government spokesperson, meanwhile said: “The government will consider recent developments including the Prime Minister’s letter at its Cabinet meeting this afternoon.”

Things could not get worse for Kevin and his mother Madelle. In crisis-ridden Venezuela, they could not get a hospital to treat Kevin.
Madelle recounted that he was refused in one hospital because his name was too ‘gringo’.
Kevin Masterson’s Dad was Patrick Masterson, from Raheny in Dublin. Patrick left Ireland in the 1970s to go to London and there he met a Venezuelan potter called Madelle. They decided to go to Venezuela which had a booming economy due to the high oil price, to start a new life. They did so by producing unique pottery, a blend of Irish and Venezuelan, and made a good living until the economy went belly-up.
By then they had two children, Kevin and Ita.
Initially, for Patrick, the Chavez government seemed to offer hope, as they struggled to survive in the late 1990s. Bit by bit though, as Patrick and Madelle sunk into the ever deeper hole of poverty, their faith inChavismowaned.
I first met Patrick in 1991 when I was living in Caracas. He was happy – an artist alive with ideas. We kept in contact when I returned home.
I last met him in 2006. He was a broken man, broken by poverty and by hopelessness. One year later, at the age of 59, he died of a heart attack, in the back of a jeep, on the way to the hospital. Little did he know that things were going to get much worse for his family.
Chavez died too and was replaced by Maduro, his anointed successor. Like many other families in Venezuela, the poverty of the Masterson’s just kept getting worse and worse.
Crisis struck last September when Madelle fell and broke her wrist, ribs and suffered a punctured lung. Kevin needed money to cover hospital care and there was none in Venezuela.
She was going to die if he did not get help. His Irish relatives and friends funded the cost of hospital care and medicine for Madelle.
At first, the Irish supporters were able to get dollars to the Mastersons but in time this became difficult as the persons who helped channel the money left for the US or Spain.
As Madelle was just getting back on her feet, bad luck struck again. Last week Kevin vomited blood. It turned out that he had used all the help from Ireland to feed his ailing mother and starved himself.

He developed a chronic bleeding ulcer – the product of stress and malnutrition and he needed an immediate operation. The minimum cost was $1000. Again, his Irish family and friends quickly sent the money and he was treated.
Unfortunately, there was a power cut during the operation. Kevin suffered respiratory failure and was just kept alive before the power was restored. Kevin Masterson is clinging to life as is his mother Madelle.
This is the truth of Venezuela — it is no longer the amazing resource-rich salsa-dancing haven on the Caribbean.
What hurts Venezuelans most is that all of this is totally unnecessary.
Democracy needs to be allowed to give someone else a chance.
Let’s be clear, there is no silver bullet. Any replacement government is going to struggle to tackle the problems confronting the country.
Venezuela’s core issue is that its only source of income is from oil but their production is down 70% and the price of oil is 25% of its peak in 2006. This is a true economic disaster.
Clearly, Venezuela needs to transform its economy, it needs to diversify its production, it needs to win the trust of the international community. The last person to lead this is Nicolás Maduro.
I was in Caracas during the parliamentary elections in December 2015. Everyone, there was surprised at the scale of victory for the united opposition candidates. They won over 75% of seats, one of which went to a new deputy, Juan Guaidó.
The Venezuelan voters clearly wanted change. But 18 months later, in the elections for a new constitutional assembly, the Chavistas won an unbelievable 90% of seats.
Any member of Fianna Fail will tell you, from experience, that you don’t reverse a landslide political loss in eighteen months.
Venezuela, once among the richest countries in Latin-American now needs food aid. The Irish government, using its EU position, must push to demand fair and free elections.
The 60 countries supporting Guaidó need to commit to a massive investment in Venezuela and a plan to rebuild the Venezuelan economy.Otherwise, we will continue to witness millions of Kevin and Madelle Mastersons, and even though they may have less ‘gringo’ names, they will have no food and no health care — their only hope is democracy. And they need it now.
Eamon Stack lived and worked in Venezuela for three years. He is best known for organising the Garvaghy Road residents to peacefully protest against Orange Order parades in Drumcree between 1994 and 1997.

STEPHEN KENNY MAY, over the next 18 months, come to know how senior international football works, but 17 years ago Mick McCarthy showed him how it can end.
Kenny was standing with Pat Dolan and the Irish Independent’s Vincent Hogan outside Lansdowne Road on a fraught October night, looking on as the Irish team bus pulled away from the West Stand.
An Irish fan ran alongside the bus, spitting poison into a plastic megaphone.
When the bus came to a stop, he found himself looking straight at Mick McCarthy.
“Fuck off home you English c**t”.
A sour episode at the end of a night in which Mick McCarthy’s Irish reign had endured its rapid, final curdle.
Robbie Keane reacts to a missed chance on that fateful night against Switzerland.INPHOINPHO
Ireland had just been beaten 2-1 by Switzerland at Lansdowne Road; the manager’s gamble in replacing a defender (Ian Harte) with an attacker (Gary Doherty) backfiring when Fabio Celestini scored a late winner.
With Ireland suddenly winless from their opening two Euro 2004 qualifiers, McCarthy was whipped back into the dressing room by a roiling crowd; his ears lashed with boos, taunts, and jeers.
“No, never, ever”, says Clinton Morrison, when asked byThe42if he had ever heard an Irish crowd so.
“Everytime I played for Ireland the fans have been excellent, but that was the final straw, and they thought that was the time for him to go.”
McCarthy did eventually go, albeit it was a slightly drawn-out process with some unseemly public squabbling about a pay-off before he announced his resignation on 5 November.
While he insisted he wouldn’t walk away after the match, a television interview in which he admitted the negativity directed at him was affecting the team’s performances hinted that his exit was inevitable.
Dion Fanning of the Sunday Independent reported that McCarthy left the dressing room in tears, and as he stepped out to do that interview, was supported by a roar from the dressing room.
McCarthy arrives at a press conference to announce his resignation.INPHOINPHO
“Don’t let the bastards get you, Mick.

That nobody knew exactly who the bastards were went to show how utterly warped discussion around McCarthy’s position had become.
“He was emotional”, says Morrison.
“Everyone looks at Big Mick and thinks, ‘Oh yeah, this big Yorkshire guy’, but he cared like everyone else.”
It all, of course, came back to Roy.
Keane remained in his post-Saipan exile, and after he granted an interview to say he would return to play for any manager other than Mick, the manager’s authority wouldn’t survive another bad result.
In the middle of the Saipan chaos, a Sunday Independent telephone poll found 51% were in favour of Mick; by the time the Swiss had won in Dublin, it had tipped to more than two-thirds in Roy’s favour.
Eventually, Mick fell on his sword, announcing his resignation by saying that “some of the negativity directed at me was affecting the players.
“Under normal circumstances, people leave because things are on the wane. The last two results [defeats by Russia and Switzerland] may suggest that but I don’t think it’s the case.
“I walk away with my head held high. It has been a privilege and an honour to do the job. My successor, whoever he or she is, has a great job and a great bunch of players.”
Johns Aldridge and Toshack were among the early favourites; Giles suggested Keane as a player-manager. One optimistic Irish Independent columnist recommended Johan Cruyff. In the end, the job was Brian Kerr’s.
Now, 5952 days and four permanent managers later, McCarthy is back.
“The butterflies are already starting”, McCarthy said at his pre-match press conference.
“I have that feeling. And I’m glad I have. Because if I lose that then there’d be something wrong, as it’s been there since the very first game I played.”
Back in 2002, the Telegraph reported Mick’s resignation by saying that he “may have won the battle with Roy Keane but he lost the war”, not realising that theirs was the kind of falling-out that should be told on a tapestry.
It is reductive to view McCarthy’s long management career through the prism of Keane, but given he was forced out of the job by critics looking and roaring through that distorted lens, it’s worth comparing them since.
Mick resigned, and Roy returned. Then Roy retired and moved into management, where he succeeded Mick at Sunderland. Then he was sacked and took over at Ipswich, where he was again sacked and within eighteen months had Mick among the list of his successors.
Roy then improbably ended up working with the FAI, only to be again succeeded by Mick, who has now been charged with sprucing up a gloomy camp.
So how has McCarthy, who left the job in one of the most febrile Lansdowne atmospheres ever, become the man to make it all happy again?
His essential dignity in the final days of the last reign has stood to him as he has been rehabilitated in exile.

Where once Keane’s anger and misanthropy could be cast as a condition of his greatness, it has in recent years exacerbated jobs at which he is mediocre.
McCarthy has continued to work in these environments, his greater success seemingly coming from the fact that he genuinely enjoys it.
Whereas Keane wrote in his book that he doesn’t particularly like footballers, McCarthy said this week that he enjoys “just being at close quarters with players…I enjoy being with them, I enjoy watching them, and interacting with them. It’s great.”
McCarthy is largely working with the same group of players as Keane and Martin O’Neill had – only Mark Travers, Josh Cullen, Jack Byrne and James Collins weren’t capped by the former manager – so he has thus far relied on affecting a change in spirit.
He has always refused to engage with questions inviting him to say that he is picking a lower quality of player to his previous reign, telling one journalist that he wouldn’t “insult” his players that way.
McCarthy has also refused to agree with O’Neill’s dreary “I worked with an older Robbie Keane than I would have liked” incantation in response to a lack of goals.
Instead he has talked up James Collins’ form, David McGoldrick’s record, and Sean Maguire’s potential.

Matt Doherty and Jack Byrne, whose unusual levels of self-confidence were not always a valuable currency in the previous set-up, were put front and centre for media duties.
Doherty was a critic of a previous camp he referred to as “tense”, but on Wednesday spoke glowingly of the atmosphere in McCarthy.
McCarthy will also end O’Neill’s custom of telling the players the team a couple of hours before the game, and thus there should be greater clarity of purpose in their approach.
That should stand to them against Gibraltar, where anything other than a win would be a catastrophe and would lead us all to revise the Sunday Tribune’s scathing summary of Jack Charlton’s failure against Lichtenstein, where Ireland “drew 0-0 with a mountaintop.”
Providing his side don’t end up mining ignominy from Gibraltar, McCarthy’s challenge then will be startling the Aviva from its disaffected slumber on Tuesday.
And whereas McCarthy left a fiery, furious ground 17 years ago, the one he returns to next week has been dulled beyond passion.
One last fling for Mick and Ireland then, for which he might earn a championship game in Dublin and a more fitting farewell.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eurovision-boycott-israeli-ambassador-4553285-Mar2019/,"PROTESTERS CALLING FOR a boycott of this year’s Israel-hosted Eurovision have a record of trying to “hijack” cultural and sporting events for political reasons, Israel’s ambassador to Ireland has said.
In an interview withTheJournal.ie, Ambassador Ophir Kariv said he was glad RTÉ had been “strong in its position that this is a big cultural event and that politics should not be involved in it”.
His comments come in the wake of renewed calls from the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign to boycott the song contest, to be held in May in Tel Aviv.
In a protest at RTÉ called to coincide with that day’s announcement of Sarah McTernan as this year’s competitor, the group called on the singer to “stand on the right side of history by listening to the Palestinian and international calls for a boycott”.
The first suggestions that Ireland should stage a boycott of the contest sprang up on social media moments after singer Netta’s triumph in Portugal last year.
A campaign supported by a range of Irish artists and media personalities, including a former Eurovision host,was launched last June, and a petition supporting an Irish boycott now has over 11,000 signatures.
The IPSC supports a long-running cultural boycott of Israel. In the UK, meanwhile, cultural figures like Peter Gabriel and Mike Leighhave signed a letter to the BBCcalling on it to cancel coverage of the contest.
Speaking to this website Ambassador Kariv said that millions of Europeans “voted for the Israeli song knowing that Eurovision was going to take place in Israel at the end of it”.
“Even though some people have tried to make it one, this is not a political event. It’s a cultural event, it’s a musical event and we are expecting close to 20,000 people travelling from all across the world, especially from Europe.”
Asked about this month’s protest, he said the group calling for a boycott “are people you see time and again trying to hijack the agenda of sporting and cultural events”.
Speaking at the RTÉ protest ISPC chairperson Fatin Al Tamimi said that Palestinian fans “whether from the occupied Palestinian territories or the refugee diaspora are highly unlikely to be allowed entry to attend the contest, reflecting Israel’s discriminatory apartheid system imposed upon Palestinians”.

Kariv, asked to respond to that point, said: “Anyone from any country will be welcome to participate.
He added that “the government and the state is obliged to keep the security of Israeli citizens, and this will have to be imposed and this right will have to be maintained also during the Eurovision”.
“Palestinians do cross to Israel on a daily basis. Thousands of them cross from the West Bank to Israel itself on a daily basis. There’s nothing discriminatory here and certainly the word apartheid has been reinvented when it’s mentioned together with Israel. This is so wrong – it doesn’t have anything to do with reality on the ground.
The Jerusalem Postreported last monththat Israel had upgraded the technology at the main crossing point between the northern West Bank and Jerusalem in a bid to cut down significant wait times at the crossing.
More recently the Times of Israelreported this weekthat a total shutdown of crossing points from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank would be in place for four days ahead of the holiday of Purim, in keeping with standard practice during holidays and festivals.
Security
Asked for advice for Irish Eurovision fans who do plan to travel to Israel this May the ambassador said that in Tel Aviv they can expect to find “one of the most lively cities in the world, one of the most open cities in the world one of the safest cities in the world”.
“It’s very culturally diverse, especially around the Eurovision time, there’s going to be many cultural events and performances.”
Eurovision competitors and other artists will stage performances in a specially constructed Euro Village that would be set up about two weeks before the contest, he said.
Asked what people can expect in terms of security he said such concerns had “long ceased to be only Israel’s concern and you can see heightened security around Europe at all major events that are cultural and you can expect the same in Israel”.
“In Israel unfortunately we have a lot of experience in this field and many in Europe I believe are now  dealing with similar challenges.
The latest travel advicefrom the Department of Foreign Affairs here advises Irish citizens in Israel and the Occupied Territories to exercise “a high degree of caution”.
It also notes that the Israeli Parliament passed a law in 2017 “which gives authority to immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/cancer-speak-talk-diagnosis-daffodil-day-4554883-Mar2019/,"SOMEONE YOU KNOW has been diagnosed with a serious illness and you bump into a close relative of theirs. Words won’t come. You’re standing there and you need, desperately, to say something, anything.
Remember, no-one has ever been offended by the words:“I don’t know what to say… I’m so sorry for this horrible thing that is happening to you.”
“I’m thinking of you”is never the wrong thing to say.
The right words are never easy to find. No-one knows that better than the patient’s close relatives who are already struggling to find the words to process what’s happening, to comfort each other; while trying not to look sick with dread, trying to keep a “normal” face fortheirloved one.
The world has suddenly spun out of control. Days are a pile-up of scans, biopsies and medical appointments with a constant undercurrent of terror. It’s no-one’s fault when life becomes suspended in that sadistic wait for results or the treatment plan is cruel.
For loved ones, there is a single focus: the needs and wishes of the person who is going through this. There is only so much the relatives can control and, first and foremost, comes the patient’s privacy and dignity. So remember this above all when you’re in that moment, unsure of what to say, or even more so when you’re tempted – as we all can be – to ask the kind of questions you regard as “straight” and “honest”.
No matter how long or close your friendship, such queries can sound a lot like a probe for a gossipy nugget to be shared and dissected over a few drinks.
Calling on our own and others’ experiences in the worst of situations, we’ve come up with 10 things that are commonly said to patients and relatives – and examined how not to say them and what might be a better way of saying it.
But first, a lesson for those of us who have been on this side. People feel helpless when they see their friends suffering. And sometimes they say the wrong thing. But what we have learned from going through all those rights and wrongs is that they’re there, (mostly) doing the very best that they can, letting you know they love you. And they really want to help. Let them.
Unasked, they will leave care packages with phone chargers, fleecy pyjamas and books at your front door; still-warm lasagnes and curries in the garage; fruit baskets behind walls. People will feed the dogs after an unexpected hospital dash, arrive early on a Saturday to cut back the hedges and send someone over to adapt doors to the patient’s new normal.
This list isn’t designed to make you feel bad or inadequate; or to agonise over previous behaviour. We simply hope it helps.
1. “Shout if there’s anything I can do.”
Open-ended questions are exhausting. Most people have to get used to asking for help, especially if they’re already leaning heavily on grieving family and friends for emotional support.
Try to be specific.
Instead of a text asking,“How’s everything?”(often too open-ended for a polite reply), try a more manageable,“How are you today?”
Be practical.
For one friend, the best thing anyone said was, “Sit down and write me a list of what you need done – no job too small – and jump in the shower and leave me to it.”
For another, preparing for her husband to be moved from hospital to home and into an unknowable new phase, her sister arrived before they returned, arranged a beautiful, cosy new bedroom in a downstairs room, cleaned the house and lit the fire.
Back to that important lesson for us: people really want to help. Let them.
2. “What’s the prognosis?”
“How bad is it? Did they give you a timeline?”
Of course people are worried and want to know what’s happening but questions like these can feel like acts of violence towards a family.
Months of treatment and unknowns lie ahead. Some of us have huddled in a hospital family room with a surgeon coldly presenting a countdown calendar of life. For a patient and their family who are unsure they will come through this, asking for the prognosis is brutal.
Advertisement
It’s up to the patient to divulge what they want to reveal, to whom and when. And it’s up to us to protect that patient and their dignity in the process.
If you feel out of the loop, it’s probably because it’s not the right time to have this conversation.
Do say:“We’re thinking of you, sorry you’re going through this.”
3. “I can’t get any of you to answer your phones. Next time I’m just going to turn up at the house.”
Just don’t. You have no idea what is happening in that house. The patient’s mobility may be deteriorating. They may be unable to manipulate a knife and fork. They don’t need an audience at what may be random, difficult meal times. The kindest visitors will offer a certain day and time for a visit and cheerfully add that it’s ok to cancel right up to the last minute. They might text just beforehand to check that it’s still a good time.
You’re still friends.
The patient/family’s capacity for small-talk and a hangover may be just diminished right now.
4. “You just have to be positive.”
No, I have to be realistic. And practical. Platitudes are neither.
We question oncologists, radiologists, neurologists, nurses. Take notes and process what it means. We learn to differentiate between symptoms and side-effects, watching in fear as the patient moves into what we only guess is “a new phase”.
Depending on the course of the illness, this can be a constant low-level terror. Expecting someone to look on the bright side and keep their chin up is, at best, minimising the situation they’ve found themselves in; at worst, it further exacerbates feelings of loneliness.
“They’ll get through this.”“Everything will be ok.”“It really shows you, every day counts.”“They’re lucky it’s not 30 years ago, by God it was a different story back then.”“Everything happens for a reason. At least they’re doing treatment.”
You don’t have to be a cheerleader. Avoid sentences that begin with, ‘At least…’
Let patients and their carers be honest. If they want to share their despair, disbelief or fear, let them. If they’ve brought it up, it’s probably because they need to get it out. Don’t imply that their extremely founded fears are unfounded. Just listen. Try not to interrupt or disagree.
5. “She’s a fighter. If anyone can beat this, she can.”
“Fight this. Beat this. Kill it. Smash it. You’re a warrior.”
It’s not war. Or CrossFit.
You’re watching the patient do everything the doctors tell them to do. They can do no more.
If rounds of chemo and radiation and surgery and drugs don’t work, will people think that they didn’t fight hard enough, weren’t strong enough, that they just gave up? Did they fight less valiantly than someone else?
It’s another enormous pressure to put on patients. And on the families witnessing their bodies fail and for whom it’s probably painfully clear that no battle or strength of character is going to reverse.
Coming out the other side of cancer is based on so many factors (including inexplicable luck). Personality and combat style are not among them.
Just say:“I’m really sorry you’re all dealing with this.”
6. “I read about an amazing diet that cured a woman’s cancer in Australia. I’ll send it to you.”
No, please don’t. Just think very carefully first about whether your best-intentioned advice will be helpful.
“Has she cut sugar from her diet? I heard of someone who decided against chemo and visited a shaman and she’s the healthiest person I know. I’ll send you links to a few articles on the power of positive thinking. He should be drinking a green juice twice a day. Are you all still eating meat?”

Cancer is complicated. Pushing vitamins and yoga and ketogenic diets onto patients undergoing a treatment plan devised by a multi-disciplinary team of experts the family has come to trust – in whose hands they have almost literally placed your loved one’s life – implies that we’re not doing enough. That more could be done. And we just aren’t bothered to research it.
Respect the patient and their choices. Don’t add guilt into the horrible mix.
If you know of something that helps to relieve nasty side effects – frozen pineapple chunks for mouth-sores, ginger for nausea – go with that. Just think carefully before you offer it.
7. “I know someone who had the exact same thing as her and they’re flying it now.”
Cancers are not the same. Experiences are not the same. Based on our family’s experience and watching one person progress compared to the other, we often observed that different forms of cancer are like different diseases.
Don’t go there. Teams of experts make specific treatment decisions based entirely on that one individual’s case.
Don’t tell a story about someone who had“the exact same thing”and died (yes, this happens). Be careful with the one about the woman who“had that 20 years ago and she went and kicked cancer’s arse”.
Don’t say,“My neighbour forced herself to walk Killiney Hill every day without fail while she was having chemo. She said she’d have gone mad if she hadn’t had that to keep her going. Tell your mum.”
I didn’t tell my mum. That story only made me worried that she, undergoing treatment, was hiding something more serious from us:‘How come that woman can hike a 10k every morning and my mum is struggling to get to the top of the stairs?’
8. “I don’t know how you’re coping. I’d fall to pieces”
A supermarket car-park on a Sunday morning is not the ideal spot for the community to witness a meltdown.
“I have no idea what’s happening and in fact I didn’t think I was coping very well at all but now that you mention it, I’m reminded that we have no absolutely no choice in the matter and we’re doing just about all we can to keep breathing and standing upright.”
You would probably keep upright too. But the family dynamic could mean that you feel a responsibility to be The Strong One so you may be less likely to admit to feeling down, to ask for help or just for a break.
Do say:“I know you have some bad days. If you want to go for a walk or breakfast, let me know. You can cry or scream, talk or not talk.”Just a text. Heart emojis are always welcome too.
9. “I heard about the scan results, amazing news. Are you popping Champagne tonight?”
The reality is that there has most likely been a long, terrified lead-up to that scan appointment.
You’re back in the hospital, your optimism scorched, aware that the cancer could re-erupt. It’s not all over and they’re not “cured” just because they’ve finished their last treatment or the scan has shown a shrinkage. Life may get better but for many, it will never be quite the same.
Do say:“I’m glad you’ve made it through such a crap time.”
10. “I feel so bad I wasn’t around. I just didn’t know what to say.”
Of course you don’t know what to say. We don’t either.
But admitting that is better than avoiding it and saying nothing (except in the instances above where it’s better to say nothing). Or:“I know I haven’t been in touch but don’t worry, someone from down the road has been updating me.”
Send a card. It’s never too late. Never.

The bodies of a woman and a teenage girl were also found in the apartment on Glin Ree Court, in what’s being treated as a suspected murder-suicide.
Yesterday, the PSNI named the 37-year-old woman as Giselle Marimon-Herrera and 15 year old teenager as Allison Marimon-Herrera.
A post-mortem last night confirmed that the cause of 15-year-old Allison’s death was strangulation.
Although the post-mortem results are not definitive for Giselle, detectives believe there is “a strong possibility” she too was strangled.

Steele, who the PSNI said is believed to have been Giselle’s partner, died by hanging.
Police said on Thursday that they were “not looking for anyone else” in connection with the deaths.
Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy had appealed to anyone who came in direct contact with either Giselle or Allison, or who communicated with them via text or social media since last Friday to contact police in Newry.
“My thoughts today are very much with their families and friends who are trying to come to terms with their loss,” he said in an earlier statement.
Giselle was from Colombia and arrived in Northern Ireland around four years ago. Allison was born in Spain and has lived in the North since 2017. She attended Newry High School.

https://www.the42.ie/rory-mcilroy-the-players-championship-golf-4548368-Mar2019/,"A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE from Rory McIlroy saw the County Down native secure the Players Championship at Sawgrass on Sunday to cap off a perfect St Patrick’s Day.
The four-time Major winner recovered from a double-bogey six at the fourth to card a 70 and finish on 16 under, one stroke ahead of Jim Furyk, securing his first PGA Tour win since the Arnold Palmer Invitational 365 days ago.
Jon Rahm, who held the overnight lead by one stroke from McIlroy and fellow Team Europe Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood, faded badly to finish five back.
Fleetwood ended up on 13 under alongside world number one Dustin Johnson and Brandt Snedeker, while Tiger Woods claimed a tie for 30th on six under.
McIlroy adds Sunday’s crown — the unofficial fifth major — to his collection while picking up the $2.25 million prize.
He now approaches the 2019 Masters at Augusta with a renewed confidence seeking to become just the sixth man to ever complete the career grand slam.

“It’s very special, I just tried to treat it like another day,” McIlroy said after his victory.
“Even though I’ve had close calls this year, they didn’t mean anything. They were good for me, I call them ‘remote misses’. It gives you even more hope to go again — I think all those experiences this year led me to this point.
“Ultimately they were good for me because it got me over the line today. I birdied nine, I had a great chance on ten, birdied eleven and then before I hit my tee-shot on twelve I heard this big roar and I backed off.
“The birdie on twelve was huge, just to give me a little bit of momentum to get to fifteen under par.”
McIlroy bogeyed the 14th but held his nerve in the final stages with back-to-back birdies to reclaim the lead, before navigating the final two holes with two pars.
“The final few holes were tough and to get that birdie on fifteen after the drop shot on fourteen was massive,” he said. “I knew sixteen was a good chance and then just to par the last two holes gives me a lot of confidence going forward.

“This is a great start to the season. It’s a massive win, but the way I played on those last few holes gives me huge confidence.
“If I hadn’t have won today I would have said that I don’t need a win going into Augusta, but it’s very nice to get a win, especially doing it on this golf course which plays a little bit similar to the way Augusta will play in a few weeks’ time.
“As I said, I can take a lot from this. It’s taken me a few weeks to get to this point, but I feel like I’m playing some of the best golf of my life right now and I just need to keep going with it and keep doing the same things.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/protest-the-ivy-waiters-tips-4544235-Mar2019/,"A NUMBER OF activists gathered outside The Ivy restaurant yesterday evening to protest working conditions.
Issues at the restaurantfirst came to light in Novemberlast year when staff were told they will no longer be allowed process payments from customers after management alleged that some waiters were asking patrons to pay tips in cash, rather than on a credit card.
Management at the restaurant posted a staff notice to express disappointment that bad manners had been shown to guests by being “consistently asked for cash”. Management also claimed that the cash tips were not being shared with other staff members.
The notice said that a new system would mean no team member is ever to handle cash or card from a guest. Until trust was rebuilt, management would process all payments, the notice said.
In a video posted online yesterday, a ‘menu’ of alleged workplace issues was read aloud by an activist to customers and management in the restaurant.
Reading a list of issues aloud as diners continued with their meals around her, the woman told them good service was “not rewarded” at the restaurant.

Independent TD Joan Collins supported yesterday’s protest.
Raising the issue in the Dáil, Joan Collins TD said “I have been approached recently by workers in the new, swanky and expensive restaurant, The Ivy, where the company is taking the major proportion of tips paid to staff to make up the difference in their wages.”
The Ivy response
In a statement today, The Ivy said: “The Ivy collection would like to clarify that 100% of credit card tips are shared amongst the entire 150 staff members (excluding management).
“A gratuity per hour is paid to every staff member in addition to their contractual hourly wage and is guaranteed by the company in that any shortfall, regardless of whether any tips are paid by patrons, will be made up by the company.”
It said that “all cash tips are kept by the individual waiter/waitress, although they are encouraged to share these tips with their colleagues”.
“We believe that the credit card tips should be shared amongst the entire team (excluding management) reflecting everyone’s contribution to the service.
In a statement to Liveline in November, The Ivy explained that when a tip is paid by credit card, it goes towards a shared gratuity per hour that all restaurant staff – including front of house, bar staff and kitchen porters – receive.
The Ivy is located on Dawson Street in Dublin city centre.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cardinal-pell-sentenced-4538556-Mar2019/,"
DISGRACED AUSTRALIAN CARDINAL George Pell “may not live to be released from prison”, the judge warned a Melbourne court today as the sentencing of the 77-year-old for child sex crimes began.
Pell, the most senior Catholic clergyman ever found guilty of child sex abuse, faced a maximum 50 years in prison for assaulting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral in 1996-97.
Today, he was sentenced to six years in jail but will be eligible for parole after three.
The Australian cleric has been in custody since late February ahead of the sentencing hearing. Sitting at the back of the court as Justice Kidd read out his remarks, Pell was impassive and did not wear his white clerical collar with his black shirt and light olive-coloured jacket.
The cardinal is “entitled to the balanced and steady hand of justice”, Chief Judge Peter Kidd told the County Court of Victoria as he opened his sentencing remarks.
He warned that the cleric was on trial and not the Catholic Church and lamented a “lynch mob mentality” among some of the public, adding: “You are not to be made a scapegoat.”
“I am not sitting in judgment of the Catholic Church,” Justice Kidd added, vowing to deal with only the facts of the case.
Going through the crimes in graphic detail, Justice Kidd said that Pell’s actions had a “profound impact” on the life of the boy who survived his abuse and likely had a similar impact on a boy who later died of a heroin overdose.
Assaulting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral with both present likely caused additional “degradation and humiliation”,” he said.
He accused Pell of “callous indifference” to the suffering of the boys, who have not been named.
The jury was told that Pell abused the two boys after catching them swigging from a bottle of sacramental wine in the sacristy after Sunday mass. He exposed himself and forced one of them to perform oral sex on him, and fondled the boy’s genitals while masturbating.

Justice Kidd said the offences in the sacristy “involved a brazen and forceful sexual attack on the two victims”.
“The acts were sexually graphic. Both victims were visibly and audibly distressed during this offending,” he said.
Acknowledging Pell’s age and his health issues including cardiac problems and hypertension, Justice Kidd said that his sentence “carries with it a… possibility that you may not live to be released from prison”.
“Of some real importance in my sentencing exercise is the fact that each year you spend in custody will represent a substantial portion of your remaining life expectancy,” he added.
Pell was found guilty by a jury in December, but a suppression order Justice Kidd prevented media from reporting the case until late February, when prosecutors withdrew plans to hold a second trial.
Victim reaction
One of the victims, who remains anonymous but issued a statement through his lawyer, said it was difficult to allow himself to feel the “gravity of the moment”.
“I appreciate that the court has acknowledged what was inflicted upon me as a child,” h said. “However, there is no rest for me. Everything is overshadowed by the forthcoming appeal.”
The father of the other victim, who died of a drug overdose in 2014, said through his lawyer that Pell’s sentence was “disappointing”.
“Our client is disappointed with the short sentencing and has expressed sadness over what he believes is inadequate for the crime,” Lisa Flynn of Shine Lawyers said in a statement.
“I admire the courage of my client to keep fighting on behalf of his deceased son. To him, this battle is not over.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-i-felt-terror-when-i-realised-i-would-have-to-do-chemo-while-pregnant-4555678-Mar2019/,"ONE MORNING IN early January last year, whilst getting ready for work, I felt a very obvious lump in my breast.
People often ask me how I felt at that moment. Did my blood run cold? Was I terrified? The answer is no, I wasn’t because I was sure that it wasn’t cancer, I was too young.
I felt in some way protected because of my age. The youngest of five children, the ‘baby’ of the family – I couldn’t have cancer.
I was wrong.
I was 32 at the time and within two weeks of discovering the lump, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.
While it was confirmed that I had a tumour growing in my right breast, I also had a life growing inside me. I was 9 weeks pregnant!
I was told that I would need immediate surgery, followed by 6 months of chemotherapy.
Incredibly, once I began chemotherapy after my first trimester, my baby would be safe throughout my treatment, they said.
I struggled to believe that in the early days.
I armed myself with information. As a postdoctoral researcher in my career, information gathering was my speciality.
My husband and I met with consultants, counsellors, oncologists and women who had gone through cancer during pregnancy themselves.
The more information we gathered, the more I began to believe that maybe it was possible to treat my cancer and continue my pregnancy at the same time.
Feelings
Although surrounded by an incredible support network, at times I felt deeply alone. I was different, I was a cancer patient. Nobody wants that label. Even surrounded by other men and women undergoing treatment, with my growing baby bump – I was different.
With each passing round of chemo, my baby was scanned and each week he grew bigger and stronger.
We lived week to week and never really allowed ourselves to think or hope of meeting him for the first time – we could only live in the present.
Of course, there were very difficult days, but there were some great ones too.
Advertisement
The moment myself and my husband saw our baby’s heartbeat for the first time, is a feeling that will stay with us forever.
In that instant, I did not feel like a cancer patient, I didn’t feel worried or frightened.
I felt excited and that we were like any other couple – staring in awe at a monitor and watching the flicker of our baby’s heartbeat.
Surrounding myself with friends and family helped enormously throughout this time because I was still Mary to them – I may have looked different, but they saw and continue to see more than just cancer.
Cancer had changed me and for a long time I wished I could go back and be the person I was before I was diagnosed.
Because once I was told I had cancer, a little piece of myself died. I couldn’t look at my life, my relationships, my goals the same way anymore.
Fear clouded everything and I was terrified that I could no longer have the future I had planned. And that’s the thing, we may read it a million times and it may never really sink in but if there is one thing I can say with absolute certainty it is this.
On 10 August 2018, we were rewarded with this precious gift- our beautiful baby boy Cillian made his way into this world.
He was healthy and strong with a mop of dark brown hair.
Moving on
Today, I have finished all my treatment. I am heading back to work and I have my husband and son by my side.
I am one of the lucky ones. Lucky that I found my lump at an early stage, lucky that my GP referred me to a breast clinic and that I was surrounded by so much love and support from family and friends.
I am grateful to so many people – the wonderful staff at the National Maternity Hospital, my nurses, who in truth became my friends and of course my doctors – for their compassion, skill and diligence.
I’m also thankful for support groups such as Breast Friends, ARC and Mummystar, and the Irish Cancer Society’s Cancer Nurseline a free helpline where you can talk to a Cancer Nurse about any worries or concerns.
Using these supports helped me to realise that I am not the first person that this has happened to, I am not alone and that there is life after cancer. Many of these supports are reliant on Daffodil Day donations.
Cancer has changed me in so many ways but it is only a chapter (albeit a big one!) in a larger story that has yet to be written.

https://www.thejournal.ie/italy-bus-driver-abducts-school-kids-4552947-Mar2019/,"
A BUS DRIVER in northern Italy abducted 51 children and their chaperones earlier today, threatening them over a 40-minute ordeal before setting the vehicle on fire when he was stopped by a Carabinieri blockade.
Officers broke glass windows in the back of the bus and got all the passengers to safety without serious injury before the flames destroyed the vehicle, authorities said.
As he was apprehended, the driver said he was protesting migrant deaths in the Mediterranean, Commander Luca De Marchis told Sky TG24.
De Marchis told Sky TG24 that the driver, an Italian citizen of Senegalese origin in his 40s, threatened the passengers, telling them that “no one would survive today” as he commandeered the bus carrying two middle-school classes to a nearby gym in Cremona province, some 40 kilometres from Milan.
ANSA quoted one of the students as saying the driver took all their phones and ordered the chaperones to bind the students’ hands with cable ties, threatening to spill gas and set the bus ablaze. ANSA said the chaperones only loosely bound several students’ hands, not everyone’s.
One of the middle school students described his terror in an interview with La Repubblica TV, his face obscured due to his age. His name was not given.
“We were all very afraid because the driver had emptied the gas canister onto the floor (of the bus.) He tied us up and took all the telephones so we could not call the police,” the student said.
“One of the telephones, belonging to a classmate, fell to the ground, so I pulled off the handcuffs, hurting myself a bit, and went and picked it up. We called the Carabinieri and the police.”

Quotidiano La Provincia di Cremona/ YouTube
Authorities said that an adult called an emergency operator, while one of the students called a parent, and they alerted authorities, who set up roadblocks. The bus was intercepted on the outskirts of Milan by three Carabinieri vehicles, which were able to force it into the guardrail, De Marchis said.
“While two officers kept the driver busy — he took a lighter and threatened to set fire to the vehicle with a gasoline canister on board — the others forced open the back door, breaking two windows,” De Marchis said. While the evacuation was still underway, the driver started the blaze.
De Marchis credited the officers’ “swiftness and courage,” for getting out all the children and their teachers “with no tragic consequences.”
Some of the passengers were treated at a hospital, mostly for cuts and scratches related to the evacuation, he said.
Quotidiano La Provincia di Cremona/ YouTube
The driver was apprehended and was being treated for burns. ANSA identified him as Ousseynou Sy, and said he was being investigated on suspicion of kidnapping, intention to commit a massacre, arson and resisting law enforcement.
The prosecutor’s office later said they would add terrorism as an aggravating circumstance since the event caused panic.
De Marchis said he had previous convictions, but did not specify their nature.
ANSA reported that Sy, who became an Italian citizen in 2004, had been convicted in 2007 and 2011 of drunken driving and sexual molestation of a minor.
Sky TG24 said that the driver had worked for the bus company for 15 years without any employment-related issues.
“Investigators must clarify how the transport company permitted such a delinquent … to drive a bus, especially one carrying children,” said Riccardo De Corato, a Milan provincial official for security.

MPS HAVE HELD a crucial vote on whether to back a no-deal Brexit.
They voted against it in the end, but it was a confusing path to get there.
It’s important to remember that even though they’ve voted against a no-deal Brexit, that that isn’t a legally binding decision.

It’s Seán Murray here with you this afternoon and feel free to get in touch by commenting below, emailing sean@thejournal.ie, or tweeting me at @seanmjourno.
First, let’s catch you up with what’s been happening already today…
After the latest crushing defeat for Theresa May last night, the UK government publishedits plans for trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit early this morning.
It says there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
However, tariffs will apply to goods on the way into mainland UK.
And it is these tariffs on the likes of beef, lamb and poultry that have caused dismay in Ireland.
Irish Farmers’ Association Joe Healy said the beef industry, in particular, “will not survive the kind of tariffs being talked about”.
“We export over 50% of our beef to the UK.  If this is subject to tariffs, it will be a ‘direct hit’ of almost €800m on the sector,” he said.
From midday, Brexit was the topic of debate in both the House of Commons and in the Dáil when leaders questions got under way.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin asked about the tariff proposals from the UK government, saying it would be devastating for the Irish economy.
With the Taoiseach in Washington, Tánaiste Simon Coveney acknowledged that tariffs would be ”damaging to businesses, farmers and consumers, whether in Ireland or the UK”.
He added the government will study any proposals carefully.

https://www.thejournal.ie/article-50-brexit-date-extension-4542521-Mar2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted to back a short extension to Article 50, to push the UK’s date to exit the EU out by three months.
MPs voted to extend the exit date until 30 June.
The final vote was413in favour and202against – a majority of211for the government.
Several other motions, including one calling for an extension to be sought in order to hold a second referendum, were defeated.
Theresa May will now make a third attempt to get the EU withdrawal deal through parliament next week, ahead of an EU summit getting underway next Thursday.
If the deal May has been recommending since last November (and which MPs have already rejected twice) does not pass next week then the UK faces the prospect of a much longer extension of the Brexit date or leaving the EU without a deal.
A longer extension would require the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, a prospect the prime minister has said she does not support.
The UK will have to ask the EU if it can extend the exit date beyond 29 March and the leaders of the remaining 27 nations will have to sign off on any extension unanimously.
Deal or no deal
Tonight’s motion proposed seeking to extend the period covered by Article 50 until the end of June, noting thatif the House passes the withdrawal agreementby next Wednesday then the three month extension will be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
The motion also noted thatif the deal is not passedby next Wednesday “then it his highly likely” EU leaders will decide at their summit that they will require “a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019″.

Strangest 2 things of the night - Steve Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, voted against the plan he had been arguing for minutes before, and the chief whip who is in charge of getting MP s to back the govt, abstained
Seven cabinet ministers voted against the government’s own motion to push out the Brexit date, including Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay who had earlier spoken in favour of the motion during the afternoon’s debate.
Many Brexiteers fear any extension to the exit date will make Brexit more unlikely (with the prospect of Brexit not taking place at all becoming more likely the longer that extension goes on).
Even the government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote this evening.
Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (a former Brexit secretary) also voted against the extension. The original former Brexit secretary David Davis backed May’s motion and voted to delay Brexit.
The Conservative MPs who voted against the government motion tonight will not face punishment, as a free vote had been offered by May.

Other motions
Earlier this evening, MPs rejected a motion calling for an extension to Article 50 in order to hold a second referendum on Brexit.
Most Labour MPs sat out the vote, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell explaining that today was “not the day to press the public vote issue”.
Anti-Brexit campaign Best for Britain said today’s votes needed to focus on “the pressing need for an extension to Article 50″ to confirm the rejection of a cliff-edge exit in two weeks’ time.
Labour’s party policy is to try and get its own Brexit plan through first, and failing that it would back a second referendum.
The result was334against and only85in favour.

A motion put forward by Labour’s Hilary Benn calling for the House to put aside time next Wednesday for indicative votes on the way forward was defeated by a razor thin majority oftwo(314to312).
A separate vote was also held on a similar proposal, putting a deadline of 30 June on any process involving indicative votes. That was rejected by314votes to311.
A Labour frontbench motion calling for an extension of Article 50 to allow time to find a different approach was also defeated by318votes to302.
Now what?
EU Council chief Donald Tusk said earlier that a long postponement could be approved “if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.
His comments reflected Brussels’ long-standing position that a closer relationship is possible if May is willing to compromise, notably by abandoning her opposition to joining an EU customs union.
Other European leaders have warned that London must define a clear purpose to any extension.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney spoke of a possible Brexit postponement of 21 months, saying: “It would give a long reflection period for the British political system to look at how they want to approach Brexit again.”

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, speaking in the US, said tonight that he welcomed the vote for the extension “as it reduces the likelihood of a cliff edge, no-deal Brexit on March 29th”.
“But we now need to hear from London about what purpose an extension would serve and how long it would last. There seem to be two emerging options: ratification of the withdrawal agreement followed by a short extension into the summer, or a much longer extension that would give the UK time and space to decide what they want to do, including considering options that had been taken off the table like participation in the customs union and single market.
“I think we need to be open to any request they make, listen attentively and be generous in our response. This matter will be now discussed further at next week’s European Council meeting and hopefully we will have more clarity from London in the meantime about their intentions. Unanimity by the 27 will be required for any extension.”

DETECTIVES IN NORTHERN IRELAND are appealing for information to help solve the murder of two soldiers at the Massereene army barracks in Co Antrim in 2009.
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the atrocity, which also saw the attempted murder of three soldiers and two civilians.
Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead outside the barracks on Saturday, 7 March 2009.
Two of their colleagues were also injured in the attack, as were two civilians delivering pizza to the base.
Another soldier, who was close by, narrowly escaped injury.
To date, the PSNI’s investigation has resulted in 4,062 investigative actions, 1,858 witness statements, 33 searches and 14 arrests.

“Our thoughts today are very much with the families of Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar whose ongoing grief, pain and hurt must be unimaginable,” Detective Chief Superintendent Raymond Murray said.
“It is also a poignant day for those who were injured and maimed and now live with the physical and psychological scars of that fateful attack,” he said.
The PSNI is today appealing that anyone who has information about the attack and those who carried it out would come to the police with information which may open up new lines of enquiry.
“Today, on the 10th anniversary, I would appeal to those who know anything about the events of that night to come forward to police,” Murray said.

“There are people in the community who know exactly what happened and who was involved. A decade has passed and with that allegiances change and people’s circumstances alter. It is never too late to come forward,” he said.
Anyone with information should contact detectives in the PSNI major investigation team on 101. Alternatively, people can anonymously call UK Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

https://www.the42.ie/steve-hansen-4-4526284-Mar2019/,"ALL BLACKS BOSS Steve Hansen believes “hunted” Ireland are feeling the pressure of being the “top dog” after beating his New Zealand in November.
Heading into this weekend’s fixture with France at Lansdowne Road, Ireland currently sit third in the Guinness Six Nations table and have failed to fire on all cylinders since a crushing opening-round defeat to England last month.
Hansen himself hailed Joe Schmidt’s side as the world’s best after their first-ever home victory over the Kiwis in November, but the two-time World Cup-winning coach reckons Ireland are beginning to feel the weight of expectation ahead of the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.

“I said it at the time when we played Ireland that whoever won that game was going to be viewed as the number one team in the world and everyone is going to chase them,” Hansen told his native media.
“For us that’s something we’ve been used to. We’ve been ranked the number one team for 112 months now, I think, but people have seen Ireland as the top dog after they beat us, and that put a massive amount of expectation on the players and coaches.
With the All Blacks not currently in action, Hansen has been keeping his eye on the Six Nations as well as Super Rugby, and maintains that the northern hemisphere sides stand in good stead ahead of World Cup kick-off in September.
“They’re all capable of knocking off a big team,” he said. “There’s been some brutal tests.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/paschal-donohoe-strokestown-eviction-support-4534430-Mar2019/,"FINANCE MINISTER PASCHAL Donohoe held a meeting with KBC to “reassure” the bank of the government’s support in the wake of the controversy surrounding the forced eviction of a Roscommon family in December.
The mid-January meeting involved the head of the Belgian bank’s local operation, Wim Verbraeken, and its chairman, Luc Popelier.
Internal Department of Finance records state the main purpose of the meeting was “to reassure KBC about our support for the bank in light of the recent difficulties it has experienced follow the attempted repossession” of the Strokestown property.
The documents, obtained byTheJournal.ie, went on to note that KBC was an “important challenger bank” with an Irish market share of around 8% and more than 1,000 employees here.
The meeting followed the forced eviction of the three McGann siblings from their Roscommon farm in December, an incident involving a series of violent scuffles that were captured on video.
The case drew national media attention after private security guards employed by KBC were allegedly forced from the property by a group of masked men.
A screengrab of footage from the incidentThe DemocratThe Democrat
Speaking points
Under a list of “suggested speaking points” for Donohoe in advance of the meeting, finance officials said the minister could “welcome the opportunity to discuss concerns that KBC may have” about repossession issues.
“We fully accept that repossessions are part of the normal financial services landscape and that it must be possible to enforce security as a final resort when all else has failed,” the document said. The partially redacted records were released after a freedom of information request.
In public comments after the eviction, senior government figures were more circumspect in showing support for the bank.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil the facts behind the eviction “seem to be about much more than an elderly farm family being evicted” and there had been years of debt, arrears and tax evasion involved in the case.
“Nobody likes to see anyone being evicted in any circumstance. Nobody wants to see it happening, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. However, the High Court does not issue eviction orders lightly,” he said.
However in response to Sinn Féin criticism that the eviction was “an ordeal of thuggery inflicted by a group of men acting on behalf of a financial institution while gardaí watched”, Varadkar added that there was a need to regulate private security firms used by banks to carry out evictions.
The McGann familylater said that the Taoiseach’s commentswere “a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from some of the very serious issues relating to our eviction”.
Two men have since been charged over the violent confrontations after guards occupying the site were attacked. A security dog had to be put down after suffering serious injuries during the incident, while the guards’ six vehicles were also set alight.
The family, who were not involved in the attacks, subsequently returned to the home. One sibling, David McGann,has filed High Court proceedingsagainst KBC claiming that the eviction was unlawful and the security firms allegedly involved had no authority to enter the property.
The bank had earlier obtained a possession order against McGann’s brother, Anthony, in relation to a debt of more than €300,000. KBC lodged legal action against him in 2009 and court records show a repossession order was issued in 2013.
The incident triggeredanti-eviction protests in Strokestown, while three TDs and around a dozen supporters also‘occupied’ a KBC branch in Dublin.
Mattie McGrathMattie McGrath
In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Finance said the discussions that took place at the meeting were confidential, however given its timing “the events in which the bank’s branches and agents came under physical attack were likely to be of particular concern to the bank”.
“It would have been completely inappropriate for the department and the minister to ignore the incidents which took place or in any way to condone or appear to condone these incidents,” he added.
“It was right and proper that this message should be clearly conveyed to KBC.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/social-housing-report-2-4529232-Mar2019/,"DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL – IRELAND’S biggest local authority – built just 74 social homes last year, with 69 of them being rapid-build modular housing.
Discounting modular housing, DCC built just five social homes over the course of 2018.
As well as this, it bought 63 turnkey homes – built by contract by a private developer – and worked to regenerate another 127.
In total, the Housing Department puts at 264 the number of new builds in the Dublin City Council local authority area, before taking into account Part V social housing.
Part V refers to the 10% of housing private developers must sell to the council for use as social housing.
Taking into account all of the different building streams, as well as houses built and acquired by housing charities, the total number of social homes delivered in the Dublin area was 651.
The latest Social Housing Needs Assessmentshows there were just over 16,500 households in Dublin City on the social housing waiting list.
Construction report
The Housing Departmentreleased the social housing construction report for 2018on Wednesday, following a less detailed breakdown being released last month.
It was revealed last monththat there were 4,251 new-build social houses built in 2018, with the pace of delivery described by the opposition as “glacial”.
Before the figures were made available on Wednesday, there were exchanges in the Dáil between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Social Democrats’ Catherine Murphy during Leader’s Questions, in relation to social housing.
Murphy called for a more detailed breakdown of social housing delivery to be released other than the one last month.
“According to the 2018 social housing output figures under local authority build, the number is listed as 2,022, but the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has bundled all of those categories and has consistently refused to give a breakdown of local authority build by individual category,” Murphy said.
Varadkar responded that the government had ramped up its house-building significantly in recent years, and that he disagreed with Murphy about the “obsession about the different ways in which one categorises social housing as provided”.
“There are many different ways to provide social housing,” Varadkar said.

He said he had “seen the joy” on the faces of people when they received their new social home for the first time.
“Nobody ever said to me that it was Part V housing, or built by Clúid or the Peter McVerry Trust, not built by the local authority, and that they did not want it,” he said.
‘There is a problem’
Speaking toTheJournal.ieyesterday, Murphy said she welcomed the publication of a more detailed breakdown of the social housing builds, saying it was important for transparency.
“The problem is that if you don’t break it down then you don’t know what’s working or not,” Murphy said.
“No matter what you’re talking about, the numbers [of new homes] relative to the scale of the problem are low.
Murphy said there could be many reasons for this, and that it was important therefore to have accurate, detailed figures.
Social housing report
Wednesday’s report shows significant differences in the number of social homes either built, bought or acquired by local authorities across the country.
Clare County Council built no social houses at all last year themselves and bought just two. Offaly also built none and bought 12, while Roscommon built none and bought 14.
At the higher end of the scale, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council built 130 new social homes last year; South Dublin County Council built 238; while Cork City Council built 93.
In terms of builds by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs – housing charities contracted to supply and manage social housing), there were a total of 1,338 delivered.
The Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) said the figure represented “steady progress”, but that more needed to be done.
“We need to build on the successful partnerships between housing associations and local authorities to maximise social housing delivery,” CEO Dr Donal McManus said last month.
In its social housing delivery report, the Housing Department said it had provided 27,103 social housing solutions last year, 106% of its target.
The vast majority of these (just under 18,000) came from the rent subsidy Housing Assistance Payment.
Rebuilding Ireland – the government’s Housing Action Plan – commits to providing over 50,000 long-term social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes between 2016 and 2021.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-food-4528746-Mar2019/,"https://soundcloud.com/the-explainer-podcast/how-will-brexit-affect-the-food-that-you-buy/s-BohiS
HOW WOULD BREXIT affect Irish fridges, shelves, and shops?
We’re just three weeks out from the 29 March, the date by which the UK is due to leave the European Union, and a no-deal Brexit seems more likely than ever. Although companies are steering clear of speculation, there is a fear about what exists now as a free-flowing and open market could shudder to a halt, at least briefly, because of Brexit.
Ireland, of course, has a close business and trading relationship with the UK, which means Brexit, particularly the uncertainty that it’s brought, has threatened it.
Of particular significance are the Irish businesses that export to the UK, and rely on that UK market to a significant degree: if that market is closed off to them, or becomes less lucrative to export to, then that could threaten businesses to the point of collapse. This means that some foods produced and distributed inside Ireland could be at risk.
So what foods should we be worried about? In short, fresh produce – like agrifoods, fruit and vegetables – that Ireland imports through the UK. This could mean that there is a short period immediately after a no-deal Brexit where these foods could be in short supply.
Ireland also imports quite a bit of confectionery and baked goods from the UK, but because this is preservable it shouldn’t be a problem to source post a no-deal Brexit in the long run – although it could become more expensive.
The UK landbridge
The UK landbridge consists of the roads and ports Irish trucks use to get products to the EU, and vice versa. Around 150,000 Irish trucks use the landbridge a year; two-thirds of Irish goods exporters make use of the UK landbridge to access continental markets.
A further 53% of Irish goods exports (measured in volume) to all countries other than the UK are transported via the UK.
Evergreen, Wexford Street.Gráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ieGráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Meats and other ‘perishables’are massively reliant on the UK landbridge. Although it’s more expensive than circumventing it, it’s also much faster: it takes less than 20 hours from Ireland through Great Britain to the EU, according to a report by theIrish Maritime Development Office(Nov 2018).
Dublin to France would double to 40 hours for direct roll-on, roll-off services. And if there are delays, it will affect the food we import and export.
If there arechecks at Dover-Calais, and they take 80 seconds to carry out, that means the tailback of trucks will be “unrecoverable” – if they take 40 seconds, then there will be no change to the free-flowing system we have currently.
But Irish hauliers have said that it’s“unreasonable”to expect that no-deal Brexit checks would take just 40 seconds.
Tariffs
If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it will mean a number of products could be hit by tariffs, which is a tax imposed on goods or services from other countries in order to favour home industries.
Ireland’s biggest exports,beef and cheese,are at particular risk(of the 90% of Irish beef that is exported, 47% goes to the UK, and 87% of Irish cheddar cheese is exported to the UK).
The expectation is that the UK’s trading relationship with other countries would revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – meaning a set standard of tariffs (though they would have to apply to join).
The items that carry the highest import tariff rates under WTO rules are meat (49%), cereals (45%), sugars and confectionery (42%), and dairy products (31%). Here’s a list of the tariffs by commodity, meaning the extra cost of importing:
WTO tariffs, by itemWTO tariffs, by item
Forbread, 95% of all flour used actually comes from the UK, so importing that would carry tariffs in a no-deal Brexit.Breadmakers have warnedthat if there is no deal, tariffs could result in prices increasing by between 10% and 15%, as breadmakers would be paying €172 extra per tonne of flour they import.
Gerald Cunningham, president of the Flour Confectioners and Bakers Association, toldTheJournal.iethis when asked if it would mean there would be a shortage of bread: “I’d like to think that the shelves will be full, we don’t want to panic and put more pressure on bread-making businesses.

The all-island economy
Flour, cheese and the meatindustries are all based on north-south cooperation.
“Every year 400,000lambsgo South, and 400,000pigsmeet them and go North,” Irish Farmers’ Association presidentJoe Healy said at its AGMthis year, adding that the organisation’s support was for the backstop to remain.
A UK committee was told that farmers in the North were so worried about the Republic of Ireland being closed off to them because of Brexit that they had considered breeding less lambs for this season.
If farmers in the North can’t send lambs down here, because of checks or because it just doesn’t make financial sense for them anymore, there could be a surplus in the North:
“We can’t eat our way out of the problem”,as one representativetoldTheJournal.ie.

Guinness is also another all-island-of-Ireland product: although it’s brewed at St James’ Gate, it’s then transported up to Belfast where it’s packaged, and some of it is then brought back down to Dublin for export.
Diageo tolda UK Business committeethat 18,000 of its trucks cross that border a year, “so even small hold-ups to process those truck movements would be really unwelcome”, it also stated in an annual report that it has no intention to change its supply chain because of Brexit.
CSOCSO
In 2017, Ireland imported over 72,000 tonnes of potatoes, 62,000 tonnes of cheese, 72,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish and almost 70 million litres of water.
Almost 10,000 tonnes of tea and over 21,000 tonnes of coffee were imported in 2017.
Most of these are non-perishable goods, so if there is a delay, it’s reasonable to assume that the supply chain will catch up with itself eventually.
Shane Hamill of Bord Bia said that companies are going to try to offset costs as best they can.
“You’ll see a lot of companies reformulating their products, shifting their ingredients in order to manage any cost increases.
Fishwould also become more expensive. ANetherlands report on fishing in the EUsays that if the United Kingdom “completely closed its marine areas, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium would be affected the most”.

“The most visible impact of Brexit on fish consumption would be expected in Ireland (more than 4% decline), followed by UK. The change in consumption is directly linked to the changes in consumer prices… The strongest increase of fish prices occurs in Ireland, where consumer prices of fish products would grow by more than 9%.
Fish production would also decrease, according to the same report.
An interesting note onpotatoes and potato seeds:Michael Creed, the Minster for Agriculture, Food and the Marine told the Dáilthat seed potatoes are banned from entering the EU from third countries.
Traders have been forewarned about this, he said, and all advice to Irish growers is to ensure that UK seed is supplied before the end of March in order to facilitate the 2019 planting season.
“There will then be at least another 9 months before the 2020 planting season for the European Commission to consider requests from the UK for amendment to Annex III of the Plant Health directive based on a detailed scientific justification as to why the amendment is warranted,” he said – so they’re putting that off for later.
A good by-product of Brexit, however, is that it may get people thinking about how they get their food so cheaply and so quickly.
“I think people are starting to pay a little bit more attention to what is on their shelves,” Shane Hamill says, “so there’s certainly a new appreciation not only for how the food arrives and how quickly it takes, but also where it’s coming from and that’s probably a good thing.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/murder-charge-david-boland-4543545-Mar2019/,"A MURDER CHARGE relating to the death of a man in Athy, Co Kildare last year has been struck out because of a delay in presenting the complete book of evidence.
A Kildare District Court judge yesterday ordered the charge facing Calvin Cullen, 20, of Greenhills, Athy, be struck out on the basis that the Director of Public Prosecution was not ready.
The young man appeared before the court, charged with the murder of David Boland on Duke St, Athy during the early hours of 1 November 2018.
His defence team told the court that the State had a 42-day timeline to prepare the Book of Evidence.

The matter has been adjourned before Naas District Court several times since the accused was first charged with murder in November 2018.
Last month, Sergeant Brian Jacob said that there were more than 200 statements being examined and asked that the DPP get further time to prepare a book of evidence. At the time, Judge Zaidan said that he did not want four weeks to turn into 20 weeks.
Yesterday, Sergeant Jacob asked if the court could give the DPP a further three weeks.
However, Judge Desmond Zaidan refused the request and ordered that the murder charge be struck out based on the delays.
Boland died from multiple stab wounds received in a stabbing incident on Duke Street i the early hours of 1 November.

https://www.thejournal.ie/new-zealand-tributes-4555143-Mar2019/,"
NEW ZEALANDERS UNITED today in reflecting on the moment one week ago when 50 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques were killed, with an imam telling the crowd of thousands that it had left the country broken-hearted but not broken.
People across New Zealand listened to the call to prayer on live broadcasts while thousands, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, gathered in leafy Hagley Park opposite the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died.
“New Zealand mourns with you. We are one,” Ardern said.
The call to prayer was observed at 1.30 p.m local time (12.30am Irish time) and followed by two minutes of silence. Hundreds of Muslim men at the park sat in socks or bare feet. One man in the front row was in a Christchurch Hospital wheelchair.
The Al Noor mosque’s imam, Gamal Fouda, thanked New Zealanders for their support.
“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology… But, instead, we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” the imam said.
“We are broken-hearted but we are not broken. We are alive. We are together. We are determined to not let anyone divide us,” he added, as the crowd the city estimated at 20,000 people erupted with applause.

Later in the day, a mass funeral was held to bury 26 of the victims at a cemetery where more than a dozen already have been laid to rest.
Family members took turns passing around shovels and wheelbarrows to bury their loved ones. Today’s burials included the youngest victim, 3-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim.
Solidarity
Christchurch native Fahim Imam, 33, returned to the city for today’s service. He moved away three years ago and now lives in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city.
“It’s just amazing to see how the country and the community have come together — blows my mind, actually,” Imam said before the event.
When he got off the plane this morning, he saw someone holding a sign that said “jenaza,” denoting Muslim funeral prayer. He said others were offering free lifts to and from the prayer service.
“The moment I landed in Christchurch, I could feel the love here. I’ve never felt more proud to be a Muslim, or a Kiwi for that matter. It makes me really happy to be able to say that I’m a New Zealander,” Imam said.

He called it surreal to see the mosque where he used to pray surrounded by flowers.
The observance comes the day after the government announced a ban on “military-style” semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines like the weapons that were used in last Friday’s attacks at the Al Noor and nearby Linwood mosques.
An immediate sales ban went into effect yesterday to prevent stockpiling, and new laws would be rushed through Parliament that would impose a complete ban on the weapons, Ardern said.
“Every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned,” Ardern said.
The gun legislation is supported not only by Ardern’s liberal Labour Party but also the conservative opposition National Party, so it’s expected to pass into law.
‘Stronger than before’
Among those planning to attend today’s observance was Samier Dandan, the president of the Lebanese Muslim Association in Sydney and part of a 15-strong delegation of Muslim leaders that had flown to Christchurch.

“It was an ugly act of terrorism that occurred in a beautiful, peaceful city,” Dandan said.
He said his pain couldn’t compare with that of the families he’d been visiting who had lost loves ones. He was inspired by their resilience, he said.
“And I’ve got to give all my respect to the New Zealand prime minister, with her position and her actions, and it speaks loud,” he said.
Ismat Fatimah, 46, said it was sad to look at the Al Noor mosque, which was still surrounded by construction barricades, armed police officers and a huge mound of flowers and messages.
“We’re feeling stronger than before, and we are one,” she said.
She said she prayed for the people who died.
“I’m just imagining what would be happening last Friday,” she said. “People were running around so scared and helpless. It’s just not right.”
Erum Hafeez, 18 said she felt comforted by the overwhelming response from New Zealanders: “We are embraced by the community of New Zealand, we are not left behind and alone.”
The Al Noor mosque’s imam said workers have been toiling feverishly to repair the destruction, some of whom offered their services for free. Fouda expects the mosque to reopen by next week.

https://www.the42.ie/fai-offers-to-bring-forward-john-delaneys-oireachtas-hearing-4554200-Mar2019/,"THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION of Ireland has today confirmed it has offered to bring forward their upcoming Oireachtas committee hearing.
The meeting had been originally proposed for January, but was subsequently postponed until 20 February.
That hearing then did not go ahead, as Delaney was unable to attend due to a clash with a Uefa event in Switzerland the same day.

Delaney, who is part of Uefa’s executive committee, thanked the committee for facilitating a request to postpone the meeting until April and the association has now suggested putting it forward from 10 to 3 April.
A statement read: “The Football Association of Ireland has today written to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.
“The Association has offered to bring the April 10th meeting with the Committee forward to April 3rd and the FAI awaits the Committee’s response.
Delaney and the association have been embroiled in controversy over the past week, after it emerged that the chief executiveissued a personal cheque worth €100,000 to the Football Associationin April 2017.
The CEO defended this move, explaining that it was a “bridging loan” and insisting that he had acted in the best interests of the FAI.

However, there has been a considerable backlash to the news, with Sport Ireland among thoseseeking further clarification, and there are likely to be further questions asked of Delaney and his colleagues at next month’s hearing.

https://www.the42.ie/mick-mccarthy-first-training-session-4548810-Mar2019/,"MICK MCCARTHY’S BACK to work, and you only needed to hear the gruff Barnsley voice stabbing through the Abbottstown air to know it.
This morning he took his first Republic of Ireland training session in 17 years, and his centrality to it all was notable.
Whereas Martin O’Neill often preferred to stand aloof and observe from a distance the sections of Irish training sessions open to the media, McCarthy was fully among the action: his shouting, instructing and cajoling audible at the edges of a roll call of players’ nicknames.
“I loved it”, McCarthy told the media afterward.
“I loved the atmosphere with the lads, the banter they are all having, the little boxes and the warm-ups; just being at close quarters with players.
“I enjoy being with them, I enjoy watching them, and interacting with them. It’s great. I’ve enjoyed my morning.”
Not all of the players were present: Shane Duffy arrived late last night owing to his FA Cup involvement dragging past extra-time and into penalties while Conor Hourihane, Keiren Westwood and Richard Keogh join up with the squad tonight.
Seamus Coleman and Seani Maguire sat out training, both out of routine. Coleman’s was general and Maguire’s bespoke: Everton played yesterday afternoon so Coleman was never expected to train, while Maguire’s training load is closely managed by Preston, given his injury profile.
McCarthy expects both to train tomorrow and Wednesday.
Coleman, meanwhile, will retain the captaincy “if he plays” against Gibraltar on Saturday.
McCarthy also confirmed that the players will be aware of the team selection earlier on a matchday than was the custom of the previous manager, who usually unveiled his within 90 minutes of kick-off.
Given this was McCarthy’s first day back to work, previews of the games ahead were intermingled with looks back to the past.

McCarthy refused to look beyond the near-future (repeating that he is not taking Gibraltar for granted ahead of the Georgia game) and, inversely, preferred to address the distant past over anything that happened last year.

Ireland’s wretched 2018, featuring as it did one win in nine games (a friendly game) and just four goals (all but one scored in friendly games), has not occupied McCarthy’s thoughts.
“I’m looking forward, I’m not considering what went on before.
I’m not concerned at all by it. I’m hoping I can change that. That I, Robbie [Keane], TC [Terry Cononor] and the lads can change it.”
Is there even mild fretting about the potential for some lingering negativity?
“It’s my responsibility to change that.
“We have to get the lads at it and play as well as we possibly can. It’s got to be about us. I’ll be doing my damndest, I’m sure the lads will.
“They are all proud to be coming in here, and wanting to do well. I doubt they’ll be happy about that record. I don’t know what it is, I haven’t looked back on it.”
Turn the clock back a bit further.
“The last time I was here was 17 years ago. So, some of them [the players] might remember me playing, I don’t know.
“Or managing! None of them will remember me playing. They might have seen me on an eight-track or something.”
The last time McCarthy completed at Euros qualification campaign with Ireland was for Euro 2000, when ambitions for automatic qualification perished with the infamous concession of a last-minute goal away to Macedonia.
That night got a brave mention at today’s press conference.

“I was going to be quite offensive to you then. Only [think about it] when people bring it up.
“I was going to say something other than ‘people’ there.
“We had the shirt with an ‘I’ve had a Macedonia’ on it, but since then I’ve had a few good results as well. It would be remiss of you to remind me of a night like that.
“I’ve won the Championship twice and nobody ever mentions that, being in the PL. Had a pretty good time since. Oh, we qualified for the World Cup as well.
“Thanks for reminding me of one of my worst nights.”
The question of style came up as well, what with it being the topic that has stalked virtually every Irish press conference for the last ten years. McCarthy batted it back by saying that he’s “never been sacked for winning games”.
“I reckon it’s my job to get results, however they might come. If we get enough good results and we have the Euro 2020 games here, that’s got to be my remit.
“I’m sure we played some scruffy, scrappy games when I was last here, but when we won games I never heard the fans complaining, they were too busy cheering.”
If that coarse accent of his is subsumed beneath the Aviva’s cheers next week against Georgia, McCarthy can consider the first chapter of his Irish sequel a success.

https://www.thejournal.ie/murder-accused-told-farm-hand-of-rumour-that-polish-people-murdered-dj-bobby-ryan-4524851-Mar2019/,"MURDER ACCUSED PAT Quirke told one of his farm hands he heard a rumour that Polish people were involved in the murder of DJ Bobby “Mr Moonlight” Ryan, the Central Criminal Court has heard.
Gary Cunningham told David Humphries BL for the prosecution that he was studying agricultural science in 2013 and did his work experience on Quirke’s farms, starting in February of that year.
Following the discovery of Bobby Ryan’s body in a tank on land leased by the accused, the witness had one quick conversation with Quirke in which the accused asked him if he had heard any rumours about what happened.
The witness couldn’t recall what his response was but said that Quirke then told him he had heard a rumour it was a “Polish group”.
Under cross examination the witness told defence counsel Bernard Condon SC there was a rumour going around that Polish people were involved in the murder of Bobby Ryan. The witness further told Humphries during reexamination that he couldn’t recall if he heard that rumour from anyone other than the accused.
Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Bobby ‘Mr Moonlight’ Ryan.
Bobby Ryan went missing on June 3, 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am. His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Mary Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013.
The prosecution claims that Mr Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Lowry (52).
Cunningham also told Humphries that he did not know of the existence of the tank where Bobby Ryan’s body was found and never spoke to Quirke about it.

Farm
Emmett Kenny told Humphries that he started working on Quirke’s farm in 2009. He worked there during the calving season from February to April doing general farm work, feeding, milking and looking after the cattle. Quirke owned a farm at Breanshamore where he had a milking parlour and leased the farm at Fawnagowan where he also kept cattle.
This witness knew of the tank where Bobby Ryan’s body was found because he would be doing jobs around that area. He thought it was an old septic tank and said there was a ditch beside it that cattle would shelter in during bad weather. Cattle would walk on top of the tank but they had no effect on the concrete slabs covering it, he said. Kenny said he never fenced off the tank.
Humphries then asked about Mary Lowry whom the witness said he saw maybe 20 times over the years and talked to her on occasion.
He saw Quirke together with her once or twice and they appeared to get on fine, he said. He recalled Quirke telling him that Mary Lowry has a good farm, but they never discussed her apart from that. Under cross examination by Condon he accepted that what he said to gardaí in previous statements was that Martin Lowry, Mary Lowry’s deceased husband, was a good farmer.
On the bank holiday weekend when Ryan went missing the witness recalled that Pat Quirke went away on the Friday.
He said Quirke had told him about two weeks earlier that he would be going away for the bank holiday and asked if Kenny be available to work on the farm. The witness arrived that Friday at about 5.30pm to milk the cows and noticed two bulls in a field about 60 or 70 yards from the cows.
The day after the discovery of Bobby Ryan’s body Kenny met the accused in the milking parlour at Breanshamore. Quirke asked: “Did you hear?” and the witness replied: “I did yes.” That was all he said.
In October 2018 Mr Kenny went to Fawnagowan with gardaí and pointed out to them a septic tank in a field in front of Mary Lowry’s house which Kenny erected a fence around when he started working for Quirke in 2009. He put up this fence, he said, because it was his understanding that a heifer had suffered an injury to her leg when it got caught between gaps in the concrete.
He accepted under cross examination that he was not there when the heifer was injured and that “it’s quite possible” he was wrong in thinking the heifer was injured at that tank. He added that he always thought the tank where Bobby Ryan’s body was found was an old septic tank.
The witness further told Condon that on October 26, 2013 he pointed out to gardaí an area beside a slatted shed where bales of silage would have been stacked in June 2011 when Bobby Ryan went missing. A garda photographed the area but Kenny was not shown the photograph.
The trial continues in front of Justice Eileen Creedon and a jury of six men and six women.

RTÉ - IRELAND’S NATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MEDIA/ YouTube
SARAH MCTERNAN WILL represent Ireland at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Israel in May, RTÉ has revealed.
McTernan, who came third in The Voice of Ireland 2015, will perform the song ’22′  in the second Eurovision semi-final in Tel Aviv on Thursday 16 May.
The song was penned by Janieck, Marcia “Misha” Sondeijker and Roulsen,
She previously competed to represent San Marino at last year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon with a song called Eye of the Storm, however, she failed to qualify.
‘Full steam ahead’
The 24-year-old  from Scariff, Co Claretold RTÉthat representing Ireland in the contest is like “an early birthday present”.
“My 25th birthday is next Monday and if you’d told me last year that I’d be chosen to represent my country at Eurovision, performing the song for the first time on Dancing with the Stars this Sunday, and then flying to Tel Aviv on my birthday to record a postcard, I would have told you – you were crazy,” she said.
McTernan has a 2.5-year-old daughter, Mia, who she says is her biggest fan.

“My Mom, Nana, family and friends are super excited for me – they’re shocked and very proud. I can’t wait to teach my biggest fan – my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Mia – all the lyrics to 22,” she said.
So here we go 🎉I’m delighted to announce that I will be representing Ireland in The@eurovisionthis year, You can catch the song ‘22’ on its first airplay on Ryan Tubridy's radio show at 9am, I will be interviewed by the lovely Jenny Greene on 2FM at 12:30pm and Ray Darcy at 3pic.twitter.com/uLty2KNCqc— Sarah McTernan (@Sarah_McTernan)March 8, 2019Sarah McTernan/ Twitter

Over 430 songs were submitted to RTÉ for consideration with Irish Head of Delegation Michael Kealy accrediting the volume of entries to Ryan O’Shaughnessy’s “great” performance in Lisbon last year.
Politically tense
Israeli singer Netta was crowned winner at last year’s contest. Her win immediately sparked controversy over 2019′s competition, the first time in 20 years that Israel will play host.
Israel previously hosted the Eurovision in 1979 and 1999. The country won the competition in 1978 with Ireland’s Colm Wilkinson placing fifth with ‘Born to Sing’.
In 1998, Israel came first again in the Eurovision when Dana International won with ‘Diva’ while Ireland’s entry ‘Is Always Over Now?’ performed by Dawn Martin came ninth.
Two years after Eurovision 1999, the Irish Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) was established to raise awareness about the Occupied Territories and Israel’s continued occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act showdiplomacy was requiredas RTÉ management responded to calls from both sides of the political divide between June and December last year – before and after Ireland confirmed its participation in this year’s competition.
The Eurovision final takes place on Saturday 18 May.

A STARVING WHALE with 40kg of plastic waste in its stomach has died after being washed ashore in the Philippines, activists have said, calling it one of the worst cases of poisoning they have seen.
Environmental groups have tagged the Philippines as one of the world’s biggest ocean polluters due to its reliance on single-use plastic.
That sort of pollution, which is also widespread in other southeast Asian nations, regularly kills wildlife like whales and turtles that ingest the waste.
In the latest case, a Cuvier’s beaked whale died on Saturday in the southern province of Compostela Valley where it was stranded a day earlier, the government’s regional fisheries bureau said.
The agency and an environmental group performed a necropsy on the animal and found about 40 kilograms of plastic, including grocery bags and rice sacks.
The animal died from starvation and was unable to eat because of the rubbish filling its stomach, said Darrell Blatchley, director of D’ Bone Collector Museum Inc, which helped conduct the examination.

“It’s very disgusting and heartbreaking,” he told AFP. “We’ve done necropsies on 61 dolphins and whales in the last 10 years and this is one of the biggest (amounts of plastic) we’ve seen.”
The 4.7-metre long whale was stranded in Mabini town on Friday where local officials and fishermen tried to release it, only for the creature to return to shallow water, said the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.
“It could not swim on its own, emaciated and weak,” regional bureau director Fatma Idris told AFP.
“(The) animal was dehydrated. On the second day it struggled and vomited blood.”
The death comes just weeks after the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternative released a report on the “shocking” amount of single-use plastic in the Philippines, including nearly 60 billion sachets a year.
The Philippines has strict laws on garbage disposal but environmentalists say these are poorly implemented.
The problem also plagues the archipelago’s neighbours, with a sperm whale dying in Indonesia last year with nearly six kilograms of plastic waste discovered in its stomach.
In Thailand, a whale also died last year after swallowing more than 80 plastic bags. A green turtle, a protected species, suffered the same fate there in 2018.

A dozen Republicans supported ending Trump’s declared emergency.
The president had hoped that it would provide him cover to secure alternative government funding for his protective wall on the US-Mexico border which had been denied to him by Congress.
But opponents warned that Trump’s move smacked of executive overreach, and insisted a vote to curtail his authority would preserve the constitutionally mandated separation of powers in Washington.
Trump tweeted “VETO” this evening in response to the vote.
Trump said the move declaring the emergency allowed him to skirt Congress and repurpose billions of dollars in other government funds, including money that was earmarked to build or renovate military facilities.
But Democrats and some Republicans strongly resisted the move.

They argued that Congress is constitutionally appointed to control the government’s purse strings – and declaring an emergency to seize more money is a blatant abuse of executive authority.
Republicans control the Senate, 53 to 47, 12 today supported the resolution of disapproval, giving Democrats the numbers they needed to get it through.
Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate who supported the measure, said it was “a vote for the constitution and for the balance of power that is at its core”.
A group of Republicans sought to limit defections by cutting a deal yesterday with Trump to limit his powers on emergency declarations, but the president refused.
Earlier today, he acknowledged that “I’ll probably have to veto” the legislation, the first such executive blockage of legislation in his presidency.
But he is likely to get his way nonetheless, at least for now, before the issue gets taken up by the courts, as Democrats will not have enough votes to override the veto.
“It won’t be overturned and the legal scholars say it’s totally constitutional,” Trump said.
“It is, pure and simple, a vote for border security,” he said earlier.

FIFTY PEOPLE, INCLUDING Hollywood stars Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, were charged today in a scheme in which wealthy parents allegedly bribed college coaches and other insiders to get their children into some of the US’s most elite schools.
Federal authorities called it the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the US Justice Department, with the parents accused of paying an estimated $25 million (€23 million) in bribes.
“These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,” US Attorney Andrew Lelling said in announcing the results of an investigation code-named Operation Varsity Blues.
At least nine athletic coaches and 33 parents, many of them prominent in law, finance, fashion, manufacturing and other fields, were among those charged. Dozens, including Huffman, the Emmy-winning star of Desperate Housewives, were arrested by midday.

The coaches worked at such schools as Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, Wake Forest, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles. A former Yale soccer coach pleaded guilty and helped build the case against others.
No students were charged, with authorities saying that in many cases the teenagers were not aware of what was going on. And several of the colleges involved made no mention of expelling or taking any other action against the students.
Prosecutors said parents paid an admissions consultant from 2011 through last month to bribe coaches and administrators to falsely make their children look like star athletes to boost their chances of getting into college. The consultant also hired ringers to take college entrance exams for students, and paid off insiders at testing centres to alter students’ scores.
“For every student admitted through fraud, an honest and genuinely talented student was rejected,” Lelling said.
Several defendants, including Huffman, were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

https://www.thejournal.ie/drink-driving-exemption-poll-4524554-Mar2019/,"ONE IN FIVE people in Ireland think convicted drink drivers should be given an exemption from their driving ban in order to drive to work.
According to a survey carried out by Amarach Research for RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live, 66% of people in Ireland said convicted drink drivers should not be given an exemption from their driving ban, while 21% said they should.
13% of respondents were unsure.
The poll comes afterThe Sunday Business Postlast week reported that junior transport minister Brendan Griffin has asked officials to study a system currently operating in New Zealand.
In New Zealand, banned drivers can apply for an exemption if a driving ban causes them “extreme hardship”, such as a need to get to work.

Applicants for a limited licence in New Zealand have to apply to a court and prove that not being able to drive causes extreme hardship to themselves or undue hardship to someone else, such as an employer or dependents.
In a statement to Virgin Media’s Tonight Showon Monday, Minister Ross said “this idea is a non-runner”.

“Absolutely no question of countenancing any idea of exempting anyone. This idea is a non-runner,” Ross said.
“If the vinters want to suggest ways of stopping driving drinking alcohol, let’s hear them,” he said.
Speaking to the mediaon Monday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that his initial sense is that he’d be “sceptical about it as a proposal that’s workable”.
“If someone is banned from driving they’re banned for a reason. If you were to make an exception around travelling to and from work I’d wonder about the enforceability of that,” Varadkar said.
“My initial sense is one of scepticism.”
The poll was carried out by Amarach Research on Monday with more than 1,000 adults in the Republic of Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cannabis-psychosis-study-the-lancet-4549656-Mar2019/,"INDIVIDUALS WHO USE cannabis every day are three times more likely to suffer from a psychotic disorder than those who don’t use the drug at all, a new study has revealed.
The study, which examines how cannabis use and strength affects the incidence of psychosis, found that the odds of having the disorder among daily users of the drug were 3.2 times higher than among non-users.
It also found that users of high-potency cannabis were approximately 1.6 times more likely to have a psychotic disorder than those who never used the drug.
The study,published today inThe Lancet Psychiatryjournal, claims to be the first to show the impact of cannabis use on population rates of psychosis, and highlights the potential public health impact of changes to the legal classification of cannabis.
To carry out the study, researchers compared more than 2,000 people between the ages of 18 and 64 at 11 sites in Europe and one in Brazil between 2010 and 2015, in order to understand the risk factors associated with the disorder.
Of these, 901 patients had presented to mental health services following their first episode of psychosis, while a further 1,237 were studied as “healthy matched controls”.
Comparing the two groups, researchers collected information about participants’ history of the use of cannabis and other recreational drugs.
They used published data on levels of delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the psychoactive compound in cannabis – to evaluate the potency of cannabis used by participants.
They also separated cannabis used by participants into two categories: cannabis classed as high potency, where its THC content was over 10%, and cannabis classified as low potency (under 10%).
No longer available
The research found that daily cannabis use was more common among patients who had their first episode of psychosis (266 of 901 participants), compared to the “healthy” control group (84 of 1,237 participants).
Meanwhile, high-potency cannabis usage was more likely among patients who had their first episode of psychosis (334 of 901 participants) than those in the “healthy” control group (240 out of 1,237 participants).
The study also discovered that psychosis was five times more likely among those who used high-potency cannabis on a daily basis, and estimated that one in five new cases of psychosis across the 12 sites in the study were linked to daily cannabis use.
In two sites, Amsterdam and London, high potency cannabis was found to be a strong predictor of psychotic disorders.

In Amsterdam, four in 10 (43.8%) new cases of psychosis were estimated to be linked to daily cannabis use, and five in 10 (50.3%) new cases were linked to high potency use.
Meanwhile, rates of psychosis in London were 21% among daily users, and 30.3% among those who used the drug with high rates of THC.
The researchers suggested that if high potency cannabis was no longer available, the incidence of psychosis in Amsterdam would be expected to halve from 37.9 to 18.8 per 100,000 people per year, while in London, it would fall from 45.7 to 31.9 per 100,000 people per year.
At-risk individuals
Dr Marta Di Forti of King’s College London, the lead author of the study, claimed the findings were consistent with other studies linking high cannabis potency with adverse effects on mental health.
“As the legal status of cannabis changes in many countries and states, and as we consider the medicinal properties of some types of cannabis, it is of vital public health importance that we also consider the potential adverse effects that are associated with daily cannabis use, especially high potency varieties,” she said.
The research follows observational studies which have supported a causal link between cannabis use and psychosis, although none has previously shown that patterns of cannabis use can influence rates of psychosis on a national level.
Commenting on the findings, Dr Suzanne H Gage of the University of Liverpool suggested that the findings indicated that a new approach to treating psychosis among cannabis users was required.
“Given the changing legal status of cannabis across the world, and the associated potential for an increase in use, the next priority is to identify which individuals are at risk from daily potent cannabis use, and to develop educational strategies and interventions to mitigate this,” she said.
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny suggested that regulating cannabis for recreational use would allow Irish users to consume the drug more carefully.
Kenny’s Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill is currently moving through the Dáil,although the government delayed the Billwith a money message last year.
“We need to have a grown-up conversation about this,” he toldTheJournal.ie.
“There are forms of unregulated street cannabis that have very high forms of THC, which can be sold by people who are sometimes unscrupulous.
“Regulation would take it out of their hands and allow users to make a choice about the strength of cannabis they use, even if it wouldn’t stop varieties with high levels of THC.”
He added that the findings did not affect his call for the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use, which contains low levels of THC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/teenager-pleads-guilty-to-repeatedly-slamming-door-into-girls-head-4542670-Mar2019/,"A DUBLIN TEENAGER who repeatedly slammed a door into a girl’s head and set fire to her hair will be sentenced later for this and for assaulting a passerby with a broken bottle.
A witness told gardaí that Dylan Lynch (18) told him to take a video of the door banging the teenage girl’s head and share it with friends on Snapchat.
The witness said he did this using Lynch’s own phone. He said the girl, who’d been drinking vodka with a group in Lynch’s bedroom, had looked “drowsy” when she was put sitting up.
He gave an account of Lynch taking a deodorant can and lighter and creating a flame at the back of the girl’s head. Lynch then started cutting clumps out of the girl’s singed hair and throwing them out the window.
Garda Sarah Hogan told Monika Leech, prosecuting, that girls who had been with the injured party eventually took her out of the house. The girl and her mother complained to gardaí the following day.
Lynch, of Avonbeg Gardens, Tallaght, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to assaulting the teenage girl at his home on 21 July 2018.
He also pleaded guilty to assaulting a former Tallaght Hospital lab technician and robbing his phone at Sean Walsh Park, Tallaght, on 16 April 2018.

Garda Gary Duffy said Lynch hit the lab technician about five times in the head with a vodka bottle, which broke during the assault. At times the injured party had tried to run away, but Lynch caught him and resumed the attack.
The man, in a victim impact statement referred to in court, described receiving nine stitches to his left temple, staples to a wound on the top of his head and having to get his right ear glued.
Duffy told Leech that the man had passed Lynch and two girls while walking home from work. He had noted Lynch looking worked up and agitated and that he had two vodka bottles.
When Lynch threw one bottle onto the road, the injured party turned to face him as he was afraid of being assaulted by the second. Lynch took this as a confrontation and began the attack.
Another man, not before the courts, joined in at the end of the assault holding a switchblade and the pair robbed the injured party’s phone. After this, the victim was able to run for help.
The court heard the attack had influenced his decision to move abroad to work.
Duffy agreed with Sarah Jane O’Callaghan, defending, that her client had a very dysfunctional background and that there had been tragic and violent deaths in his family.
He accepted a psychological report assessment that since Lynch has been in custody he has had “a maturing of his insight” and an attitude change to crime and victims.

THE SPACEX DRAGON capsule successfully splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday after more than six days in space, completing its demonstration mission for US space agency NASA.
“Good splashdown of Dragon confirmed!” the SpaceX account tweeted along with an image of the capsule showing its four main white and orange parachutes deployed as two boats sped toward it.
Live footage from NASA showed the capsule’s main parachutes opened without a problem, and it splashed down at 8:45 am (1.45pm Irish time), completing a mission to demonstrate that it could reliably and safely carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).

Launched on Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Dragon docked at ISS the following day before detaching earlier today for its return to Earth.
It represents the first private space mission to the ISS, as well as the first time a space vessel capable of carrying people was launched by the US in eight years.
SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, was selected along with the Boeing group by NASA in 2014 to develop the next generation of space vehicles for US astronauts, after the end of the 1981-2011 space shuttle program.
Only a test dummy was aboard for the test, but the first manned flight aboard Dragon is scheduled for July with two astronauts — a date that could be postponed until later this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-centre-clondalkin-2-4538646-Mar2019/,"THE DIRECT PROVISION centre in Clondalkin in Dublin is set to remain open for at least another two years.
There had been calls for the planned closure of the centre at Clondalkin Towers, a former hotel, to be postponed on humanitarian grounds asresidents struggledto find alternative accommodation, as reported byTheJournal.ie.
There were 235 people, including 78 children, living in the centre as of last month.
About 70 residents already have protected or leave-to-remain status and faced having to find private rented accommodation; this figure includes 19 refugees.
At the start of October, residents were informed that the centre would close on 3 December as the company running the centre was not renewing its contract. However, a deal was later reached to keep the centre open until June.
The company, Fazyard Ltd, waspaid €27.5 millionby the State from 2006 to 2015 for operating the centre.
A tendering process seeking alternative locations for DP centres has now been completed and it has been confirmed that the centre will remain open until at least 2021.
Fazyard Ltd reapplied to run the centre and was successful. The company plans to increase the centre’s capacity from 225 to 250 people.

Kildare and Laois
Three other centres – two in Co Kildare (Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin and the Eyre Powell in Newbridge) and one in Co Laois (the Montague Hotel in Emo) – are due to be granted two-year contract renewals once mobilisation works to deliver on the proposals have been commenced. A further one-year extension may be added to each contract.
Fazyard Ltd is also behind the proposal for the centre in Co Laois, which has a planned capacity of 202 residents.
Oscar Dawn Ltd is the bidder for the Hazel Hotel proposal, which has a planned capacity of 143 residents. Peachport Ltd is behind the Eyre Powell bid, which has a planned capacity of 125 residents.
The Department of Justice said it is a condition of the tender “that all residents will be able to cook meals of their own choice and that families will have access to designated living areas where they can carry out normal family activities outside of their bedrooms”.
There have been numerous calls for the DP system to be reformed, or scrapped altogether, amid complaints aboutliving conditionsandother issuesfaced by residents. Almost 6,300 asylum seekers are housed in 38 DP centres around the country.
Better conditions
David Stanton, Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and Integration, said he was “pleased” that the Clondalkin centre would remain open, stating that “residents will enjoy greater autonomy and independence in the centre” once the proposed changes are made.
“The contract with the Towers Accommodation Centre, as with other centres placed on this framework, will be for a minimum of two years,” Stanton said.
He added that the department is continuing to roll out its public procurement process on a regional basis throughout the state in 2019.
“As with the competitions for Sligo and Newbridge, it will be a condition of the tender that all residents will be able to cook meals of their own choice and that families will have access to designated living areas where they can carry out normal family activities outside of their bedrooms,” he said.

‘Not the right way’
Sinn Féin’s Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin, who was among those to call for the centre to remain open, has welcomed the news.
“The uncertainty about the centre’s future caused enormous worry and fear for the 250 adults and children. Closure would have resulted in the residents being moved out of Dublin and away from vital educational, medical, social and community supports.
“Thankfully the contract has been extended and much needed improvements in cooking and recreational facilities are included in the new contract.”
Local independent councillor Francis Timmons said he was “delighted” with the news.
“This news will be a huge relief to the residents living there, many of whom attend local Clondalkin schools and are involved in the local community … They deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,” Timmons said.
However, Ó Broin added that the uncertainty surrounding the tendering process “highlights why Direct Provision is not the right way to provide those seeking asylum with accommodation”.
A number of organisations such as the Irish Refugee Council and Nasc (the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre) have also said the current model needs to be scrapped.
A spokesperson for the IRC previously toldTheJournal.iethe State needs to “shift to a new way of accommodating people who seek asylum: from a reactive, managed emergency style system delivered by private actors towards a long-term, planned model delivered by non-profit bodies who are experts in housing and supporting vulnerable people”.
The government has paid tens of millions to private companies running DP centres around Ireland. It has also paid over €1.6 million to a private contractor tosource emergency accommodationfor asylum seekers since September 2018.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gsoc-sensitive-information-4549643-Mar2019/,"THE DATA PROTECTION Commissioner has been informed of an alleged data breach after Gsoc accidentally sent a complainant’s file including their full name and case file reference to an unauthorised third-party,TheJournal.iehas learned.
A man had made a complaint about alleged racist abuse he received from gardaí while he lived in Galway. The complaint is still being processed.
However, late last year, the man was sent correspondence which informed him that Gsoc had accidentally sent his file, including his case number and other personal details to an incorrect recipient.
The senior case officers wrote to him and explained that “correspondence relating to your complaint was inadvertently sent to a third party”.
Gsoc explained that the “correspondence contained your contact details (name and address) and the reference number above”.
“The correspondence was returned to Gsoc and no other information in relation to you was released,” the garda watchdog continued.
Gsoc admitted it had made an administrative error and apologised to the man for any distress it may have caused him.
His case officer said that staff at Gsoc have been reminded of the “care required when issuing correspondence” and that the body is taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again.
There are a number of current investigations ongoing within Gsoc with regards to the unauthorised sharing of sensitive information so far this year.

TheJournal.iehas learned that Gsoc has reported a number of data breaches to the DPC since the start of last year.
A spokeswoman confirmed: “Gsoc has reported four data breaches to the Data Protection Commissioner since January 2018.
“We will not comment on individual cases.”
The future of Gsoc
The Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) came into force in May 2007 and took over responsibility for receiving and dealing with all complaints made by the public about the conduct of gardai.
The report from theCommission on the Future of Policing in Irelandpublished late last year recommended that Gsoc should be superseded by a new independent complaints body, to be called the Independent Office of the Police Ombudsman (IOPO).
In 2016, more than half of investigations by Gsoc did not disclose a criminal offence and were referred back to An Garda Síochána for investigation.
The report found Gsoc does not have the resources to investigate independently the volume of complaints it is receiving. It also noted that many fall into the category of “performance management complaints”, where members are alleged to have been impolite, incorrect or negligent in their dealings with individuals or organisations.
“Investigations have focused on the individuals against whom a complaint has been made rather than on the incident concerned to determine where the fault lies, for instance with an individual, or with a policy or wider organisational issues, such as inadequate training.”
The report recommended the work of the IOPO should be that it investigates incidents rather than individuals “so as to find fault where appropriate, identify what needs to be learned, and make recommendations for change as required”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/children-custody-4536415-Mar2019/,"IRELAND’S FAMILY LAW system is creating a situation where parents can be more focused on winning than on what their children want, an Oireachtas committee will hear today.
The Justice Committee will continue this morning to hear submissions on reforms to Ireland’s family law system, including recommendations from Special Rapporteur on Child Protection Dr Geoffrey Shannon.
Shannon will tell the committee that the common law adversarial system is “highly unsuited” for these types of case as “parents are focused on winning”.
This can be psychologically damaging for both the parents and their children, according to Shannon.
Shannon will tell the committee that mediation is one arena in which there is potential for greater flexibility in family law as the attention of parents is more likely to be on children’s needs.
The committee will also hear from representatives from Men’s Voices Ireland who will tell TDs and Senators that children may be “used as pawns in custody battles”.
“Outcomes in the family courts are bad for men and this is well attested. Too often it is a winner-takes-all situation in which the man is removed from the home, may still have to pay maintenance and/or a mortgage as well as provide for himself,” according to the group.

Members will hear from David Walsh that the rights of children are being lost “in the tussle between competing parental rights”.
“Current practice puts the adult at centre stage whereas the child’s welfare should be paramount and his/her fundamental right to know and spend time with both parents.”
Walsh will also tell the committee that mediation is needed in cases where domestic violence is alleged as these allegations do “not need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a civil court”.
Legal representation
Last week the committee heard from Dr Carol Coulter, director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project, about an imbalance created by the legal aid system.
She said some fathers are just above the limited threshold and cannot afford to pay for legal representation themselves.
“It is strictly means tested and a situation often arose where a working father earning a modest wage was above the means threshold for legal aid while his wife, if she was a mother, would typically not be working or working part-time, and would fall under the means threshold.
“Therefore if the relationship broke down she would be eligible for legal aid but he would not. That gives rise to an inequality of arms in legal proceedings and is clearly unfair.”
Coulter suggested removing or significantly increasing the means threshold while asking for a contribution from litigants.

TACKLING DUBLIN’S SEAGULL problem requires a “viable, practicable and innovative” solution, a Dubliner told Dublin City Council in February.
“For too long the streets of Dublin have fallen foul to the menacing, torturous and unprovoked attacks delivered by a gang of feathered brutes,” the concerned local wrote in a letter.
“Each day the victim count from these attacks rise with the injuries sustained ranging in severity and the victim profile being as broad and diverse as the attacks themselves.”
Protected under wildlife legislation, however – as well as being a core element of Dublin’s biodiversity – there is not much local authorities can currently do to reduce the population of urban gulls.
The capital’s gull population has increased as well, according to BirdWatch Ireland, despite companies and state bodies requesting licenses to remove gull nests and chicks in a bit to scare them off buildings.
As this avian issue rolls on, some are calling for a different approach than the cold-hearted cull, though – saying that seagull population surveys need to be carried out to properly assess the situation.
‘Very visual component’
Concerned Dubliners wrote to the council on several occasions last year to highlight the ongoing problem, correspondence received under the Freedom of Information act show.
The birds “have grown more common in recent times but are now a real menace”, said one spotter of the creatures in Ballsbridge on Dublin’s Southside last May.
“Can something be done to give the ducklings a chance?”
In July, a concerned citizen contacted Labour councillor Mary Freehill in relation to the “growing number of seagulls in the Rathmines area” of Dublin.
With the city’s gulls “becoming bigger, bolder and more populous in urban areas”, this person wanted to know if there were measures to be taken to reduce the number of seagulls in urban areas.
“They prey [on] food waste and are seen tearing apart bins creating a mess. They also make a tremendous racket as some are perched on house chimneys.
“[The] abundance of noise, very early in the morning and late at nights, that is my primary distress.”
Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
‘Constant droppings’
Residents of Marino on Dublin’s Northside experienced similar seagull difficulties last July.
“Noise pollution from 5am onwards all day every day [and] constant droppings,” a concerned Marino resident wrote to the council last summer.
A Biodiversity Officer at the council’s replied saying that seagulls – or gulls -  are a “very visual component of Dublin City’s biodiversity”.
They are protected under wildlife acts, legislation which is enforced by the National Parks and Wildlife Service [NPWS].
“Dublin City Council does not have a role in the control of gulls,” the officer said. “However, [the council] strongly advises people not to feed the gulls as this influences the interactive behaviour between birds and humans.”
Herring gulls – the most abundant roof-nesting species in Dublin – are presently red-listed. In other words, they are of high conservation concern.
According to Stephen Newton, senior seabird conservation officer with BirdWatch Ireland, the country’s gull population – including the colonisation of inland towns – has increased largely due to the availability of food.

Companies like Diageo have recently been granted licenses to remove gull nests from the Guinness brewery at St. James Gate.
The NPWS has also issued several permits to organisations in the past like the Abbey Theatre and South Dublin County Council, as well as private individuals in North Dublin to scare gulls away, relocate chicks, or remove nests and eggs from buildings.
Since 2016, NPWS has issued a total of 60 permits to private individuals, state bodies and businesses, according to a spokesperson.
Of permits issued to date, 48 were for premises in Dublin.

‘Control measures’
At approximately 11.45am on 4 October, a seagull swooped down to a picnic table in Herbert Park and stole a toddler’s croissant.
Their parent wrote to the council after the incident, saying that they were “worried that seagulls are becoming increasingly brazen”. The parent also wanted to know what exactly could be done to tackle the problem.
Four days later, Labour councillor Dermot Lacey brought forward an emergency motion to draw up a plan to deal with seagull issues across the city and to specifically introduce measures to deal with the specific problem in Herbert Park.
Several Dublin councillors have followed suit. Independent councillor Mannix Flynn has described the situation as “totally out of control”.
“There’s been no attempt whatsoever to deal with this. Private individuals, firms and businesses are dealing with it in their own way,” Flynn toldTheJournal.ie.
“In the meantime, it’s getting totally out of control, particularly on the likes of Dame Street.”
“They’re free creatures and they need to be protected,” says Flynn. “But the city also needs to manage the seagull population.”
‘Intelligent, cunning, motivated’
A holistic approach to this issue is what is required, according to Birdwatch Ireland’s Newton.
His group is currently pressing authorities to fund surveys in order to update gull population figures and distribution information.
“Only when this has been done we can review the population status, and local authorities and NPWS can open a debate about whether ‘control’ measures are necessary and what the impact may be on the national population,” Newton has said.
Fingal County Council has funded a survey of roof-nesting gulls in Balbriggan, Skerries and Howth.
These surveys, according to Newton, have shown a “considerable increase” since previous surveys which were carried out in 2000-2001.
No efforts have yet been made by Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.
For one “uniquely placed” and “highly skilled” Dubliner, however, tailor-made solutions are the way forward in tackling the city’s gull problem.
“In this instance I can conduct an independent investigation to ascertain the facts which include identifying the specific breed of seagull executing the attacks, the hotspots where those attacks occur, the triggers that drive the attacks and identifying the chain of command within the flock.”
All seagulls are “highly intelligent, cunning and motivated and…should not be underestimated”.
“Their protective legal status, in the most part, shields them from any drastic measures normally adopted by humans to combat similar aggressive behaviour in other species.”
Writing to the council, this savvy citizen pitched their linguistic expertise as a means of understanding the flock.
“Once I infiltrate the flock and gain their trust I can gain an insight into the flock hierarchy and the core objectives driving their choice of action.”

PRODIGY FRONTMAN KEITH Flint has died aged 49.
The vocalist was found dead at his home in Essex this morning.
The cause of his death has not yet been officially confirmed but his bandmate Liam Howlett said Flint took his own life, adding that he was “confused and heartbroken”.

Essex Police said in a statement: “We were called to concerns for the welfare of a man at an address in Brook Hill, North End, just after 8.10am on Monday, March 4.
“We attended and, sadly, a 49-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.
“His next of kin have been informed.
Flint was originally a dancer with the rave/dance group, but went on to perform vocals on their two biggest hits in the 1990s: Firestarter and Breathe.
His band, founded by keyboardist Howlett during the English underground rave scene at the start of that decade, went on to become a multi-million selling outfit, headlining arena shows and festivals.
They were an extremely popular live draw in Ireland throughout their late 90s-early 2000s heyday, and most recently headlined the closing night of last year’s Electric Picnic festival in Co Laois.
Alongside Howlett and fellow vocalist Maxim, Flint was one of three core members of The Prodigy throughout the group’s 29-year career.

They had recently returned from a tour of Australia and were due to start their first headlining tour of the US in a decade this May.
‘Pioneer, innovator and legend’
The band paid tribute to Flint today, saying: “It is with deepest shock and sadness that we can confirm the death of our brother and best friend Keith Flint. A true pioneer, innovator and legend. He will be forever missed.
“We thank you for respecting the privacy of all concerned at this time.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-what-can-we-learn-from-those-irish-people-who-live-to-be-100-4537435-Mar2019/,"WHY ARE SOME people living significantly longer, healthier, more fulfilled lives and how can we emulate them?
Once an exclusive club, the number of people living to celebrate their hundredth birthday has grown exponentially across both the developed and developing world – to the point where centenarians are now the fastest growing demographic globally.
In Ireland, the centenarian population has risen by 20% in just four years. We now have 456 centenarians and this number is expected to increase 10-fold by 2050.
By the turn of the next century, it is estimated that there will be more than 25 million centenarians living worldwide.
While this remarkable phenomenon can be attributed, in part, to advancements in healthcare, technology, living conditions and improved economies, there’s more to extreme longevity than meets the eye.
Centenarians have long been regarded as paragons of successful ageing. I wanted to ask them what they did, beyond the norm, to extend their lifespans?
Under the stewardship of Dr Mary McDonnell Naughton and Lorraine Gaffney, lecturers in the Faculty of Science and Health, I set about finding and interviewing a sample of Ireland’s centenarians.
Loneliness: a silent killerThe first commonality to emerge from my research was the importance of social connectedness and having close ties to friends, family and the wider community.
I’m not talking about how we would rank social connectedness today – I could say I’m extremely socially connected because I have 700 friends on Facebook and 300 people like my Instagram page – but that’s a foreign world to them.
They’re talking about real-time connections, face-to-face interactions with the people around them.
In the modern world, where people appear more ‘connected’ than ever, we’re actually totally disconnected – it’s a cruel irony and something I’ve become more aware of since I began this research.
Look around any coffee shop and you’ll observe people sitting together in groups completely ignoring each other – every one of them preoccupied with their phones.
Loneliness and social disconnect is an incredibly pervasive problem that affects all strata of society. Irish women aged between 65 and 85 are considered particularly at risk of withdrawing into themselves following retirement or the loss of a spouse.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, 16-24-year-olds are experiencing record levels of depression and anxiety with more than 10% of them reporting feeling often or always lonely.
Loneliness is worse for your health than smoking, it’s a silent killer. We need to listen to the centenarians who are telling us to develop our social relationships and put down the phones and actually talk to one another.
Hobbies, goals and rolesStaying active in retirement as well as having hobbies, goals and roles also proved vital to centenarians attainment of longevity.
Often, they carried hobbies, like dancing, right through from childhood to adulthood.
I  clearly remember meeting one of the oldest participants in the study – a sprightly 106-year-old man with a penchant for gardening:
Advertisement
I pulled up to the house and saw a man flying around his garden on a ride-on mower. Assuming he was the son, I introduced myself and asked to speak to his father.
He laughed and hopped off the lawn mower to shake my hand.
Shortly afterwards I discovered that the same man still had an active driving licence and drove to mass every Sunday to meet his friends.
I was also struck by how engaged the centenarians were with what was happening in the world around them on both a micro and macro level.
Every one of them had an opinion on the big stories dominating the news cycle at the time, most notably #MeToo and #Repealthe8th, and they were determined to take an active role in the public discourse.
As a trained nurse working in aged care, I often see patients on the other end of the spectrum – older people who have retreated into themselves because they feel that no one wants to listen to what they have to say, although they have many years of experience that society could benefit from.
Resilience and positivityMany of the study participants also showed a propensity for resilience – a quality that saw them through some extremely challenging times.
Some have been orphaned very young while others had experienced difficulties in their married lives and were left rearing children by themselves, while others had never married at all.
The commonality was not in the event itself but in how they dealt with it.
When one of the women’s husbands got sick, she took on the role of a full-time carer so that she could nurse him back to health. What’s incredible is that he is two years older than her and she was 96 at the time.
That kind of resilience and positive outlook on life is inspirational -it’s something we should all take on board.
Looking to the futureWith more and more people making it to 100 and beyond, Irish centenarians are beginning to impact society on a grand level.
Through stakeholder-informed research, policymakers will have the tools to plan for the future and put supports in place to meet increased demand on housing, service, medical care and considerations to pension and working age.
These are the conversations that we need to be having now. As it stands, the healthcare system is already flummoxed. This problem isn’t just going to go away, it’s only going to be compounded as the centenarian population grows.
Prevention is better than cure, so more money needs to be allocated to health promotion and educating people on how to make better choices and stay healthy – something that is atypical across the developed world.
Other things that can be done to promote successful ageing include encouraging people to stay in their homes longer as ageing within the community, has been proven to be much more beneficial and cost-effective.
We should have a scheme so that neighbours check in on people most at risk of social isolation – namely widowers and people living in rural areas.
As a society and as individuals, we can learn so much from our centenarian population. We should implement changes now that will affect our journey to old age and improve our longevity and quality of life

https://www.the42.ie/paddy-andrews-fractured-jaw-4549671-Mar2019/,"DUBLIN FORWARD Paddy Andrews has undergone surgery after suffering a fractured jaw in a clash with Tyrone keeper Niall Morgan in Croke Park on Saturday.
Andrews was in a race for possession along the Hogan Stand sideline in their Division 1 meeting, when he shipped a heavy blow from Morgan’s badly-timed shoulder challenge.
The St Brigid’s star was left with a bloodied face after the foul and was immediately stretchered off. Dublin manager Jim Gavin subsequently told reporters that Andrews was brought to hospital with a head injury.

RTÉ Sport’s Darren Frehill has since reported onTuesday’s Morning Irelandthat Andrews has had surgery after sustaining a fractured jaw as a result of the collision.
That injury will rule him out of St Brigids’ club championship games which are coming up in the next three weeks.

Morgan was handed a yellow card by the referee for the challenge on Andrews, meaning his punishment cannot be reviewed by the GAA’s Central Competition Controls Committee (CCCC) as it was dealt with at the time.
Dublin’s loss to Tyrone at the weekend was their third loss of this year’s Allianz League campaign, which rules them out of the hunt to defend their Division 1 crown.

This will be the first time since 2012 that Dublin will not feature in the league final.

https://www.thejournal.ie/public-consultation-national-cyber-security-strategy-4548740-Mar2019/,"THE MINISTER FOR Communications Richard Bruton is today opening a public consultation on a new strategy to protect individuals, businesses and Ireland’s national security from cyber attacks.
The new strategy will set out how best to ensure the resilient, safe and secure operation of computer networks and associated infrastructure used by the State, Irish citizens and business.
It will set out the framework to protect against such threats as hacking, cyber-crime, cryptojacking, hacktivism and cyber espionage.
Minister Bruton is today encouraging interested parties to have their say on what a new national cyber security strategy should look like.
“We have seen the risks that cyber-attacks can pose to a state’s security. We must ensure that our hospitals, schools, personal data and State infrastructure are protected and that Ireland is not vulnerable to such threats,” Bruton said.
“We also need to make sure that individuals and businesses have the necessary safeguards in place to protect themselves,” he said, calling this an issue of “national importance”.

There are already over 6,000 people in Ireland who are employed in the cyber security sector.

An arrest report said the incident occurred yesterday when a fan approached McGregor and attempted to take a picture of him while exiting the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.
According to the Miami Herald, the report reads: “The defendant slapped the victim’s phone out of his hand, causing it to fall to the floor. The defendant then stomped on the victim’s phone several times, damaging it.”
McGregor had recently carried out community service in New York as part of his punishment for attacking a bus carrying fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov.

The building was evacuated after the envelope, which was addressed to Health Minister Simon Harris, was opened by a member of staff.
Harris was in the building at the time but was not in the room when the envelope was opened. Technicians from the Defence Forces have since confirmed that the powder was non-hazardous.

Reacting to the incident, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his concern is for the staff in the department who opened the mail.
“I’m not sure what kind of oddballs send suspicious packages in the post but they should be well aware that it’s not the politician who’s going to be opening the mail, it’s somebody doing a normal job,” he told reporters.
Minister Harris earlier thanked emergency services for their diligence in responding to the incident. He said it was a “difficult day” for his staff, particularly those working closely with him.
The envelope has now been handed over to gardaí for their investigation.

THE DUTCH HUSBAND of Shamima Begum, a British-born teenager who fled to join Islamic State, wants to live with her in the Netherlands, he said in an interview from detention in Syria.
Yago Riedijk, who is being held in a Kurdish-run detention centre in northeast Syria, married Begum days after she arrived in territory held by IS when he was 23 and she was 15, he toldBBC television.
Begum, 19, from east London and now in a refugee camp, has said she would like to return to the UK but has been stripped of her British citizenship by the government which deems her a security threat.
Riedijk, 27, says he now rejects IS after having fought for the jihadist group. Instead, he wants to return home to the Netherlands with his wife and their newborn son. Their first two children died.
“I would love to go back to my own country… I now understand the privileges I lived with. The privilege of living there as a citizen,” he said.
Asked if he thought marrying a girl of that age was acceptable, he acknowledged that she had been “very young”.
“When my friend came and said there was a girl who was interested in marriage, I wasn’t that interested because of her age, but I accepted the offer anyway,” he replied.

Miserable life
Riedijk, from Arnhem, told the BBC that he had been imprisoned and tortured after IS suspected him of being a Dutch spy. He surrendered to Syrian fighters.
“I lived a miserable life. I was imprisoned. I was tortured. I lived in fear,” he said.
“It was my own fault for going, yes, but I didn’t come out of it as a winner, in any way.”
He said he did not see how Begum could be deemed a threat by the British authorities.
“I don’t understand how she would, in any form, be a danger. All she did was she sat in the house for three years, took care of me and my children,” he said.
The case of Begum has highlighted a dilemma facing many European countries, divided over whether to allow jihadists and IS sympathisers home to face prosecution or bar them as the so-called “caliphate” crumbles.

A spokesman for the Dutch Justice and Security Ministry said they could not comment on individual cases.
Speaking generally, he told AFP: “The Netherlands don’t offer any help to Dutchmen in Syria willing to return. If someone reports at a Dutch embassy or consulate, that person will be transported to the Netherlands, arrested and prosecuted.
To be eligible for a residence permit to live in the Netherlands, a valid passport or travel document is mandatory, and people must meet national security requirements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-5-4539966-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reports from Washington DC
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said those that advocated for Brexit “have been chasing unicorns for a very long time”.
Speaking for the first time since yesterday’s Brexit Westminster vote, Varadkar said there is a “rich irony” that theUK’s tariff proposalsintend to treat Northern Ireland differently to Great Britain.
Addressing the media at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington DC today where he is kicking of the St Patrick’s Day celebrations, Varadkar was asked about the letter sent by a little girl to Donald Tusk saying Britain and the EU “should be friends”. The letter was finished with a drawing of a unicorn.
‘Chasing unicorns’
“I think a lot of people that advocated unicorns have been chasing unicorns for a very long time and as we head into the next few weeks it should be patently obvious to everyone that unicorns only exist in fairytales,” said Varadkar.
He added:
“I would say to people that advocate Brexit, is this really what you want?
“Protectionism, tariffs, borders, restrictions on trade, is this what Brexit was really all about?”
He said for those who voted against the Withdrawal Agreement on the basis that they feared Northern Ireland might be treated differently as a result of the backstop, “it must be evident to them now that it’s the UK Government’s intention to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom and to do so within the next few months”.
Varadkar added:
He said “inevitably Northern Ireland would become a back door to the single market”.
Varadkar said this would result in checks being needed at Northern Ireland’s ports in a matter of months.

Tariffs
Today, the UK government announced that there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
While there will be no tariffs imposed by the UK on goods moving across the land border into Northern Ireland, tariffs will also not be applied to around 87% – up from 80% at present – of imports in a no-deal Brexit to the rest of the UK under a temporary scheme.
The tariffs on various goods where they will be applied are presented by the UK government as a percentage of the “most favoured nation” (MFN) – this is the tariff imposed by the EU on imports from countries that they do not have a free trade agreement with.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will become one of these countries. Currently, no tariffs are paid on the import of goods from Ireland into mainland UK, for example, but that would change in a no-deal.
The Taoiseach was also asked if the proposals on tariffs will effectively create a smugglers paradise in Northern Ireland.

In his response, Varadkar said what will happen is European Law and European Customs code will apply so the common external tariff will apply to any goods exported from the United Kingdom to the European Union.

“And obviously that will have a severe impact on the British economy and on the Northern Ireland economy in particular. That’s why you’ve seen the reaction today from British business, from British farmers, Northern Ireland business, Northern Ireland farmers very concerned about what the UK is proposing and the impact that it’s going to have on their economy,” he said.
As more votes go on this evening, does the Taoiseach think the deal is dead?
“That’s still a matter for Westminster. It’s possible that there will be a future vote, and possible that they may yet ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.
“But from the point of Ireland, and the point of view of the European Union, we really went the extra mile in the last couple of days to try to get the withdrawal agreement over the line – to try to give the British government and the British parliament the assurances that they needed. That failed, that didn’t work, and we have no confidence now that any further assurances would work either,” he said, adding:
“So there is no point in the British government asking for changes or further concessions – because they have demonstrated twice now that they are unable to get an agreement, once made, over the line. So there is no point in asking for further concessions.”
Extending Article 50
While the Irish government has always been open to an extension to Article 50 which would push out Brexit, the Taoiseach said today there has to be a reason for drawing it out.
“I think an extension has to have a purpose. That’s really what we need to hear from London in the next couple of days after they have their various votes today and tomorrow and perhaps if there are more votes too.
“If there is an extension, what’s the point to it. We don’t want a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions that they have to make get put off until the end of June, the end of July or September. That is not going to work for anyone,” he said.
When asked what his preference would be, he said it would depend what the purpose of the extension is.
St Patrick’s Day
While Brexit is dominating the news back home, the Taoiseach has a jam-packed week of events in the US.
Varadkar said there “is a real understanding of the unique nature of Northern Ireland, the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the need to protect the peace in Northern Ireland and how that is so much more important than any economic considerations. That is well understood.
“People mightn’t understand the details of withdrawal agreements and backstop and European law and all of those things, but they do understand the Good Friday Agreement is paramount. That we must have on the island of Ireland, free movement of people and free trade and protection of the peace process”
Will he be asking US President Donald trump for any help with Brexit.
“Certainly if the president is open to wanting a Special Envoy to Northern Ireland that would be very welcome. We know historically that when the United States has taken an interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland it has helped bring peace to conclusion so that will certainly be welcome.
“We’re not asking anyone here in America to take sides between the UK and the European Union and Ireland. We know they will want to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK into the future and we also want to negotiate a free trade agreement between the US and the EU and would like to do that before there is any agreement with the UK, but we will be saying to them of course that the Good Friday Agreement has to be paramount, that the peace process has to be paramount.
He said the US was so involved in making the Good Friday agreement possible and in helping to bring about peace in Northern Ireland.
“What we’ll be saying to them of course that we would ask that no trade deal that is done with the UK should ever undermine the peace process,” he concluded.

The incident happened last night when a section of the E Division caught fire. Early indications suggest faulty wiring was the cause of the blaze.
A spokesperson for the Irish Prison Service confirmed it is investigating the incident but stressed that all safety procedures worked correctly.
The spokesman said: “The Irish Prison Service can confirm that there was a fire in the E Division of Midlands prison (attic area) last night.

“There has been damage to some non-residential (plant room) area of the division. The fire brigade were called and the fire was extinguished.
“There is currently no power to most of the affected area and the Irish Prison Service are taking all reasonable steps to rehouse prisoners that have to be moved as a result of the electrical power issue.
“There were no injuries reported as a result of the fire. There have been some queries about issues in relation to the safety systems in place however, the Irish Prison Service can confirm that all the relevant safety systems worked as expected.”
Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said he was concerned by the incident.
In a statement, he said he wished to commend the fire brigade and all those who responded to the fire in order to extinguish it.
He said: “I understand power has been restored to many of the affected areas and I know the IPS are working to keep disruptions for prisoners to a minimum. I am of course concerned that the fire broke out in the first place. Early indications suggest the fire started as a result of an electrical wiring fault however I am expecting a full report on the incident from the Irish Prison Service in due course.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/barnardos-financial-concerns-4549528-Mar2019/,"CHILDREN’S CHARITY BARNARDOS has said it will take a “shift in strategic direction” and, due to financial concerns, has made a “small number” of employees redundant.
A circular sent to the charity’s 300 workers last month said that Barnardos would no longer take an “all-children focused political mobilisation approach” in its advocacy work, the Irish Times reported today.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, Barnardos CEO Suzanne Connolly said the redundancies would be coming in its advocacy and learning and development functions “because of gaps in state funding following cuts instigated in 2009″.

“We have prioritised continuation of services to children and families using our voluntary funds to make up gaps in state funding and we have made no direct cuts in this area,” Connolly said.
She said that if Barnardos wasn’t faced with these financial challenges, then no positions would be made redundant.
The charity has been operating in Ireland since the 1960s, and offers early years and family support services to more than 15,300 children and families a year, it says.
Going forward, Connolly said the charity would continue to lobby to ensure vulnerable children are given the supports they need.
“In particular we will be advocating strongly for the investment in our intensive family support services for vulnerable children and families living with addiction, domestic abuse, parental mental health issues, separation and bereavement, and in the area of child protection,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-soldiers-explainer-bloody-sunday-4541427-Mar2019/,"TODAY, THE PUBLIC Prosecution Service (PPS) in Northern Ireland announced that one former British soldier would be charged over two murders and two attempted murders in the Bloody Sunday killings.
Soldier F – as he’s identified by the PPS – will face charges over the murders of James Wray and William McKinney in Derry on 30 January 1972.
He’ll also be charged with the attempted murder of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick O’Donnell.
However, there were 12 other people who were fatally shot on Bloody Sunday, when British soldiers opened fire on unarmed civil rights protesters in the Bogside area.
After the lengthy second inquiry into Bloody Sunday – called the Saville Inquiry which lasted 12 years – it was found that the killings were “unjustified” and it led to an apology in the House of Commons from then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010.
The PPS said today that it had concluded the “available evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction”, in respect of the 16 British soldiers.
It also provided its reasoning behind this, so here’s why prosecutors say there won’t be murder charges brought in the cases of the other civilians killed on Bloody Sunday.
The Bogside area of DerryShutterstock / Edward HaylanShutterstock / Edward Haylan / Edward Haylan
‘Test for prosecution’
The PPS said all its decisions were taken strictly in accordance with the ‘test for prosecution’.
This involves ascertaining whether the evidence is available, admissible in court and can be considered credible and reliable. Once this first test is met, a decision must be made on whether it is in the public interest to prosecute a case. Once the evidence meets the required test, and the public interest test is satisfied, a prosecution can proceed.
It notes that previous inquiries – such as the Saville Inquiry which found the killings to be unjustified – are “not bound by rules designed for court cases”.
The PPS is bound by those rules, and cannot draw on the conclusions of the Saville Inquiry for its case.
It also had to weigh the various accounts given by the soldiers who discharged their weapons that day. The PPS judged that it could not draw upon previous testimony from soldiers regarding these events, including at the Saville Inquiry.
Some will have given evidence to the Royal Military Police immediately after Bloody Sunday, statements and sworn testimony to the Widgery Inquiry in the 1970s, and statements and sworn testimony to the Saville Inquiry in the 2000s.
Some of these earlier statements would have been made where soldiers were “provided with an assurance by senior Army officers that the statements would not be used against them in any subsequent proceedings,” the PPS noted.
“The circumstances in which the various statements described above were made by the soldiers presented the prosecution with formidable legal difficulties in terms of relying upon them,” the PPS said.
It was concluded that this highly significant body of evidence was not available to the prosecution for the purpose of any criminal proceedings.
The PPS also judged that in many cases, the evidence of one soldier over another was consider inadmissible.
When considering whether to prosecute, the PPS divided the events of the day into five ‘sectors’.
That morning on 30 January, Catholics planned to hold a civil rights march against the backdrop of the escalating violence in Northern Ireland, the introduction of internment, and the banning of marches by the Northern Irish Prime Minister.
Those marching planned to travel from Bishop’s Field in the Creggan housing estate to the Guildhall in the city centre.
Sector 1
In the first incident, shots were fired by two soldiers at a derelict building on William Street, before other soldiers had moved into the Bogside.
Two civilians – Damien Donaghy and John Johnston – were injured by gunfire. Soldiers A and B were suspected of being responsible.

The PPS said: “After careful consideration the PPS concluded that on the available evidence there was no reasonable prospect of proving that Soldier A and Soldier B were not acting in self-defence.”
Sector 2
These events concerned what happened in the area of the car park at the front of Rossville Flats. Army vehicles moved into the Bogside, soldiers disembarked and a number of shots were fired by the soldiers.
Jackie Duddy was shot and killed, while Margaret Deery, Michael Bridge, Michael Bradley, Patrick McDaid, Patrick Brolly and Pius McCarron suffered injuries.
The soldiers reported to the PSNI of being involved here were Soldiers N, O, Q, R, S and V. Soldier N has recently died, so no prosecution can be brought against him.
The PPS noted that the Saville Inquiry was unable to be sure as to which soldier was responsible for the various casualties in this area.
Saville concluded that Soldier Q “probably shot Michael Bradley” and Soldier V “probably shot” Margaret Deery. But the PPS found no evidence to prove they fired their weapons.

In the case of Soldier R, Saville concluded he probably shot Jackie Duddy, and also may have fired the shots that injured McCarron and McDaid.
The only evidence available that Soldier R had fired their weapon was the account of another soldier. However, from this evidence the PPS said “it is far from clear whether soldier did in fact see Soldier R fire”.
While there was some evidence to potentially prove that soldiers O and S had fired, the PPS judged it insufficient.
“The inconsistencies between those accounts and the lack of correlation with the wider body of evidence meant that, even if they were admitted, they could not present a clear or coherent narrative capable of providing the basis for a prosecution case,” the PPS said.

Sector 3
This centres around a rubble barricade that ran across Rossville Street. Soldiers from Mortar Platoon, Anti-Tank Platoon and Composite Platoon were reported in connection with these events.
Michael Kelly, Hugh Gilmour, William Nash, Michael McDaid, John Young and Kevin McElhinney were shot and killed in this area.  Alexander Nash was also shot and injured.
After the shooting had stopped in other sectors, a number of soldiers in this area fired at a window of the Rossville Flats, though none of the bullets struck a person.
The soldiers who were reported were Soldier F, Soldier J, Soldier K, Soldier M, Soldier P, Soldier U and Soldier 039.
The Bloody Sunday (Saville) Inquiry:
Was sureSoldier Ushot and killedHugh Gilmour;
Was sureSoldier Fshot and killedMichael Kelly;
Was sureSoldier Pshot at least one ofWilliam Nash, John Young and Michael McDaid;
FoundSoldier Jmay have been responsible for one of the three above;
Could not eliminate the possibility thatSoldier E(deceased) was responsible for shooting at least one ofWilliam Nash, John Young and Michael McDaid;
It was possibleSoldier PorSoldier Jshot and woundedAlexander Nash;
Was sure that eitherSoldier L(deceased) orSoldier Mshot and killedKevin McElhinney;
Found thatSoldier Kfired at around the same time but it was likely he did not hitKevin McElhinneyor anyone else;
Found thatSoldier L, Soldier M and Soldier Kprobably fired after being given an order bySoldier 002(deceased) and/orSoldier 039.
In the case of Soldier F, there was some evidence that might show he fired at the rubble barricade.
A forensic examination in 1972 of a bullet recovered from the body of Michael Kelly linked that bullet to a particular rifle, with the serial number A.32515. However the contemporaneous documents do not link the rifle to any particular soldier so there was no reasonable prospect of proving Soldier F discharged the shot from this rifle.
The only source of evidence that it was Soldier F who fired this weapon in the day was contained in his own inadmissible accounts.
One soldier placed Soldier F among a group of soldiers who were firing in a location that would appear to be Rossville Street but there was insufficient evidence to prove that Soldier F was one of those actually firing. This soldier also later heard Soldier F admitting to having fired on Bloody Sunday, though the admission did not detail where or when he fired.
Another soldier referred to Soldier F firing in this location but in his first statement he had stated he was unable to identify which soldiers were firing. The PPS said there were a number of “further significant reliability and credibility issues” with this witness. It concluded the available evidence did not provide a reasonable prospect of proving Soldier F fired at this location.
In respect of Soldier M, there was some evidence to be considered of his involvement in the firing that resulted in Kevin McElhinney’s death. This evidence came from other soldiers. The PPS said even if this hearsay evidence was admitted in court, it would support a defence case that Soldier M fired under the genuine but mistaken impression that he had identified a gunman. There was no reasonable prospect of disproving a self-defence case.
With Soldier 039, the PPS found the evidence was not consistent solely with an intention on his part to encourage other soldiers to fire, as opposed to ensuring they monitored a potential threat.
In the other cases, the PPS also said there was insufficient evidence that the accused soldiers fired their weapons at this location that day.
The prosecution service also made a decision on the firing at the window of the Rossville Flats. The Bloody Sunday Inquiry concluded Soldier C, Soldier D, Soldier F, Soldier G (deceased) and Soldier L (deceased) all fired at a window in Block 1 of the flats where a photographer had sought to take pictures out of a window.
However there was no admissible evidence capable of identifying Soldier C or Soldier D as being amongst those who fired. There was evidence which could be adduced to prove Soldier F was one but there was also evidence to support a defence that soldiers believed their target was a gunman.
In all of the above cases, the PPS made a decision not to prosecute these soldiers in connection with these incidents.
Sector 4
This section considered events in Glenfada Park North and Abbey Park.
James Wray and William McKinney were shot and killed at Glenfada Park. Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick O’Donnell were shot and injured.
In Abbey Park, Gerard McKinney and Gerald Donaghey were shot and killed.
Four soldiers were reported in this incident – Soldiers F, H, G and E. Soldier G and Soldier E have since died and can’t be prosecuted.
Soldier Fisbeing prosecutedin the murders of James Wray and William McKinney, and the attempted murder of four others.
In the case of Soldier H, the PPS said there was no admissible evidence to prove he’d fired his weapon on Bloody Sunday.
In the case of the now-deceased Soldier G, the Saville Inquiry “had no doubt” that he shot and killed Gerard McKinney and Gerald Donaghey.
Sector 5
This area concerned events to the rear of Rossville Flats, where a kneeling soldier is alleged to have fired from the corner of Glenfada Park North into this location.
Bernard McGuigan and Patrick Doherty were shot and killed here. Daniel McGowan and Patrick Campbell were shot and injured.
The only soldier reported in this incident was Soldier F.
The Saville Inquiry concluded that he was responsible for killing both Bernard McGuigan and Patrick Doherty and that it was highly probable that he was responsible for the injuries sustained by Daniel McGowan and Patrick Campbell.
The only evidence that Soldier F fired his weapon from the corner was from Soldier G, who is now deceased. In some, but not all, accounts this Soldier G had given, he placed Soldier F at that scene.
PPS reasoning in this case
The PPS said: “Having regard to the importance that this evidence would hold (it would be sole and decisive evidence), the serious reliability issues in relation to this soldier’s evidence (he had shot and killed persons in Abbey Park and failed to mention this in his own accounts) and the difficulties a court would face in testing and assessing this evidence, the PPS concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of a court admitting this evidence for use against Soldier F.”
In the case of the alleged involvement of Official IRA members, there is no suggestion that any shots discharged by them hit any soldier or caused any injury.
Reaction
Although charges have only been brought in the cases of two of the killings, the families of victims today described today as a “remarkable achievement”.
In a statement issued by the families through Madden & Finucane Solicitors, they said:
“Notwithstanding the unprecedented attempted political interference with the independence of the judicial process, the families have not only succeeded in consigning the Widgery report to history, and securing the complete vindication and declaration of innocence of all of the victims of Bloody Sunday through the Saville Inquiry, they have now secured the prosecution of Soldier F for the murder and attempted murder of six innocent people.”
However, they added: “We are disappointed that not all of those responsible are to face trial.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-backstop-meaningful-vote-2-4536984-Mar2019/,"THE DUP HAS said that it cannot support Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest Brexit deal tonight, making it less likely that the Withdrawal Agreement will pass in the House of Commons.
MPs are due to vote once again on the Brexit deal, in the wake of last-minute measures announced last night by May and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
However, advice from attorney general Geoffrey Cox published this morning put hopes of the deal passing in doubt.
Deputy leader and MP, Nigel Dodds tweeted the party’s current position, adding: “Sufficient progress has NOT been achieved at this time.”

However, the party added that it does want to back an agreement but does not believe May’s deal passes its “fundamental tests” on the “constitutional and economic integrity” of the Union.

The DUP’s statement in full reads:
“The Prime Minister set out a clear objective for legally binding change which would command a majority in the House of Commons in line with the Brady amendment.  We recognise that the Prime Minister has made limited progress in her discussions with the European Union.
“Having carefully considered the published material as well as measuring what has been achieved against our own fundamental tests, namely the impact of the backstop on the constitutional and economic integrity of the Union of the United Kingdom, it is clear that the risks remain that the UK would be unable to lawfully exit the backstop were it to be activated.
“The Attorney General’s legal advice is clear in his last paragraph “the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”

“The European Union has been intransigent. It is possible to reach a sensible deal which works for the United Kingdom and the European Union but it will require all sides to be reasonable and in deal making mode.”
The European Research Group (or the ERG), made up of hardline-Tory Brexiteers – has also advised its 110 members not to support the government’s motion, describing the new assurances as offering only “faint and remote prospects of escaping” from the backstop.
The House of Commons is due to vote on May’s Withdrawal Agreement at 7pm.
There are650 seats in the House of Commons; Theresa May needs 320 votes to pass her deal tonight.
If the deal fails again this evening, parliament will vote on a no-deal Brexit tomorrow, or an extension to Article 50 on Thursday which could delay Brexit if the EU is amenable.

https://www.the42.ie/paula-radcliffe-4526632-Mar2019/,"
BRITISH WOMEN’S MARATHON world record holder Paula Radcliffe has warned of potential “manipulation” in top-level sport unless tighter rules are applied to transgender women.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines state that athletes who transition from male to female should be allowed to compete without undergoing sex reassignment surgery but need to demonstrate their testosterone level has been below a certain level for at least a year.
The debate about whether it is fair for transgender women to compete in women’s sport has come into sharp focus since a row developed between transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon and former tennis player Martina Navratilova.
“Right now, transgender women are not a threat to female sport,” Radcliffe told BBC Sport.

“But you would be naive if you thought that, by not putting in any rules, it couldn’t come to that at some point in the future.
Radcliffe said it was important to protect female sport but also transgender women and their rights.
“You don’t have to talk about excluding transgender women from sport, but I don’t know if the current levels go far enough. I’m not an expert, but I’m trying to safeguard the future of female sport,” she added.
“I think 10 (nanomoles of testosterone per litre, the current IOC requirement) is too high given I’ve read that the normal female range is up to two. So five might be about right.
Radcliffe also called for a halt to the “attacking and bullying” that she believes has existed between groups and individuals with contrasting views.
Navratilova, an 18-time Grand Slam title winner, was branded “transphobic” after writing in a newspaper column that allowing trans athletes to compete with women who were assigned female at birth is “cheating” and “unfair”.

She apologised for describing transgender athletes wishing to compete in women’s sport as cheats but said the issue of transgender athletes was guaranteed to keep raising competitive as well as ethical questions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/aer-lingus-cabin-crew-make-up-4528585-Mar2019/,"FEMALE CABIN CREW at Aer Lingus will no longer be required to wear makeup or skirts as part of new uniform guidelines, the airline has confirmed.
The announcement, which was first reported in The Times (Ireland edition), comes after Aer Lingus last month revealed a brand refresh with an updated logo.
New uniform guidelines are still being completed, according to Aer Lingus, but it confirmed the use of makeup for female staff will no longer be mandatory.
In a statement today, the airline said the new uniform has been designed in partnership with a number of staff to “reflect changing dress norms and to better meet the needs of our guest-facing colleagues”.

Aer Lingus first announced plans to redesign the airlines uniform, which was being led by designer Louise Kennedy, last March.
“The new uniform collection incorporates a range of wearer options including a trouser option for females and an ability to combine collection elements,” Aer Lingus said.
Designed by Sybil Connolly of Pimms in 1945, Aer Lingus’ first-ever uniform was a military-style rich brown suit which then became green a few years later in 1948. Since then, green has remained a primary colour in the Aer Lingus uniform.
The decision to no longer require Aer Lingus staff to wear makeup, follows a similar announcement by Britain’s Virgin Atlantic yesterday.
“Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work,” Virgin Atlantic Executive Vice President Mark Anderson said in a statement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-mps-no-deal-4533098-Mar2019/,"AHEAD OF THE series of vital votes on Brexit in the coming week in Westminster, Northern Irish businesses have written to MPs and warned how local firms are “hugely exposed” to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
Urging politicians to take a no-deal off the table, the group of 50 businesses asked MPs to “consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit”.
Separately, the UK’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has told the BBC that if the House of Commons – as expected – refuses to pass Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, then it opens up the possibility of a second referendum.
However, the hardline Brexiteers have signalled that they won’t back May’s proposals which include the Irish backstop, and said it will be defeated in the House on Tuesday.
Crunch time
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher with the potential for three crucial votes this week.
Advertisement
On Tuesday, MPs will get the opportunity to vote again on the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement. It was heavily defeated in January, and not a great deal has changed with the deal with the EU since that point.
On Wednesday, if May’s deal is voted against, MPs will then vote on whether to leave the EU without a deal. If this is also defeated, a vote will be put to the house on Thursday on whether to delay Brexit.
With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit not yet off the table, Northern Irish businesses have urged MPs not to support this option.
In its open letter – signed by more than 50 businesses – it says: “Although Brexit has not yet happened, the negative economic impact is already starting to bite in terms of the private sector’s ability to invest.
We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Responding to the letter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said it is clear there is a “coordinated attempt to railroad MPs into accepting the toxic, union destroying, NI economy damaging deal, which the prime minister had previously agreed with the EU”.
Hard stance
Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that if Brexit didn’t happen, it would be “devastating” for the Conservative party.
Related ReadsExplainer: What on earth is going to happen in Westminster next week?
He also said it was essential the UK seizes its opportunity to leave with Theresa May’s deal on 29 March because “there is wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit”.
“If you want to stop Brexit, you only need to do three things,” he said. “Kill this deal, get an extension and then have a second referendum. Within three weeks those people could have two of those three things… Quite possibly the third one could be on the way.”
Two leading Brexiteers, meanwhile, have said that delaying Brexit would cause “incalculable” harm to the public’s trust in politics and the democratic process.
DUP MP Nigel Dodds and Tory MP Steve Baker, writing in today’s Sunday Telegraph, said that delaying Brexit would mean that “democracy would be effectively dead”.
Both said that May’s deal would be soundly defeated on Tuesday, and delaying Brexit now would be costly for businesses who’ve prepared for a 29 March exit date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/crusader-head-dublin-stolen-man-charged-4542926-Mar2019/,"A 35-YEAR-OLD man has been charged with burglary over the theft of a mummified head of an 800-year-old “Crusader” knight from a church in Dublin.
The Crusader was decapitated at the crypt in St Michan’s Church, Church Street, on the weekend of 23-24 February last, and his head was taken along with another skull.
The break-in was discovered on 25 February, when a guide about to open the church for visitors found the head of the Crusader had been severed from its body and was missing.
On 5 March, investigating gardaí from the Bridewell station recovered the head of the Crusader and another skull that had been taken from the crypt.
This evening, Brian Bridgeman, with an address at Kings Inns Street, Dublin 1, was brought to appear before Judge Michael Walsh at Dublin District Court.
Evidence of arrest, charge and caution was given by Garda Niall Cadden.
The defendant, who has not yet indicated how he will plead, made no reply when charged, the court heard.

He was charged under Section 12 of the Theft and Fraud Offences Act, with an accusation that while trespassing at St Michan’s Church he had committed theft at at time between 23 and 24 February last.
Judge Walsh asked the garda if the case related to recent matters he had read about in the newspapers.
The garda confirmed that it did, and the court heard directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions were awaited.
He also objected to bail.
Legal aid was granted following an application by defence solicitor Eoin Lysaght, who asked the court to set bail.
The judge agreed to grant bail in the defendant’s own bond of €200, of which €100 must be lodged before he can be released with conditions that he must reside at another address furnished to the court, sign on daily at Blanchardstown Garda station, obey a 10pm–6am curfew, and be contactable at all times by mobile phone.
The man, who remained silent during the hearing, was remanded in custody with consent to bail on these terms and will face his next hearing on 21 March at Cloverhill District Court.
Last week another man in his 20s was arrested as part of the investigation but he was later released without charge.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-the-guards-will-know-expert-tells-court-of-indentations-found-on-page-in-patrick-quirke-home-4539709-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Mar 2019
A GARDA DOCUMENTS and handwriting expert developed indentations made on a page found in Patrick Quirke’s home and discovered somebody had written: “What the guards will know,” and details relating to Bobby Ryan’s disappearance.
Following on from yesterday’s evidence when a garda detailed notes relating to the investigation written on an A4 page found in Quirke’s home, Detective Garda Jeremiah Moloney said he examined pages found during the search.
Quirke, 50, of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan.
The deceased went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am.
His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013.
The prosecution claims Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with the deceased’s girlfriend Lowry, 52.
He explained that when a person is writing the pages below can develop indentations that may not be visible to the naked eye.
‘Needle in a haystack’
Using an Electrostatic Detection Device, known as an ESDA machine, he said it is possible to develop those indentations.
When he carried out the procedure on the document he said that he was able to confidently record on one side of the page that someone had written: “What the gardaí will know.”
Two lines below that he found the words: “Murdered poss in house.” Four lines below that was the word “location” and a question mark.
Further down the page he found “Mary \ walk \ kids to school?” and the word “yes” with a ring around it.
On line 16 of the page he found the words: “dispose of clothes \ phone \ any other evidence.”
On line 25 it read: “Mary had to see him, be with him.”
The document also noted: “Mary” followed by something illegible and then: “Needle in haystack.” The writing also mentioned that “Bobby stayed in yard, ie two mins \ ten mins.”
On the other side of the page he found the words: “Agitate need water”, “Get load of… following”, “Tuesday”, and a person’s name towards the bottom of the page.
Terminated lease
The witness agreed with Lorcan Staines for the defence that the indentations he found could have come from multiple pages and that in some places there was so much cross writing that he couldn’t make out what was written.
He further agreed that he can’t say how many different notes made up either page.
The trial also heard from solicitor Aidan Leahy, who acted for Ms Lowry in 2012 when she decided to terminate the accused’s lease on her land.
Advertisement
He told Mr Bowman that he sent a letter to the accused saying that Lowry had “concerns” and suggested that terminating the lease would be in the best interests of his client, Quirke and their families.
The letter also stated that the accused should be aware that the intruder alarm at Lowry’s home had gone off on a number of occasions and while she was not making any allegations, she did report an incident to the gardaí.
He said it was also noted that the accused appeared to have interfered with Lowry’s letters, looked through her windows and interfered with items on her clothes line.
The letter asked Quirke to refrain from entering Lowry’s property and restrict his activities at Fawnagowan to the farmland.
Deep regret
A reply was received from Quirke in January 2013, when he said there were many inaccuracies in the previous letter that he was not going to comment on or clarify “to your benefit”, but added that he may at some later time.
He said his mother-in-law lives at the property in Fawnagowan and looks forward to his visits and he plans on visiting her has he had done for years.
He added that he would consider the termination if he were compensated for loss of earnings and for investments he had made on the land.
In March, 2013 a solicitor acting on behalf of the accused wrote to Lowry’s solicitor to say that the relationship between herself and Quirke had deteriorated and that Quirke “regrets this deeply”.
The letter also said that Quirke would pay a further three months rent, and due to his previous relationship with Lowry, was prepared to forego any compensation.
He was “extremely regretful” and anxious that their relationship should not deteriorate any further, the letter stated.
He also wished to continue to visit his mother-in-law, who lives in a property adjoining Lowry’s farmhouse.
‘Inflammatory’ comments
A subsequent letter from suggested 3 July as the date for termination of the lease, and stated that there was no difficulty with Quirke visiting his mother-in-law as long as he confined his visits to that purpose only.
Contained within the letters was also a request that Quirke cleaned out a cattle shed and tanks before leaving.
His solicitor replied that he was leaving the sheds in the same condition they were in when he took up the lease.
In September 2013, Quirke’s solicitor sent a letter denying that a payment was owing from him.
There was a subsequent allegation from Quirke’s solicitor that Lowry made “inflammatory” comments about him in front of his mother-in-law and requested that she not do this again.
The witness confirmed to Mr Bowman that Lowry had given her permission to have the letters used as evidence in the trial.
The trial continues in front of Justice Eileen Creedon and a jury of six men and six women.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-bercow-papers-4549242-Mar2019/,"HOUSE OF COMMONS Speaker John Bercow yesterday delivered a potential hammer blow to Theresa May’s hopes for a third meaningful vote on her Brexit deal, and is feeling the wrath of many of the papers in the UK today as a result.
Bercow said MPs from both sides of the house had expressed concern to him about the house being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.
The Speaker was invoking a 400-year-old parliament rule to take the measure, and scuppers the prime minister’s hopes of avoiding a delay to Brexit by finally getting her deal through.
It is no unclear what move May will make next, although a delay to Brexit now appears the most likely outcome.
Here’s what the papers this morning make of it.
The Daily Mail featured a photo of Bercow with the headline “Smirk that says: Brexit be damned”.
Daily MailDaily Mail
“Bercow is sabotaging Brexit deal, says No 10,” according to the headline in The Times.

The Daily Express names him simply “The Brexit destroyer”, while the Daily Telegraph ran with the headline “A major constitutional crisis”, and added that there was “disgust in the Commons” over Bercow’s intervention.

It is the second-straight year Duffy won the award, although he wasn’t in Montrose to collect his award as a result of Brighton’s FA Cup game with Millwall going to extra-time.
He is the first player to win the award on consecutive occasions since Shay Given in 2006.
Darren Randolph finished second in the voting, while Declan Rice was third.
As was confirmed ahead of the event, Rice was voted as Young Player of the Year and unsurprisingly wasn’t around to pick up the award. Callums Robinson and O’Dowda finished second and third respectively.

Elsewhere, Leanne Kiernan won the senior women’s award, ahead of Tyler Toland in second place and Niamh Fahey in third.
The Goal of the Year award – amended to include goals scored at all age grades given that the senior team managed just four in the whole of last year – was won by Aiden O’Brien, for his effort against Poland last year.
Like Duffy, he wasn’t there at the studios to collect his award.
Ronan Curtis was the winner of the U21 Player of the Year award, while Lee O’Connor, Brian Maher, Adam Idah, Troy Parrott, and Anselmo Garcia McNulty were winners at U19, U18, U17, U16 and U15 level respectively.
The underage women’s awards went to Niamh Farrelly (U19), Emily Whelan  (U17), and Jessica Ziu (U16).
Dundalk’s Chris Shields was voted SSE Airtricity League Player of the Year, ahead of his clubmates Pat Hoban and Michael Duffy.

There were awards too for Eoin Hayes (Junior International of the Year), Darragh Reynor (Intermediate Player of the Year), Nathalie O’Brien (Football for All), Daire O’Connor (Schools and Universities) and Ali Reghba (Schools).
Richard Dunne and Emma Byrne were inducted into the hall of fame, while Georgia’s Kakha Kaladze was given the International Personality award.

https://www.the42.ie/richard-keogh-4549523-Mar2019/,"USING THE PHRASE ‘trial by media’ is often the preserve of managers and footballers usually sullen with their treatment press, and while that can’t describe Richard Keogh’s attitude at Irish training this morning, he was nonetheless asked to raise his hand ahead of a press conference.
Not that he was swearing on anything – it’s so we could all inspect his heavily-bandaged right hand.
Keogh snapped a bone in his hand against Stoke City last week, but after seeking advice, is determined to avoid surgery and play on for Derby County and, most immediately, Ireland.
“At first they were talking about surgery, I didn’t particularly want to do that.
“When I spoke to [the hand surgeon], I said, ‘Listen if there’s a chance I can keep on playing I want to continue playing, if that’s at all possible.
“I told him I don’t want to have surgery, I’d rather take a risk and crack on. He said we can do that. If it hadn’t been the middle of my finger which is protected by the other two, I might have had to have surgery and been out for a while.

“So fingers crossed it works out well and I can keep on playing.”
Sticking to a similar theme, Keogh said it was time that his teammates followed his lead and own up to the disappointments of 2018 and atone for them this year.
“I think we can all hold our hands up to that.
“As players, we have to take responsibility, we could have performed a lot better. I just think that whatever happened in the past is in the past now.
“Obviously Mick has come in. He’s a fantastic manager, a fantastic guy. His record for Ireland and at club level is very good.
“Walking into the group, there is a very good vibe, a very good excitement about it.
“Whatever happened is in the past, and we have to look to this campaign.”
Elsewhere, Shane Long has pulled out of the squad with a groin injury, with Millwall’s Aiden O’Brien called in as a replacement. He will fly in tomorrow.

Conor Hourihane has also yet to join up with the squad, but it’s hoped he will join up with the squad later today.
Shane Duffy and Keiren Westwood joined the squad yesterday evening after missing the earlier training session, while it’s expected that Seamus Coleman and Seani Maguire will train today having sat out yesterday’s session.
In preparation for the surface that awaits them in Gibraltar, the Irish squad will train on the astro pitch at Abbottstown later today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/istanbul-convention-ratification-ireland-4529128-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Mar 2019
THE TAOISEACH HAS said there is an “epidemic of violence against women” and the government is working to put measures in place to stop it.
Leo Varadkar was speaking after a special Cabinet meeting for International Women’s Day and the ratification by Ireland of the Instanbul Convention, which was confirmed this morning.
The convention is a significant international legal instrument which requires criminalising or legally sanctioning different forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment and psychological violence.
Ireland, which signed the convention three years ago, has now become the 34th Council of Europe Member State out of 47 to ratify the Convention.
Varadkar said Cabinet had this morning agreed a number of measures to promote greater gender equality and one of the most significant memos related to gender-based violence.
He pointed to changes in law that have already been made like the inclusion of a definition of consent and the recogition of coercive control as a form of domestic abuse.
Ratification
Formal ratification of the Istanbul Convention by Ireland took place at a ceremony at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg this morning.
Council of Europe Secretary General, Thorbjørn Jagland, welcomed the ratification, saying: “We welcome Ireland’s ratification as yet more proof of the success of our convention, which helps to prevent violence, helps victims, and ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice.
“All our member states need the Istanbul Convention to more effectively prosecute perpetrators and to provide support and protection to their victims and to implement measures that will help prevent the violence from occurring in the first place.”

Domestic violence
Commenting on the ratification, Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said that protecting and supporting victims has been a key priority for this government.
“Domestic and sexual violence can have devastating consequences for victims as well as society as a whole. Ratifying the Convention delivers on a Government commitment and sends an important message that Ireland does not tolerate such violence. That message is all the more appropriate given that today is International Women’s Day,” he said.
The Istanbul Convention is a broad-based document which covers a number of Departments’ policy areas.
In October 2015, the government approved an action plan to deal with outstanding actions that were identified as being necessary to enable Ireland’s rectification of the Convention. A month later, Ireland signed the Convention, however, campaigners have criticised the government for slow progress.
The minister said the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which was published in January 2016, adopts a whole of government strategy to the outstanding issues that needed to be addressed.
Women’s Aid, the national organisation providing frontline support to women experiencing domestic and dating abuse, has welcomed today’s progress.
“The ratification of the Istanbul Convention is a major milestone in tackling domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  At the heart of any progress there must be the increased safety and protection for women and children affected by domestic violence,” Women’s Aid director Margaret Martin said.
However, Martin said that urgent movement is needed in State prosecution of crimes against women.
“Now that we have comprehensive and binding legal framework, there is no reason not to prosecute and properly sanction offenders,” Martin said.
Similarly, Safe Ireland, the agency representing 37 domestic violence services also said that the ambition of the Istanbul Conventionwould only be realised if the Government also committed to putting in place the specialised supports and services that women and children need to be safe from abuse and control.
“Ultimately, we have a choice. We can ratify the Convention and then revert to piecemeal business as usual, or we can ratify it and say, now let’s put in place the wrap-around resources, training, policies, support infrastructure, awareness programmes and whole of society response that will make Ireland the safest country in the world for women and children,” Safe Ireland programme and communications manager Caitriona Gleeson said.
Key actions
Key actions contained in the plan include the training of public sector officials, the implementation of the Victims Directive and the enactment of key legislation such as the Victims of Crime Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018. The recent enactment of the Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction) Act 2019 was the final legislative action required to enable today’s ratification to proceed.
Flanagan said today’s ratification of the Istanbul Convention is a significant step in tackling these issues, and is the result of much work from many people over a number of years.
“Ratification does not mean the end of our efforts. The implementation of the actions of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and gender-based Violence is ongoing. The government will continue to work in providing protections to victims of domestic and sexual violence and holding perpetrators to account. The prevalence of this violence means we cannot lessen our efforts in this regard. Rather ratification signals a renewal of our commitments,” he said.
Some of the key elements of the Convention include running regular awareness-raising campaigns, setting up treatment programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence and for sex offenders, ensuring adequate police intervention and protection is in place, as well as specialised support services, in addition to making 24/7 telephone helplines free of charge.
The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre (DRCC) has also welcomed Flanagan’s announcement today.
“Today’s ratification will be the end of the journey of preparation and the beginning of a journey of implementation of the steps required by the Convention, which is the first legally binding treaty identifying violence against women as both a human rights violation and as downright discrimination,” DRCC CEO Noeline Blackwell said.
“It is particularly significant that the ratification will happen on International Women’s Day which this year focuses on better balance. This convention can be an important way of achieving that balance.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-lets-drop-the-narrative-of-the-undeserving-poor-and-other-myths-that-dehumanise-people-4538958-Mar2019/,"I GREW UP in West Belfast.
Born into the conflict, I lived in an area that was hugely politically active.
We were aware from a very young age of politics, the fight for rights, chalking political slogans to the ground where we played. I knew well the faces of John Major and Margaret Thatcher – more from Spitting Image than anything else.
I also had an in-depth knowledge of the benefits system from panicked phone calls and conversations, getting sent to the neighbour’s house to see if their ‘bru’ came in that week.
My primary school was a mix of kids from my area and children from a more affluent one down the road. I was acutely aware that my parents had less money than others, that we were different.
The embarrassment and shame of having to queue up with a few others from our class to get our free school dinner ticket was a daily dread.
One Christmas when I was eight years old, I remember seeing the news that my classmate had been shot in a bar when playing snooker with his father. The shock for me was realising this wasn’t just between the adults. Age didn’t matter. You were someone’s enemy and you never knew why.
Circumstances
Lingering inside me always was the feeling that we deserved it because of ‘our circumstances’.
Ah, your circumstances: your name, where you’re from, where you live, how you speak, what you look like, what you have, what you don’t have. I was surrounded by the narratives, the judgements and the justifications for all of it.
It creeps into your head. When you don’t think you’re equal to someone else, when you think other people are simply better because of their circumstances, you’re in danger – in many different ways.
These narratives inform my work as a theatre-maker in some shape or form.
Undeserving poor
For a few years, I’ve been campaigning against the Tory party’s brutal Welfare Reform Bill as part of theParticipation and the Practice of Rights Project.
People with disabilities have had much-needed benefits stopped, while others have been sanctioned without due process and left with absolutely no income for weeks.
Then there is the controversial ‘two-child policy’ which limits welfare benefits to people who have more than two children. Rape victims can get an exemption from that rule – but they have to prove that they conceived the child as a consequence of rape.
Recently, I was tasked with writing workshops with a parents group to share stories of people living in poverty at a conference in Belfast to raise awareness and tackle these false narratives about people on benefits.
I worked with women who have been through some of the darkest times imaginable because they are living in areas of deprivation, with some battling custody of children, addiction, illness or violence – all while trying to provide for their children from meagre benefits.
After presenting the stories, I was told by the organisers that the women’s stories didn’t ‘relate to the subject of poverty’. They had previously referenced ‘I, Daniel Blake’, where the protagonist has worked all his life and due to illness had to sign on.
There was ignorance of the nuances of poverty and to the circumstances that propel people into it. They’re not the narratives we want to hear.
Advertisement
Dehumanising the ‘other’
I’m currently working with a group of people seeking asylum in Northern Ireland.
Their circumstances are unimaginable. Talking to asylum seekers – especially to those with children – I’m in awe of their resilience in the face of a brutal system.
Brexit gave further permission to the negative narratives around immigrants and asylum seekers, allowing us again to justify cruelty to another human being in defence of our quality of life.
The narrative tells us we can strip some people of their humanity – they are the ‘other’.
This narrative then gives permission for cruel legislation, for racist attacks, for violence, for dehumanising men, women and children to a label, to severe stress, to violence, to starvation and destitution.
In working with asylum seekers to share their stories, we debated those stories, including the fact that one of them smokes and can’t afford tobacco on the £37 a week income they are expected to live on.
Will highlighting his story undermine our argument? Will people say, ‘Well you shouldn’t be spending your money on tobacco?’
Even though for him, living in a foreign country with no family and in a highly stressful situation, having a smoke is the only small joy in his life.
Is he undeserving?
Removed
For my new play, Removed, I had the privilege of working with young people with care experience, to hear their stories and mainstage them.
The recurring theme was the young people thinking they had done something bad to be removed from their families and placed in care.
How do our assumptions about who is ‘deserving’ facilitate us to ignore the plight of some care leavers and to create a system that may not serve them but instead reinforces to them that they are bad?
When we are presented with a young person with care experience who has been through extraordinarily difficult times, but they’re not the ‘Annie’ we have in our heads, how do we really respond?
The young people I interviewed were building their lives having suffered great trauma, but also having to continually battle against other people’s perceptions and judgements about them.
And it is a battle. One that makes their lives incredibly difficult on top of everything else they are going through.
It feels to me that there is now a sense of people becoming aware of it – in wider debates around victims of rape and women seeking abortions.
We are possibly moving towards a place where we are ready to ask ourselves why we want the perfect victims and situations, in order for us to sanction people in desperate circumstances with our support?
Fionnuala Kennedy is the author of Removed a new play inspired by interviews with young people growing up in care in Northern Ireland, created by Prime Cut Productions in collaboration Voice Of Young People In Care and in association with Young at Art.
Removedis currently running in the Belfast Children’s Festival until Saturday 16 March 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-brexit-extension-4550531-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Mar 2019
TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said there is a lot is concern among EU member states about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50, as the British Prime Minister Theresa May is on the cusp of asking to delay the date by which Brexit must happen, currently set for 29 March.
His comments come after the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that EU member states should prepare for a no-deal Brexit.
If MPs vote for Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal this week, May said that she would ask for an extension to Article 50, and delay the Brexit date by three months until 30 June.
But to do this, the UK must get the permission of the EU’s 27 countries. EU leaders have said previously that without a clear reason for leaving, the request to push that date out wouldn’t be likely to be accepted by the EU.
Speaking after Cabinet this evening, Coveney said that “there is a lot of concern among EU member states and partners about the prospect of a long extension to Article 50″.
“The disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months or another whatever period of time is something that I think people will need convincing on,” Coveney said.
He said that if there is a request for a long extension, “there will need to be a very persuasive plan” to go with that which would explain why that’s needed and how the UK will use the time to “conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been able to be agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process”.
Coveney also said it has been “very clear” that there is “absolutely no appetite” to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement” from the EU.
Making similar comments ata press conference today, Barnier said: “EU leaders will need a concrete plan from the UK in order to be able to make an informed decision.”
He added that the “key questions” for the EU would be:

He added that the political declaration could be made “more ambitious” if a majority in the House of Commons wanted that.
If the reason for an extension is neither of the above, Barnier asked what the purpose would be: “…How can we ensure that, at the end of a possible extension, we are not back in the same situation as today?”
Coveney also warned that “it’s important that the British government gets the message from EU countries that while … there is an openness to an extension of Article 50 that EU leaders will be demanding in the context of a persuasive plan to accompany that extension”.
He said this is to ensure “we can all move forward with some confidence that the outstanding issues relating to the Brexit process can be resolved”.
Barnier said that the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of the EU’s 27 countries and is due to convene this Thursday and Friday, will need to assess what is in the best interest of the EU.
“Voting against a no-deal does not prevent it from happening,” he continued, adding that it was “for the British government to decide what the UK wants to do next”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with European Council President Donald Tusk at Government Buildings in Dublin this morning; meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney is in Brussels and has held meetings with UK Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Michel Barnier, among others.

https://www.the42.ie/naas-cbs-hogan-cup-semi-final-ps-corca-dhuibhne-4553113-Mar2019/,"Kevin O’Brien reports from Parnell Park
NAAS CBS ARE adamant they will not be playing the Hogan Cup semi-final against Pobalscoil Corca Dhuibhne on Saturday.
They became the first school from Kildare to string together back-to-back Leinster Post Primary Schools A titles last night,beating Wicklow Schools by 2-12 to 1-9 after extra-time in the decider at Parnell Park.
Naas CBS were already into the All-Ireland semi-finals as combined schools cannot advance to the Hogan Cup phase of the competition, but goals from Alex Beirne and Harry Carroll saw the Kildare side retain the Br Bosco Cup in style.
Croke Park have fixed the last four clash against the Kerry side for Saturday, giving Naas CBS just two days to recover from a taxing 80-minute provincial final.
Their Leinster semi-final against Colaiste Eoin was delayed due to the Stillorgan school’s run to the Leinster A hurling final, which they lost to St Kieran’s College.
Naas CBS manager Ronan Joyce said after the game he’s confident “common sense prevails” and the semi-final will be re-fixed for next Wednesday night.
“We won’t be playing this Saturday,” said Joyce.
“We got confirmation yesterday the match was supposed to be Saturday but Leinster GAA assured us after we facilitated Colaiste Eoin in fixtures that it was going to be next Wednesday and that’s when we’re playing, next Wednesday.
“It’s not possible. We’ve played fixtures as they have been all year and we won’t be playing this Saturday. It’s just not possible. I’m hoping common sense prevails but we won’t be playing this Saturday.
“We’ve played all the fixtures during the year so we’ve done absolutely nothing wrong,” he continued.
“We facilitated Colaiste Eoin in the hurling. They wouldn’t play within five days of games, so we’re not playing within three days.”

They’re the latest team to stand up to the GAA’s fixture makers in recent times.
Last summer, Kevin McStay was affirmative in his stance that Roscommon’s provincial SFC final against Galway would be played at Dr Hyde Park, despite the Connacht Council’s initial decision that the venue posed problems on health and safety grounds.
Roscommon won their fight to host the final. Then in June came the nuclear ‘Newbridge or Nowhere’ stand-off between Cian O’Neill’s Kildare and the Association.
The GAA, after fixing the qualifier tie for Croke Park, eventually bowed to public pressure and allowed Kildare host the game at St Conleth’s Park.
Former Waterford boss Derek McGrath admitted earlier this month he “wasn’t forceful enough” in trying secure Walsh Park as the Deise’s home venue for the 2018 Munster SHC.
They were forced to travel for the entire round robin series and subsequently bowed out at the provincial stage.
But new Waterford manager Paraic Fanning insisted Walsh Park would host their games this summer and the Munster Council later confirmed the venue was fit to cater for their home ties against Clare and Limerick.
Last Wednesday week, a farcical situation took place in the All-Ireland Freshers 1 hurling final where the game was not played after UL took umbrage to the late change of venue.
Mary Immaculate College was to host the final but Croke Park bosses decided earlier in the week they would to toss for home advantage, which LIT won. UL indicated they would be lining out at the original venue at Mary I, so both sides togged out at different pitches and no match was played.
The outcome of the all-Limerick decider is now likely to be decided in the board room.
And now Naas CBS are keen to give their players at least a week to prepare for the biggest game of their season.
The GAA have yet to officially announce any change in date for the Hogan Cup semi-final, but Joyce remains confident the game will be moved.

“We’re playing in the seven-day rule and that’s it,” he stated.
“It was Leinster GAA and Croke Park. There was a bit of a mix-up in communications so I’m hoping common sense prevails.”
The fall-out shouldn’t take away from Naas CBS’s remarkable achievement in winning successive Leinster A titles after only moving up to the grade.
“It just proves the talent that’s in that group and the group last year. I’m just over the moon for them to be honest. They’ve put in savage work.
“We made hard work of it but it’s about getting results at the end of the day. You come to finals to get results and I’m just delighted. Delighted for the lads because they put in savage work.
Naas CBS conceded 1-1 after the 58th minute as Wicklow Schools forced extra-time last night, but their superior fitness levels told in the extra 20 minutes.
“Look in a Leinster final you have to play to the final whistle,” said Joyce.
“There’s going to be no inch given towards the end, it was backs to the wall and the ball came back off the crossbar and a goal came off it.
“We pulled up a small bit short but a super extra-time to win it and the lads showed the character at the end to get through.
“We showed the work we put in all year. Extra-time is really about character and how much you can get out of yourself. The lads just put everything into it, they dug really deep and thankfully it came off.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/tusla-scouting-ireland-2-4538983-Mar2019/,"TUSLA HAS DENIED trying to close down Scouting Ireland “in one fell swoop” with a letter sent to the organisation last month.
The letter in question was sent to Scouting Ireland CEO John Lawlor on 18 February and later made public by Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone.
It said parents should seek assurances that no overnight scouting trips take place without adequate numbers of trained supervisors.
In the letter, the Child and Family Agency also called for an “urgent review” into the manner in which Scouting Ireland manages child protection concerns and disclosures, and questioned the current viability of overnight trips.
The letter was sent on foot of an investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of hundreds of children who were members of Scouting Ireland.
Most cases date between the 1960s and 1980s, although there may be one from an earlier period. The Irish Times, which first reported the allegations, has said there are over 300 alleged victims and over 200 alleged abusers.
In a statementissued about the letterlast month, Scouting Ireland said: “It would be helpful to understand what evidence Tusla has for suggesting that ‘Scouting Ireland should consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips.
“Overnight trips and the experience of camping outside at night is an experience every scout should have the opportunity to enjoy and we have a strong policy framework in place to support this activity in Scouting Ireland.”
Representatives from Tusla were questioned about the letter’s impact when appearing before the Oireachtas Children’s Committee today.
‘Devastating’
Labour TD Seán Sherlock said the line in the letter regarding overnight trips was “explosive”, asking: “Did Tusla have any sense of the hurt, the shock, that would cause when it went into the public domain?”
Sherlock said parents and other volunteers who have gone through garda vetting and undertaken training about safeguarding children were deeply hurt by the tone of the letter. He said the correspondence could have possibly led to the “closing down an organisation in one fell swoop”.

“It was devastating to the thousands of innocent and decent people who give hours and hours of their time, who dedicate themselves to this lifestyle,” he added.

Tusla’s CEO Pat Smyth said the State body never intended for the letter to end up in the public domain. He said the letter ultimately dealt with “identifying practice issues and the need to improve those practice issues”.
‘Knee-jerk reaction’
Tusla’s COO Jim Gibson added that the organisation never set out to attack Scouting Ireland. He said the letter was not a “knee-jerk reaction,” adding that such a reaction “happened elsewhere”.
He noted that one of the eight recommendations made by Tusla last month references the need for “an immediate review of the supervision of children” involved in Scouting Ireland.
Another recommendation notes that Scouting Ireland “should consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips given the concerns outlined”.
Gibson said this review will “look at overnight camping trips and what measures are in place” to protect children as well as any changes that may need to be made. He agreed that there were no issues with the vast majority of volunteers, many of whom are parents.

Gibson said last week’s meeting was an “open discussion”, adding: “We don’t get business done by having a dog fight, we want to work with [Scouting Ireland] and assist them in becoming compliant.”
The other recommendations made by Tusla in February were as follows:
The Action Plan for Scouting Ireland – agreed with Tusla at a meeting last week – includes the following recommendations:
Speaking about the helplines set up to field people’s concerns about the abuse allegations, Tusla’s Service Director Linda Creamer said the initial helpline set up by Scouting Ireland received 43 calls before being disbanded before Christmas due to lack of use.

A new helpline set up by Tusla has received 23 calls in recent weeks.
Creamer said a review will be carried out into whether it’s “independence enough” for people involved with Scouting Ireland to field such calls. She said there has been “full cooperation” between Tusla and Scouting Ireland in this regard.
Representatives from Scouting Ireland are set to appear before the committee later today.

The law makes it compulsory for children in pre-school education to be vaccinated against 10 diseases, includingmeasles, tetanus and polio. Parents in Italy, as in a number of other countries, face fines for not vaccinating their children.

There has been a huge spike in measles cases worldwide, including a number ofoutbreaks in Ireland. People who can’t be vaccinated for health reasons rely on herd immunity – the people around them being vaccinated to prevent the spread of diseases.
One of the reasons behind parents not vaccinating their children is an erroneous claim which links the MMR vaccine to autism – this claim has been debunked by medical experts.

https://www.the42.ie/katie-taylor-33-4531084-Mar2019/,"AMONG THE CONCERNS when Katie Taylor turned professional in the autumn of 2016 was that she was entering an industry which in its perpetually evident nefariousness was completely at odds with her values.
Two and a half years on, Taylor is by a considerable margin the most valuable entity in a women’s professional boxing scene which is all the more healthy for her presence: Taylor earns more money per fight than any other female pugilist, and her opponents earn more to face her than they ever have previously. Many of them have earned more against Taylor than they have for their previous outings combined.
Taylor, alongside her youngerAmerican contemporary Claressa Shields, has created the tide upon which all boats have risen. But it hasn’t all been plain sailing.
It was originally hoped that WBA and IBF lightweight world champion Taylor would face WBO titleholder Rose Volante in a unification clash in December, but the Brazilian’s team steered their woman off Taylor’s course.
A press conference at The County Club in Dunshaughlin afterTaylor imperiously retained her titlesin a tasty scrap with former amateur rival Eva Wahlstrom — a world-class and world-champion alternative opponent, but still an alternative — was called with the intention of confirming a clash with Volante in the presence of Taylor’s home press.
Best laid plans and all that: ‘Queen Rose’s representatives declined a six-figure offer worth 10 times more than her previous career-highest purse, and it suddenly seemed likely that Taylor’s pursuit of the undisputed title would be derailed by those pesky boxing ‘politics’ to which so many cautiously referred when she joined the punch-for-pay ranks post-Rio.
Taylor’s team of Brian Peters and Eddie Hearn seriously considered going down another route — one which would see Irish icon forego her dream of cleaning out the 135-pound division and instead fulfil another by diving straight into a sequence of match-ups with fellow pound-for-pound contenders. There was a cognisance, however, that these impending superfights would be somewhat less super, and in turn less lucrative, if Taylor went into them without having first become the undisputed ruler at lightweight.
And so the purse strings were loosened slightly, a few more strings were pulled, and finally, Taylor v Volante was a go for Philadelphia on St Patrick’s weekend, the ‘road to undisputed’ repaved.
“I was delighted when the fight was actually confirmed,” Taylor tellsThe42. “It’s a fight I’ve wanted for a long time. I guess she was holding out, looking for more money and things like that — the business side of things was holding it up a small bit.
“Training camp has gone great for this fight. I know I say that before every single fight”, she laughs, “but I really am feeling good and sharp ahead of this one.
“It’s a huge chance for me — a chance to unify the division once again, and a chance to take that step closer to becoming undisputed champion.
“This could be a huge year for me, and there are big, big fights out there for me, but I have to get past Rose Volante for those big fights to happen.

“It is definitely frustrating at times when the fights aren’t happening when I want them to happen”, Taylor adds, “but I do realise there is a business to professional boxing as well.
“But I also know that theyaregoing to happen — I’ve just got to be patient. Thankfully, Brian [Peters] kind of looks after that side of things.

“The Rose Volante fight didn’t happen when we wanted it in December, but we got a super replacement in Eva Wahlstrom — we couldn’t have had a better opponent, really. I think Eva said herself that it was the biggest fight in women’s boxing at that time; we both came into the fight as undefeated champions, fighting at Madison Square Garden. So I still got a huge fight even when the fight I wanted didn’t quite come together at the time.”
Adds manager Peters: “We had a plan: we wanted the WBO belt, all going well, and then we’d move onto Delfine Persoon for the WBC.
Manager Brian Peters knows future 'superfights' will be all the more super for Taylor holding all four major lightweight belts.Bryan Keane / INPHOBryan Keane / INPHO / INPHO
“That’s why I was so anxious to get this fight,” Peters continues. “We negotiated with Rose Volante, she wanted to get a few defences in first so she could earn more money to fight Katie — and listen, she’s dead right.
“But obviously she’s crucial to Katie’s plan of being undisputed champion, all going well, by the middle of the summer. And from there, we can look at real superfights.”
A showdown with rival Serrano and a meeting a fight or two further down the line with undisputed welterweight world champion Cecilia Braekhus are not dead certs — not least in Taylor’s eyes, which are fixed firmly on Philly next Friday.
But should they come to fruition, they will likely see her pocket high-six- and seven-figure sums respectively, a feat of earning unprecedented in women’s boxing and one that 99.9% of pro boxers — male or female — can only dream of.
There still exists a squeamish concern among casual followers in Ireland that ‘our lovely girl’ is swimming with sharks — that nobody as nice as Taylor can expect to escape a business as nasty as boxing without having first been skinned alive.
Instead, it’s she who is making the killing. And to believe Taylor naive is to sell her short: this is, after all, a woman who has seen plenty of dosh pass through her hands not only via fight purses and multiple high-profile sponsorships, but her commercial firm KT Sports Ltd whose accumulated profits passed the €1.5 million mark in 2017.
She knows her value, and she has surrounded herself with a small, tight-knit team who have thus far succeeded in ensuring she gets every penny of it.
But it would also be wrong to suggest that Taylor is remotely money-driven. A comically off-the-mark BBC article recently stated that she was “willing to give up on her dream of ever boxing in Ireland to pursue a super-fight which could earn her a first $1m purse”.
On that front, Taylor is keen to set the record straight.
“Money is obviously important — this is prizefighting, so you have to earn as much money as you can during your career — but it’s not something that motivates me at all,” she says.
“I’ve said from the start that I want to make history in this sport, I want to leave a great legacy, and that’s why I want the big fights.
“I don’t care how much money I’m making for these fights — I just want the fights, the big fights –”
“She’s only joking, Eddie!” chimes Peters with a chuckle, just in case promoter Hearn catches wind and attempts to shave a zero off her next cheque.
Taylor laughs. “That’s where Brian comes in. He negotiates for me. And it’s great to be getting those big purses but it’s really not something that I’ve ever focused on.

“So it’s not even something that was on my mind. I boxed for years and years as an amateur fighter. I wanted to do the same thing — leave a great legacy and make history — and now I’m trying to do the same in professional boxing. I want to make history and be the best fighter that I can, regardless of how much money I’m making.

Equally, what will never motivate Taylor is the need to prove wrong naysayers, or those who, almost per fight at this stage, will find a means of discrediting her opponents or the women’s code generally.
If she has her arm raised over Volante’s next Friday, those critics will begin to run out of road.
Delfine Persoon is a formidable challenge by anyone’s standards; Amanda Serrano is a seven-weight world champion and legitimate knockout artist; Cecilia Braekhus is an undefeated, undisputed champion. Beyond them — if Taylor can get beyond them — Olympians Mikaela Mayer and Taylor’s Rio successor, Estelle Mossely, lie in wait.
There’ll doubtless be a few more edgy columns written between now and the bona fide ‘big ones’ in June and further down the line. Taylor is unlikely to read them, nor will she use them as fuel beyond the fireplace.
“To be honest with you, I think I’m well used to it. Even during my amateur days, there were still people who never gave me the credit — even when I was coming back with World Championship gold medals.
“So I am very, very used to that, and I don’t take too much notice of it.
“That’s all that matters, really. The real boxing purists know exactly what’s happening, and I don’t really take much notice of anyone else. I’m not out here to impress those kinds of people.”

“Like, some of these other champions that these people are criticising are getting hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight Katie,” adds Peters. “Katie herself is obviously getting more than them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rte-public-funding-2-4523166-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR was told by one of his officials that ”radical re-thinking” of RTÉ’s role might be needed to address its chronic deficits – rather than constant rises in its public funding.
Meanwhile, the State broadcaster may struggle to further stem its losses after only 160 staff put their hands up for a redundancy programme – around 100 fewer than it had targeted with the scheme.
Records released toTheJournal.ieshow that RTÉ courted senior government figures in a series of meetings to discuss the organisation’s funding in the lead-up to last year’s budget.
They included a meeting between Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the broadcaster’s director general, Dee Forbes, in September.
A few days later she also met with Department of Communications director general Mark Griffin, while on 1 October Forbes met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
Just over a week later, RTÉ got a boost in Budget 2019 when it was allocated extra funding worth €8.6 million per year.
That included €5 million from increasing the amount RTÉ was paid by the government for free TV licences issued as part of welfare packages and another €3.6 million from licence fee collections that had previously gone to TG4, which had its direct exchequer funding increased.
The State broadcaster recorded a funding deficit of €6.4 million last year, although that was down on the €19.4 million loss it delivered in 2016.
Its total revenue increased slightly thanks to an increase in licence fee income, offsetting a €6.7 million drop in its commercial revenues.

‘Radical re-thinking’
An internal briefing note prepared for Varadkar in advance of his meeting with Forbes and RTÉ chair Moya Doherty said that the broadcaster had “undertaken a number of measures to address its budgetary situation”.
“However, it is clear that trends such as growing international competitions, shift of advertisers to digital platforms and (an) increasing number of ‘no TV’ homes makes RTÉ’s financial position very perilous,” it added.
The document, obtained under freedom of information laws, noted that RTÉ’s five-year strategy, launched last year, was dependent on “a substantial increase in funding”.
“It might be argued that a more radical re-thinking of RTÉ’s role in the digital era is required rather than just relying on further incremental increases in public funding,” the note added.
The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland last year recommended a minimum of€30 million in extra annual fundingbe granted to RTÉ.
Meanwhile, in August 2017 RTÉ said itwas looking for 250 redundanciesto help reduce its funding deficit – although a staff member reported at the time that the organisation would take 300 jobs cuts “if that was available”.
However Varadkar’s briefing documents said that only 150 staff had “availed” of the “voluntary exit program” to date.
An RTÉ spokesman said the number of staff who had taken redundancy packages had since increased to 160. He added that the organisation “continues to carefully manage its cost base” but it had no intention to introduce forced redundancies to meet the target.
The redundancy scheme was funded with the broadcaster’s €107.5 million Donnybrook land sale to developer Cairn Homes, which was also going towards repaying debts and investing in facilities.
Nearly €30 million was set aside for the redundancies and related costs in RTÉ’s 2017 accounts.
The broadcaster recently warned that its “precarious” financial position was likely to take another hitif the UK crashed out of the EUlater this month as a no-deal Brexit would further reduce its advertising income.
A government working group is reviewing the current licence fee regime – including whether it should be replaced with a new charge – and is due to deliver its report later this month.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-extension-4555186-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Mar 2019
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL has agreed to delay Brexit until 22 May if British MPs back Theresa May’s deal next week.
The decision wasannounced last nightbut has some stipulations.
If the UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement – a deal it has already rejected twice – the new deadline would be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward before that date.
The UK would then face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or exiting the European Union without a deal.
The May deadline was unanimously agreed upon by the other 27 leaders of the European Union’s member states following discussions in Brussels yesterday.
Britain was due to officially leave the EU on 29 March, just a week from now, and May had requested an extension until 30 June.
Speaking at a press conference last night, President of the European Council Donald Tusk said Britain now has four options: a deal, no deal, a long delay or revoking Article 50.
“The 12th of April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European Parliament elections. If it has not decided to do so by then, the option of long extension will automatically become impossible,” Tusk said.
At the same press conference, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU is ready for all outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit.

Juncker says they've tried everything to get this deal over the finishing line.pic.twitter.com/P6KJ5f5tdt
May insisted at a press conference after the announcement that Brexit will still happen.
She welcomed the brief extension agreed by the EU, saying: “I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.”
About 2.5 million people have to date signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched on Wednesday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
May has consistently said she will not revoke Article 50.
No hard border
Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the extension avoids “a cliffedge” next week, adding that “nobody wants a no-deal scenario”.

She said the political situation in the UK is “quite chaotic and likely to change any given day” but that the deal may still be backed by MPs.
McEntee reiterated Europe’s stance that negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement are “not for reopening”.
She said she doesn’t want to preempt what will happen in the House of Commons next week but noted that if MPs don’t back the deal, the UK needs to present other options before 12 April.
“It is on that date that the UK has to signal whether or not they’re running in the European elections,” she noted, adding that Britain must then “set out very clearly what it is that they want to do and how they want to move forward”.
McEntee said the Irish government is committed to avoiding a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit and will work with the UK and the European Commission to make sure this situation doesn’t come to pass.
‘Constitutional crisis’
Negotiations are ongoing behind the scenes in a bid to get MPs to back May’s deal. This uphill battle may have been made even steeper after May hit out at MPs for not backing her to date in a televised speech on Wednesday night.
“MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, we will not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me,” May said.
Her speech was sharply criticised by many MPs, from across the political divide, who viewed it as anattempt to shift blamefor the ongoing crisis from herself to others.
Conservative Sam Gyimah said “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.
Describing her speech as “incendiary and irresponsible”, Labour MP Wes Streeting said May would be partly responsible “if any harm comes to us”, noting that MPs have been subjected “credible” death threats.
I’ve thought long and hard before saying this, but@theresa_mayknows that MPs across the House are subjected to death threats - some very credible. Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible. If any harm comes to any of us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.— Wes Streeting (@wesstreeting)March 20, 2019Wes Streeting MP/ Twitter

Asked at last night’s press conference if she would apologise for her comments, May said she understands that MPs are frustrated, saying so is she.
“There are passionately held views on all sides of the argument,” she noted, adding that the House of Commons now has a “clear choice” between an “orderly” Brexit and a no-deal scenario.
She said the idea of Britain taking part in the European elections while still preparing to leave the EU would focus people’s minds, adding: “I think the choice is clear for people.”
Earlier this week doubt was cast on over whether or not the House of Commons would actually vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
On Monday, John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland claimed the UK was facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the deal – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Justin Trudeau has denied accusations of “inappropriate” meddling in the prosecution of a corporate giant but did not apologise over the scandal.
Facing calls to resign, Trudeau addressed the allegations news conference today in Ottawa, saying he had learned “lessons” from the crisis but denying any wrongdoing.
Trudeau’s inner circle is accused of pressuring his former attorney general to shield Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial.
The case has already triggered the resignation of Trudeau’s right-hand man and two cabinet ministers, with support for the prime minister and his Liberals falling for the first time behind the opposition Tories – seven months from a general election.

Addressing the media today, the 47-year-old Trudeau acknowledged that he raised the pending trial during a meeting last September with then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – whose resignation sparked the crisis. Trudeau said that they discussed its possible impact on jobs in his Montreal electoral base.
“But this comment was not partisan in nature,” the prime minister said today.
During days of testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said she experienced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Trudeau’s inner circle to interfere in the case, including “veiled threats”.
“There was no inappropriate pressure,” said Trudeau, who has stood by his previous claim he made clear to Wilson-Raybould that any decision was hers alone.
‘Erosion of trust’
Trudeau did take some responsibility for the breakdown in relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first indigenous attorney general.
She claims she was ousted from the justice ministry over the case and quit the government last month.

“As we look over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,” the prime minister said today.
“I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister, I should have been,” he said, vowing to “do better next time.”
But he added that Wilson-Raybould should have been more forthcoming with her concerns. “She did not come to me and I wish she had,” he said.
Rejecting Trudeau’s account this afternoon, opposition leader Andrew Scheer told a news conference in Toronto that “the erosion of trust has been between Justin Trudeau and Canadians”.
“It’s now beyond dispute that he and his office bullied and threatened Ms Wilson-Raybould to get her to let SNC-Lavalin off the hook (and) when she resisted the attempts he fired her,” Scheer said.
The Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged with corruption four years ago for allegedly paying $47 million (€31 million) in bribes between 2001 and 2011 to secure Libyan government contracts under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi and of defrauding the Libyan government.","10.47pm, 7 Mar 2019",

TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will meet with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley after she said that killings by military and police forces during the Troubles “were not crimes”.
Coveney is to meet with Bradley in London this evening and will seek a clarification of the comments, which have been criticised by Sinn Féin as “outrageous and offensive”.
In a statement released this evening, a spokesperson for Coveney said that the position of the Irish government “is clear”.
“The Irish government has been clear that it would not support any proposal to introduce such a measure, for state or non-state actors,” the statement added.
During a House of Commons debate, the DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly said that “well over 90% of the murders and injuries” caused during the Troubles in Northern Ireland were caused by acts of terrorism.
Bradley agreed with those figures, which she said were “set out very powerfully”.
“They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way.”
Later this afternoon, Bradley clarified her comments saying that she wasn’t referring to any specific cases, but was simply “expressing a general view”.

“Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated, whoever is responsible. These are of course matters for police and prosecuting authorities, who are independent of government.”
The statement comes after media reports indicated thatfour ex-British soldierscould be charged with the 1972 shooting of unarmed marchers in Derry, known as Bloody Sunday.
Former foreign secretary and BrexiteerBoris Johnsonthen wrote a lengthy opinion piece on the topic, where he claimed that there would be “a storm of utter fury” if the four men were charged next week.
In 2010, the then-British Prime Minister David Cameron issued an apology to the people and families who suffered due to the Bloody Sunday killings.
ReactionSinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said the comments were “outrageous and offensive”.
“Karen Bradley’s comments also show contempt for the legal system, including ongoing court cases into legacy cases involving the British state and its forces.
“British politicians cannot be allowed to ride roughshod over the legal system.”
She called for the comments to be withdrawn.
SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the comments were “absolutely appalling”.
“Such comments, albeit always wrong, are particularly insensitive given the Bloody Sunday families await news on whether former British soldiers will be prosecuted for murdering 14 innocent civilians on the streets of Derry.
He said that Bradley should apologise to families of state violence, “as well as setting aside time to read a book on the history of Ireland”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/beto-orourke-announces-presidency-4541221-Mar2019/,"BETO O’ROURKE, the popular former congressman who rose to political stardom last year, has formally announced that he’s running for president of the United States.
The 46-year-old ended months of speculation by finally revealing that he will seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination today.
Until he challenged Republican Senator Ted Cruz last year, O’Rourke was little known outside his hometown of El Paso, Texas. But the former punk rocker became a sensation by running a social media savvy campaign that used grassroots organising to mobilise young voters and minorities.
He got within 3 percentage points of upsetting Cruz in the nation’s staunchest Republican state. Crucially for the presidential race, he also shattered national fundraising records in the process.
Now O’Rourke must prove whether the energy he brought to the Texas campaign will resonate on the national stage. Despite the enthusiasm associated with his candidacy, the former three-term congressman has little track record in domestic or foreign policy.

He’s also entering a field that has been celebrated for its diverse roster of women and people and colour. There are now 15 confirmed candidates for the Democratic nomination and another handful who are said to be considering a bid.
“This is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us, that seeks to unite a very divided country,” O’Rourke said in a video announcement with his wife on a couch. “We saw the power of this in Texas.”

O’Rourke joins a large and unsettled 2020 field in which his fundraising prowess, bipartisan optimism and anti-establishment attitude could quickly make him a political force.
His lack of governing experience could hurt, but President Donald Trump’s shock win in 2016 suggests that the US electorate is not afraid to select a charismatic outsider.

https://www.the42.ie/seamus-darby-laochra-gael-2-4523939-Mar2019/,"“WHAT HAS THE game come to?” chuckled Martin Tyler as Roberto Firmino gently returned the child with whom he agreed to be photographed during the second half of the Merseyside derby on Sky Sports.
Hours later, after Mario Balotelli had Instagrammed his goal celebration for Marseille, the fatalists could tell Tyler at which point the game currently is: it’s gone, mate.
TV Wrapdisagrees: the game ‘went’ a long, long time ago.
As elite sport becomes a television show, its main actors largely exist like celebrities and are treated like spectacles, as something to be filmed and photographed.
Balotelli turning his back to the crowd to film himself shows how happily complicit some players are in becoming so, but it suits much of the public too: by making celebrities out of our sports people it becomes easier to hijack their lives for our own benefit.
The absurdity of celebrity was the central theme of last week’s installment of TG4’sLaochra Gaelseries. It focused on the life of Seamus Darby, he of the “sensation of sensations” – the goal which detonated a Kingdom’s five-in-a-row expectations and instantly became one of the most iconic moments in the history of the GAA.
The problem with on-the-spot myth-making, however, is it demands a hero frozen in time. How to keep on living?
So while the founding premise of theLaochra Gaelseries is that there is no Irish landscape too sparse for dreaming, this episode carried with it the twist that the same land’s fruits in laurel can be too rich.
eir GAA/ YouTube
“The goal that turned my life into a nightmare” read a newspaper headline as Darby reflected on the aftermath of the goal.
Advertisement
He was, as Vincent Hogan of the Irish Independent testified, out five nights a week seven months on from the All-Ireland final; “pulled and dragged everywhere” in the opinion of Kerry’s Sean Walsh.
All the while, his daily life groaned and buckled beneath the weight of his hopping from one function to another.
After a decision to gamble his security on a pub in Borrisokane backfired, Darby left for London. His marriage dissolved and he ended up sleeping fully clothed beneath a radiator in a disused pub.
Darby testifies that he is happy with his lot right now, and has returned to Ireland after what his brother Stephen said was a kind of necessary exile.
Narrator Brian Tyers asserted that Darby’s goal “was no longer the property of the man who scored it”, but the same could be said of Darby himself in those frenetic months after the All-Ireland final, as he willfully became the property of just about everybody else.
The final word goes to Vincent Hogan, who meditates on the enduring message of the Darby goal.
“For GAA people everywhere, it was that Cinderella moment…that you have that shot. Like a boxer with a puncher’s chance. And that’s what sustains the unheralded in the GAA, that you have that puncher’s chance.”
Laochra Gaelasked another question: what are we all doing to the puncher?
One man who is unlikely to ever become tangled in someone else’s story is is Jerry Kiernan, the Kerryman who has steadfastly ignored convention to the point that he has spent a slice of the last quarter-century having a pop at the GAA.
That RTÉ carried live coverage of the European Indoor Athletics championships meant that our weekend was elevated by the presence of Kiernan, otherwise known as the RTÉ athletics analyst who didn’t have a long and meandering anecdotedenounced as “rubbish” by Vincent Browne.
It is one of the enduring realities of Irish broadcasting – like the fact TG4’s GAA coverage must always be underrated, (regardless of the deluge of recent rating), and that RTÉ One is always either showingErin BrockovichorPretty Woman– that Kiernan isn’t on television nearly enough.

Jerry Kiernan.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
Nonetheless, when RTÉ shows the bit of athletics it permits us a look into Jerry Kiernan’s world, arriving as he does like a wise traveller from another world.
His is a world of meritocracy and precision, in which even time is measured differently. “One-tenth of a second is a lot of time, Peter”, as he explained to an audience more used to hearing that a week’s a long time in politics.
His depth of knowledge is extraordinary, yet it is delivered in such a way as to never feel overwhelming. With Kiernan, nothing ever feels inessential: if someone ran a 52.70 in Gent three weeks ago, it is of no doubt of huge importance to whatever we are about to see.
His is a kind of grudging but no-less sincere patriotism, which eventually triumphs over his passion for the sport.
Looking back at Mark English’s medal-winning race, he couldn’t help but be disappointed in Bosnian runner Amel Tuka.
“It’s disappointing for Tuka…but we don’t care.”
Kiernan is a rare example in televised sport in that he is utterly and entirely himself.
And in these days of falsity and celebrity…that’s a revolutionary act.

https://www.the42.ie/jordan-larmour-ireland-france-4533728-Mar2019/,"Ryan Bailey reports from the Aviva Stadium
AS THE WIND swirled and heavens opened during Ireland’s warm-up, you wondered how difficult an afternoon Jordan Larmour — drafted into the starting XV after Rob Kearney’s late withdrawal — was in for at fullback.
It underlines the trust Joe Schmidt has in the 21-year-old that he had no reservation in dropping him in at the last minute, but even still, the loss of Kearney’s experience and defensive stability in such conditions was a setback.
Larmour made a darting second-half break.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
Larmour’s last starting appearance, against Argentina back in November, exposed his vulnerability under the high ball, so even considering his obvious talent in possession, this was a stern appraisal of his credentials as an international fullback.
Told on Sunday morning he would be making his first Six Nations start aftercalf tightness ruled Kearney out, Larmour clearly embraced his opportunity, producing a positive first involvement with an excellent kick into space behind the blue shirts. From there, Ireland struck through captain Rory Best.
It was an early settler for the Leinster fullback and while there was a difficult moment in the air against Damien Penaud, when a knock-on spared Larmour and Ireland on this near side, he grew into the game as it progressed. At times, he had the crowd on their feet.
One of the strengths of Kearney’s game is his communication with the back three and his management of the backfield, but Larmour showed he is growing into this role with some intelligent and mature link-up play with Keith Earls and Jacob Stockdale, while using his pace to cover the large swathes of grass in his jurisdiction.
Advertisement
Granted, Ireland’s dominance in the possession and territory stakes, particularly in the first period, meant Larmour wasn’t pressed into defensive duty as much as expected, but he was able to slot in seamlessly.
With ball in hand, the former St Andrew’s man is a lethal threat while Ireland used him very cleverly during the opening 40, the fullback regularly running decoy lines to confuse the French defence, notably for Johnny Sexton’s try.
Then, in the second half, a glimpse of Larmour’s superb broken-field running ability, the Leinster flyer scything through the heart of the French defence, ducking and weaving his way through before being smothered by Mathieu Bastareaud just as he set his eyes upon a first home try.
This capacity to come into the line and jink and step his way through opposition defences, leaving four French defenders for dead, before turning on the afterburners to speed through not only adds to Ireland’s attacking armoury, but compliments the strike runners in Earls and Stockdale on either side.
He could, perhaps, have taken a more direct route to the line rather than take another step in this instance, but Schmidt was understandably pleased with how his fullback performed upon his promotion to the starting XV.
“Well his first involvement was special, wasn’t it?” the Ireland head coach smiled.
Larmour celebrates Sexton's try.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
“Finding that space into the corner, forcing Damien Penaud to put that ball into touch after the kick receive. I thought that was super and I’m sure that gave him a spring in his step, that his first involvement was positive.
“On the back of that, he built a number of other good positive involvements. He was probably a little bit lucky that Penaud knocked the ball on from the cross-kick and that’s one of the things as a fullback, he’s still learning to get into the right position at the right time.”
Overall, it was a hugely positive afternoon for Larmour, who will no doubt take great confidence from another assured performance on the international stage, as he made 10 breaks across 76 metres, beating nine defenders.

“When he scythed through the middle of their midfield defence, he is freakishly good on his feet,” the Kiwi continued.
“I thought he was going to work his way back up the pitch at one stage to make sure he beat everyone. He’s probably learning a bit from that, to get through and step and go, as oppose to step and step and maybe step again.
“I thought he linked well with the back three, he brought the ball back and linked. I thought it was a really good performance from Jordan in a real pressure cooker.
“Yesterday, he’s not starting, Rob is starting and this morning he gets told the calf is still tight, it’s you, young fella, you’re up at number 15. He virtually rubbed his hands together and said, ‘thanks, I’m delighted.’”
As always, there will be work-ons as Ireland turn their attention to Wales next weekend — he was turned over on the French line in the first half — but this was the exposure Larmour requires to build on the exciting career progress he has made in the last two seasons.
When given the chance, Larmour, with confidence and assurance, seized the opportunity to underline his exciting credentials as Ireland’s long-term fullback. Cap number 12, with the 15 on his back, under his belt, and all the better for it.

A PRIEST WAS stabbed during a livestreamed morning mass today at Saint Joseph’s Oratory in Montreal, the largest church in Canada, police said.
The suspect was arrested at the Roman Catholic basilica shortly after the attack in front of 50 people and a television audience around 8.40 am (12.40pm Irish time), while priest Claude Grou was taken to hospital.
Police told AFP that Grou was “slightly wounded in the upper body” when, according to witnesses cited by authorities, “the suspect suddenly ran up to the priest and attacked him with a knife” while he was officiating the mass.
The suspect was due to be interrogated shortly, while the scene has been cordoned off.

Church spokeswoman Celine Barbeau said Grou, the church’s rector, “was conscious when he left. We are hopeful he will pull through.”
Video of the attack rebroadcast by CTV showed the assailant – a tall man in jeans, a parka and a white baseball cap – chase the priest around the altar and stab him.
Grou falls to the ground, but quickly gets back up and backs away as security officers surround the suspect and detain him until police arrive.
A witness, Adele Plamondon, told public broadcaster Radio-Canada the priest was about to start reading the gospel, when “this man drew a knife and ran up to stab him.”
The suspect “did not shout, didn’t say anything” during the assault, but appeared “very determined,” Plamondon said.

THE METROPOLITAN POLICE have confirmed that one Paris Saint-Germain fan has been arrested in connection with incidents before Thursday’s Women’s Champions League game against Chelsea.
PSG travelled to London for the first leg of their quarter final match against the Blues, with the return match scheduled for 27 March.
The build-up to the game at Kingsmeadow, however, was marred by reports of criminal damage and disorder levelled against a group of the French team’s fans.
Those reports were later confirmed by police sources, who revealed that supporters had carried weapons to the match on board a coach.

“Weapons, including knives and knuckledusters, were recovered along with class A drugs,” a statement released by theMet explained.
“One man from the coach was arrested for possession of class A drugs and the remaining passengers were escorted from the area by police.”
The coach is understood to have travelled from Paris to London overnight carrying the fans, 50 of whom were denied entry to the stadium on Thursday evening.
Reports of vandalism at Kingsmeadow emerged as early as 8pm GMT, including a broken door and pro-PSG graffiti daubed on the walls.
The fans are believed to be part of a PSG ultras group known for their violent behaviour, according to the BBC. The group has already been banned from attending first-team and youth matches of the Ligue 1 side, but no such prohibition is yet in force for the club’s women’s team.
Chelsea and PSG’s clash suffered no delay despite the incidents, with the Blues taking the lead through Hannah Blundell deep into the second half before Erin Cuthbert doubled their advantage in the 88th minute to secure a 2-0 win for Chelsea.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-there-is-a-good-reason-why-nobody-plays-golf-in-manhattan-4525112-Mar2019/,"THE BOROUGH OF Manhattan, an exemplar of efficient land use, is undoubtedly a wonderful place to live or visit.
Architecture that is breathtaking in both aesthetic beauty and as pure feats of engineering, the best of museums and entertainment and some of the most beautiful parks in the world.
You can do almost anything in the Big Apple.
You could spend a lifetime on this relatively small island and fail to exhaust the panoply of activity on offer.
However, no matter how wealthy, powerful or important you are, there is one thing you absolutely cannot do – play a round of golf.
Golf requires a number of things – time, small balls, clubs, implausible clothing and land. A lot of land.
It is therefore logical that where land is in high demand, regardless of how much people would like to play the game, you will have to find somewhere else to swing your sticks.
New York is far from unique.
Cities with a large population and expensive housing do not have golf courses near their centre due to the self-evident inefficiency of that land use.
There is one glaring exception to this rule. An outlier that proudly bucks the trend allowing its citizens, for just a few thousand euros per annum to play 18 holes of golf within walking distance of the city centre.
And, as if not spoiled enough, they have not just one urban course to choose from, but multiple.
Within walking distance of the city centre, three of these courses are also located on high-speed transport links. The state has spent and is planning to spend, billions of euros providing public transport, rail, tram, bus and cycle greenways, that is not only close to these courses but actually abuts their very perimeters.
In case you haven’t realised, this paradise of fairways is the fair city of Dublin.
In the map below – the blue line is the Dart, the light green line is the Luas, the dark green line is the Dodder Greenway, which is under development and the pink line donates the BusConnects rapid bus corridors, which are also under development.

Crazy for golf
A visitor to Dublin would be forgiven for thinking that as a city we are golf crazy.
That every man, women and child must be given a set of clubs at birth and spend every moment of their spare time playing the sport.
What else could possibly explain this unorthodox use of urban land?
In truth, golf is no more popular in Dublin than any other part of the western world.
Advertisement
The large amount of strategically important land given over to the game is simply emblematic of the tragically inefficient use of land in the city.
A consequence of this overall inefficiency is a seemingly insurmountable housing crisis, some of the highest land prices and rents in the world, incredibly long commutes for a significant portion of the population and some of the worst traffic on the planet.
Underground solutions?
A recent study by motor data company Inrix showed that, of all the major cities in the world, only Bogota had congestion that is worse than Dublin.
The solution to this congestion that is often suggested, usually proffered with an air of exasperation that know no-one seems to have thought of it before, is that all Dublin needs to do is simply build an underground system.
But as anyone who has followed the development of our proposed first subterranean train line joining the airport to the city centre will know, there is nothing simple about building an underground.
They also happen to be the most expensive non-military capital projects undertaken by any state.
Billions of euros are required to build, maintain and operate an underground metro and in order to get a decent return on investment you need population density.
Criminally underutilised
We will never rectify these issues unless hard decisions are made.
Maintaining the status quo, continuing with our sclerotic planning laws and allowing the narrow interests of the few to outweigh the greater need of the many will cause Dublin to continue to spill into its neighbouring counties, one three-bed semi-D at a time.
That is not just a waste of time to the commuter but also incredibly damaging to the economy and the environment.
The new Land Development Agency must be given the political backing along with the necessary changes to our restrictive compulsory purchase legislation to free up the massive swaths of this city that are criminally underutilised.
Along with Dublin Port, militarily irrelevant army barracks and the many substantial ill-positioned industrial estates peppered across Dublin, the LDA needs to acquire and make available for high density development the three golf courses that together make up one hundred hectares of land, a full million square metres of urban space, all abutting major public transport infrastructure.
The members of these exclusive clubs would be handsomely compensated and can play in any number of more appropriate locations in the North and South of the county.
Tens of thousands of people could be accommodated preventing future housing crises.
That amount of newly zoned land entering the market, either through sale or lease, would have the critical mass to significantly depress city land prices, the main cost factor preventing current development.
Local politics
The crucial factor here is having local politicians after the local elections in May that will assent to the necessary changes in zoning.
Unfortunately, for those of my colleagues who are seeking re-election, the incentives point the other way.
Doing the right thing in local politics costs you votes. But if we are to ever see an end to crippling rents, extortionate land prices and intractable traffic congestion, with its resultant environment consequences, we need people to live and work on land near to the city and golfers to play in the great wide open, away from it.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has presented US president Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks as part of the annual tradition, as both leaders celebrated the relationship between their countries.
In his speech, Trump welcomed Varadkar’s partner, Matt Barrett, who did not join him on stage with the president, but was in the crowd.
Trump also talked about the long history between the Irish and America, talking about the shared history of both nations. He also said relations between the two nations were at a historic high, and complemented Irish people.
“They’re smart. They’re sharp. They’re great. And they’re brutal enemies,” Trump said.
Varadkar in his own speech congratulated US president Donald Trump on the “booming” American economy at the annual Shamrock Ceremony at the White House.
“Your ambition is to make America Great Again, and we can see the results today,” Varadkar said, before handing over the bowl of shamrocks to Trump.
“The American economy is booming. More jobs. Rising incomes. Exactly what you said you’d do. American military power is unrivalled.”

The Taoiseach said, however, that he believed that “the greatness of America is about more than economic prowess and military might”.
“It is rooted in the things that make us love America: your people, your values, a new nation conceived in liberty. The land and the home of the brave and the free,” Varadkar said, before quoting from the American Declaration of Independence.

He said that the fight for civil rights in Northern Ireland was inspired by the struggle of American women like Susan B Anthony, Rosa Parks, Rachel Carson and Marsha Johnson.
Immigration
In his speech, Varadkar took the opportunity also to talk about the need for greater legal immigration pathways for Irish people to live in America, and for closer economic cooperation between the two countries.

“Mr President, our history is shared, our future is entwined,” Varadkar said.
“And so I believe that future generations of our citizens should have the same opportunity to enrich one another’s societies as past generations have.
“No nation with as many ties as Ireland has to the United States has so few pathways to legal immigration. Whenever we’ve talked about this we’ve found agreement”.

‘Secure of our place in the EU’
Varadkar painted a picture of Ireland as a proud member of the UN and the EU.
He said the country was a “gateway to the Atlantic world and, I hope, a bridge between Europe and America”, before saying that he wanted to strengthen the economic ties between Ireland and the US.
“Decades of investment by US firms in Ireland have helped transform Ireland from one of the least developed in Europe to one of the most prosperous: a budget surplus, record number of people at work, lower income taxes, rising wages, poverty and deprivation down,” Varadkar said.

The Taoiseach said that “today our economic relationship is very much a two-way street”.
“One hundred thousand Americans across 50 states are employed in Irish-owned companies with more jobs to come,” he said.
He said that free trade and free enterprise made everyone better off.
“Let’s keep it that way,” Varadkar said.
He closed by saying that Ireland loves “America and the promise of America”.
“And we know that making America Great Again, will not mean forgetting or losing sight of what makes it great already,” he said, before handing Trump the bowl of shamrocks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/national-lottery-factcheck-4517047-Mar2019/,"
LAST WEEK, A major piece of research into gamblingwas publishedand it showed that lottery and scratch cards were by far the most common way people gamble in Ireland.
According to the gambling prevalence survey – published on Wednesday by Ministers of State David Stanton and Catherine Byrne – 56.7% of people in Ireland had a bet on a lotto or bought a scratch a card in the past year, with 35.4% doing so in the last month.
In response to the publication of the data, the National Lottery issued a statement.
It said: “The National Lottery differs from other forms of gaming in that it is based on many people playing, but spending reasonably small amounts.
“Nearly 30c in every euro spent on National Lottery games goes back into the areas of youth, sport, recreation & amenities, health & welfare, arts, culture & national heritage and the Irish language.”
But is this claim correct?Does the National Lottery exist for the sole purpose of raising money for good causes?
The National Lottery was established by the government in 1986, began trading in 1987, and was initially owned by An Post.
When set up, its purpose was to provide funding for “sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts and the health of the community”.
However as the recession laid siege to the national finances in the early 2010s, the government put the licence to operate the National Lottery up for sale.
It was eventually sold to a consortium made up of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, An Post and the An Post pension funds.
Under that agreement, a private firm ultimately co-owned by the trio, called Premier Lotteries Ireland, was awarded a 20-year licence in 2014 to operate the National Lottery.
The Canadian pension fund ultimately controls the majority of Premier Lotteries Ireland’s shares, with An Post and its pension funds holding minority stakes.
The relevant legislation was updated with theNational Lottery Act 2013, which replaced the previous laws and established a regulator to oversee the lottery.
Premier Lotteries Ireland paid the government withan upfront sum of €405 millionto secure the contract.
Thelicenceto operate the National Lottery stated that Premier Lotteries Ireland had to allocate 65% of its gross gaming revenue – made up of its total ticket sales minus prize money – to good causes each year.
It was also required to provide regulators with a statement containing details of its contributions to those causes – which includes funding for many small, community organisations – for every 12-month period.
According to Premier Lotteries Ireland’s most recent financial statements gross ticket sales amounted to €800 million in 2017. The company paid out €452 million in prizes to players, representing around 56% of its total ticket sales.
More than €226 million was distributed to good causes, representing the 65% share of gross gaming revenue that the State licence required the company to hand out to worthy initiatives.
That left Premier Lotteries Ireland with an operating profit of €17.4 million – after its running costs, including staff expenses and other overheads, were stripped out.
However due to financial expenses of €31 million, the company posted a net loss of €13.5 million for the year. The largest portion of the financial expenses came from interest due to ‘related parties’.
Elsewhere in the accounts, the company noted that it had more than €220 million in loans and accrued interest outstanding to its parents: the pension funds and An Post. These loans incurred a hefty 9% rate of fixed interest.
Without the interest charges to Premier Lotteries Ireland’s owners, the company would have delivered a slender profit for the year.

In addition, An Post delivered services worth €2.2 million to Premier Lotteries Ireland – which it part-owns – in 2017, while another firm called Camelot provided “systems implementation and support services” worth €9.7 million during the year.
Camelot runs the UK national lottery under licence and it is also owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.
Meanwhile, Premier Lotteries Ireland’s ultimate parent company in Ireland paid out its first dividends to shareholders of €84.6 million in 2017.
So between the dividend payout and intra-group charges, the National Lottery’s licence holders benefited by more than €96 million from the operation of the service for the year.
Canadian owners
The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan – Premier Lotteries Ireland’s majority owner – describes itself as “Canada’s largest single-profession pension plan with $189.5 billion in net assets”.
Under a section describing “our investments” on its website, the fund says: “Our investment program has one goal: to earn the best possible returns, at an appropriate level of risk, to pay pensions to our members.”
That means that the company responsible for running Ireland’s National Lottery is itself majority-owned by a Canadian investment firm.
Lottery statement
We asked the National Lottery for a statement based on the claim in question for this FactCheck.
A spokeswoman told us: “The National Lottery was set up on a statutory basis by the Irish Government, under the National Lottery Act 1986, with the express purpose of raising funds for Good Causes all over Ireland.
The spokeswoman added that since 1987, around €5.4 billion had been raised for good causes through the National Lottery.
Some 91c of every euro spent on National Lottery games went either to good causes, prize money or retailer bonuses and commissions, she noted. The remainder went towards paying for Premier Lotteries Ireland’s operations and any profits.
The claim made by the National Lottery was that it “exist[s] for the sole purpose of raising money for good causes all over Ireland – whilst offering the people of Ireland fun, responsible play”.
As shown above, however, the company that operates the lotto – Premier Lotteries Ireland – is majority-owned by a Canadian investment firm which promises to deliver returns for its members.
It is true to say that the company provides hundreds of millions of euro in funding for good causes each year, while it also pays out hundreds of millions of euro in prize money.
However it is also a business which seeks to make money and pay its shareholders: which it did to the tune of more than €84 million in dividends in 2017.
Which means that, while the National Lottery does indeed raise hundreds of millions for good causes, it also functions as a cash-generating asset for its owners.
PLI, the operators of the National Lottery, does draw a distinction between the National Lottery and themselves as operators of the National Lottery but that distinction ignores the reality that the gambling by the public on the National Lottery funds both the National Lottery and the operator PIL, and therefore the National Lottery (funded by this public gambling) cannot truly claim to exist ‘for the sole purpose of raising money for good causes’.
As a result, we rate this claim:Mostly FALSE
As per our verdict guide, this means the claim contains an element of truth but is missing critical details or context.
Based on the information set out above, the National Lottery may have been set up with the goal of raising money for good causes, but it also serves as an income-generating asset for its licence-holders and therefore can not be described as existing for the “sole purpose” of raising money for good causes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/smuggled-cigarettes-revenue-4546389-Mar2019/,"MORE THAN ONE million cigarettes have been seized by customs officers at Dublin Port.
The seizure was made by officers with the Revenue during routine operations on Thursday, when the smuggled cigarettes were discovered.

The unstamped cigarettes were found when a cargo of freight which had arrived into Dublin from Rotterdam in the Netherlands was examined.
The seized cigarettes, branded ‘Marlboro’, had a retail value of almost €500,000, and would have represented a potential loss to the Exchequer of €422,000 if they had been smuggled successfully.
Investigations into the seizure are ongoing.

https://www.the42.ie/the42-tv-wrap-4535159-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Mar 2019
DECADES AGO, WHEN the GAA was still in the throes of its ban on foreign sports, a Longford delegate to Central Council growled discontent at the fact his county didn’t get a mention in that year’s GAA annual.
When told that his county were merely the victims of limited space, the delegate replied sourly that they had “found space for a bloody rugby commentator”, in reference to an article written in Irish by Brendán O hEithir.
O hEithir’s varied life took him from the Aran Islands to the centre of public life in Ireland, and he became known as a poet, author, Irish Times columnist and, very briefly, the aforementioned rugby commentator.
Although primarily a GAA man, he spent a short part of his life delivering Irish-language commentaries on rugby internationals. As he wrote inOver the Bar,he found the gig difficult: a “challenge to find simple forms of speech to describe any activity which was neither discussed nor written about in Irish.”
His protruding memory of it all was seeing the Irish players’ feeble gesticulations in response to Noel Murphy’s being knocked out by Wales’ Brian Price, thinking to himself what would have happened had Price embroiled himself with the “Buffers Alley hurlers”, who would no doubt have “hurled the jock-straps off those Welsh hoors all the way to Holyhead.”
If O hEithir struggled to penetrate the singular vocabulary of rugby union half a century ago, were he confronted with the lexicon of today’s game he might well have quit before ever he had to consider the distance to Holyhead.
While Virgin Media’s coverage of Ireland v France last Sunday ruminated on Joe Schmidt’s legacy – “I hugely respect him…even though they have been out of form for a few weeks, that will have nothing to do with the legacy he will leave” declared Matt Williams – their broadcast exhibited one of strand of that legacy: the extent of the change in how rugby is talked about on television.
Joe Schmidt is interviewed by Virgin Media after Sunday's game.Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
Virtually all rugby coverage has, in the last few years, been drenched by curious words and phrases largely singular to the game.
Following Matt Williams’ introduction of the “corridor of power” a couple of weeks ago, Sunday brought us Shane Jennings talking us through some Irish players “on the latch” and Shane Horgan talking urgently about something called “pendulum” defence.
That studios are now flooded with Schmidt’s retired players, and given that the novelist Julian Barnes wrote that we only need 15 minutes on a phone with a solicitor to find ourselves talking like one, it is understandable that men who worked with the Irish coach for years should absorb some of his precise phrasing.
In fairness to Virgin’s coverage, host Joe Molloy does a good job of cutting through the jargon and they also did a lengthy feature on body language – a topic on which we can all confidently declare ourselves experts.
TW Wrapcan only lament that these players-turned-pundits didn’t soak up some of Eddie O’Sullivan’s unique phraseology, responsible as he is for aphorisms like “as useful as a trapdoor in a canoe” and “Peter Stringer might as well be looking for a Mars bar in a bucket of shit.”
Advertisement
If O’ hEithir was working in rugby today, he would also be robbed of the comfort in finding refuge in one of the game’s great clichés: the essential unpredictability of the French.
Not that this is Schmidt’s fault. The sad diminishing of the French rugby team over the last six years means they have made themselves a stilted, denuded and lamentably predictable thing.
Thus the only unpredictability on Sunday last came from the Irish weather, with Virgin Media dispatching David Wallace pitchside during a thunderous downpour as CNN might a reporter during some disastrous weather event in Florida.
Minutes later, the studio was bathed in rich sunlight.
Some things never change.
Last week also brought another Irish team into a French tangle, with Manchester United shocking Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.
BT Sport presaged the game with a documentary calledRio Meets PSG, in which Rio Ferdinand travelled to Paris to get an exclusive, all-access look at the French champions.
Rio spoke of his fascination with it all, intrigued as he was by the city and the “project.”
He spoke to manager Thomas Tuchel -”not a dictator”, in the presenter’s opinion – and veteran players Dani Alves and Gigi Buffon, attempting to probe to the heart of why these legends of the game were tempted to spend their gloamy twilights at what is effectively a start-up.
That they are being paid fantastical amounts of money didn’t come up, oddly.
Rio also explored the commercial aspect of it all, fascinated as he was by their exclusive partnership with Nike Air Jordan; kits he testified as being “pwapah fashonistas.”
Rio Ferdinand takes a browse through PSG's club store.BT Sport YouTubeBT Sport YouTube
Rio has his own clothing line, so he was naturally enthused as he was guided around the club store, cooing “this is me” when he set eyes on a top that he was then told was worn by “Will Smith.
This part of the documentary became little more than a man indulging his narrow interests; like a sausage magnate being led down the Tesco Finest aisle and being dazzled by all that was possible for the humble sausage.
Not thatRio Meets PSGworried about how the sausage is made.

“They have positioned them so well, commercially” testified Rio. “It’s a great story.”
Rio decided against discussing why all this was happening in the first place, of why PSG are so eager to “become one of the biggest sports brands in the world.”
He elected to ignore the ambient rattle of the laundry through which the Qatari owners were giving their image a good rinsing; spending hundreds of millions of euro to angle the mirror westward and away from the ugly reflection of their repressive kafala work system which –in the recent opinion of Amnesty International– they have failed to reform in spite of promises to do so, preferring to use the PSG “lifestyle” to puff up their image to the rest of the world.
Instead, Rio celebrated the “lifestyle” that PSG are selling, of how they want to “celebrate being a trendsetter in football culture.”
So we return to the ancient question that has become redundant in rugby: which French team is going to turn up?
Sometimes, it’s just the one they want you to see.
Talking of organisations filled with oodles of exceptional individual talent unable to produce anything of substance collectively,Saturday Night Liverecently tried its hand at a parody of English football.
Best of luck making it all of the way through this.

https://www.thejournal.ie/murder-trial-longford-rihards-lavickis-4545335-Mar2019/,"A MURDER ACCUSED told gardaí that his first attempts to strike the deceased with a knife didn’t work so he “put more effort into it”.
The accused, who stabbed a man to death in broad daylight outside a shopping centre, admitted that he went out with a knife that day to “get him” for threatening his family and breaking their windows.
The jury in his murder trial was hearing the memos of his interviews being read to the Central Criminal Court today.
Rihards Lavickis (26), originally from Latvia, but with an address at Annaly court, Longford is charged with the murder of Polish father-of-two Arkadiusz ‘Arik’ Czajkowski on 1 November 2016 at Rue Noyal Chatillon, Townspark in the town.
The father-of-one stabbed the 31-year-old to death outside Longford Shopping Centre shortly after 11.30am that day. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter.
The court has already heard that the accused had come downstairs that morning to find his living room window broken, something which had happened a number of times before.
His neighbour had described the people who had done it, and the accused said he knew that it was the deceased, to whom he owed money. The gardai arrived and began an investigation.
Detective Garda Joseph Esler told Patrick McGrath SC, prosecuting, that he and a colleague had interviewed the accused about what he did after the gardaí left his home that morning.
“I wasn’t in the best of mood because my girlfriend, her mother and sister weren’t,” he said, referring to the three women with whom he and three children shared the apartment.
“My temperature was going up. It wasn’t just about the women. It was about the kids. He could have come in,” he said of the deceased.
“I was looking to get him for what he’d done. It just kept on happening so either I or he was getting it.”
He said that he took the knife because he had never known the deceased to have a fair fight.
“He always had someone with him. This was the chance I get him on his own,” he said.
He said that he saw the deceased and stood into an alley so that he couldn’t see him.

“I waited five to six minutes,” he said. “I was getting stressed about all he had done to me.”
He recalled then running after the deceased as he crossed the road.
He said that he struck him a third time and was going to strike him again.
“Then I thought it’s enough,” he explained. “I turned around and started walking back to the apartment… I was just thinking I might have crossed the line.”
He was asked how much force he had used when he chased the deceased and pushed the knife into him.
“The first few didn’t really work because he was running backwards and that’s when I put more effort into it,” he replied.
He said that was his first time to take the knife, a gift, out of the apartment. He agreed that the only reason he brought it was in case he met the deceased.
“I was thinking about going to frighten him, but when it was out I went to use it” he said.
“After I was back in the flat smoking and watching everyone flipping, I couldn’t say I didn’t feel sorry for what I’d done.”
He said he’d thought then that he shouldn’t have brought the knife with him.
“That it could have been sorted with fists,” he said.
He said that the deceased had threatened to come over and kill his family.
“He said to my girlfriend, he shouted to her: ‘When Richie goes to jail, we’ll see what happens then’,” he said.
The State has now closed its case and Justice Michael White has asked the jury of eight men and four women to return to court on Wednesday.
Comments are closed as legal proceedings are ongoing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boeing-747-airline-4536133-Mar2019/,"SINGAPORE HAS JOINED the list of countries that have banned the use of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the country’s airspace, following the deadly Ethiopia plane crash at the weekend.
The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight to Nairobi in Kenya Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia killing 189.
One of those killed was 39-year-old Michael Ryan, a worker with Deputy Chief Engineer at the United Nations’ World Food Programme.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement it was “temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into and out of Singapore in light of two fatal accidents involving Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months”.
The move comes as airlines around the world remove the model from their schedules, while US regulators have ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to the jet.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) yesterday ordered Boeing to improve anti-stalling software and the model’s maneuvering system, giving the company until the end of April to make the updates.
But it ruled out grounding the fleet for now. It said investigations had “just begun” and so far no data had been provided to “draw any conclusions or take any actions”.
Singapore’s suspension came into effect from 2pm local time (6am Irish time) this morning.
The regulator said that SilkAir, the regional wing of Singapore Airlines, operates six Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.
Safety doubts
Airlines in Ethiopia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and the Cayman Islands said yesterday they were suspending operations by their 737 MAX 8 fleets.
The move caused Boeing shares to drop around 12% earlier in the day, before recovering about half its losses in mid-afternoon New York trading.

Ethiopian Airlines said investigators had found the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders yesterday.
It said it had grounded its fleet of six remaining Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes pending analysis of the black box data.
“We assume we will find out the cause of the crash in the black box data,” the airline said.
China also ordered domestic airlines to suspend commercial operation of the MAX 8.
Indonesia, which has 11 of the MAX 8 model planes, said it would “carry out inspections and temporarily prohibit Boeing 737 Max 8 from flying”.
South Korea ordered an inspection of two MAX 8 planes flown by low-cost Eastar Jet.
Some other airlines said they were not cancelling MAX 8 flights, including Oman Air, flydubai, Turkish Airlines and Russia’s S7.
Boeing has described the MAX series as its fastest-selling aeroplane ever, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date from about 100 customers.
State-owned Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s largest carrier, had ordered 30 MAX 8 jets in total, and China has received 76 from an order of 180.
The plane that crashed on Sunday was less than four months old. Ethiopian Airlines said it was delivered on November 15.
The jet went down near the village of Tulu Fara, some 60 kilometres (40 miles) east of Addis Ababa.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-which-irish-media-users-can-identify-a-trustworthy-news-source-4552394-Mar2019/,"AHEAD OF THE European and Local elections in May, there is a renewed focus on media literacy – something that is critical to citizens making informed decisions.
This week is European Media Literacy Week, an initiative by the European Commission aiming to highlight the importance of media literacy and promote media initiatives and projects across the EU.
With heightened concerns regarding the quality of information available to citizens and declining levels of public trust in the fourth estate, media literacy initiatives seek to empower and inform citizens.
The2018 Reuters Digital News Reportsurvey, funded by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, examined levels of news literacy among Irish online news consumers as part of a wider survey of general news attitudes and preferences.
Respondents were asked four questions to measure their knowledge of journalism production and distribution.
The multiple choice questions asked respondents to identify the state-funded media outlet, the financial status of the newspaper industry, the person who writes a press release, and how algorithms shape social media newsfeeds.
It found that only about 3% of news consumers were wholly informed about news production, getting all four questions about journalism correct.
About 33% were fairly news literate regarding some aspects of journalism, getting two of the four questions correct.
About one-third of people got half, or more of the questions correct showing higher levels of news literacy.
The results indicate that men have slightly higher levels of literacy than women and younger people tend to be only slightly more literate than older age groups.
Higher income, higher education and higher engagement with news on a daily basis are also factors shaping higher levels of news and media literacy.
Platforms
However, the research shows that where people get their media also affects media literacy.
The overall highest news literacy was among users of news websites and apps (40%) and radio (30%), while the lowest literacy levels were among consumers of printed magazines and newspapers (both 23%).
News websites and apps have an enhanced capacity to be transparent about the news production process with features like tracking changes to articles and linking to public sources used.
However, there are still questions around how explicit news websites are when it comes to sourcing, such as citing that the article was provoked by a press release or through political communications.
Social media is often viewed as problematic in terms of news literacy.
However, the survey found that social media users are slightly more literate (29%) than newspaper and magazine readers, as well as rolling TV viewers (28%) and TV bulletin viewers (26%).

Online Sources
Online readers of established news brands show higher levels of news literacy, particularly readers of the Guardian (53%) and The Irish Times (47%) as well as digital born brands likeTheJournal.ie(42%).
Additionally, dedicated regional newspaper readers are among the most media literate news consumers (43%).
But just 28% of Sky news online users had high levels of news literacy. Online tabloid readers, in particular, showed lower levels of news literacy compared to digital broadsheet readers.
The high percentage of media literate consumers of The Guardian might in part be explained by the outlet’s dedicated media analysis section that critically evaluates and investigates the industry.
Similarly, in the effort to build subscribers during financially challenging times, The Guardian increased transparency regarding their news production processes and enhanced engagement between the audience and news producers.
It was the first British title to have a readers’ editor.
Amid all the initiatives to support news consumers, it is worth remembering that providing readers with a window into newsrooms can lead to a better understanding of how journalism is produced.

Political Leaning
Much of the hype around fake news, conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns have focused on fringe right-wing conservatives.
Distrust of mainstream media is a common theme among alt-right commentators for example. This research indicates that people who said they had a right-wing leaning were found to have slightly lower levels of literacy than those who say they lean left.
Trust
News literacy is also associated with the levels of trust in the news.
Amid the debate about the quality of information on social media, the impact on the audience and the efforts of social giants to tackle disinformation – this indicates that those with higher levels of trust in news on social media have lower levels of news literacy.
Previous research has found that users often do not recognise news brands on social media. This raises questions as to what social media companies can do to support users in making informed choices about what they click on or scroll past.
Be media smart
In 2016 the BAI launched a Media Literacy Policy which “sets out a range of skills to help people to navigate current, new and emerging content platforms.”
“The survey findings and wider concerns about disinformation underscore the need for media literacy to help people be informed about the media they consume,” said BAI chief executive Michael O’Keeffe.
It is European Media Literacy Week 2019  andBe Media Smartis a public awareness campaign running across media platforms to encourage people of all ages to ‘Stop, Think, and Check’ that the information they see, read or hear is reliable.
Be Media Smart is an initiative of Media Literacy Ireland, which is an independent network of volunteer members, facilitated by the BAI, working together to enhance Irish people’s understanding of, and engagement with media.

The British Parliament’s petitions committee tweeted that the rate of signings is the “highest the site has ever had to deal with”, after the website briefly crashed earlier. A House of Commons spokesman said the technical difficulties on parliament’s e-petition website were caused by “a large and sustained load on the system”.
Since then, the committee has also attemptedto tackle claimsthat the huge interest in the petition is not fraud, and has claimed that 96% of the signatures to the petition are from the UK.
“We don’t comment in detail about security measures. We use different techniques – automated and manual – to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses and other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. We also monitor signing patterns.

https://www.thejournal.ie/illegal-land-burning-warning-4519872-Mar2019/,"A STRONG WARNING has been issued about illegal burning of land during the closed season of 1 March to 31 August by the Department of Agriculture.
People who burn agricultural and eligible forestry land after 1 March risk facing prosecution.
Land burning is used by farmers to get rid of old vegetation, promote new grass growth and improve upland grazing. Burning land between 1 March and 31 August is an offence under the 1976 Wildlife Act.

“Both farmers and the wider public, whether it be at work or in enjoying the countryside, should at this time of year be mindful of the damage caused by burning, particularly given the current very dry weather,” said the Department in a statement.
The DAFM forest fire danger rating level is at condition yellow which means people should be more aware of fire risks in the countryside.
“The Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda Síochána, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112/999 service.”
Illegal burning can render neighbouring lands ineligible for payments and area-based schemes. Land identified as being burnt during the closed season could be inspected by officials from the Department.

https://www.the42.ie/tommy-walsh-kerry-player-watch-4523346-Mar2019/,"AFTER TAKING VICTORY for the fifth league game in succession, there are a host of positives for Kerry boss Peter Keane to glean at this stage of the season.
Tommy Walsh ahead of their clash against Monaghan.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
He clearly has the winning touch, having now won his last 22 competitive games since 2015 as manager of the minors and seniors. A number young players have impressed on their set-up to the senior ranks, particularly Dara Moynihan, Gavin O’Brien and Tomás Ó Sé.
Sean O’Shea is reaching new heights this season at centre-field, while Jack Sherwood has returned from the inter-county wilderness to shore up the full-back position.
The most unexpected feature of the Keane-era so far has been Tommy Walsh’s stunning return to form. Former selector Mikey Sheehy admitted Kerry mishandled Walsh after he arrived back from Australia for the 2015 season. He departed the squad due to a lack of game-time following the 2016 league and that looked to be that.
Despite his strong form for Kerins O’Rahillys in the Kerry championship last season, given the emergence of several talented youngsters it was thought the 31-year-old’s time in the green and gold was over.
Not alone is Walsh looking back to his best athletically and free of injury, but he’s become the focal point of the Kingdom attack. The former Sydney Swans player has clearly been a positive influence on the young players around him, in the same sort of way Kieran Donaghy had been up to his retirement.
Positioned at full-forward, Walsh contested the throw-in at the start of both halves – coming up with possession on both occasions.
His technique under the hop-ball was also notable. Walsh won a free in an early tussle with Darren Hughes, placing his left arm under the shoulder of Hughes and using his strength to push the midfielder out of his way.

Walsh collected the ball and was fouled for an easy free for O’Shea to convert.

While he spent most of his time at the edge of the square, Walsh did drop out to midfield on occasion when Kerry needed an ‘out ball’ or an extra body behind the ball.
However, he’s proving to be a formidable aerial threat upfront and as a result has become a key part of Kerry’s plan of attack. On a number of occasions the likes of Tom O’Sullivan and Moynihan picked out Walsh with long kick-passes inside.

In total, the hosts targeted Walsh with 13 kick-passes inside the Monaghan half and he came up with the ball on all but four occasions – a 70%  success rate.

His fetch early in the second-half over Wylie was a thing of beauty, where he used his knee to extend his hang-time behind the full-back.
Walsh scored four points, three from advanced marks and one fine effort from play off his left:

Tommy Walsh swings it over the bar for@Kerry_Officialpic.twitter.com/ylhV9h51Z1
He was fouled for a first-half free that Sean O’Shea converted and was heavily involved in the move for two more scores in the opening period.
AFL teams spend a great deal of time working on their hand-passing and Walsh’s fast hands were evident in the build-up to this score from O’Shea.
TG4TG4
(Click here if you can’t view the clip above)

He had 25 possessions in total and completed every one of his 13 passes from hand. His shooting is steadily improving and Walsh missed two of his six shots at the posts – sending one wide and another short (from an advanced mark).
The advanced mark rule is made for a player like Walsh and the only downside for Kerry is that it won’t apply in this summer’s championship.

Kerry look on course to reach their third league final in four years and Walsh’s form has been a huge factor in their winning run this spring.
“He’s a big unit and he has good hands, no point having a lad with good hands and not playing him,” stated Keane after yesterday’s game.
With David Clifford, Paul Geaney and James O’Donoghue still to come back into the fold, Keane will have some mouth-watering options available to him up front when everyone is fit.
Kerry won their opening five games by an average of under three points, which will give them confidence knowing they’ve come out the right side of several tight games.
And Tommy Walsh’s second powerful display in a week might just be the best part of it all.

Ireland 7
Murray Kinsella reports from Principality Stadium
THE EPIC RENDITION of ‘Land of My Fathers’ with the rain teeming down, the inspirational Alun Wyn Jones belting out each word, gave us a sense of what was coming.
The try that followed just minutes later hammered the point home – Warren Gatland’s Wales were not going to miss this opportunity to secure their third Grand Slam in the Kiwi’s tenure as head coach.
The Welsh were superb and totally deserving of their comprehensive win but, equally, Ireland concluded the 2019 Six Nations on a worrying note as they delivered a shambolic performance, perhaps the worst of the Joe Schmidt era.
Wales are Grand Slam champions.Alex Davidson / INPHOAlex Davidson / INPHO / INPHO
Schmidt’s insistence on keeping the roof at the Principality Stadium open utterly backfired as Ireland struggled to hold onto the ball and Wales thrived in the conditions, while the Irish decision-making and basic skill execution were dire.
The manner in which Ireland’s discipline – so often a strong point under Schmidt – unravelled was as telling as anything, the visitors giving up 11 penalties to allow man of the match Gareth Anscombe to keep the scoreboard consistently ticking over for Wales.
With Johnny Sexton delivering a very poor performance and his halfback partner Conor Murray also making damaging errors, Ireland were wholly lacking control in this contest. Schmidt’s refusal to sub them off until the closing 10 minutes was mystifying.
Tadhg Beirne, making his Six Nations debut, showed his quality with one turnover in the first half but really this was all one-way traffic in the superb Wales’ favour as Ireland raised real questions about their World Cup credentials.
This was Schmidt’s final Six Nations game as Ireland head coach – as was the case for Gatland – but he now has huge concerns as he attempts to guide his team beyond the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time ever.
2018, with its Grand Slam and a win over the All Blacks, seem like a long, long time ago.
For Wales, whose Slam was built on an incredibly good defence driven by Shaun Edwards, their prospects at the global tournament are looking pretty rosy right now.
Hadleigh Parkes scored an early try for Wales.Bryan Keane / INPHOBryan Keane / INPHO / INPHO
Wales’ start was sensational as Gatland’s men drove Jacob Stockdale into touch from the kick-off, then scored with their first attack as Hadleigh Parkes gathered in a delightful Anscombe chip over the Irish defence to dot down with just 61 seconds on the clock.

Anscombe converted and Ireland struggled to hang onto the ball in the wet conditions, while also conceding harmful early penalties, although Parkes did need to make a vital try-saving tackle on Stockdale after quick thinking by Sexton to cross-field kick.
The Welsh lost George North to injury inside the opening 10 minutes but Dan Biggar came on to great effect at out-half, with Anscombe shifting to fullback and Liam Williams moving to the wing.
A brilliant Beirne breakdown turnover penalty just in front of the Ireland tryline spared Schmidt’s side as Wales piled on more pressure, but Sexton went off his feet at an attacking ruck soon after, Anscombe slotting an impressive penalty from wide right.
The Welsh should have then gone 13-0 ahead but Gareth Davies’ tackle on Bundee Aki after the whistle had sounded saw another penalty reversed.
Ireland were let off the hook and finally enjoyed an occupation of the Welsh 22 as the game entered the second quarter, only for the home side’s defence to muscle up superbly and turn over a five-metre Irish maul, Adam Beard leading the way.
The rain came down heavily in Cardiff.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
Then another Irish error in a half strewn with them, CJ Stander attempting to quick tap a free-kick but nudging the ball into the Irish scrum in front of him for accidental offside, saw Ireland forced back onto the defensive.
The lineout began to come apart with some poor throwing by captain Rory Best – on his final Six Nations appearance – and questionable calling from James Ryan, while Murray knocked the ball-on and then box-kicked into touch on the full to give the Welsh one final shot of the half.
It appeared they had missed that chance when Josh Navidi forward passed to Ross Moriarty but, with everything going wrong for Ireland, the big-screen replay showed that Ryan had knocked the ball on first.
Referee Angus Gardner reversed his decision and Ireland conceded another penalty – their eighth of the half – at the scrum to allow Anscombe to kick Wales out to 16-0 on the stroke of half-time.
Ireland’s start to the second half was poor as Ryan was choke-tackled by Jones, Navidi and Beard but good scrum pressure then forced a knock-on from Wales number eight Moriarty at the base.
Handed that set-piece opportunity, Ireland ran down a blind alley and then Sexton kicked into touch on the full to invite the Welsh back into the visitors’ half.
Gareth Anscombe slots a kick at goal.Bryan Keane / INPHOBryan Keane / INPHO / INPHO
Anscombe was able to further extend the Welsh lead in the 49th minute as Cian Healy was pinged for coming in the side of a ruck 36 metres out, resulting in a 19-0 deficit.
Sexton then proceeded to kick a poorly-struck restart dead as the performance unravelled even further, Stander failing to roll away from a tackle as Tipuric cleverly pinned him in and Anscombe kicking the Welsh out to 22-0.
Sexton’s struggles continued when Ireland had their next visit into the Welsh 22, his pass going to ground and into touch as Schmidt’s side pressured the home team.
Ireland got a break as Tipuric spilt the subsequent lineout, however, and Murray was just stopped just short the tryline. More Irish possession followed but Tipuric jackaled to force the ball loose and Beirne knocked-on in the ensuing scramble.
Soon Ireland were back on their own tryline, as Murray’s pass from a lineout went to ground and Parkes hacked the ball ahead, the retreating Keith Earls forced to carry it back over his own tryline and hand the Welsh a five-metre scrum.

Wales couldn’t turn that into a score but replacement tighthead Andrew Porter went off his feet at an Irish ruck minutes later and Anscombe continued his 100% record off the tee for 25-0.
Sexton struggled badly for Ireland.Alex Davidson / INPHOAlex Davidson / INPHO / INPHO
Ireland did, at least, spare themselves the ignominy of failing to score any points, replacement Jordan Larmour crossing after Stockdale’s break.
But the game ended as it had started, with the Welsh crowd in full voice as they celebrated their Grand Slam.

AHEAD OF SUNDAY’S International awards ceremny, the FAI have announced that the Young Player of the Year award has been won by Declan Rice.
Rice played in three of Ireland’s nine games last year, and hence was voted as the winner of the award by a panel comprised of members of the Soccer Writers’ Association of Ireland. The decision was made before it was publicly confirmed that Rice had decided to switch his international allegiances to England.

In a statement, the FAI confirmed Rice was the winner of the award and confirmed he won’t be in Dublin to collect his award at Sunday’s ceremony. The FAI have not said they will pull the award, merely that Rice won’t be around to collect it.
“The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that West Ham United’s Declan Rice has won the Young Player Of the Year award at the 29th ’3′ FAI International Awards taking place on Sunday, March 17.
“The award was voted for by members of the SSE Airtricity Soccer Writers’ Association of Ireland.
“Declan Rice has since opted to switch his allegiance to England. The FAI has completed his international transfer via the FIFA protocols and wishes him well in the future.
“This award maintains the integrity of the voting process in conjunction with the Soccer Writers’ Association of Ireland and the FAI thanks the jury members for their decisions relating to the awards.

“Declan Rice will not be in Dublin for the ’3′ FAI International Awards ceremony, which will be live on RTÉ2 from 20:30.”
Meanwhile, this evening, a tweet from the official SWAI account added: “The SWAI officers endorse the stance taken by the jury of our members requested to select the FAI’s Young Player of the Year in January. Match performances in 2018 was the sole criteria and they decided at that meeting to stick with the decision regardless of future developments.”

GAME OF THRONES star Emilia Clarke suffered two nearly fatal brain aneurysms in the early years of filming the hit series, she said in an essay published yesterday.
The British actress – who plays Daenerys Targaryen on the blockbuster show about to enter its final season – wrote that the first aneurysm rupture struck while she was at the gym in February 2011, just after filming the first season.
“At some level, I knew what was happening: my brain was damaged,” the 32-year-old wrote inThe New Yorker magazinein her piece entitled A Battle For My Life.
“For a few moments, I tried to will away the pain and the nausea,” she continued. “To keep my memory alive, I tried to recall, among other things, some lines from Game of Thrones.”
Clarke was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage – a form of stroke triggered by bleeding into areas that surround the brain, which kills about one third of the patients it strikes.
She was 24 at the time of her first brain surgery, and said the recovery period in which she could not even recall her own name – a condition called aphasia – gave her “a sense of doom.”
Advertisement
“In my worst moments, I wanted to pull the plug. I asked the medical staff to let me die,” Clarke said. “My job – my entire dream of what my life would be – centered on language, on communication. Without that, I was lost.”
The condition passed and Clarke left the hospital one month after her admission — but doctors had found she had a second aneurysm that could rupture at any moment.
“Even before we began filming Season 2, I was deeply unsure of myself. I was often so woozy, so weak, that I thought I was going to die,” Clarke wrote, saying she took morphine between interviews while promoting the acclaimed show.
During a routine brain scan doctors found her growth had doubled in size and decided to operate – a seemingly simple procedure that resulted in major complications and another month in the hospital.
Today, Clarke says she has “healed beyond my most unreasonable hopes,” and helped develop a charity to offer treatment to patients recovering from stroke and brain injuries.
“There is something gratifying, and beyond lucky, about coming to the end of Thrones,” Clarke wrote. “I’m so happy to be here to see the end of this story and the beginning of whatever comes next.”

A REPORT INTO US President Donald Trump and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election has been completed.
For almost two years, special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, with a particular focus on Trump, his family and his campaign team.
Today, his much anticipated report was submitted to the Attorney General Bill Barr.
The report’s remit was to probe whether Trump or his team were involved with Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election campaign; or whether Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation.

Barr now must decide how much of the confidential report to release; in a letter to Senate and House judiciary committees, Barr acknowledged that Mueller’s investigation was completed and said that he may be able to summarise “the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend”.

The report has taken nearly two years to complete; there’s been little to no indication of what Mueller’s findings could be.
Barr said he would consult with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, and Mueller to determine what else from the report can be released to Congress and the public.
“I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,” Barr said.
In a statement, the White House said: “The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”

Every week, Darach will be regaling (re-Gaeling?) us with insights on what the Irish language says about Ireland, our society, our past and our present. Enjoy.
I’M NOT SURE if it happened by accident or design, but the end of Seachtain na Gaeilge coincides with the beginning of the Leaving Cert Irish oral exams.
I’m sure those words will stir memories for some older readers – the anxiety beforehand and the relief afterwards. Followed immediately by the l’esprit d’escalier sensation as you remembered all the prepared phrases you had that you didn’t fit in.
When I was doing the Leaving, I remember talking in my oral exam about the Peace Process (dar liom, tá an próiseas síochána i mbaol), the Oscars (d’éirigh leis an scannán Braveheart cúig Oscar a fháil) and music (is maith liom Janes Addiction ach is fearr liom na Pixies).Today’s Leaving Cert candidates are more likely to read about Braveheart, the Pixies and the Peace Process in history class than in Irish.
Barring the odd repeat student, the class of 2019 were born after 9/11, that means that they have never used a non-smartphone mobile and have only heard about the floppy discs that represent the ‘save’ action on their computers.
So what might they talk about?
There are a few Irish words and phrases for new and contemporary things including current affairs, which I’ve gathered from the brand new tearma.ie website, which is run by the Gaois research group in Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge (DCU) in partnership with Foras na Gaeilge’s Terminology Committee.
Comhaontú Muiníne agus Soláthair :This means a Confidence and Supply Agreement, such as is in place in Ireland between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but also in the UK between the Conservatives and the DUP.
If you are following this line you might like to mention that the word Tory comes from the Irish word tóraí (a bandit or outlaw).PAD:The Irish for DUP would be PAD (an Páirtí Aontachtach Daonlathach). So does that make them PAD-dies?
Advertisement
It’d be best to use the full name in the first instance before dropping acronyms.Teorainn Réidh:A frictionless border. Réidh can mean smooth and easy… but it can also mean finished.Athrú Aeráide:Climate change is an all-too hot topic that Brexit has drawn political resources away from but you may as well bring it up before your examiner does.
You could drop a line like “tá an fharraige ag fiuchadh” (the sea is boiling) into the conversation. Even better, delight your examiner with “tá an fharraige fhiáin ag fiuchadh” (the wild sea is boiling) which uses the classic three-word alliteration that made Peig Sayers so popular.Ospidéal/Otharlann:If you want to chat about the news, you might like to mention progress with a proposed hospital.
This gives you the opportunity to show you know both words for it –“dúirt mé ‘ospidéal’ ach is fearr liom an focal otharlann”.Lucht Leanúna na Simpsons in Éirinn:How do you segue from talking about the news to your favourite TV shows or memes?

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is due back in Brussels today in a last-ditch attempt to get EU leaders to delay Brexit.
Britain is due to officially leave the European Union on 29 March, just eight days away.
Yesterday May wrote to the EU asking to extend Article 50 until 30 June.
Other EU member states are due to consider her request at a summit in Brussels today, but a decision is not expected until next week.
A three-month extension would mean Britain doesn’t have to take part in May’s European elections; the new European Parliament is set to convene in July.
Responding to May’s request, European Council President Donald Tusk said he believes a short extension would be possible.
However, he said it would be conditional on MPs backing the Withdrawal Agreement drawn up by May’s government and the EU – a deal they have already twice rejected.
Tusk admitted that European leaders are suffering “Brexit fatigue” and said he feared his hopes may prove “frail, even illusory”.

In atelevised speechlast night, May hit out at MPs for not supporting her deal.
“You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with this. I agree. I am on your side,” May said, directly addressing members of the public.
Her speech was sharply criticised by many MPs, from across the political divide, who viewed it as an attempt to shift blame for the ongoing crisis from herself to others.
Conservative Sam Gyimah said “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.
Resorting to the 'blame game' as the PM is doing is a low blow. Democracy loses when a PM who has set herself against the HoC then blames MPs for doing their job. Distracts from Art 50 extension, all part of her strategy to run down the clock and rule out other options. Toxic.— Sam Gyimah (@SamGyimah)March 20, 2019Sam Gyimah MP/ Twitter

Describing her speech as “incendiary and irresponsible”, Labour MP Wes Streeting said May would be partly responsible “if any harm comes to us”, noting that MPs have been subjected “credible” death threats.

‘Constitutional crisis’
May’s appeal for an extension comes amid doubt over whether or not the House of Commons will vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
The planned vote was thrown into doubt on Monday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
Resignation threat?
In her letter to the EU, May said she intends to bring her deal back to the House of Commons “as soon as possible”, arguing that if it passed, she would need the delay to implement the treaty.
If the text is rejected a third time, a deeply divided parliament will have to decide what happens next.
“As prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30,” May told lawmakers, in comments interpreted as a hint about her own future.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
As the crisis rumbles on, a number of opponents are said to be eyeing up May’s job. Former Foreign Secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson is one of the frontrunners – something that could further split the Tories, with some MPs vowing to quit if he becomes leader,according to the Guardian.
May’s team is trying to engage senior members of the opposition, hoping to bring enough members on side to pull her deal through, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also be in Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
The pound fell sharply against the euro during yesterday – exactly 1,000 days on from the seismic 2016 Brexit referendum — reflecting fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without any agreement at all.
‘Credibility’
May yesterday said any postponement beyond the end of June would undermine voters’ trust. “It is high time we made a decision,” May said in her TV address.
Meanwhile, the European Commission advised EU leaders that it would be preferable to either have a shorter delay to 23 May — when voting begins in European Parliament elections — or a much longer one, until at least the end of 2019.
A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed London’s “clear request” and said she would “make every effort” to bring about an agreement at the Brussels summit.
But her foreign minister Heiko Maas, of the junior coalition partner Social Democrats, said May’s letter “only pushes the solution further down the road”.
In Paris, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had a tough message.
“A situation in which Mrs May is unable to deliver sufficient guarantees on the credibility of her strategy at the European Council meeting would lead to the request being refused and a preference for a no deal,” he told parliament.

https://www.the42.ie/camilla-sharples-gordon-elliott-cheltenham-2019-4531522-Mar2019/,"ONE OF THE more disappointing aspects of being an adult is finding out that, for all the warnings, swans are not strong enough to break your arm.
For all their bluster, for all their ‘you want some’ attitude, the fact is, such displays are mostly for show.
What is true of swans, however, is that no matter how serene they look on the surface, you can be sure their legs are working away frantically beneath the water.
The same is true for training horses.
The volume of work, and attention to detail, that goes into preparing horses for an event like the Cheltenham festival is easily forgotten in the agony and ecstasy of your six-horse, €5 each way, accumulator.
But whether a 40/1 shot lands the Champion Hurdle or an odds-on favourite falls at the last in a handicap he should be winning by 10 lengths, you can be almost certain it’s not for the want of trying on behalf on the horse’s yard.
For each individual horse coming from Ireland, Cheltenham can be a logistical nightmare. Deciding when the horse travels — especially if it is entered in multiple races — is just the tip of a post-it note iceberg.
Each horse needs a handler, and to be worked out every morning. They need feeding (at the same time every day for consistency), to checked by the vet, the farrier, and the trainer him or herself.
Now imagine organising that for 50 horses when, a week before the festival, you’re not altogether certain what they each will run.
It’s all in a day’s work for Gordon Elliott’s head girl, Camilla Sharples, who previously worked with Ferdy Murphy and Donald McCain in England before taking a role at Cullentra House four years ago.
“Cheltenham is the biggest meeting of the year for us,” she toldThe42this week. “It’s what our sport is centered on but it’s also the biggest challenge.
“There’s a huge amount of planning to go into it and it starts months in advance. But because horses are entered in multiple races, the final details can only be arranged pretty close to the festival so, as you can imagine. This week can be a bit hectic.”

Unlike some yards, work in Elliott’s doesn’t start at the crack of dawn and it’s all part of the trainer and staff’s philosophy to keep their horses as relaxed as possible.
Sharples’ job is to consider all of the things you probably don’t; from what jockey is going to ride out with each horse right down to the order in which they are loaded into their trailer on the way to the ferry.
“Horses can pick up on a lot, and they all have different personalities so you have to work around that as best you can,” says Sharples
“So a big part of my job is getting to know the horses and getting to know the people and understanding which people work best with which horses. To be honest, people do tend to have their favourites and those are usually the horses that respond best to them.”

It doesn’t always have to be the horses people look after in the yard either. Should Shattered Love run in the Gold Cup — she’s also entered into the Ryanair Chase — it will be Sharples who’ll lead her at Cheltenham despite the fact she doesn’t ride her in the yard or muck her out.
Another horse Sharples feels particularly close to is Bless The Wings, the cult hero who has finished second in the Cross Country at Cheltenham in two of the past three years.
“He’s just such a brilliant character,” says Sharples. “He really is a legend, even though he’s 14 now.”
When Elliott, Sharples, and the rest of the team actually get to Cheltenham, there’s little time to relax.
“It’s a much earlier start than at home. Not for everyone, but for me it certainly is.
“We’ll be on the go from around 6am and working right through to 8 or 9pm. It’ll be the usual stuff in the morning like making sure the horses are fed and checked over before getting them ready for the race itself.
“At Cheltenham, we like to get the horses in the day before they run to make sure they’re nice and fresh on the day of the race.
“To be honest, the meeting itself flies by as there’s so much going on while the races are happening. Then, once we’re finished for the day we’ll spend the evening making sure the horses that need to go home head off okay and then we’re planning for the following day.”
But the long hours and painstaking planning are very much worth it when you get a winner.

Last year, Elliott’s team had eight winners, enough for him to land the leading trainer’s title for a second successive year. 2018’s success was all the more remarkable when you consider the yard failed to make the winner’s enclosure on day one of the festival.
“I’d be lying if I said I’m not nervous until that first winner comes in,” says Sharples.
“But the other side of it is that, even if you only get one winner, you have to remember that a winner at Cheltenham is an incredible achievement when you consider this is the best of the best going head to head.”
Sharples is not a gambler herself, instead enjoying racing for racing’s sake. However, she does invest in horses in other ways.
Having bought Andy Dufresne for €30,000, she sold him last year — after less than a year of ownership — to JP McManus at Cheltenham for over €380,000 after he had won his point-to-point maiden.
Earlier this year, the horse went on to be an impressive winner in his first race at Down Royal but will sadly miss out at the festival after being tipped to run in the Champion Bumper.
She has reinvested some of her earnings in a young point-to-pointer she’s quite keen on while she was gifted another, the 12-year-old Kruzhlinin, who has won seven point-to-points in succession.
But could Sharples see herself as a trainer?
“No, I don’t think it’s for me. Gordon’s obviously a brilliant trainer and I do learn so much from him, but there’s a different set of skills involved.
“And even if you don’t get much of a chance to relax or a holiday — we’ve racing on Saturday and Sunday after we come back from Cheltenham — I love what I do. I wouldn’t change that at all.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/tree-felling-4530078-Mar2019/,"A PETITION ACCUSING councils of cutting down too many trees across the country hasreached over 5,500 signatures.
The petition wants councils to stop cutting down trees in public spaces without informing the public. It is supported by senators Frances Black and Grace O’Sullivan. O’Sullivan discussed tree felling in the Seanad on 27 February.
“A huge number of incidents of tree felling have been reported to myself and the Green Party over the past two weeks,” said O’Sullivan toldTheJournal.ie.
“The cutting done is often excessive, and that mature trees that are integral to communities and nature are being cut down, often in the face of public opposition.
“I think that all can agree that Ireland as a country needs more trees, not less,” she said.
The Forestry Act 2014 states that it is an offence for any person to uproot or cut down a tree unless the owner has obtained permission in the form of a felling licence from the Forest Service.
Deirdre O’Leary started the petition after seeing posts online about trees being cut down. She said a friend came to her after witnessing a tree being felled in Co Clare.
“He said the people cutting down the tree couldn’t tell him the difference between an oak and a sycamore, which really tells you something,” O’Leary said
“Every second person I talk to about this comes back to me with their own incidents.
“What we need is joined up thinking, to get the issue out there and to raise awareness,” she said.

Tree Strategy
Dublin City Council issued a ‘Tree Strategy’ in 2016 that outlines the city’s plan for public trees.
The plan states that there are an estimated 60,000 street trees and 40,000 trees in public parks in Dublin City.
Galway City Council has cut down 154 trees since January 2018 and warnings were given to local residents in the case of 115 trees.
County and City Councils contacted byTheJournal.iecited public safety, structural damage and storm damage as the reasons for trees being felled.
A spokesperson for the Parks and Landscape Services Division at Dublin City Council said there has been no increase in queries or complaints in relation to tree felling in the past year.
“In the period 15 Jan to 1 March 2019, Dublin City Council received 132 tree maintenance requests of which three related to trees which had collapsed,” the spokesperson said.
A spokesperson for Kildare County Council said the council carries out a programme of tree works and tree planting each year to replace removed trees.
The spokesperson laid a number of reasons for felling trees, including where they may be causing structural damage, are diseased, or are blocking public lighting, or in cases where they are damaged or where the public asks for them to be removed.
“In addition the council also carries out an annual programme of tree planting which is aimed at replanting in areas where trees were removed or would benefit from additional trees,” the spokesperson said.
“Most tree removals are as a result of requests from TDs, councillors, residents, residents’ associations, etc and to date we have not been informing residents.
Maureen O’Sullivan, founder of Tree Preservation Ireland and Save Ireland’s Trees, said Councils across the country were “butchering” trees.
“They should be doing everything in their power to conserve and plant more instead of chopping and destroying more trees,” said O’Sullivan.
She said that the health and climate benefits of trees should be considered by councils before cutting them down.

NORWEGIAN AIRLINE HAS announced that it is to temporarily operate a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to operate US flights from Dublin Airport after the 737 MAX fleet was suspended from European airspace yesterday.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)made the decisionto suspend all flight operations of the aircraft in Europe after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight to Nairobi in Kenya on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.
Sunday’s crash comes four months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia killing 189.
Earlier yesterday, Norwegian confirmed that it is temporarily suspending its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX.
The airline has now confirmed that it will temporarily deploy a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to operate US flights from Dublin Airport to support affected customers.
Affected customers are being provided with text and web updates, according to Norwegian.
Customers booked on affected transatlantic routes to and from Ireland serviced by the 737 MAX will be rebooked onto flights using the 787-9 Dreamliner.
The 787 Dreamliner, registered G-CKWF with Charles Lindbergh on the aircraft tail, will operate the Dublin-New York Stewart (SWF) route daily.
The first flight will be operated today on flight D81763 from Dublin Airport to New York Stewart International Airport (SWF) at 3.20pm.
The airline said that arrangements are being made to accommodate passengers booked to travel from Dublin to Stewart and Providence on the new Dreamliner service, with plans to bus passengers to Providence upon arrival in New York.
“We would like to apologise to affected customers and we remain committed to ensuring that customers can continue to travel on Norwegian’s network,” the airline said in a statement.
The airline had launched flights with the Boeing 373 MAX aircraft from Dublin to the US east coast in 2017.

Aircraft suspension
Announcing the airspace ban, the EASA yesterday said that it is “continuously analysing the data” emerging relating to Sunday’s crash and that the decision to suspend Boeing 737 MAX operations in Europe was taken as a “precautionary measure”.
The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) made a decision earlier yesterday to temporarily suspend the operation of all variants of the Boeing aircraft into and out of Irish airspace.
“This decision has been taken based on ensuring the continued safety of passengers and flight crew, which is the IAA’s number one priority,” the IAA said.
A Norwegian flight to Newburgh, Orange County, New York – due to leave Dublin Airport at 3.20pm yesterday – was cancelled. An earlier 2.55pm flight to Providence was also cancelled.
There are 13 Boeing 737 aircraft on the Irish aircraft register. The IAA said it will continue to work closely with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and the manufacturer Boeing.
Responding to the suspensions, Boeing said safety is its “number one priority” and it has “full confidence” in the safety of the 737 Max.
Advice for passengers
The Commission for Aviation Regulation (Car) has advised affected passengers to be aware of their entitlements.
In the event of a flight cancellation, the air carrier must offer you the choice between the following:
If you choose the first option the airline must provide you with care and assistance while you wait for the alternative flight.
‘Care and assistance’ comprise:

The Republican senator made the disclosure yesterday at a Senate hearing on the military’s efforts to prevent sexual assaults and improve the response when they occur.
McSally, a 26-year military veteran, was in the ninth class at the Air Force Academy to allow women, where she said sexual harassment and assault were prevalent.
She also told yesterday’s hearing that she felt like the system was raping her “all over again” when she tried to discuss the issue with officials, adding that she was ashamed and confused over the incident.
McSally did not say whether her assaults happened at the academy or during active duty, and did not name the alleged perpetrator, but focused on a need for accountability.

“I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences was handled,” she said. “Like many victims, I felt like the system was raping me all over again.”
Despite staying silent for years, McSally said she felt like speaking out after watching the military grapple with how to handle sexual assaults.
Captain Carrie Volpe, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the branch was appalled at and “deeply sorry” about what McSally’s experience.
“The criminal actions reported today by Senator McSally violate every part of what it means to be an Airman,” she said in a statement.
“And we stand behind her and all victims of sexual assault. We are steadfast in our commitment to eliminate this reprehensible behavior and breach of trust in our ranks.”

TWO CONSULTANTS FAILED to provide evidence of tax compliance, the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) Commission has said.
Sipo has today releasedreportsinto its investigations into non-compliance of the Ethics in Public Office Acts by Mr Ciaran Brady, consultant at Mercy University Hospital in Cork, and Dr Bryan Jones, consultant at Galway University Hospital.
Under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, appointees to senior positions of employment in, or to directorships of, public bodies are required to provide evidence to the commission of compliance with taxation legislation within statutory timeframes.
The two consultants failed to comply with their obligations upon their appointment to senior office.
The commission wrote to Brady and Jones on 12 July 2018 advising them of their obligations. Both men had not provided the necessary evidence by the deadline of 11 August.
Sipo, at its meeting on 12 November last, decided to investigate and ultimately found that both men had contravened the 2001 Act.
As legally required, the commission has given copies of the reports to the Oireachtas as well as the doctors’ employers.

SipoSipo
In a statement released today, Sipo noted that senior office holders in a wide range of public bodies, not just the medical profession, “must provide evidence of tax compliance on appointment”.
The commission stated that most individuals who are notified of their obligations do comply, adding that it launches an investigation “if an individual fails to comply or does not engage”.
People escaping scrutiny
The statement added that there “may be a number of appointees to senior office that have escaped scrutiny as not all public bodies notify the commission of appointments to public office”.
There is no statutory requirement for public bodies to do this and, as a result, the commission admitted that adherence to its request has been “inconsistent”.
In its most recent annual report, Sipo noted the difficulties it continues to experience in this regard.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-dublin-directly-elected-mayor-4527666-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR says that Dublin should have a directly elected mayor similar to London or Paris with a single assembly representing the whole city.
Speaking at the Dublin European Parliament Convention in Clontarf in Dublin this evening, Varadkar said that a directly elected mayor for the capital will “take a little more work” than Waterford, Cork and Limerick, however.
There have been calls for directly elected mayors in Ireland since the early 2000s. On 24 May, plebiscites will be held in Waterford, Cork and Limerick where voters will decide whether or not they want a mayor with real power to replace the largely ceremonial Lord Mayor roles.

The future of Dublin’s local government model, however, will fall to a citizen’s assembly which will be held later this year. Dublin is divided between four local authorities with a total of 183 councillors.
Varadkar has said that a directly elected mayor in Dublin could take over central government functions in the future and has called for smaller borough councils to be established under a mayor’s office.
“My own view, is that we should adopt the London or Paris model with a single assembly for all of Dublin headed up by a directly elected mayor dealing with issues like planning, transport and housing even taking on functions currently carried out by central government,” Varadkar said this evening.
“Below that we should have neighbourhood or borough councils dealing with the issues that are truly local covering much smaller areas that people identify with like Lucan, Tallaght, Swords, Clontarf, Dún Laoghaire and Rathmines – to name a few”.
“But that’s just my view, and we’ve much work to do before we can put a thought-out proposal to the people of Dublin to vote on”.

In London, the Greater London Authority is made up of the mayor’s office – currently led by London mayor Sadiq Khan – and a 25-member London assembly which monitor’s the mayor’s office and the decisions it makes.
Varadkar also said this evening that the Local Property Tax will not be increased on Fine Gael’s watch, despite property prices rising in Ireland.
“The vast majority of homeowners won’t see any increase at all,” he said. “It’s simply a case of adjusting the bands upwards to reflect the upward increase in property prices. We’ll talk more about that in the months ahead”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/children-court-cases-privacy-volume-concerns-4533899-Mar2019/,"PRIVACY AND CAPACITY are among the concerns that the courts face in handling family law cases, a report has said,and suggested a dedicated Family Court.
The Child Care Law Reporting Project, led by Dr Carol Coulter, was published today.
One of the “most striking” issues that the report highlights is the volume of cases dealt with by certain courts, and the difficulties this posed both for the judges attempting to deal with childcare cases.
“In another District, the judge can have over 120 cases listed on family law days.”
Another serious problem, which is related to the overcrowding issue, is privacy.
Under thein camerarule (meaning only those involved in the legal process can attend, and media and members of the public cannot), all family law proceedings including child care, must be confidential to the parties and their lawyers.
“Yet in many courts privacy can be limited, with all litigants and witnesses milling around in large open areas outside the courtrooms, often discussing their cases here with their lawyers.
Advertisement
Physical conditions in the different courts also varied widely.
In some courts, there were no ramps or lifts, so that access for children’s buggies was difficult.
A total of 292 child care cases were dealt with in the 35 courts attended, an average of 8.3 per day, three-quarters of them in other lists along with other cases.
Of the 292 cases, 156 (53.5%) were extensions of interim care orders. Forty-six (16%) were reviews of care orders, with the other cases involving initial interim care orders, access matters, appointments of guardians ad litem, extensions of care orders, supervision orders, lifting the in camera rule, a child returning from the UK or requiring detention, and after-care plans. Fifty-one cases (17.5%) were adjourned.

There are 64 judges on the District Court; 44 judges are assigned to a location and 20 are “moveable” judges, who can be called in to any district to assist with lengthy or complex cases.
Dr Coulter explained that “it is clear from the above review of all the districts that in some of them the courts are severely over-worked, which cannot but have an effect on how child care proceedings are dealt with.
“In a quarter of the courts we attended, child care was included in general lists, meaning that vulnerable families had to attend court along with those accused of crime.
“Specialist family courts, with specially trained judges and court staff, in a number of venues around the country, would mean that what are often vulnerable families could have their cases dealt with sensitively in a suitable environment, where their privacy would be assured.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/china-huawei-us-4528004-Mar2019/,"TECH FIRM HUAWEI has launched legal proceedings against the US government in a bit to overturn a law that bars federal agencies from buying its products.
It comes as the Asian company aims to counter warnings from US authorities that its products could aid Chinese intelligence services.
Huawei said that its case filed in a US district court in Plano, Texas, will challenge a 2019 defence bill that prevents government agencies from buying its equipment, services or working with third parties that are Huawei customers.
The US is said to have long considered the telecoms company a threat, with fears centering on its relatively new status as a global power in this field.
It has warned that Huawei’s equipment could be manipulated by China’s government to spy on other countries and disrupt critical communications, and is urging nations to shun the company.
A law recently enacted by Beijing that obliges Chinese companies to aid the government on national security has added to the concerns about Huawei.
However, this move towards legal action from the telecoms company is being seen as a signal that it will use all means – including the courts – to prevent attempts to exclude it from a race to the 5G market.
“The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,” Huawei’s rotating chairman Guo Ping said.
Guo said the company was seeking unspecified damages.

“The US government is sparing no effort to smear the company,” he said at a news conference at the tech giant’s corporate headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
Guo even countered that the US government “has hacked our servers and stolen our emails and source code”, without providing details.
The lawsuit says the legislation is an “unconstitutional exercise of executive and/or judicial power” and deprived Huawei of a “fair hearing” to rebut the allegations against it.
PR drive
Huawei has been engaged in a PR drive in recent months in a bid to challenge allegations it was being used to spy on other countries, with its founder Ren Zhengfei denying claims against the company in a number of foreign interviews.
This new clash in US court comes against the backdrop of ongoing US-China trade talks and the December arrest of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, Ren’s daughter.
A Canadian court yesterday set a 8 May date for the start of Meng’s hearing into a US extradition request over charges that she and Huawei circumvented US sanctions against Iran.
Two affiliates also have been charged with stealing trade secrets from telecommunications group T-Mobile.
Two Canadians were subsequently detained in China in suspected retaliation over Meng’s arrest.
Huawei officials said the company, which operates in 170 countries, had never been party to any major security breaches and never received any request from the Chinese government to install security “backdoors” in its equipment or to gather intelligence.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sean-quinn-ibrc-4536288-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Mar 2019
THE LONG-RUNNING dispute between the children of Sean Quinn and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) opened before the High Court today.
The case relates to loans of €2.34 billion that were provided by Anglo Irish Bank to Quinn Companies. It is the case of the Quinn children that they received no legal advice in relation to these loans and, although they signed various documents related to them, they were only shown the “signature page” which they then signed.
They would have signed these documents related to the loans because of their senior roles within the Quinn Group but it was argued in court today that their father Sean Quinn was directing the control of the business.
Furthermore, it is alleged that Quinn had built up a significant stake in Anglo, the bank was fully aware of what was going on, and left the children facing “disastrous consequences” as a result when the bank began to fail.
The legal action was first filed in 2011, but it faced delay as criminal cases progressed against a number of former Anglo officials.
The Quinn children deny any liability for share pledges and guarantees in relation to these loans in this case against IBRC – the successor to Anglo.
The case opened this morning before Mr Justice Garrett Simons in the Four Courts in Dublin. Firstly, it began with an opening statement from Bernard Dunleavy SC, on behalf of Aoife, Brenda, Ciara, Colette and Sean Quinn Jr.
Dunleavy said that, during the 2000s, it would have appeared on paper that the plaintiffs were to be “regarded as being among the richest people in the country”.
“They have and continue to have modest lives,” Dunleavy said. “Money generated by the business belonged to their father and not to them.”
The transactions at the centre of this court case between Quinn Group and Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 onwards relate to loans forwarded to Quinn Group to meet certain commitments it had made in regards to shares.
Advertisement
Such commitments came in the form of contracts – called CFDs – that were based on Anglo’s share price and effectively a gamble on what direction it would go. As the bank’s share price began to nosedive from late 2017-onwards, it meant that the Quinns’ investments were heavily exposed by this fall.
Prior to the bank’s collapse, Quinn had built up a 24% stake in the bank.
This “ultimately had disastrous consequences” for the plaintiffs, Dunleavy said.
He said it would be the Quinns’ case in this trial that they signed documents relating to these contracts, but did so without financial or legal advice. Furthermore, he said that these documents were signed by the Quinn children without reading the full agreements,  and the plaintiffs accused Anglo of breaching its duty of care to them.
Dunleavy said that the children were not responsible for the financial transactions with Anglo in this regard that had such negative consequences for them.
“[Sean Quinn] had total operational control of the business,” he said. “What he said, went. The possibility of refusing a request from their father was something beyond their comprehension.
Dunleavy added that when the “jig was up”, Sean Quinn “gambled with his children’s property, not his own”. “It’s the consequences of that gamble that the children have to live with today,” he said.
The senior counsel added that his team had combed through case law to find any such similar case before the courts, and could not find one.
He further alleged that Anglo never sought to meet the children at various stages that directly affected them, and that it was the view of the plaintiffs that Anglo wasn’t just a “bad bank but the worst bank”.
A separate case, taken by IRBC against members of the Quinn family, alleges a conspiracy to strip assets worth €455 million from companies in the Quinn international property group.
It will take place after the conclusion of this case, which is expected to take up to six months.
It is believed that witnesses in this case could include David Drumm, former head of Anglo Irish Bank who is currently serving a six-year term in Mountjoy prison.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jodie-chesney-london-murder-4529992-Mar2019/,"A SECOND ARREST has been made in connection with the fatal stabbing of 17-year-old Jodie Chesney in Romford, London.
The Metropolitan Police arrested a man in London this morning on suspicion of her murder.
A 20-year-old man was also arrested earlier this week in connection with the killing. Both men are currently in custody.
Police were called to a park in East London at 9.25pm on Friday, 1 March, where they found Jodie suffering from a stab injury.  She was pronounced dead later that night at 10.26pm.
A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as trauma and haemorrhage.
“This was a savage, evil attack. We’re progressing well with the investigation and continue to ask the public to assist us,” said Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, leading the investigation.

The Metropolitan Police said that Jodie was with a group of around five teenagers socialising in the park on Friday evening.
Jodie’s friends noted two men in the park who left around 9pm and returned around half an hour later. When they returned they walked straight towards the group.
Jodie was stabbed once in the back by one of the men.
“At this time, there being no clear motive is very unusual. We retain an open mind and can’t rule anything out,” said Whellams. “If you suspect something may be amiss then you need to let us know.”
Yesterday, Jodie’s family called on anyone who might have information about her “outrageously violent” murder to come forward.
Jodie’s father, Peter Chesney, said her family will remember her as “fun, honest, true, pure and innocent”.
“I had never had to worry about her affiliating with anyone involved in knife crime. If I had talked to her about it, she would have said ‘I already know’. She understood.
“Jodie was the nicest person. Everything about her was thoughtful and kind. She wouldn’t have done anything to deserve this. They [those responsible] have destroyed something beautiful. Jodie needs justice and we need justice,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/the-irish-for-some-words-for-practical-objects-tools-or-activities-dont-have-a-direct-english-equivalent-4530577-Mar2019/,"This the latest dispatch from our columnist Darach Ó Séaghdha, author of the award-winning and bestselling Motherfoclóir.
Every Sunday morning, Darach will be regaling (re-Gaeling?) us with insights on what the Irish language says about Ireland, our society, our past and our present. Enjoy.
A FEW WEEKS ago, celebrated scientist (and uncelebrated non-linguist) Neil DeGrasse Tyson observed that “Italy valued cathedrals while Spain valued explorers; so worldwide, five times as many people speak Spanish as Italian”.
To paraphrase another celebrated scientist, Wolfgang Pauli, this theory is not even wrong.
Spain is heaving with cathedrals and still building one in Barcelona, Italy was not a unified country with a single language during the age of European global conquest, and the tenacity of Spanish as a spoken language in South America owes much to factors other than a secular, scientific love of exploration.
Throughout history, communities with different languages have come into contact with each other and, for better or for worse, some words have scurried from one tongue to the other.
However, it’s rare enough for those two languages to approach each other with the same amount of agency, and the kinds of words exchanged tends to reflect this.
Consider in English where the animal has an Anglo-Saxon name (pig, sheep, cow) but the meat name comes from French (pork, mutton, beef) – the poor people who looked after the animals spoke a different language to the rich people who would eat it.
I think of this phenomenon sometimes when people mock certain Irish words for being too close to English ones, likeróbatfor robot,goraillefor gorilla.
The vocabulary of the Irish language has evolved with terms that reflect everyday life in Ireland for centuries, and in many cases suggest practices and traditions which are no longer in use.
Here are some words for practical objects, tools or activities which do not have a direct English equivalent.
Gairtéar:This is a string used to tie a bag closed, not to be confused with afuathlainn,a thread used to secure bait to hook.
Sacshrathair:This means a stuffed sack.
Advertisement
Such an object can have many uses, such as propping a door open. A similar object would be a scrathóg which is an inflated bladder to be used as a vessel, ball, prop etc. Appropriately enough, a scrathóg can also mean a windbag.
Briogadán:It probably wouldn’t pass health and safety regulations today, but a briogadán is a stick with a burning tip that was used in a children’s game from years ago.
Other stick words include apasúr- a pounding-stick used in clothes-washing and a cipín – a little stick or the clamps used when performing a castration.
Croisínteacht:If you were gathering seaweed with a pole having a hook and crosspiece, you would be ag croisínteacht. If you used a different seaweed gathering technique, you would have to find a different word.
Gabhad:Whether you carry it on a pitchfork or in your hand, this is a burning sod carried as a torch.
You might retrieve such a sod from alagpholl, a hollow in a recently cut bog. Agabhadmight be lit with anathghual,which is a lump of burnt coal or cinder used for rekindling fires.
Corpfhiacha: Corpmeans body andfiachmeans debt (it also means tooth or a raven), so this compound word refers to those debts incurred for personal services.
Certain seaweeds were deemed to have peculiar qualities; breachtraíocht means using herbs to make charms, cures or spells.
Beiltí:These are ground oats for malting; regular oats arecoirce(not to be confused withcorcra,purple).
Speaking of colours and food,cróchadhdescribes the practice of colouring foods or fabrics with saffron.
Clochscríbhinn:Finally, this word means an inscription on stone.
The last word got me thinking about what George Orwell said – that history was a palimpsest. That is a chalkboard which can be scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary.
In these Orwellian times, it is more important than ever to record our heritage as though it was carved in stone.

GARDAÍ HAVE ARRESTED two people after a “substantial quantity” of drugs, worth an estimated €850,000 was seized at a house in Navan, Co Meath last night.
During the search at a house at Tailteann Drive, a significant quantity of drugs comprising of cannabis in herbal form, MDMA in ecstasy tablet form, cocaine, diamorphine, a large amount of suspected mixing agent and other drugs related paraphernalia was found.

The total estimated street value of the drugs seized is €865,000 (subject to analysis).

A man aged in his early 50s and a woman in her late 30s were arrested at the scene. Both were taken to Kells Garda Station where they are detained under the provisions of Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.
Gardaí said that this was “a very significant seizure”, that “disrupted the sale and supply of drugs in Meath”.
The searches were led by the Meath Divisional Drugs Unit, assisted by Navan Detective Unit and the Regional Armed Support Unit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/banned-hit-and-run-driver-who-seriously-injured-cyclist-jailed-for-five-years-4544784-Mar2019/,"A HIT-AND-run driver who was banned from driving when he seriously injured a cyclist has been jailed for five years.
Jonathan Wainyae (33) of St Attracta Rd, Cabra, Dublin pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing serious bodily injury and to failing to stop at the scene of a collision at Strand Road, Baldoyle, Dublin 9 July 2016.
Judge Patricia Ryan sentenced Wainyae to six years imprisonment for the dangerous driving offence with the final year suspended on conditions.
These include that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years and engage with the Probation Service for 18 months post release. She also disqualified him from driving for 25 years.
Ryan also sentenced him to two years imprisonment for the charge of failing to stop at the scene. She backdated both sentences to 12 July 2018 and said they would run concurrently.
Detective Sergeant David Ennis told the court that the victim was well illuminated on the night. Jones Justino DaSilva was cycling home around midnight after finishing a shift in a restaurant in Howth when he was knocked off his bike by a car driven by Wainyae.
He suffered a spinal fracture and fractures to his right leg and as a result he was unable to continue working. He told the court that the effects of the injuries put a strain on his marriage and he and his wife eventually split up.
In an emotional statement to the court DaSilva, a Brazilian national, said he came to Ireland with his wife to improve his English.
He said that after the accident he thought he was going to die. He said the period afterwards was very difficult and it took him a long time to recover.
Speaking through a Portuguese translator, he said he had to return to Brazil after the accident and felt depressed and suicidal at times.
“It changed my life very much. I had so many plans. My life was turned upside down. My marriage broke down,” he said.
‘If I could turn back time’
In a written apology, read out in court by his defence barrister, Pieter Le Vert, Wainyae said “if I could turn back time and change what happened, I would.”
“I’d like to apologise to you and your family for the hurt and pain I have caused you. I only wish that I could sit down with you and explain in person that I thoroughly regret my actions.”
Wainyae, who was subject to a driving ban when he hit the cyclist, told the victim that “you were in the right place, it was me that should never have been on the road that night.”

He finished by saying “I don’t expect you to forgive me. I do want you to know how sorry I am.”
Responding to this, DeSilva told the court that he accepted the apology.
“I’ve no issue against him. I would like this situation to make him think and he can have a better life in the future. It was probably a very hard time for both of us.”
“From now on I can do my life and he can do a better life,” he said.
The majority of Wainyae’s 92 previous convictions are for road traffic offences, but he also has convictions for assault, theft and drug dealing. LeVert said he went into custody in 2014 and came out with a “full blown” heroin addiction.
He is currently serving a five year prison term imposed in 2016 for robbery. His barrister told the court that he is engaging with an addiction treatment programme in custody.
Ryan said the aggravating factors in the case were his initially denying any involvement, his being disqualified from driving at the time, his having had 12 disqualifications in the past and the effect the collision had on the victim.
She said the mitigating factors in the case were his guilty plea, his apology, his remorse, his efforts at rehabilitation and the fact that he is using his time in custody well.
‘Glass fragments’
Ennis told the court that the investigation into the incident was painstaking with a huge amount of garda man hours involved.
Gardaí tracked the car back to a housing estate where Wainyae’s then partner Imelda Fitzsimons was living.
The car had damage to the windscreen and front bumper and the two front tires were burst. Gardaí checked the car registration and found the vehicle was registered to Fitzsimons. They called to her home and overheard her and Wainyae arguing.
She confirmed the car was hers and Wainyae told gardaí he was in the house all evening with his partner. An analysis of Wainyae’s mobile phone revealed that his phone was in Howth that evening and that his partner had called the device a number of times.
Before leaving the house, gardaí seized a piece of clothing belonging to Wainyae, who denied being in the car that night. A forensic analysis of this top found glass fragments from the car.
A number of eye witnesses told gardaí that they saw the car being driven at speed shortly before the collision.
Wainyae pleaded guilty on an arraignment date and a trial was never sought, Le Vert said. He told the court that nobody saw his client driving the car and the case against him came down to forensics and CCTV footage.
Ennis told the court that while Wainyae’s apology was well received by the victim, he felt it came very late.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mulhuddart-shooting-appeal-4528747-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ IN WEST Dublin have appealed for information following the latest gangland shooting in the capital.
Lee Boylan, who is in his mid 20s, was shot a number of times as he sat in a van in traffic at the junction of Blakestown road and Huntstown Way in Mulhuddart.
He was treated at the scene by emergency services personnel and removed by ambulance to Connolly Hospital. He has since been transferred to Beaumont Hospital where his condition is understood to be critical.
The injured man was the driver of a white VW van registration number 151D43908 and stopped in traffic at the junction when he was approached and shot a number of times in the upper body by a gunman.

It’s understood the gunman had gotten out of the passenger seat of a black or grey BMW. This car was then driven to nearby Saddlers Lawn where it was set alight, while the gunman fled on foot to Huntstown Lawn.
The investigation is being led from the incident room in Blanchardstown Station, enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made to date.
Speaking this afternoon from the scene of the incident Superintendent Liam Carolan gave descriptions of two men who were involved in the incident.
He said: “We are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to yesterday’s shooting incident to contact the incident room at Blanchardstown Garda Station. We are particularly interested in the movements of a black /grey BMW 320 coupe, registration number 05KY5360, seen around the Blakestown Road area or adjoining estates yesterday between 9am and 5pm. We understand this BMW car was recently purchased in the Ronanstown area and we would also be anxious to speak to anyone who has observed this car between 9/2/2019 and 6/3/2019 to contact us.”
“Finally, we would like to speak with anyone who was in the Saddlers Estate, Mulhuddart when the BMW was set alight. The driver of the BMW car is described as approximately 6ft tall, approximately 40-50 years of age, with grey facial hair. He was wearing a baseball cap and a hooded top.”

https://www.the42.ie/joe-schmidt-six-nations-wash-out-human-cult-of-coach-4549530-Mar2019/,"“We’d certainly encourage the genuine supporter not to lose faith in the team.”
FOR THOSE WHO are truly devout in the cult of the coach, belief remains unshaken and the heretics concerned by Ireland’s Six Nations wash-out must be speaking in tongues.
A common response during Ireland’s seven-week struggle was that it’s better to see all this unpleasantness play out now, rather than at the World Cup.
When any nation was ever offered a straight choice between the two is anyone’s guess.
Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
A separate theory involves the most blindly robust faith and a belief that Joe Schmidt must surely be holding back his most prized powerplays for September and October. Perhaps it will remain a divine mystery until World Cup quarter-final weekend.
For now, all we can judge Ireland by is their performance over the past seven weeks and the inescapable shadow of their brilliant 2018.
Having beaten New Zealand for a second time, Ireland were second in the world and chasing first, they had every right to have a swagger about them moving into the new international season. Yet Ireland’s grand plan seemed to unravel as soon as they got that first punch in the mouth.
From the immediate post-match reaction all the way to Stuart Lancaster’s view yesterday, most are in agreement that the opening day humbling at home to England put Ireland out of kilter. But the most worrying thing was how – save for 60 minutes against a French side who are also far from their best – they never really recovered.
It’s concerning enough that this Ireland side are unable to overturn half-time leads, but what sort of brittle confidence exists in a side who is undermined and eaten away by a six-week old loss?  Is there no way back in the World Cup if Scotland find a way to win in Yokohama?

Inpho / Billy SticklandInpho / Billy Stickland / Billy Stickland
We doubt there is any lack of confidence or steel about the determination and character of Ireland’s playing group. But they have looked incredibly uncertain about their purpose over the course of the Six Nations.
While he can be depicted as infallible at times, Schmidt made errors which extended far beneath the Cardiff roof – though playing in warm, humid conditions with a deafening home support would not have been the worst preparation for Japan.
From thrusting Robbie Henshaw back to fullback after molding him to be a gainline-making centre, to letting Sean Cronin take the fall for the performance in Rome while allowing others to play their way into form, there are clearly matters of man-management and judgement which could form a list of ‘work-ons’ for the outgoing coach.
The Kiwi doesn’t tell the media if he’s mulling areas of improvement in his own game, however. His infamous attention to detail is always focused on his players. It’s an approach that remains consistent when things are going well for his Ireland team and he was noticeably absent from on-field celebrations on the three occasions when Ireland had a trophy to parade.
He will look to his players now too.
Having Henshaw in midfield will surely make a difference. A fit Dan Leavy too. Devin Toner’s presence and calm experience at the line-out was for years a central tenet of Ireland’s pack and the plays they spring from it.
Most of all, Schmidt will hope Johnny Sexton can rediscover the form he showed before entering the Six Nations after a month out injured and without a competitive minute of rugby under his belt.
Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
Schmidt chose to play him despite any doubts over his form or fitness, because the out-half has been the constant of all his success since leaving Clermont — from the Heineken Cup final comeback under the Cardiff roof in 2011 to the home win over the All Blacks which feels so much longer than four months ago.
With six months to run before the defining period of the World Cup, and far less actual preparation time, the head coach is not going to overhaul Ireland’s gameplan or tear up his favoured team-sheet, because he has been poring over this World Cup plan since the last one.
So Ireland will have to deliver more of the same, only better.

“There aren’t too many weeks where I don’t get a letter from somebody saying I should be picking this player or trying to do this in the game,” Schmidt said ahead of the win over Scotland this year.
“And that’s when we’re winning. When we lose, you expect three letters. A lot of people describe how we’re playing and what Plan A, B or C is.
“I’ll leave them to do their analysis and we’ll do ours and try to keep improving.”
Little over a month on and Schmidt sat in Cardiff attempting to spin a third-place finish into a positive while Warren Gatland celebrated another Grand Slam and the number two-ranking that came with it.  Things had not improved.
Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
Schmidt will depart the job at the end of the year having greatly increased Ireland’s standing in world rugby. As a man who built his reputation on details and a scientific approach, Schmidt more than anyone will know that blind faith alone won’t sustain the growth and iron out the creases so evident throughout the Championship.
It will take more than fresh set of powerplays. There is work to be done, mysteries to unravel and contingencies to be examined if Ireland are to break new ground at the World Cup.

Police in Coleraine have appealed for witnesses after a series of burglaries at a number of premises in a business park in the Gateside Road area of the Derry town last night.
One of the premises effected was the base for the Coleraine Coast Guard, which had to stand down because of interference to computers and other equipment.

The interference forced the coast guard come offline today, making the unit unable to attend emergency calls on a day of poor weather.
Detective Sergeant Gardiner said that all of the burglaries occurred overnight, and that a number of different items were stolen from each premises.

YOUTUBE HAS REMOVED a channel that featured children playing with toy guns and whistling after police arrested their adoptive mother for allegedly starving them, locking them in closets and pepper-spraying them.
The Fantastic Adventures channel had more than 700,000 followers and 240 million views.
The seven adopted children told investigators of “having to participate” in the YouTube shows, a court document says.
“They stated they are disciplined in the manners above if they do not recall their lines or do not participate as they are directed to,” says the document filed in Pinal County, Arizona.
The children were aged between six and 15.
One alleged that “her mother would spray her and her siblings with pepper spray all over their face and body,” while another “stated they would go days without food, water,” the document said.

They were also “locked in the closet for days at a time” and two said they were sprayed or pinched in the genitals, it added.
Officers from Maricopa, outside Phoenix, said the children “appeared to be malnourished”.
Arrested last week, Machelle Hackney (47) – known as Machelle Hobson on her channel – was charged with seven counts of child abuse, two counts of child molestation, five counts of unlawful imprisonment and seven counts of child neglect.
Police told AFP today that she remains in custody after a Tuesday hearing, but her two biological sons, also arrested, were released.
Ryan Hackney and Logan Hackney, both 27, are charged with seven counts of failing to report abuse.
The adopted children also appeared in superhero costumes on the channel, which YouTube took down yesterday.

A SYRIAN REFUGEE and his son have been buried in New Zealand in the first funerals of last week’s twin mosque attacks in Christchurch.
Hundreds of mourners gathered in the morning at a cemetery near Linwood Mosque, one of two places of worship targeted, to lay Khalid Mustafa and his son Hamza to rest.
The family arrived last year as refugees from the Syria. Khalid (44) and Hamza (15) were shot dead on at the Al Noor Mosque, the first attack site.
Jamil El-Biza, who came from the Sydney area to attend the funerals, said at the graves of his brother and father: “I shouldn’t be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you.”
Also attending was Abdul Aziz, an Afghan refugee who confronted the gunman at Linwood Mosque. He was embraced by many mourners.
A total of six burials are expected to take place today.
Speaking of the Mustafa family, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said: “I cannot tell you how gutting it is to know that a family came here for safety and for refuge, and they should have been safe here.”
Islamic custom dictates that people have to be buried as soon as possible after death – but the scale and devastation of Friday’s massacre of 50 people in Christchurch has delayed the handover of bodies to next of kin.

Police said yesterday that just six bodies have been released so far, and a total of 12 victims identified. Waves of volunteers have driven or flown in to Christchurch to help ease the burden on exhausted locals.
“We are a Muslim community, regardless of where we are situated through the country and the world, there is always going to be a connection with other Muslims when tragedy occurs,” Javed Dadabhai, a volunteer from Auckland, told AFP.
While there has been no figures on the number of volunteers who have travelled to Christchurch, large numbers have been walking in and out of a family support centre near the Al Noor Mosque where dozens were killed by a white supremacist.
Ardern said today that the world needs to confront the dangers posed by social media.
“There is an argument there to be made for us to take a united front on what is a global issue,” she said at a press conference in Christchurch.
“This is not just an issue for New Zealand, the fact that social media platforms have been used to spread violence (and) material that incites violence.”
She has also called on New Zealanders to not utter gunman Brenton Tarrant’s name.
“He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless,” she said.
The 28-year-old was arrested after the shootings and is expected to spend his life in prison as New Zealand has no death penalty.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-what-does-it-take-to-raise-your-children-through-irish-4526671-Mar2019/,"IT IS FUNNY how the smallest thing can change the course of your life.
Like a lot of people, I was terrible at Irish in school. However, I always wanted to speak the language fluently. Even after I finished the Leaving Certificate, I kept studying it, hoping one day that I could speak Irish as comfortably as English.
One day, near the end of my time in college, I told a friend about trying to learn Irish. She said she knew someone who was raised in an Irish-speaking home.
She said her friend’s father was an Englishman who had gotten a job at an Irish university.
He had decided that as he was moving to Ireland, he should learn Irish, and not only did he master the language, he insisted on making it the language of his home.
This story blew my mind. To think that someone who wasn’t even Irish could come to Ireland and learn the language so successfully that he spoke it as his daily language was humbling but heartening at the same time.
Before, my goal had been to be a fluent Irish speaker, but that had changed. Now, nothing would do other than to master Irish and then raise my children through the language.
Fast forward to ten years. I finally speak Irish reasonably fluently. I am also married, and our first child is on the way.
While I still want to raise my children through Irish, things have turned out differently from what I originally envisioned. My wife is American, and I am living and working in New Jersey.
Could I raise my children through Irish in the United States? I had heard of at least one other family in New Jersey that spoke Irish as their home language.
In fact, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 22,000 people spoke Irish at home in 2008, making it the 76th most widely spoken language in the country.
But what did raising children bilingually involve?
All the articles I read said that the only effective way to do it was for one parent to speak the target language at all times with their children. That meant I would have to speak nothing but Irish to our daughter.
My wife and I were both nervous about the idea, for different reasons. I really wanted to do it, but I also knew that there were some gaps in my own Irish. In some cases, I would have to learn as I went.
My wife had learned little bits of Irish over the years but was only a beginner. She was worried that she wouldn’t understand what was being said in her own home by her family members half the time.
But, as an American, she also didn’t have any of the baggage that some people at home have about Irish. She was willing to give it a go, and when our daughter was born, I committed to speaking only Irish with her.
The first thing I noticed about my daughter was that she had long eyelashes. I didn’t know what the Irish for eyelashes was (fabhraí), so I had to look it up!
Although I had a good standard of Irish by the time she was born, I have improved greatly since, as I have had to figure out the Irish word for every little thing around the house, and everything that a three-year-old might want to talk about.
Advertisement
My wife mostly speaks in English to our daughter, but she includes some Irish as well. My wife understands a lot of Irish now, of course, because she hears it every day. When I speak to her, I use Irish when I know it is something she will understand, and English otherwise.
It has been fascinating to watch my daughter’s language development. She mostly speaks English but understands everything in Irish. There are also lots of words that she only knows the Irish for, so she mixes them in with English.
For example, I took her to my office one day, and when she saw my computer she yelled: “Wow, what a beautiful ríomhaire!”
But she can speak a decent amount of Irish as well. She knows that if she wants, say, ice cream, she is wasting her time asking me in English. She also (worryingly) already understands that she can use Irish to manipulate me.
I was flicking through our TV one day when she saw something she recognised.
She shouted “Crocodile Song”  but I ignored her because I was looking for something else.
Odd as it is to say, but in some ways, I feel it is easier to raise a child through Irish in the United States than Ireland.
Here, when we go out in public, we are just another family speaking a foreign language.
But I didn’t feel as comfortable speaking Irish around other people when we visited back home last summer. Even though I know most Irish people would probably be impressed to hear you speaking Irish, I did worry that some might think I was being “elitist” or had some ulterior motive using Irish with my daughter in public.
No-one said anything, but I never fully shook that uneasy feeling during our stay.
The downside of not living in Ireland, of course, is that my daughter won’t have the chance to attend a Gaelscoil or avail of many other opportunities to develop as an Irish speaker outside of her immediate family.
Some might wonder why I should speak Irish with my daughter at all, since (especially if she lives her life in the United States) she may never use the language outside of the home.
But I remember my youth, and how I badly wanted to be able to speak Irish, a feeling a lot of Irish people, unfortunately, know too well.
This the greatest gift I can give her, and I am willing to make every sacrifice to ensure she has it. If she decides as an adult not to use it, that is fine.
I will be content knowing that she, unlike many Irish people, actually had a chance to choose to speak it if she wished.
Meanwhile, my wife and I had our second daughter in November, so our little American Gaeltacht is growing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/deal-brexit-attorney-general-cox-4536608-Mar2019/,"
IN A MUCH-ANTICIPATEDpiece of advice this morning, the Attorney General for England and Wales has said that the latest Brexit deal still presents a ‘legal risk’ of the UK being trapped in the backstop protocol.
In his officiallegal opinionto the Prime Minister, Geoffrey Cox said that much of what was agreed between Theresa May and negotiators in Strasbourg last night bolstered the legal standing of the assurances given by the EU to the UK.
“I now consider that the legally binding provisions of the Joint Instrument and the content of the Unilateral Declaration reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the Protocol’s provisions at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU,” he told May.
However, he also noted that the legal risk “remains unchanged” in relation to the UK being able to leave the backstop protocol arrangements if there was no act of ‘bad faith’ on either side.
Addressing the House of Commons to give more detail on his legal advice he told MPs that what was agreed last night improves the withdrawal agreement and that the House had to make a political judgement about whether the deal was justified.
He said the provisions of the joint instrument announced in Strasbourg “extend beyond mere interpretation of the withdrawal agreement and represents materially new legal obligations and commitments”.

“There is no doubt in my view that the clarifications in the joint statement and unilateral declaration make substantive and binding reinforcements of the legal rights available to the UK.”
He added: “Matters of law can only inform the political decision each of us must make.”
A large number of MPs and the DUP had earlier said they would not decide on their intentions for this evening’s vote on the deal until they had heard from Cox.
As Cox was speaking this afternoon, the Financial Times reported that it was unlikely the Northern Ireland party would back the agreement this evening.
“A DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) source has told the FT ‘no’, they cannot see how the party can back the PM’s deal,”the paper reported.
Elsewhere, political reporters in London said there were indications some Tory MPs who voted against the deal last time around may now back it.
Geoffrey CoxPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said earlier this morning that he believes the new arrangements appear to “fall short” of what May has promised, but added that his party would reserve judgement until they heard the Attorney General’s advice.
That advice would now indicate that they will remain opposed to May’s deal. Labour had already announced that it would vote against the deal.

Last night, May hailed the ‘legally binding changes’ to the Withdrawal Agreement that she had secured during talks with the EU.
The House of Commons is due to vote on the deal at around 7pm after a debate this evening. Last time there was a meaningful vote on a deal, it was voted down by a majority of 230 votes.
If it fails again, parliament will vote on a no-deal Brexit or an extension to Article 50 which could delay Brexit if the EU is amenable.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last night reiterated that there would be no changes to the Withdrawal Agreement and no further chances to renegotiate.

https://www.thejournal.ie/miriam-ocallaghan-distressed-over-scam-product-ads-court-hears-4542230-Mar2019/,"BROADCASTER MIRIAM O’CALLAGHAN claims she has been defamed in a series of “false” and “malicious” adverts containing her image and name that have appeared on social media.
The High Court heard that O’Callaghan intends to seek damages over the advertisements that first appeared on social media platforms Facebook and Instagram in May 2018.
The adverts contain various misleading and defamatory headlines wrongly suggesting that O’Callaghan has left her job with RTE’s Prime Time.
The court heard O’Callaghan has “nothing to do” with the adverts, which are linked to offers for skin care products.
She is most distressed at being associated against her will with what has been described as “a scam product,” the court heard.
She claims that persons, whose identities remain unknown to her, have placed these adverts in order to exploit the trust placed in her by the Irish public and have damaged her good name and reputation.
‘Targeted ads’
It is claimed that the paid for adverts, known as “targeted advertisements” appear on social media user’s newsfeeds, and are designed to encourage the user to click on the adverts.
Those who click on the adverts are offered various skin care products, which are falsely stated to be owned or endorsed by O’Callaghan.
The pages also wrongly state that she has left her position in RTE to focus on the promotion of the skincare range, it is alleged.
It is also claimed that users who avail of an offer of free trials of the skin care products have reported that had money debited from their bank accounts which they did not authorise.
It is claimed that individuals have contacted O’Callaghan complaining that they have been victims of this alleged false advertising, and have had to cancel bank cards after ordering the free trial.
O’Callaghan wants a permanent injunction restraining the publication of the adverts, as well as damages for malicious falsehood, unlawful appropriation of personality, various breaches of her constitutional rights and defamation.
The Court heard that she intends to bring proceedings against both Facebook, which owns Instagram, and those persons behind the adverts.
O’Callaghan’s lawyers say that at present they do not know who is behind the adverts.
Advertisement
As a result, O’Callaghan’s lawyers have brought a motion against Facebook Ireland seeking an order directing it to provide her with information that identifies or may assist in identifying those who have placed the ads on Facebook.
At the High Court today the broadcaster secured permission from Justice Leonie Reynolds to serve short notice of its proceedings, seeking information about those who paid for the adverts, against Facebook Ireland Ltd.
Permission was granted on an ex-parte basis.
The Judge said she was satisfied to grant the order and said she accepted the urgency of the application.
‘Immediately removed’
Seeking the order Paul O’Higgins for O’Callaghan said his client was seeking an order known as a ‘Norwich Pharmacal’ order against Facebook aimed at obtaining information about those behind the adverts.
Counsel said his client requires the names of those behind the adverts so she can bring a defamation action against them within the required 12 month period.
Counsel said that last June his client’s solicitor Paul Tweed wrote to Facebook seeking to have the adverts immediately removed.
Last August Facebook Ireland said in an email the material had been removed.
Counsel said that did not happen and within weeks of receiving that assurance from Facebook, his side wrote back stating the adverts were still appearing, and that O’Callaghan’s complaints were not being appreciated nor appropriately addressed.
The also sought information about those behind the adverts from Facebook
Counsel also said the adverts appeared with increased frequency 18 December and 19 January.
Counsel said that solicitors for Facebook informed O’Callaghan’s lawyers that it required a court order to assist with the request to identify and provide information about the advertisers.
As a result, O’Callaghan seeks orders seeking information from Facebook about those behind what counsel said are defamatory of the broadcaster and misleading the public into buying the alleged scam product.

https://www.thejournal.ie/student-who-engaged-in-extreme-bullying-escapes-conviction-but-told-to-donate-e1000-to-poor-box-4542754-Mar2019/,"A JUDGE HAS ruled that a schoolboy involved in “extreme bullying” of a younger boy at a school, will escape a conviction for assaulting the boy, in lieu of a €1,000 contribution to the court’s poor box.
Evidence of the case was heard before Limerick District Court last year. The victim (13) was stamped upon and repeatedly beaten by older pupils at the school, on unknown dates in March 2015.
At the accused’s sentencing hearing today, his solicitor alleged there had been a serious lack of supervision of students at the school at the time.
Water was thrown in the boy’s face, his head was banged against a wall, and, on occasion, he was directed to “kiss the shoes” of the culprits, the court previously heard.
The accused, who pleaded guilty to one count of a Section 3 assault causing harm, was one of a number of students involved in bullying the boy, the court heard.
Others were not prosecuted as they had accepted juvenile cautions from gardaí.
‘A case of extreme bullying’
Solicitor Ted McCarthy, defending, claimed there had been “little or no supervision” of the students in the school at the time of the bullying, which he said was “akin to a time of Lord of The Flies”, referencingWilliam Golding’s novel about a group of boys stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves.
“They were totally unsupervised. The school environment these boys were placed into was a disgrace. If there was proper supervision none of this would have occurred,” McCarthy said.
“They’re not adults, these were all young impressionable boys, full of testosterone, and, occasionally stupid,” he argued.
“They’re boys. To allow them in that environment, unsupervised, something was bound to happen, and it did,” he told the court.
The victim who was not present in court, was recovering well from the ordeal, gardaí said.
Inspector Helen Costello told the court: “He changed school afterwards. He’s doing really well.”
Costello praised the boy for speaking out, which she said was “a most important thing” in the case.

“It was a typical case of extreme bullying. The (accused) was in fifth Year and (the victim) was in First Year, there was a considerable age difference,” she said.
Costello said the matter was raised at a “national level” in An Garda Síochána after it was initially brought to the attention of the Limerick “Garda Protective Services unit”.
‘Never again’
The accused, now aged in his early 20s, apologised for what had occurred, and said that he would “never do it again”.
The court heard that, at the time of the bullying, he was stressed because of a separate ongoing family matter.
The accused confirmed he had attended twelve sessions of counselling “to deal with anger” issues, and had become a volunteer with a charity group.
In line with the judge’s orders from an earlier hearing, the accused paid €3,110 in compensation to the boy. He also wrote a 10,000 word essay about the impact of bullying on victims.
O’Leary said she was impressed with the essay. She added: “It is a very good essay and I do think it would be very worthwhile for schools to read it.”
Copies of the essay are to be furnished to the victim and to the school.
The victim does not accept an apology offered to him by the defendant, it was heard.
Imposing her sentence, O’Leary noted the defendant was “a young man who his just starting out” and that a “conviction would follow him for the rest of his life”.
“He was not the only one involved,” the judge noted.
The defendant, who is attending university and is earning €80 a week from a part-time job, was given 12 months to make a €1,000 contribution to the court poor box, in lieu of a conviction for assault, and a €1,200 fine.
“I hope you have learned your lesson and it won’t happen again,” the judge told the accused.
The court heard civil proceedings involving the parties, and arising out of the same matter, is pending.

https://www.thejournal.ie/newry-primary-school-website-accidental-url-4529368-Mar2019/,"A NEWRY PRIMARY school was left red-faced after an IT mishap allowed their former school web address to be taken over by a hardcore porn website.
St Ronan’s Primary School has a new website, but for an almost 24-hour period, anyone who typed the name of the school into Google was met with search results that directed them to the hardcore Russian pornography site.
When searching for the school’s name on Google, the first three results displayed links with information relating to the school.
However, when you clicked on the actual link, users were instead directed to a porn website with categories including ‘humiliation’ and ‘spandex’.
Mix-up
The mix-up occurred when St Ronan’s launched its new website. Principal Kevin Donaghy explained: “St Ronan’s didn’t own our old domain name, we bought it from a third party who had it before us, and we hired it off them in a sense. They would normally bill us to re-register it.
“But we didn’t know that our old domain had expired, nor were we informed that it was due for renewal. The third party purchased it from GoDaddy, who emailed the people who own the domain three times to tell them the domain name was due for renewal. But they didn’t pick up on this and they didn’t invoice us to renew it. GoDaddy did all they could to inform the third party that it was due for renewal.”

St Ronan’s had been transitioning to a brand-new website to celebrate its 25th anniversary.
Donaghy said: “We are 25 years open this year, and we informed parents that our old website would stay in its current position but that we would be launching a new one for our 25th anniversary.
It is an incredibly complicated issue, one hampered by the international factors at play. Donaghy explained some of these obstacles: “This is a hugely complicated and grey area and it involves working across time zones and international boundaries. We are a school in Ireland, GoDaddy’s HQ are in America, we are dealing with somebody who bought our old domain, and they are in Russia. This is something that spans internationally. I can understand how hugely complicated this is for everybody.”
Principal Donaghy is not aware of why the St Ronan’s domain name was targeted in this way, but was informed that there is often a dark trade in domain names. “I honestly don’t know what the motivation was behind the people who bought it,” he said.
“We are led to believe there is a trade in expired domain names, and whether that’s for good or bad intentions, there are people out there waiting for a domain name to expire to elicit money for them,” he continued. “This was not the case with us, we never got approached at all to pay for it to be taken down, nor was any money paid for it. But there is a trade in that.”
Kevin Donaghy praised the efforts of GoDaddy, who own the rights to the original web domain name. He also praised the PSNI and C2K, who offer IT services to schools in Northern Ireland.
“Because we’re probably the first school that this has happened to, it is a learning curve for all of us,” he said. “But I must say, Go Daddy in Belfast were offering advice and had been very good, as had the PSNI, as had C2K.”
SDLP Councillor Gary Stokes labelled this mishap as “vile”, and further said that it was “shocking and absolutely malicious.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/tusla-website-4524453-Mar2019/,"THE CHILD AND family agency has today launched a new website, designed by young people with experience in care, to help children understand what it means if Tusla is involved in their lives.
The concept for the website,called Changing Futures, came from a group of young people with lived experience of Tusla’s services.
The young people involved in the project felt they had not fully understood why the agency was involved in their lives or the roles of some of the workers they encountered.

They came up with everything from the name and logo to the colours, design, images and layout. They said they spent a lot of time writing and rewriting the language to explain the common words children in care will hear and to try to make them seem less scary.

Currently there are two sections on the website, aimed at children from 10 to 15 and 16 to 18, but another section for six to nine-year-olds will soon be added.

“Videos are big part of this website because we feel as a group young people are more likely to get their information from watching videos,” Mark Gray, one of the research group members said.
“We have filmed workers from Tusla that explained their roles in a child-friendly way so that young people can learn a little bit about the work they do before they access Tusla services.
“We have filmed young people that have a positive experience of being involved with Tusla – this is the best part of the website because it shows other young people that getting support is okay, and it shows them that help can work.”
Pay Smyth, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Tusla said the website is “a compelling example of what can be achieved when children and young people are given the opportunity to get involved with Tusla decision making and to make a real difference to Tusla services”.
“ChangingFutures.ieis the first website of its kind, and was only possible due to the immense creativity, passion and innovation embodied by this group of young people. The young people involved in this project are a testament to the young people that have engaged with Tusla services.”","12.39pm, 5 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/directly-elected-mayors-4552462-Mar2019/,"DIRECTLY-ELECTED MAYORS in Cork, Limerick and Waterford will get a raft of new powers and the same salary as a Minister of State.
The job comes with a salary of around €94,535, which is the basic salary of a TD, plus €35,319, which is added on to the basic wage for Minister of State. The newly elected mayors will therefore get €129,854.
If all three mayors are approved, then the total cost of running the offices in the three regions, will be less than €1 million per year.
There will also be a recall and impeachment procedure to deal with any misconduct by any future mayor.
Today, the Cabinet discussed the new proposals, which will be put to a public vote in plebiscite, due to happen on the same day as the local and European elections on 24 May.
Advertisement
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the policy paper on the new powers, which will be published soon, outlines the nomination process, which Varadkar said is similar to that of someone running for the Dáil.
The powers of the directly elected mayors involves a “significant transfer of powers” to the elected mayor from the council.
The newly-elected mayors, if the public decide to vote for such a change, will be able to bring forward the council budget and development plan. However, individual decisions on planning will remain with the chief executive.
The relationship between the mayor and the council CEO is similar to that which exists between a Secretary General of a government department and their line minister.
The first election will be held in 2021 and the mayors will sit for a two-and-half year term with five-year term kicking in from 2024
The plan is to roll out the mayors in Cork, Limerick and Waterford first, with the Taoiseach stating that “Dublin is going to take a little bit more work given the fact there are four local authorities involved”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/supreme-court-clears-way-for-us-extradition-of-dublin-man-on-child-pornography-charges-4551678-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019
THE SUPREME COURT has cleared the way for the extradition to the United States of Eric Eoin Marques, a man accused of being the world’s biggest facilitator of child porn.
The decision brings to an end Marques’s lengthy legal battle before the Irish courts against his extradition.
Today, a five-judge Supreme Court unanimously dismissed his appeal against a decision of the High Court and Court of Appeal that he be surrendered to the US authorities.
Now aged in his early thirties, Marques is wanted by US authorities to face charges relating to conspiring to distribute and advertise child pornography, and advertising and distributing child pornography.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation claims he is owner and administrator of an anonymous hosting site known as Freedom Hosting.
Marques, with an address at Mountjoy Square, Dublin, has been in custody since his arrest in August 2013 after being refused bail over concerns including he represented a flight risk and may interfere with evidence.
Last year the Supreme Court agreed to hear Marques’ appeal on the basis that it raised points of law that were of public significance.
The appeal, aimed at halting his surrender, centred around the DPP’s decision not to prosecute him in Ireland for the same offences the US authorities want to prosecute him for.
His lawyers asked the Supreme Court whether the Minister for Justice was under an obligation to seek reasons from the Director of Public Prosecutions as to why Marques was not being prosecuted in Ireland for the offences he is accused of.
The court was also asked if the reasons given by the Minister in making the decision to extradite Marques were adequate.
The State, represented by Ronan Kennedy Bl, had argued that the appeal be dismissed.
Court’s decision
Giving the court’s decision, Justice Peter Charleton said what was at issue in the appeal was the nature of the Minister for Justice’s discretion under the 1965 Extradition Act to decline to extradite a person, even though the courts have enabled extradition and no prosecution is to proceed.
Advertisement
The judge said that under the 1965 Act the Minister when fulfilling international obligations on behalf of the state which are separate from the courts, retains an entitlement to refuse extradition of a suspect.
He added that the Minister “was not under an obligation to seek reasons from the DPP as to why a suspect is not being prosecuted in Ireland”, and has a separate function from the DPP.
In addition, Justice Charleton said that the reasons given by the Minister in the circumstances of this case not to seek reasons from the DPP why Marques was not to be prosecuted in Ireland were adequate, the judge added.
In all the circumstances the judge said the appeal should be dismissed.
Justice William McKechnie, Justice John McMenamin, Justice Iseult O’Malley and Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan all concurred with Justice Charleton’s decision.
The court then lifted the stay on the extradition order made by the lower courts clearing the way for Marques’ surrender to the US authorities.
Marques was not present in court for today’s judgement.
Order for extradition
In 2015, the High Court made an order for his extradition.
That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, and an application to have the case considered by the European Court of Human Rights was refused.
He was due to be extradited in but wrote to the Minister for Justice requesting that the extradition not proceed.
The Minister signed an order on 31 May 2017 directing Marques surrender.
That decision was then challenged in the courts.
In November 2017, Justice Aileen Donnelly dismissed that action, and her judgement was upheld last year by the Court of Appeal.

THE PSNI HAS said there are a “significant number” of people who were present at the hotel where three teenagers died in a crush ahead of a St Patrick’s Day disco, and urged parents to encourage their children to come forward to help police find answers.
17-year-old Lauren Bullock, 16-year-old Connor Currie and 17-year-old Morgan Barnard have been named as the three young people who lost their lives inthe incident outside the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown, Tyrone on Sunday night.
At a press conference this afternoon, detective chief superintendent Raymond Murray – who heads up the Serious Crime Branch – said: “Over a day into our investigation I can tell you we have already traced the identities of over 160 witnesses and have already spoken to a number of young people who were in the queue at the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night.”
However, he said that initial CCTV footage has indicated there was as many as 400 people were in the queue or car park at the time the incident took place.
Murray said that some parents had indicated they are concerned their children – many of whom were underage – were trying to enter a licenced premises.
“I want to reassure you, the focus of our investigation is not the age of people who were at the event – it is about trying to find answers for the families of the three teenagers who tragically died – we need to know what you saw so the heartbroken families of Connor, Lauren and Morgan know what happened to their children,” Murray said.
Tributes
A number of different groups paid tribute to the teens who died on Sunday.
Euphoria Allstar Chearleading group said everyone who knew Lauren, one of their senior athletes, was devastated by the news.
Her coach wrote on the group’s Facebook page:

“My heart is broke writing this. You where the most down to earth, beautiful soul and our Coral team will never be the same without you. You where an incredible cheerleader and were the backbone of our team.
Connor Currie’s GAA club, Edendork Gac, said the club and community are “deeply saddened”. They described him as a “much loved and highly thought of player”.
“Connor will forever be remembered with the greatest affection by all associated with our club and indeed the wider Edendork community.
“We are all in shock at Connor’s untimely passing, to lose a dear friend and team mate is one of the most difficult life experiences you will have to face.”
Connor and Morgan Barnard both attended the St Patrick’s Academy and the school yesterday held a prayer service and made counsellors available to support pupils.
“We pray for the happy repose of the souls of Connor, Morgan and Lauren and offer our deepest condolences to their families. We pray, also, for all in our school and in the wider community who have been affected by this terrible tragedy,” the school said.
President Michael D Higgins has also offered his condolences to the families affected by the tragedy.
“As President of Ireland may I express what I know is the shared grief of the people of Ireland at the terrible loss of life of young students in the tragedy that took place in Cookstown, County Tyrone on St Patrick’s Day,” he said.
“May I offer, in particular, my condolences to the families of the victims and to the pupils of the schools in Dungannon that I visited recently.”
Other young people who were caught up in the crush have already been sharing their experiences, with one yesterday describing the incident as “the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my life”.
She and the two friends she went to the disco with escaped without injuries but she knew Morgan Barnard, one of the teens who was killed in the incident.
She said everyone had gone there  for an enjoyable night, “but unlike the rest of us, they didn’t make it home”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/new-zealand-gun-laws-mosque-terror-4545791-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|15 Mar 2019
NEW ZEALAND’S PRIME Minister Jacinda Ardern has said her country’s gun laws will change as a result of a massacre of 49 people at two mosque in Christchurch.
Speaking at a press conference today, Ardern said that one of the attackers who entered the mosques had a gun licence.
One man was arrested and charged with murder, and two other armed suspects were taken into custody while police tried to determine what role, if any, they played in the cold-blooded attack that stunned New Zealand.
It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, noting that many of the victims could be migrants or refugees.
She pronounced it “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.
The gunman who carried out at least one of the mosque attacks posted a jumbled, 74-page manifesto on social media under the name Brenton Tarrant, identifying himself as a 28-year-old Australian and white supremacist who was out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims.
Jacinda Ardern said the gunman, a 28-year-old Australian, obtained a “Category A” gun licence in November 2017 and began purchasing the five weapons used in the attacks in the southern city of Christchurch the following month.

The firearms included two semi-automatic rifles, two shotguns and a lever-action weapon, she said, speaking to reporters in Wellington, before heading to Christchurch.
“The mere fact… that this individual had acquired a gun licence and acquired weapons of that range, then obviously I think people will be seeking change, and I’m committing to that,” she said.
“While work is being done as to the chain of events that led to both the holding of this gun licence, and the possession of these weapons, I can tell you one thing right now — our gun laws will change.”
Ardern noted several earlier attempts to reform the laws in 2005, 2012 and 2017. She said options to consider would include a ban on semi-automatic weapons.
She also confirmed that the gunman and two suspected associates who were also arrested had not been on the radar of any intelligence agencies, even though he had published a manifesto online indicating plans for attacks on Muslims.
“They were not on any watchlists either here or in Australia,” she said.
“The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community, nor the police, for extremism,” she added.
“I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response. That work is already underway.
“Given global indicators around far-right extremism, our intelligence community has been stepping up their investigations in this area.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mozambique-deaths-cyclone-4550944-Mar2019/,"
THE DEATH TOLL from a cyclone that smashed into Mozambique and Zimbabwe has risen to more than 300, as rescuers raced against the clock to help survivors and the UN led the charge to provide aid.
“We already have more than 200 dead, and nearly 350,000 people are at risk,” Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi announced, while the government in Zimbabwe said around 100 people had died but the toll could be triple that figure.
The UN, meanwhile, said that one of the worst storms to hit southern Africa in decades had also unleashed a humanitarian crisis in Malawi.
The storm is affecting nearly a million people and forcing more than 80,000 from their homes.
Four days after Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall, emergency teams in central Mozambique fanned out in boats and helicopters, seeking to pluck survivors from roofs and treetops in an inland sea of floodwater, sometimes in the dead of night.
Air force personnel from Mozambique and South Africa were drafted in to fly rescue missions, while an NGO called Rescue South Africa said it had picked up 34 people since Friday night, using three helicopters.
“It is the only way to access the people that are stranded,” Rescue SA’s Abrie Senekal told AFP, saying the NGO was trying to hire more helicopters.
‘Like a tsunami’
Ian Scher, who heads Rescue SA, said the helicopter teams were having to make difficult decisions.
“Sometimes we can only save two out of five, sometimes we drop food and go to someone else who’s in bigger danger,” he said.
In Nhamatanda, some 60 kilometres northwest of Beira, 27-year-old Jose Batio and his wife and children survived by climbing onto a roof.
But a lot of their neighbours “were swept by the water”, he said.
“Water came like a tsunami and destroyed most things. We were prisoners on the roof,” he told AFP after they were rescued by boat.
The city of Beira, Mozambique’s second largest city and a major port, was immediately cut off after the storm. According to the Red Cross, the cyclone damaged or destroyed 90% of the city of half a million people.
President Nyusi, speaking today after attending a cabinet meeting in the ravaged city, said the confirmed death toll stood at 202 and nearly 350,000 were “at risk”.
The government declared a national emergency and ordered three days of national mourning, he said.

“We are in an extremely difficult situation,” Nyusi said, warning of high tides and waves of around eight metres in the coming days.
Yesterday, Nyusi had said he feared more than 1,000 had died and more than 100,000 people were in danger.
Zimbabwe toll
The storm also lashed eastern Zimbabwe, leaving around 100 dead, a toll that could be as much as 300, local government minister July Moyo said after a cabinet briefing.
“I understand there are bodies which are floating, some have floated all the way to Mozambique,” he said.
“The total number, we were told they could be 100, some are saying there could be 300. But we cannot confirm this situation,” he said.
At least 217 others are missing and 44 stranded, officials said.
Worst hit was Chimanimani in Manicaland, an eastern province which borders Mozambique.
Families started burying their dead in damp graves yesterday, as injured survivors filled up the hospitals, an AFP correspondent said.
Military helicopters were airlifting people to Mutare, the largest city near Chimanimani.
The storm swept away homes and bridges, devastating huge areas in what Defence Minister Perrance Shiri said “resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war”.
Some roads were swallowed by massive sinkholes, while bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods.
Aid
The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said it was mobilising aid for some 600,000 people, saying the world did not yet appreciate the scale of the “massive disaster”.
So far, it has dispatched more than five tonnes of emergency provisions to the affected areas.
In Malawi, 920,000 people have been affected by the cyclone and 82,000 people have been displaced, the UN said.

What sets it apart from the other tell-all, confessional type films is the skill with which it tells a deeply complex story, in a deceptively simple manner.
It does this by escalating the viewers’ emotional responses in increasingly powerful ways.
First off, you are introduced to the key players: to the fore, of course, is Michael Jackson, the most successful musician of his generation and at the time the most famous man in the world.
The events the film deals with occur during the period he was at the pinnacle of his fame and his performing abilities – the BAD album was topping charts all over the world and Jackson was a constant presence on television, newspapers, magazines and radios all around the globe.
Next up are Wade Robson, James Safechuck and their families.
At the outset, you are already aware they have a story to tell, and you are, initially, a little unsure of them. Both, though, are articulate, measured, good-looking men in early middle-age.
They do not come across as angry or hysterical, and the stories they begin to share are all about wish fulfilment in its simplest form.
Then how they got to meet him and both went on to become an important part of his life.
In the first hour, you sit through home movies, concert footage, television advertisements, music videos – the viewer is immersed in the sights, sounds and fashions of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
That was a time when our child protection sensibilities were a lot less developed than they are now.
There are some gentle prompts. Safechuck’s mother says she initially refused to allow her ten-year-old son to sleep in the same room as Jackson as it just didn’t seem right to her.
Wade’s mother was less astute and says she just didn’t see anything wrong with the proposal and of course her seven-year-old son was begging her to allow him to share Jackson’s bed.
What harm could it do?
At this point, you’re a little uncomfortable, but the hammer still hasn’t fallen.
You see, you’ve become used to the idea of Michael Jackson as an alleged child abuser. There were some well-publicised court hearings, none of which resulted in prosecutions.
The world watched from a distance, tutted a few times, and looked away. Reed’s documentary pulls those gazes back front and centre.
Wade and Safechuck begin to tell of the sexual abuse they claim they experienced at Jackson’s hands without any real preamble.
Their story moves from joyful, exciting, fun-filled days with their hero to seemingly relentless sexual molestation rapidly and no detail is spared.
Their stories have polarised opinion and elicited emotional outbursts across both the mainstream and social media.
The main argument in Robson and Safechuck’s favour posits that everyone knew this was going on, and finally, we have evidence – two survivors are bravely stepping forward and speaking their truth. Jackson was a monster.
The backlash is equally vocal: both Robson and Safechuck have, in the past, denied any abuse took place, and are therefore just attempting to cash in on Jackson’s notoriety.
Advertisement
The pop star is not here to defend himself so all we have is one more allegation on top of the others. It proves nothing – Jackson is no more guilty now than he was before Leaving Neverland was released.
Both stances hold some merit. However, permit me to bring a child protection worker’s eye to the situation.
Arch manipulation?
Survivors of sexual and physical abuse often repress their experiences, to all intents and purposes forgetting they occurred.
This is a psychological tool to help the person cope with the magnitude of what happened – the pain, the shame and the guilt.
So the fact that the two men changed their story is not unusual and in no way diminishes the credence of their testimony.
What I found extremely compelling is the conflict that plays across Robson and Safechuck’s faces as they speak. There is still love there, still some damaged form of loyalty.
Both say they were not afraid of Jackson, that they believed they were having a relationship with him. They even hint at a form of consent being given.
Over the years, both men defended their alleged abuser in the court cases against him.
Wade even admits to sobbing when he heard the singer was dead, something the mother states he did not even do when his own father died.
Definitive?
The confusion, the devastation, the sadness and the sheer, raw anguish that is evident in Leaving Neverland all hint at real validity. But is that enough? Can the details of this film be given the undisputed stamp of the definitive?
The answer has to be ‘no’.
Compelling or not, what the film presents is the unproven accounts of two young men and their families. While it is deftly presented and adorned with all the skills of a master filmmaker, it would not stand up in court and offers one view of a relationship.
Jackson can never be asked to corroborate, and too much time has passed for a forensic examination.
So in terms of clarifying whether or not Michael Jackson was a paedophile, Leaving Neverland is just one voice amid a choir of such choruses.
Hiding in plain sight
However, the film does offer a different kind of truth that might be just as important.
Whether sexual abuse was a feature or not (and you can choose to believe or not as you see fit) he isolated them, he manipulated them and eventually disposed of them.
Whether you take the fundamentals of their story as true, what Reed presents in all their battered glamour are the damaged lives of two young men and the obliteration of their families. Robson’s father died by his own hand.
I believe the anger that has erupted since the documentary broadcast is as much an expression of collective guilt as it is a remonstrance against the two men at the centre of the controversy.
What he did when our eyes were turned cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but I think we can all be sure that it was wrong.

https://www.the42.ie/jon-walters-2-4556462-Mar2019/,"Gavin Cooney reports from Victoria Stadium, Gibraltar
IRISH CAPTAIN SEAMUS Coleman has hailed the retiring Jon Walters as an “inspiration” for both erstwhile teammates and future Irish stars.
35-year-old Walters announcedhis retirement on social media earlier today, forced to call time on his career because of an Achilles injury.Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of Ireland’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Gibraltar, Coleman paid a rich tribute to Walters.
“As long as he and I have been in the squad, he has been nothing short of an example to all of us. The pride: every time he has played for his country he has been an inspiration to all of us.
“These new lads that are in the squad in the next few years, he is a real example and he will be missed.”

Walters scored 14 times in 54 appearances for Ireland, and messaged Mick McCarthy last week to ask were it possible for him to visit the squad in Abbottstown this week. McCarthy phoned back to invite him in and learned of Walters’ decision.
Walters told the rest of the Irish players in camp this week.
“It is sad to see him go. It happens to all of us. He was an inspirational player for Ireland and it’s sad when you lose those kinds of players”, said McCarthy.
“It is sadder still that it’s for an injury. I wish him well in whatever he chooses to do.
“I’ve known for the best part of a week.
“It’s sad we are losing him.”
Of Walters’ 14 goals, his double against Bosnia in the second leg of the Euro 2016 play-off were arguably the most important.

“Unfortunately he got injured before the Euros in 2016 so it didn’t go as well as he would have liked”, said Coleman, “but I feel he nearly carried us there, the night he scored two against Bosnia.
“He will be remembered for that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mcdonalds-eu-appeal-big-mac-trademark-4550962-Mar2019/,"FAST FOOD GIANT McDonald’s has appealed the EU trade mark office decision cancelling a trademark for its iconic Big Mac.
In the latest round of the brand battle between McDonalds and Galway-based Supermacs, the US fast food giant has lodged notice of appeal with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based at Alicante in Spain.
McDonald’s has yet to lodge grounds of appeal.
However, Supermacs CEO Pat McDonagh said today that he is “not surprised” that McDonald’s has lodged the appeal.
It is expected to take at least one year for the EUIPO to decide on the McDonald’s appeal and that delays further Supermacs’ application to have its own Supermacs trademark registered Europe wide to enable the business expand.
That application is being strenuously opposed by McDonald’s and the EUIPO has told each party in correspondence that the Supermacs trademark application won’t be made until the Big Mac trademark cancellation dispute is finalised.
McDonagh said that the McDonald’s move to appeal the Big  Mac cancellation ruling “is a delaying tactic” concerning Supermac’s plans to make its brand Europe-wide.
He said that the issues concerning the Big Mac trademark cancellation “is a sideshow compared to the real prize of getting the Supermacs brand registered across Europe” for selling fast food.
McDonagh said: “We are at this for four years so one more year doesn’t bother us. I am very confident that we will get the decision on the Supermac’s trademark. Common sense shows that we are certain to win it.”

Ongoing dispute
In January, (EUIPO) said that McDonald’s had not proven genuine use of the contested trademark, Big Mac as a burger or as a restaurant name.
As part of McDonald’s submission claiming that the ‘proof of use’ of the Big Mac, McDonald’s submitted a printout from en.wikipedia.org, providing information on the Big Mac hamburger, its history, content and nutritional values in different countries.
Separately, McDonald’s also claimed significant sales figures in relation to Big Mac sandwiches for the period between 2011 and 2016 along with brochures and printouts of advertising posters, in German, French and English, showing Big Mac meat sandwiches.
In its detailed ruling, the EUIPO stated that having examined the material listed in its entirety, the Cancellation Division found that the evidence is insufficient to establish genuine use of the trade mark.
The EUIPO stated that “as far as the printout from en.wikipedia.org is concerned, it is noted that Wikipedia entries cannot be considered as a reliable source of information, as they can be amended by Wikipedia’s users and therefore these could only be considered relevant as far as they are supported by other pieces of independent concrete evidence”.
The EUIPO further stated that in the case, the remaining pieces of evidence which were submitted do not provide information about the extent of use and therefore, the excerpt from Wikipedia does not change the conclusions reached in that respect.
A spokesman for McDonald’s in January stated that the EUIPO decision “did not take into account the substantial evidence submitted by McDonald’s proving use of our BIG MAC mark throughout Europe”.
The spokesman stated that McDonald’s was confident that the decision will be overturned by the EUIPO Board of Appeals.
On its Big Mac burger, the spokesman said: “We have a range of intellectual property protection across the brand at an EU and national level and this remains unaffected by the recent EUIPO decision.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-deadlocked-meaningful-vote-4534195-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Mar 2019
“WE ARE APPROACHING the position of a hard Brexit,” according to Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, following today’s Cabinet meeting which focused on Brexit.
This morning, Donohoe said he met heads of Revenue, NTMA, Central Bank and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to discuss their Brexit preparations this morning.
He told reporters that a no deal will have a “sudden, immediate and negative effect”, but added that the economy is prepared and able to withstand a “sudden adverse shock”.
“We are ready to act,” he added in a defiant tone, stating that preparations have been long underway.
His comments come as Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are still deadlocked just a day before a crucial meaningful vote in the House of Commons.
Yet again, this week will see the spotlight squarely on Westminster with MPs set to determine the course of the UK’s future with a series of crucial votes on Brexit.

There are less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney appeared to confirm today that British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Strasbourg this evening, however others state that her travel plans have not been locked down as of yet.
He said he hoped May and Jean Claude Juncker could reach agreement, though he said there are obstacles that still need to be overcome.
Coveney added that this is not a case of the UK versus Europe, stating that “nobody is looking to trap anybody anywhere”.
While the message about the impacts on Ireland were stark, Coveney remains hopeful that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided, though he admits, no one knows what may come.
“We can’t be sure, of course, of anything in Westminster these days,” he said, adding that it is about putting together a package of measures that can give reassurances to the UK.

Speaking to reporters in Dublin earlier today, Varadkar said:
“As I’ve always said, no deal is not a threat that the European Union or Ireland is making. The 29 March is a self-imposed deadline. The UK parliament can take the threat of no-deal off the table at any time.
“If there is going to be an extension though, it has to be an extension with a purpose, and nobody across the European Union wants to see a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions get put off until the end of April, then until the end of May and then maybe until the end of July,” he said.
Varadkar added that the prospect of the House of Commons vote being called off in favour of a new one “misses the point”.
“I do hear some suggestion that the vote may be called off in favour of a new vote as a result of which the House of Commons would tell the EU what they want, that really misses the point. It’s far too late for the UK to tell us what they want.

Deadlock
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
However, despite numerous talks with the EU since then, little has changed in the withdrawal agreement with the Irish government and Brussels refusing to back down on the backstop.
Downing Street has said that talks between the EU and UK are still deadlocked, theBBC has reported.
It said that May spoke with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last night after a weekend of negotiations failed to find a breakthrough.
While there were reports that there would be delays, it is understood that MPs will tomorrow vote again on May’s Withdrawal Agreement.
There are a number of different ways the vote could go. We’ve laid out all the possibilities here:
‘Dreadful’
Yesterday, the former Brexit secretary David Davis said Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal is “dreadful” and, in a way, worse than the UK’s current EU membership.
“Frankly this deal is worse than current membership in one sense because we can’t get out of it,” he told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
He said that it was “a dreadful deal on many, many counts”, but added that if the UK could leave the backstop whenever it chooses, that it might be “rescuable”.
“I would love to be able to vote for it, if she gets the ability to pull out,” he said.
Davis said that EU leaders were “shocked” after the deal was rejected, and “that the language changed”.
“The tenor of the language changed. Mr Varadkar’s language changed, Mr Juncker’s language changed, Mr Tusk’s… and then all of a sudden, three Cabinet ministers said ‘You’ve got to take no-deal off the table’, ‘You’ve got to have an extension’, and then it went back to being hard again.”
Davis also said that he’s not hoping for a no-deal Brexit, but that it needs to be kept as a viable option “because it’s what keeps bringing the European Union back”.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier repeated on Friday that the bloc could offer a legally binding statement confirming the backstop was only meant to be temporary.
But this offer from Barnier is unlikely to be enough.
“It is inevitable this unchanged withdrawal agreement will be voted down again,” two senior Brexit-supporting MPs, Steve Baker and Nigel Dodds, warned yesterday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-brexit-deal-4531460-Mar2019/,"THE EU’S CHIEF Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has offered the UK a new Brexit deal which would see it leave the customs union but keep parts of the backstop which would ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.
In a number of tweets sent this afternoon, Barnier said the UK has been offered a way to exit the “single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border”.
Barnier added: “The UK will not be forced into customs union against its will. The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement.”
However, it is thought that the DUP, which props up Theresa May’s Conservative government, will not accept the deal as it effectively differentiates between the North and Great Britain – a red letter issue for the DUP.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, in response to Barnier’s tweets, said the ball is in the UK’s court.

He said: “We were and remain happy to apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland, if they want to go back to that. It doesn’t have to trap or keep all of Great Britain in the single customs territory for a prolonged period, or at all.”
The British parliament is set to vote this Tuesday on May’s existing deal with Brussels after rejecting it by a historic margin in January.
May told an audience of factory workers in the North Sea fishing port of Grimsby that Britain may never split off from the other 27 nations if Brussels failed to help her now.
The deal “needs just one more push to address the final, specific concerns of our parliament,” May said.
“Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis.”

TRANSPORT MINISTER SHANE has apologised this evening for saying Sinn Féin’s Imelda Munster was “like a donkey in the last race at the last fence” unlike her “thoroughbred” party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Aengus O Snodaigh.
The minister said he was “sorry for any offence caused by my analogy” adding that he was “caught up in the heat of the debate”.
During a debate on thegreen card for motoristsissue in the Dáil today, Munster said other ministers had managed to resolve Brexit issues for their own department, but criticised Ross for not sorting out the issue of green cards, which drivers travelling to the North will be required to have post-Brexit.
Responding, Ross said he had “a very sensible discussion” about green cards with two of Munster’s colleagues, Pearse Doherty and Aengus O Snodaigh.
He added:
The Leas-Ceann Comhairle Pat the Cope Gallagher interjected, stating: “Minister”.
He called on him to use parliamentary language.
Ross said: “She upset the whole apple cart.”
At this point, Fianna Fáil’s transport spokesperson, Robert Troy said: “That is disgraceful.”

Munster accused Ross of getting personal, and accused him of being incompetent.
“If he wants to get personal to mask his incompetence that is fine. I can take it,” she said, adding:
The debate continued, with the Leas Ceann Comhairle telling the minister to “forget about the word donkey”.
‘An analogy’
The minister explained that “it was just an analogy… made by her colleagues and, as is so typical, she came in and ruined the debate”.
While the Leas Ceann Comhairle acknowledged that, he added that “it does not sound good”.
Munster said the minister did not make any effort at all on the green card issue. However, Ross said that accusation was “simply untrue”.
He said his department and the government have represented the case that the green card is unwelcome and “we do not want it”.
“Of course we do not want it but it is an EU decision,” he added, stating:
In a statement following today’s debate, Munster accused the minister of resorting to name-calling in the chamber.
She called on the minister to apologise, stating:
“I don’t think that this is an appropriate way for the minister to conduct himself. What message does this send out to other women who may have an interest in getting involved in politics? I believe that Minister Ross should apologise for his distasteful remarks.”

As a millennial kid growing up in Monaghan, my big concerns were the same as most other teenagers in a hopeful ‘Celtic Tiger’ Ireland.
Unlike my folks, I could expect to go to college, get a decent job and travel freely without the expectation of violence or injustice.
I didn’t care who was Protestant or who was Catholic or whether someone was from the North or the South and I never needed to.
The ‘border’, in my mind wasn’t much more than an arbitrary line we drove over on our way to pick up cheaper heating oil, booze or clothes from Topshop.
I’d notice the signs turning from green to white, kilometres to miles, green and orange to red and blue – and then back again without much fuss.
I had just a few vague memories of trips to Newry or Armagh town as a kid before the Good Friday Agreement; the barbed wire and soldiers with guns leaning in the window of the car, my mother and grandad falling silent as we went through the checkpoint, the feeling of tension and oppression, the violence and anger in the air.
These aren’t pleasant memories, but they aren’t particularly traumatic ones either.
The traumatic stories were ones I heard from family; memories of the Monaghan bombing, friends killed and wounded, beatings, shops refusing to serve Catholics, raids at border checkpoints and many near misses with often merciless soldiers.
But mostly, the tales of ‘The Troubles’ my family told were laced with hints of nostalgia. Humour would be carefully woven through what were objectively miserable stories.
I’d feel grateful for the sacrifices that were made for the peaceful world I got to live in, never really connecting with the deep trauma that lay just beneath the surface of the people I loved.

It’s that sense of naive nostalgia felt by many young people along the border that frightens me now.
The young people who are at Brexit’s mercy, have no living memory of the war or the violence and trauma that came before us. We don’t fully understand how precarious and precious our peace is or how high a price our parents and grandparents paid for it.
But if the hard border comes, we’ll see armed police and maybe even soldiers on windy country back roads that we used to pass through freely.
Our cars will be searched, we’ll lose employment opportunities as trading routes are cut off and our town will once again dwindle into economic despair.
The freedom to decide our own futures and to escape outdated identities like ‘Nationalist’ or ‘Unionist’, ‘Southerner’ or ‘Northerner’ will be taken from us. We will once again have to decide what side of the line we stand on.
Without the living memory of the trauma of war to immunise us, many will be sucked into a renewed violence that’s bred from despair, disempowerment, mistrust and paranoia.
We need to do everything in our power to stop any kind of border being erected because it is going to create the conditions for violence and division to flourish.
We’ve already seen letter bombs sent to London and car bombs in Derry in response to the mere threat of a hard border.
The values we’ve held dear since the Good Friday Agreement can only hold strong if the foundations are in place to bend us towards reconciliation, forgiveness, trust and faith in a shared and flourishing future.
As the people who’ll suffer through Brexit’s consequences, it’s time for us to make ourselves heard by decision makers in Ireland, north and south, the UK and the EU.
Already more than 73,000 people across the UK and Ireland have signedan open lettertelling Theresa May to take our peace process off the negotiating table.
Will youadd your nameto our petition and publicly stand up for an Ireland of peace and hope rather than one of violence?

Goalkeeper/Defence
KEIREN WESTWOOD HAS been in excellent form for Sheffield Wednesday recently, with seven clean sheets in his last 11 Championship games, but Darren Randolph has been having a decent campaign too with Middlesbrough, and so Mick McCarthy is unlikely to drop the goalkeeper who was number one for the majority of Martin O’Neill’s reign.
At the back, Seamus Coleman is expected to feature on the right, while after Stephen Ward’s retirement, Enda Stevens, who has been in terrific form for Sheffield United in the Championship, could be given the chance to make the Irish left-back slot his own.
At the back, Shane Duffy is virtually certain to start, while the other position appears to be between Richard Keogh and John Egan, both of whom have been having decent seasons at club level. At 26, Egan is six years younger than his colleague. McCarthy may view the Gibraltar match as an opportunity to ease the Sheffield United player into international football, as with just four caps under his belt (none of which have been in competitive games), he remains relatively inexperienced at this level.

Midfield
Midfield is probably the area where the most debate is to be had in terms of selection. McCarthy will surely find room for Matt Doherty, who has been in superb form for Wolves in the Premier League this season. The 27-year-old indicated earlier this week that he would be open to playing in an unfamiliar right-wing role, and the Irish boss may well choose to proceed with this experiment.
On the other wing, James McClean could get the nod over Robbie Brady, who has not seen too much game time at Burnley since coming back from injury.
There are a couple of options in midfield, though the relatively attack-minded choice of Jeff Hendrick and Conor Hourihane might well be suited to Ireland’s opponents, who are likely to spend much of the match with 11 men behind the ball. A defensive alternative, such as Glenn Whelan or Harry Arter, could subsequently come in for the more difficult Georgia encounter.
It would be a surprise to see the creative likes of Alan Judge or Jack Byrne feature from the outset, though either could potentially be sprung from the bench, particularly if Ireland are in need of a goal.
Attack
It is likely to be a choice between Sean Maguire, David McGoldrick and James Collins to start, with McCarthy seemingly preferring that trio to late call-up Aiden O’Brien.

There is a case to be made for Collins, given how many goals he has scored at Luton this season as well as the likelihood that Gibraltar are hardly of a higher standard than the average League One side.
That said, Sean Maguire and David McGoldrick are playing at a higher level than Collins, and the 31-year-old Sheffield United striker has also registered his fair share of goals, with 12 to his name so far this season.

Dale, a Lebanese-American, was born Richard Monsour in 1937 in Boston, and moved to California as a teen.
He was still performing until the time of his death, according to reports. Four years ago he gave an interview to thePittsburgh City Paperin which he said he had to raise $3,000 every month to pay for the medical supplies he needed to stay alive – and this was on top of the insurance he paid.
“You tell the people, ‘Don’t be scared of dying,’” he said. “When your mind leaves this body, it is a beautiful thing and it is not to be feared. Don’t let that fear of dying affect the way you live.
“You take that fear and you use it as a driving force to keep moving forward, no matter how much pain you have. That’s how I do what I do on stage. I’m not afraid to die because it all gets beautiful from here.”

The Journal is partnering with Allianz Insurance for our Best Drives series that showcases some of the most picturesque drives across the country. For our next instalment, we’re packing up the car and heading west to one of Ireland’s most breathtaking routes on the Dingle Peninsula.

From narrow cliffside roads to sweeping Atlantic views and ancient cultural landmarks, Dingle offers one of the most unforgettable drives in the country. Although you could spend a week driving around this beautiful part of the world, we picked one of our favourite drives. This route through one of the most popular areas in the Gaeltacht is more than just a scenic Sunday drive, it’s a journey into the heart of Irish heritage.

Our journey begins at the dramatic Conor Pass look-out point. We recommend taking all the safety precautions necessary if you do decide to drive it while making sure you are well prepared. However we began our route from the lookout point parking lot into Dingle town which is a safe and well-paved road where you can take in the sheer scale of the landscape.

From there, wind down into Dingle town. It’s one of our favourite towns; colourful, lively, and packed with character. You can watch out for well-known boutiques and local shops before pulling in for coffee at the much-loved Out of the Blue café.
Bellies full and ready to go, the coastline calls. The Slea Head Drive loop is the main event: a coastal road that hugs the cliffs and opens up to one jaw-dropping vista after another. Along the way, historical landmarks like the Gallarus Oratory and the Riasc Monastic Settlement offer a chance to step back in time and soak in the serenity of this part of the country. Further along, the road winds through Ballyferriter, where a stop at Tig Áine Café & Gallery delivers great food and panoramic views.

Close by, the Blasket Centre, a cultural and historical gem provides stories of resilience, literary greats and island identities. From the centre’s stunning viewing platform, take in almost 360-degree views of the wild Atlantic ocean. Talk about a photo opportunity – it doesn’t get much better than this.
In summer, please note that this is a one-way system for visitors based on the clockwise direction through Ventry / Ceann Trá village. Turn off your sat nav and google maps, and only follow the local road signs. This is to avoid the bottleneck of coaches and tours that often come to visit. Make sure to touch base with a local on arrival, they will be sure to offer all the help and guidance you need!

https://www.thejournal.ie/sean-o-casey-house-homeless-accommodation-4540957-Mar2019/,"THE HOUSE WHERE playwright Sean O’Casey wrote some of his best known works is being bought by Dublin City Council, which plans to use it to accommodate homeless people.
The four-storey building at 422 North Circular Road was built-in 1810 and still retains many of its Georgian features. It was initially used as a family home before being converted into tenements.
O’Casey, a staunch socialist who focused on the life of Dublin’s working classes, wrote his celebrated Dublin trilogy (The Shadow of a Gunman, Juno and the Paycock, and The Plough and the Stars) when he lived there in the 1920s. It was the playwright’s last home in the city of his birth.
The council’s head of housing, Brendan Kenny, toldTheJournal.iethat it is currently in negotiations with the building’s owner and “it may be a while” before the deal is finalised.
Lord Mayor Nial Ring said that it is his understanding that O’Casey wrote the trilogy in a particular room in the house and the room is largely unchanged since that time.
He contacted the council proposing that the room be preserved as a tribute to the renowned dramatist.
If the sale goes through Kenny estimates the building will likely house up to eight single people. He said the council will need to maximise the use of the entire building so preserving one room would likely not be possible.
Advertisement
In response to Ring the council said: “We would of course consider the installation of a suitable plaque etc. to commemorate the fact that Sean Ó’Casey did reside in the property at one stage.”
Several councillors said they welcomed the acquisition of the house for use as homeless accommodation once O’Casey’s connection to the building was acknowledged in a fitting manner.
Green Party councillor Ciarán Cuffe added that “the most suitable tribute to Sean O’Casey is to provide more public housing”.
‘Not good enough’
Councillor Mannix Flynn slammed the council’s “ad hoc approach” to tackling the homeless crisis as “not good enough”.
He said the 200-year-old building is not appropriate for emergency accommodation.
Kenny added that the house, which is a listed building, is currently in poor condition.
As well as providing much-needed homeless accommodation he said the council acquiring it would have the added benefit of the property being “looked after in the right way”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-centre-clondalkin-4526390-Mar2019/,"THERE HAVE BEEN calls for the planned closure of a Direct Provision centre in Dublin to be postponed until the housing needs of residents with refugee or predicted status are rehomed.
The Clondalkin Towers centre, a former hotel, is set to close at the end of June. There were 235 people, including 78 children, living in the centre as of last month.
Up to 70 residents already have protected or leave-to-remain status and face having to find private rented accommodation; this figure includes 19 refugees. The other 150-plus residents are expected to be transferred to other DP centres if and when the centre closes.
At the start of October, residents were informed that the centre would close on 3 December as the company running the centre was not renewing its contract. However, a deal was later reached to keep the centre open until June. The company, Fazyard Ltd, waspaid €27.5 millionby the State from 2006 to 2015 for operating the centre.
The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and the Peter McVerry Trust (PMVT) have been helping residents source new accommodation, in a bid to prevent them becoming homeless, through the PATHS Project.
David Moriarty, Assistant Director of JRS, said many of the housing issues that led to the postponement of the centre’s closure on humanitarian grounds late last year still exist and need to be addressed.
Some residents previously toldTheJournal.ietheyarestruggling to locatealternative accommodation for various reasons – the housing crisis and increasing rents, some landlords refusing to accept the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), and, in some cases, racism.
125 people rehomed
The PATHS Project has rehomed 125 people (43 households, both families and individuals) since March 2017, including 107 residents from Clondalkin Towers. Three more people are expected to move out of the centre in the coming days.
The remainder of people who were rehomed are former residents of a DP centre in Knockalisheen, Co Limerick, where the scheme has been rolled out on a smaller scale in recent months.
The project is supported by the Department of Justice and is ahead of schedule in its goal to resettle 140 people by the end of 2019.
It involves sourcing housing, providing transportation for viewings and move-ins, support in overcoming language barriers, liaising with landlords and local authorities, ensuring all HAP documentation is completed, support with transfer of benefits from one location to another, and support to sustain tenancies once they are secured.
Moriarty toldTheJournal.ieJRS ran a clinic once or twice a week at Clondalkin Towers for about 18 months but that this ramped up to five days a week when the closure of the centre was initially announced in October.
In the last quarter of the 2018, 20 people (nine households) were rehomed. Five households have secured accommodation so far this year. Of those who have been moved to date, 18 households are currently located in the south Dublin area and the remaining 25 households are based across north Dublin, Co Louth, Co Meath and Co Cavan.
Moriarty said a social worker assesses a family or person’s needs and tries to match them with suitable accommodation. The social worker arranges viewings of private rented accommodation or sources an alternative property.
“Individuals or households will present and will be needs-assessed – family size, educational needs, medical needs, preference for location, etc. We create a profile for each household and try to match them with accommodation to meet their needs.
“We match them with available viewings online or source non-public property – this might be provided through partner organisations or a congregation making property available – non Daft.ie models basically,” Moriarty explained.
A bedroom in Clondalkin Towers
The PATHS Project initially focused on refugees but due to the imminent closure of the centre, it has been extended to help anyone with protected or leave-to remain status.
Moriarty said the biggest challenges facing residents is the lack of availability of suitable properties, noting: “We are at the mercy of the market in that regard.” He said the current market is difficult for any potential renters to navigate but added:
“There are just not that many properties out there, it’s so competitive. People are not securing property in as timely a manner as we want…
“Otherwise they could end up in a situation where they find themselves accessing homeless service, that’s something none of us want to happen.”

Third centre to close
The timing of the expected closure of the centre is far from ideal. A number of DP centres around the country are oversubscribed, including Clondalkin Towers.
The government has paid over €1.6 million to a private contractor tosource emergency accommodationfor asylum seekers since September 2018; close to 200 people are living in hotels and B&Bs in the Cavan-Monaghan area.
Meanwhile, hotels inLeitrimandDonegalearmarked as future DP centres have been the subject of suspected arson attacks in recent months.
The Department of Justice or Fazyard Ltd did not respond to a request for comment in relation to the closure of Clondalkin Towers potentially being postponed on humanitarian grounds.
The department is trying to source an alternative location for a DP centre in the area. The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) has sought expressions of interest from service providers for premises within 40km of Newbridge in Co Kildare, which would cover the Clondalkin area.
A spokesperson for the department said it would be “inappropriate to comment on any prospective tender bid that may be participating in an ongoing public procurement process”. The procurement process is expected to be concluded in the coming weeks.
The centre in Clondalkin is currently the largest DP centre in the capital. Two centres in Dublin city closed last year: the Georgian Court centre on Gardiner Street, which housed 80 people, closed last February; and the centre at Watergate Hall on Usher’s Quay, where 52 people lived, closed in July.
A common room in Clondalkin Towers
The department’s spokesperson said the fact people are staying in DP centres for some time after they receive a protection status or permission to remain “is putting increased pressure on the system”. Under EU regulations, Ireland must accommodate new arrivals who apply for asylum here.
“Considerable work is being done by the Department to support residents with status or permission to remain to move out of accommodation centres and to secure long-term accommodation,” the spokesperson noted.
A spokesperson for South Dublin County Council said residents of Clondalkin Towers are “eligible to make an application for social housing support and each application is individually assessed and the applicant made aware of the decision following assessment”.
“If they are not accepted on the social housing list, they can re-apply in future if their circumstances change,” they stated.
‘Living in limbo’
Moriarty stated that people in DP who receive refugee or protected status can find themselves in “limbo” if they have received the initial letter telling them they are going to be granted status but not the formal declaration.
“People get the initial letter, but then it could be months and months until they receive the ministerial recognition. They can’t go on housing list or access mainstream support until then. In practical terms, they can’t access the support they need to enable them to leave Direct Provision.”
He said this is “a very real issue”, noting: “If a person can’t access the support and mainstream services, they can’t leave the centre – this can be quite traumatic.
Moriarty said the PATHS Project helps people to get access to the Enhanced HAP, also known as Homeless HAP, which “allows them to compete more” when searching for somewhere to rent.
A hallway in Clondalkin Towersorlaorla
A spokesperson for PMVT noted that the organisation secured recognition that people in Clondalkin Towers with leave-to-remain or protected status “are in fact homeless and thus were able to avail of Homeless HAP from South Dublin County Council”.
In relation to HAP, they noted that landlords refusing to accept it “is an everyday reality for people we work with not just in Clondalkin Towers but across our homeless services too”.
The spokesperson added that PMVT and its partners in the RIA and Dublin Region Homeless Executive will “make every effort to prevent any of the 70 [residents with status] from needing to enter homeless services”.
“Our energy is about progressing as many people into housing as possible and we are determined to exceed our targets.”
They added that in the past when it has been shown that move-ons can be achieved “it has helped to re-motivate others and created a domino effect as people progress more make the effort to achieve similar outcomes”.

THE US INTENDS to scrap a preferential trade status granted to India and Turkey which allows certain products from the two countries to be imported duty-free.
The Office of the US Trade Representative announced it would end the countries’ designations as beneficiary developing countries as part of what the ‘Generalised System of Preferences’ programme.
Under the programme, certain products can enter the US duty-free if countries meet an eligibility criteria, including “providing the United States with equitable and reasonable market access”.
In a statement, the office said that the two countries “no longer comply with the statutory eligibility criteria” for the programme.
It added that India has failed to provide assurances that it would allow the US the required market access, and “has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on United States commerce”.

In response, India said the impact on its exports to the US would be minor, claiming just €4.95 billion of its €70 billion in exports to the US are covered by GSP.
Meanwhile, the US said that Turkey was now considered “sufficiently economically developed” to have “graduated” from the programme, having first been designated a GSP beneficiary in 1975.
Donald Trump said the country’s economy “has grown and diversified”, and noted that Istanbul has already “graduated from other developed countries’ GSP programmes”.
The changes cannot take effect for at least 60 days, after the US House of Congress and the affected countries were notified, a process that started on Monday when Trump wrote letters to the speaker of the House and the president of the Senate.
The move comes as the US and China seek to negotiate an exit from a costly trade war that is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to address what it views as inequitable commercial relationships with other states.
Under an agreement taking shape, Beijing would lower some barriers on US companies’ operations in China and purchase large amounts American agricultural and energy goods if the United States agreed to lower most of the tariffs in return.
However, reports have suggested that significant details of the deal remained unresolved.

Videos from the scene showed firefighters tackling the blaze last night, before it was brought under control in the early hours of this morning.
The cause of the fire is not yet known, and gardaí are currently at the scene.

“The scene is preserved to facilitate a forensic examination to establish the cause of the fire,” a garda spokeswoman said in a statement.
The statement added that no injuries have been reported, and that investigations into the cause of the blaze are ongoing.
Local TD Fergus O’Dowdtweeted pictures from the scenelast night.
“Donaghys Mill abandoned for many years now totally engulfed in flames,” he said.
The five-storey building, which is situated on the River Boyne, is around 200 years old and has been abandoned for a number of years.
A listing for the mill on An Taisce’s website said that it was suffering from neglect and that the level of risk surrounding it was high.

https://www.thejournal.ie/miriam-ocallghan-facebook-4532988-Mar2019/,"JOURNALIST AND PRESENTER Miriam O’Callaghan has filed High Court proceedings against Facebook.
O’Callaghan told the Sunday Times newspaper in January that she was planning to sue the social media giant, alleging that fake advertisements using her name and photo were being promoted on the platform.
These advertisements featured false adverts for a face cream, and her solicitor had been complaining to Facebook about the ads since last June, she said.
Callers into the RTÉ Radio One’s Liveline with Joe Duffy last summer said they’d seen the advert and had bought the product believing it had been endorsed by O’Callaghan.
The case was filed by O’Callaghan on Friday, and she is being represented by solicitor Paul Tweed. There is no date as of yet for when the case will be heard before the court.

It’s understood the presenter is seeking damages and requesting that all adverts featuring her that are like the ones that have been appearing on the platform be banned.
Tweed toldTheJournal.ie: “Notwithstanding assurances received from Facebook, these fake advertisements continue to pop up and are a major cause for concern for Miriam, and also for other clients.
“This will now have to be determined by the courts.”
A Facebook spokesperson toldTheJournal.iethat it does not comment on legal action, but advised of its previous statement in this matter.
The spokesperson said: “Since Miriam raised this issue, we have removed a large volume of false ads featuring Miriam as well as associated pages and ad accounts and we will continue to remove these ads. We are working hard to enhance our efforts to detect and keep this kind of activity off our platform, including increasing our safety, security and review team to 30,000 people this year.”
It’s understood that the social media platform has also removed a large volume of adverts on the foot of further investigations into such practices. Facebook also urges people to flag adverts that they believe may violate its policies or don’t belong on its platforms.

The bodies of a man (38), a woman (37) and a 15-year-old girl were found at a flat at 11am yesterday.
Officers were called to attend the scene at an apartment in Glin Ree Court, close to the centre of Newry. A murder enquiry was launched into the incident.
The PSNI has now confirmed the two females were Giselle Marimon-Herrera (37) and her daughter Allison (15).
Giselle was from Colombia and arrived in Northern Ireland around four years ago. Allison was born in Spain and has lived in the North since 2017. She attended Newry High School.
The identity of the man found dead has not yet been revealed.
Police believe that the mother and daughter were still alive in the early hours of Sunday morning. However, family members had not been able to contact them since.

Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy has today appealed to anyone who came in direct contact with either Giselle or Allison, or who communicated with them via text or social media since Friday to contact police in Newry.
“We are currently supporting the families of those involved as well as Newry High school. I would ask that they are given the time and space to come to terms with these tragic events,” Murphy said.
Officers are still investigating the circumstances of what happened in the home. Post-mortem examinations are currently underway.
“I do not yet have any preliminary or definitive causes of death, and I do not intend to speculate about that today. I would expect the post-mortem results to be available to us in the coming days,” Murphy said.
He added that while the investigation remains at an early stage, there is “no evidence at this time that anyone else was involved”.
Reaction
Local Sinn Féin Councillor Charlie Casey yesterday said that the community in Newry is “in shock” and has asked anyone with information to contact police.
“My thoughts and sympathies are with all of those involved in this incident and their families,” Casey said in a statement.
SDLP MLA for Newry and Armagh Justin McNulty has said that “a dark cloud has been cast over Newry”.
Councillor Michael Savage said that it had “sent shock waves across our city and has left many local people unnerved”.
The PSNI is appealing to anyone with information to contact detectives on 101.

https://www.thejournal.ie/plant-based-food-heart-disease-4526595-Mar2019/,"NEW RESEARCH HAS found that it’s never too late to cut your risk of dying from heart disease by adding fruits and vegetables to your diet, even if you previously had poor eating habits.
Previous studies have found that eating a diet rich in plant-based foods can reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease but the new research has shown for the first time that positive or negative changes in a person’s diet can influence their risk of dying, no matter how they ate in the past.
“Not all plant-based diets are equal, but boosting the intake of high-quality plant-based foods over time lowers the risk of death even among people who started off with poor-quality diets,” explains the study’s lead author, Megu Y Baden, from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.

The study included nearly 48,000 women and 26,000 men with an average age of 64. None of the participants had a history of heart disease or cancer when they entered the study in 1998.
During the 12-year follow up the death rate from all causes dropped by 10% for those who added the most fruit, veg, whole grains and nuts to their diet.
This was achieved by people who made these adjustments to their daily food intake:
However, not all plant-based food has this life-lengthening effect, the death rate was 11 percent higher for those who ramped up their consumption of unhealthy plant-based foods such as chips, fruit juices and sweets.
“Over a period of time, consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, while decreasing your intake of refined grains, sweets and desserts, and animal foods such as animal fat meat, and miscellaneous animal-based foods, may lower your risk of death from heart disease and other causes,” Baden said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/courts-sligo-warrant-4523043-Mar2019/,"AN ARREST WARRANT has been issued for a Sligo woman who impeded an investigation into a killing and was released on bail, despite DPP objections, after the High Court heard that gardaí have “no idea where she is”.
Janice Brady (29), with a last address of Maryville Hostel, Finisklin, Sligo, was arraigned before the Central Criminal Court in November 2017.
She pleaded guilty to impeding the apprehension or prosecution of a man between 2-3 August 2015, at an address in Sligo, knowing or believing that the man was guilty of a killing.
Paul Murray SC, for the Director of Prosecutions, yesterday told Mr Justice Paul McDermott “we simply don’t know where she is”.
The terms of Brady’s bail included that she would enter her own bond of €100, reside for a period of six months in sheltered accommodation, remain drug and alcohol free for the six-month period; take proactive steps in her recovery, sign on three times a week at a garda station and observe a curfew from 10am to 6pm.
Brady was also required to provide a mobile phone number to gardaí and not visit or live in Sligo except for the purposes of visiting her son.
Murray SC said that it’s the State’s case that Brady has breached these conditions.
He said Brady, since being granted bail, has tested positive for drugs and hasn’t signed on with the gardaí since 15 February.

He said because of these developments, the State was seeking an arrest warrant for Brady in order to revoke her bail.
On 1 February last, when Justice Michael White granted Janice Brady bail, the judge warned her: “Be careful, you’re on very strict conditions.”
At the time, the State objected to the bail application, with Inspector Tom Colsch telling Murray SC that there was a strong likelihood that if Brady was granted bail she would reoffend and return to her drug habit.
Inspector Colsch yesterday told Mr Justice McDermott that Brady has breached her bail conditions.
He said the gardaí “have no idea where she is” and he added that she has not been seen in Sligo.
Mr Justice McDermott said he was satisfied that there had been a breach of Janice  Brady’s bail conditions and issued an arrest warrant for her.
On 1 February last, Justice White said he was comforted by a letter from the Peter McVerry Trust offering Janice Brady sheltered accommodation in Drumcondra for a period of six months and he was prepared to release her on bail conditions for that amount of time.
The judge said the defendant’s urine analysis had not tested positive for any illegal substance and he was not unduly concerned that she would try to evade justice.

Ireland 26
Ryan Bailey reports from Parc Eirias, Colwyn Bay
CHAMPION SIDES FIND a way to win. Ireland, no matter what, were not going to be denied their crowning moment here, as Noel McNamara’s side dug deep and deeper again to eke out a monumental victory and clinch a famous Grand Slam.
With their backs against the wall, and Wales threatening to spoil the party, Ireland showed remarkable resilience to negotiate the final hurdle of the championship, scoring two late tries through replacement Colm Reilly and Tom Clarkson.

Reilly’s sniping score from 30 yards out, with Ireland trailing by three points and just a handful of minutes left on the clock, will live long in the memory, as will a rollicking campaign that sees McNamara’s young guns emulate the feat of Eric Elwood’s 2007 side.
Ireland were not at their best here, their performance pockmarked by a string of frustrating errors. Yet the character, team spirit and unity which has been evident throughout the last eight weeks came to the fore when they needed it most.
Even losing Craig Casey and Harry Byrne before kick-off was not going to deter this group, who become just the second Ireland U20s side to complete a Six Nations clean sweep on the back of home wins over England and France and victories on the road against Scotland, Italy and now Wales.
The pack were again superb, led by captain Charlie Ryan and Scott Penny, while Dylan Tierney-Martin scored his fifth try of the campaign during a rip-roaring affair on the Welsh coast.
Liam Turner and Sean French were excellent again in midfield and when questions were asked of the bench, including Ryan Baird, they duly responded to get Ireland across the line when the big prize had threatened to slip from their grasp in the final quarter.
There is no doubt that the withdrawal — however late it may have been — of their influential half-back pairing, Casey and Byrne, was an unwanted distraction ahead of kick-off and it must have been a factor in their jittery performance. That they ticked this final box — while also winning at this venue for the first time — is a testament to the group.
It wasn’t all perfect, yet that makes the victory and sense of achievement even sweeter. An overthrown defensive lineout on this near side set the tone as Wales pitched tent under the shadow of the Ireland posts for the opening exchanges, using their controlled maul to good effect when the visitors infringed under stress.
After initially withstanding wave-after-wave of Welsh attack, Ryan and John Hodnett making key interventions in defence, it appeared Ireland had relieved the early pressure on their line with a scrum penalty of their own, only for further errors to grant the hosts access.

Using their lineout maul as a solid attacking base, Wales changed the tempo of their attack, throwing it wide from 40 metres out and when Turner and Wren shot up off the line, Jake Flannery was exposed on the outside.

The Ireland fullback was beaten by Tomi Lewis’ hitch-kick, blistering step and turn of pace, before he drew the final two defenders and offloaded inside for Aneurin Owen to surge over untouched.
Cai Evans added the extras with a sweet strike, and the fullback showed his accuracy off the tee again just short of the half-hour mark to land a long-range penalty and extend Wales’ lead to 10 points after Josh Wycherley was penalised at the breakdown.
Gareth Williams’ men were full value for it, too.
It was the poorest half of rugby Ireland had produced in this championship, yet the complexion of the scoreboard changed on the stroke of the interval as Angus Kernohan produced the moment of inspiration his side so desperately craved.
Swooping on a loose ball on the far side, the Ulster winger brought Ireland up to the Welsh 10-metre line with a slaloming break from his own half and with the support in tow, the visitors were able to show their clinical edge.
Ireland moved it wide with pace and precision, allowed Penny to carry, straighten and fix the red shirt before releasing for Wren to step back inside, wrong-footing three covering defenders for a sensational score which Healy converted from under the sticks.
In an instant, Ireland had rediscovered their accuracy in the red zone after it had frustratingly deserted them earlier in the half when two scoring opportunities went begging.
Firstly, Penny injected some oomph with a typically abrasive carry off the back of a maul and then thought he had got the ball down at the base of the post after a strong Foley carry, only for the TMO to call it just short.

Referee Christophe Ridley was asking for further video recourse moments after when French, off a set-piece move, put the head down and pumped the legs — but again the officials agreed that the Ireland centre had planted the ball agonisingly shy of the whitewash before knocking on.
But Wren wasn’t to be denied the third time, as Ireland charged for the sheds with a spring in their step, and just three points in arrears despite an off-colour and error-strewn first-half showing.
With the wind and momentum at their backs, Ireland seized the scoreboard advantage upon the restart, as Tierney-Martin added to his impressive championship tally in the far corner.
The initial TMO review appeared to show the Connacht hooker break off the maul and for the line in an offside position, but Ridley judged that he went to ground of his own accord and was then allowed pick up again and drive for the line.
It was a superb piece of play for Tierney-Martin’s fifth Six Nations try, and Healy nailed the touchline conversion for a 14-10 lead.
And so it ebbed and flowed. Kernohan was pinged for holding on after collecting the restart but Evans uncharacteristically pushed his penalty wide and then Penny showed his worth on the other side of the ball, winning a huge turnover five metres from his own line.
At the other end, Ireland looked to have executed a superb strike move for a third try to create daylight between the sides, but the TMO did well to spot Turner’s pop pass for French was fractionally forward in the build-up. It was a shame because the centre’s audacious offload for Kernohan was a moment of individual brilliance.
As it was, Ireland, instead of heading into the final quarter with an insurance score on the board, found themselves under their own sticks and chasing the game and Grand Slam again.
Another poor kick downfield gave Evans time and space and replacement winger Ryan Conbeer did the damage with brilliant footwork and scintillating pace to cut through the green shirts and free the supporting Jac Morgan. 17-14, backs against the wall again. But they had the solution.

Charlie Ryan and Ed Scragg battle for possession at a lineout.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
The end-game because fast and loose, Ireland were fortunate Evans’ radar had gone awry as he was off-target with another long-range kick and that second row Teddy Williams was the only man in support of Conbeer, after he made another scything break through the heart of the Irish defence.
But the moment of the game — the moment of the championship — was still to come, and it was delivered by replacement 9 Reilly, who was not even in the original matchday 23, only to be promoted when Casey withdrew.
Out of nothing, he saw a gap where Welsh pillars ought to have been and sniped right of a ruck from 30 metres out, arcing his way around the cover defence with a serious show of gas to sprawl over for a sweet, sweet score. Flannery, having moved into out-half, struck the upright with the conversion but it mattered little.
Martin Moloney came up trumps with a big steal and the pack did the rest, showing maturity and composure to land the knockout blow through Clarkson, sparking jubilant scenes in the coaching box and stands.

https://www.thejournal.ie/storm-emma-centra-theft-4535951-Mar2019/,"A MAN ARRESTED following the looting of a Centra during Storm Emma last year threw trollies in the path of gardaí as they pursued him through the shop, a court has heard.
John Doyle (38), who has 111 previous convictions, had only been in the shop for one minute and 30 seconds before gardaí arrived and was found with three packets of cigarettes.
Doyle, of Russell Drive, Russell Square, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to trespassing at Centra, Kiltalown, Tallaght on 2 March 2018 with the intention of committing theft.
Judge Melanie Greally adjourned sentencing until July to allow a probation report to be prepared.
Detective Garda David Jennings told Eoghan Cole BL, prosecuting, that gardai received a call shortly before 8pm during the “atrocious” weather conditions of Storm Emma that the security door of a Centra shop had been breached with a mechanical saw by a group of people.
Gardaí made their way as far as they could in a jeep and the remainder of the way on foot. As they arrived, a large group of people on the road began shouting warnings that gardaí were coming.
Detective Garda Jennings said the front shutter of the store had been cut open and people were coming out.
Officers entered the shop and Doyle took off towards the back of the premises, throwing trollies to obstruct them. He was found crouched down trying to hide in the store room. Two other men were found in that area of the shop, one of whom had a sledgehammer.
Doyle’s previous convictions include offences such as robbery, burglary, possession of stolen property, road traffic offences and criminal damage.

A co-accused, David Berney (37), of Suncroft Park, Tallaght, has already received an 18 month suspended sentence for his role in the incident.
Detective Garda Jennings agreed with Sarah Jane O’Callaghan BL, defending, that 12 or 13 people could be seen coming in and out of the store on infrared CCTV footage and Doyle was identified by “work boots” he could be seen wearing.
He said the majority of the damage had already been done by the time Doyle entered the shop.
Detective Garda Jennings agreed Doyle was not present when the shop shutters were cut open with a con saw and that the cigarette machine had been forced open before he arrived.
Ms O’Callaghan said that certain people looked out of the shop and appeared to beckon others over and it was at that point that Doyle entered the store.
She said Doyle had panicked on seeing gardaí and ran, throwing trolleys to slow them down. She said he was deeply ashamed of his actions which almost cost him his relationship with his partner.
She said he did not cause the criminal damage in the area of the shop where he was found.
Counsel said that Doyle had a significant past but is a deeply committed father who had got his life together. She said he was disgusted that he was lured into chaos and lawlessness on the night.
She said he had drink taken on the night and it had been an “opportunistic and stupid” thing to do.

THE UK’S NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has repeated her apology for saying that the deaths caused by soldiers and police during the Troubles “were not crimes” – adding that she didn’t believe what she said.
Bradley has faced calls to resign over her statement in the House of Commons yesterday, where she said the deaths in Northern Ireland “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
She added: “They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way.”
In a statement today, she said she was “profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt” that her words had caused.
“The language was wrong and even though this was not my intention, it was deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones.
Speaking to RTÉ News tonight, Bradley said again that she was “profoundly sorry” for the offence caused, and said she didn’t believe what she said.
She said that the families and the people of Northern Ireland “need someone to deliver for them” and was “determined to deliver for them with the government”.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Bradley had already sought to climb down yesterday from her initial comments, later saying she hadn’t been referring to any specific cases, but was simply “expressing a general view”.
In her statement today, she said the British government’s position is “clear”.
She did not go as far as acknowledging that killings committed by British forces during the Troubles were crimes.
As well as investigations currently under way into crimes allegedly committed by members of British security services, there have already been cases where soldiers have been convicted over killings during the Troubles.
Media reports in the past week have indicated thatfour ex-British soldierscould be charged with the 1972 shooting of unarmed marchers in Derry on Bloody Sunday.
‘Totally inappropriate’
Tánaiste Simon Coveney was asked in the Dáil today by Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary to address Bradley’s comments, which he himself described as “absolutely callous and completely out of order and totally inappropriate”.
Calleary referenced comments made by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in a column for the Telegraph newspaper at the weekend, where he said would be “a storm of utter fury” if up to four ex-British soldiers were charged with the deaths of 14 unarmed marchers in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972.
“It’s easy to dismiss Boris Johnson, he’s paid to be bizarre,” Calleary said, adding that Bradley’s comments, however, cannot be ignored.
Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty added that Bradley’s remarks were “outrageous and ridiculous”. He said it was important to note that her comments followed on from a statement from British Prime Minister Theresa May about protecting serving and former British soldiers who committed crimes.

Doherty said the comments of both women “are an insult to families who have lost loved one to the British Army”. He said victims’ families, some of who have been campaigning for decades, deserve justice.
Responding, the Tánaiste said he met with Bradley in London yesterday evening and made it clear where the Irish government stands on the issue.
He said her comments caused “intense” concern, distress and hurt for families whose loved ones were killed.
Coveney said Bradley’s attempt yesterday to clarify her initial comments was “important but perhaps not enough”.
He noted that in her additional statement today, Bradley said she is “profoundly sorry” and “recognises the seriousness of the statement that was made yesterday”. He also said she may comment further and make contact with victims’ families when she is in Belfast later today.
But he acknowledged that the timing of the comments “couldn’t be worse”, as the families of the 14 people who died as a result of Bloody Sunday await a briefing from the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland next week.
He also referenced last week’s decision by the UK Supreme Court that an effective investigation into Pat Finucane’s murderwas not held. Finucane, a 39-year-old human rights solicitor, was shot dead by loyalists paramilitaries in front of his three children and wife Geraldine, who was also injured, on 12 February 1989.
Coveney said both cases have placed a “heightened focus on legacy issues”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also addressed Bradley’s comments, telling reporters that he had met victims’ families in the past and that they are still grieving, still hurting and a lot of them have questions that are unanswered.
He said her comments were “insensitive and they were wrong”.
When asked if he thought she should resign, he replied “Not going to go there”.
Calls to resign
Victims’ families and political parties in the North have led calls for Bradley to resign.
John Kelly, whose brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday,told the BBCthat her comments were “outrageous”.
“Her place now is untenable, she should go,” he said. John Teggart, whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, agreed.
He said: “What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father – 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body – that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way.
The SDLP and Sinn Féin have also called for Bradley’s resignation.
SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the comments were “absolutely appalling”, while Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said they were “outrageous and offensive”.

Detective John Walsh said he discovered the notes on an A4 sheet of paper in an office area in Quirke’s house during a search in May 2013. He read from the document: “Mary last one to see him”, “body naked, either murdered and clothes taken off or never left the house”.
The words “never left the house” were underlined, the witness told Michael Bowman for the prosecution.
It also contained questions including: “Why did she find the van so quickly? Why did she look for him in a place where she knew he wouldn’t have needed to go? Why didn’t she act on leads? Why did she give varying accounts of how long he was in the yard before he left for work? Two minutes? Ten minutes?”
“Why was she so adamant no activity took place in the yard? How would she hear? It wasn’t always possible. Why did she rip down photos of Bobby Ryan after his family put them up? Why was she relieved after Crime Call was a rubbish programme and got no help to jog anyone’s memory?”
The note also contained the comment: “V strange.”
‘Nothing of evidential value’
Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan. Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am. His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013.
The prosecution claims Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Lowry (52).
Detective Walsh further told Bowman that he seized a brown envelope inside which was a document relating to Quirke’s lease of Lowry’s land at Fawnagowan.
Detective Garda Kieran Keane told Bowman that he is the exhibits officer assigned to the investigation into Ryan’s death. Following the search he took possession of a computer, two memory keys, two mobile phones, an iPad, a hard drive from one of the farm houses and a phone bill seized from the kitchen.
Swabs were taken for analysis from a pair of overalls hanging in the boiler house, a cow trailer and a crew cab door. Det Gda Keane  agreed with Lorcan Staines for the defence that analyses of the overalls, cow trailer and door provided nothing of evidential value.

Plumber Stephen O’Sullivan said gardaí asked him in 2013 to test whether Quirke was telling the truth when he described how water leaking from a mains pipe flowed from an old dairy farm into the tank where Ryan’s body was found. Quirke told gardai that he opened the tank because he needed water to agitate slurry and believed there would be water in it because of the leak some weeks earlier.
O’Sullivan told David Humphries for the prosecution how water running from a leak in the area identified by Quirke would have made its way to that tank and told defence counsel Lorcan Staines that what the accused told gardaí was the truth. He further stated that there was evidence that pipes in that area had leaked and were repaired by a handyman rather than a professional plumber, something he said would be common on farms.
While the witness carried out the test in 2013, he told Condon he was called as a witness earlier this year.
‘Silt, water, debris’
Siobhan Phillips is a manager at the Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore, Co Waterford. She told Humphries that a booking was made over the phone for a twin room for 6 September 2011.
She said the booking was taken up and included dinner in the Michelin star restaurant. She said she can’t say who stayed there or who had the dinner but the bill, which came to €416.20 was paid by Laser on 7 September.
The trial has previously heard that Lowry, who said she couldn’t remember staying at the Cliff House Hotel, had a bank record detailing a payment to the Cliff House for more than €400.
Phillips agreed with defence counsel Bernard Condon that the booking was for a “top end package”, famed for its food, in a stunning location with beautiful views. Condon added: “I’m not trying to sell it for you but it’s pretty well-known.” The witness agreed.
She said the booking was made under the name Patrick Quirke with an address at Fawnagowan, Tipperary. The payment was made using a Laser card which was used in the hotel and would have required a PIN. The witness said she was first approached by gardaí to make a statement in January.
Under reexamination Phillips told Humphries she doesn’t know who made the phone call to make the reservation but the name given was Patrick Quirke. She also said that whoever made the booking requested a twin room and although the room in question contained a double and single bed, the guest would not have known that.
Sergeant Debbie Marsh told Bowman she and a team of searchers spent three days emptying the tank where Mr Ryan’s body was found and searching through its contents.
It consisted of silt, water and debris and gardaí used a soil sieve to examine the contents. Any items gathered were brought to the attention of the scenes of crime officers, she said. Due to health and safety concerns on the first day her team was ordered out of the tank and the Garda subaqua unit went in.
The trial continues in front of Justice Eileen Creedon and a jury of six men and six women.

https://www.thejournal.ie/newbridge-ash-burns-4541116-Mar2019/,"A SCHOOL IN Newbridge in Kildare has written to parents to apologise after an incident where a number of students received burns on their foreheads when being given blessed ashes last week for Ash Wednesday.
The priest who administered the ashes separately wrote to them explaining that it “remains somewhat of a mystery as to why or how this happened”, as he also apologised.
Ash Wednesday marks the traditional start of Lent for Christians, where ashes are ceremonially placed on people’s foreheads.
Staff and pupils at Holy Family Secondary School in Newbridge were receiving the ashes when a number started to report feelings of discomfort and pain.
One guardian of a child at the school toldTheJournal.iethat some were left with “visible” marks on their forehead.
The school subsequently wrote to parents saying expressing “deep regret” for “any distress that has been caused”.

In the letter, seen byTheJournal.ie, the school said: “Blessed ashes were distributed to those who wished to receive them in the oratory and a number of students and staff received burns as a result.
In the letter from parish priest Fr Paul Dempsey to the parents and school, he explained the process whereby the ashes were created.
He said: “The ashes are produced from the burning of palm (evergreen tree) that is left over after Palm Sunday ceremonies. The palm is burned without the use of any accelerant. After the palm is burned, it is put through a sieve to refine it. Is it then stored until Ash Wednesday.
Fr Dempsey said that the ashes were put in small plastic containers before they were distributed. Holy Family Secondary School was among a number of recipients of the batch, and the priest had heard of one other primary school student having an adverse reaction.
“Nobody else from the parish or other schools has mentioned any adverse reaction, which adds to mystery,” he said.
As well as extending sincere apologies for the incident on behalf of the parish, the priest advised that he would inform the school immediately if he discovered the cause of the ashes resulting in those injuries.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Fr Dempsey said he had no other comment to add beyond the contents of the letter.
TheJournal.iehas contacted Holy Family Secondary School for comment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/front-pages-brexit-vote-4538557-Mar2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May suffered another Brexit loss last night, with the House of Commons again voting against the Withdrawal Agreement struck between her government and the European Union.
Despite additional assurances about the backstop element of the deal, legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday added to the likelihood it would be rejected once more.
In the end, it was voted down by 391 votes to 242 –a loss of 149.
MPs will today vote on whether Britain should leave the EU without a deal, and there will be a further possible vote on extending Article 50 – delaying Brexit – tomorrow.
On foot of her latest defeat, May features on the front page of many British newspapers today.
Some of the headlines include the phrases The House of Fools, Out of Control, Driven to Despair and Croaky Horror Show (referencing May’s sore throat as she spoke yesterday).

https://www.the42.ie/ireland-wales-grand-slam-preview-2019-4545535-Mar2019/,"Murray Kinsella reports from Cardiff
AFTER THE PHONEY war, now we finally get the rugby.
It’s likely to be wet, wild and utterly brutal at Principality Stadium [KO 2.45pm], with Ireland’s desire to see the roof open for this final round Six Nations clash ensuring that it’s likely to be played in difficult weather conditions.
The forecast for Cardiff is not good – rain and strong winds – so there are likely to be plenty of pissed-off Welsh supporters in the crowd, although the roof not being closed will reduce the effect of their vocal support.
Schmidt has opted to keep the roof open.Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
Warren Gatland’s Grand Slam chasers wanted this game fought out indoor but Joe Schmidt wasn’t willing to play ball and, with Six Nations protocols essentially allowing the away union to decide, we have an outdoor game.
The physical nature of this fixture is likely to be ferocious, with Ireland believing their pack – including Six Nations debutant and former Scarlets lock Tadhg Beirne – can get the upper hand in the set-piece and collisions.
Gatland’s men have shown their ability to go through long passages of play successfully – both in attack and defence – over the course of this championship but it will be riveting to see which team cracks first in this contest.
Memories of Ireland battering and battering in vain against the formidable Welsh defence on their visits here in the 2015 and 2017 Six Nations remain strong, although they insist that’s not the case in their camp.
“The big thing was that we were able to keep the ball,” said Ireland captain Rory Best yesterday.
“It’s going to be tough, especially with guys like Justin Tupuric in there. Having played with him on two Lions tours, he’s one of the best players that I’ve ever played with.
“So when he’s in there, it’s going to be a challenge to keep the ball.
“Probably the big one that jumps out is just how tough their defence is going to be. We’re going to have to be as good as we can be in every opportunity we’re given because Wales aren’t going to give you very many opportunities.

Alun Wyn Jones has led Wales superbly.Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
“When you get into that 22, they seem to go through the roof in terms of their physicality. The closer you get to the Welsh line, the harder it’s going to be and we’ve got to get our head around that as well.”
The Welsh attack is improving with Gareth Anscombe at out-half – his creative touches add a new dimension – but it is that defence that will have given Schmidt restless nights this week as he has plotted a map for Ireland to find ways to break it.
Gatland’s side have been strong aerially in this championship, with Liam Williams – fit to start today after concern for his shoulder – defusing bombs in defence and Josh Adams showing his threat for a wonderful leap and gather to score against England.
Jonathan Davies is class at outside centre opposite the equally influential Garry Ringrose, while Hadleigh Parkes is the glue-like figure for Wales that Bundee Aki so often is for Ireland.
Tipuric, the combative Ross Moriarty and Josh Navidi are a multi-skilled back row, while Ireland’s Peter O’Mahony will threaten the Welsh lineout, CJ Stander will work relentlessly, and Sean O’Brien will be keen to prove a point on the big occasion.
In Adam Beard, Wales have a 23-year-old lock who has yet to lose a Test match but the man alongside him is even more important.
Alun Wyn Jones will go down as a legend of Welsh – and probably world – rugby and his determination to seal this Grand Slam could be a telling factor.
Gatland, who has already won two Grand Slams with the Welsh, is another advantage in a week like this, his record in knock-out games and championship deciders being impeccable. He is a superb motivator.
Tadhg Beirne adds something different for Ireland.Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
Ireland, however, will feel they can peak on this final day of the championship, never having lost the last game of a Six Nations under Schmidt.
With Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton ready to deliver a controlling masterclass in the rain, Ireland have travelled with confidence that they can spoil the Grand Slam party at the Principality.
The bookies have found it difficult to call this one and Wales’ one-point favouritism says it all. Fine margins will be decisive.
“There’s going to be little errors,” said Best, “maybe somebody over-eager overruns the ball or a small penalty offside, that kind of thing.
“Those are going to happen in a game but I think for you to get close to your best 80 minutes, they’re at a minimum, but it’s also how you react off the back of those, that says a lot. Do you make a mistake and switch off?
“And a team doesn’t just get the ball back, they get yards and it’s all these little things that we’ll know. It’s a little bit of a cliché, but you’ll know when a team is just in that moment and they’re trying to live every moment around the pitch.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/measles-ireland-2-4542049-Mar2019/,"NINETY-EIGHT COUNTRIES around the world experienced an increase in measles cases last year, including Ireland.
There were 77 reported cases here in 2018, based on provisional figures, up from 25 in 2017.
To date in 2019, there have been 28 reported cases – 15 of which have been confirmed and the rest are probable or possible.
HSEHSE
People of all ages have been affected, but most cases relate to children under the age of four. Two outbreaks have been confirmed so far this year – in Donegal and north Dublin.
The increase in cases, both in Ireland and abroad, is examined in the latest edition ofTheJournal.ie‘s The Explainer podcast which wasreleased earlier today.https://soundcloud.com/the-explainer-podcast/why-has-there-been-a-208-rise-in-measles-cases-in-ireland
Measles is a highly infectious illness and spreads very easily. The uptake rate for the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is quite high in Ireland – about 92% – but this has varied over the years.
The HSE’s goal is to reach a rate of at least 95%, the level needed for herd immunity – whereby people who can’t be vaccinated for health reasons rely on those around them being vaccinated to prevent the spread of conditions such as measles.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Dr Mary Ward, who works in the Public Health section of HSE East, said the single biggest risk factor in terms of getting measles is not being vaccinated or not receiving both doses of the vaccine.
All children are entitled to, and advised to, get the MMR vaccine at the age of 12 months. They are supposed to get a second dose when four or five (in junior infants). Adults who are not sure if they received the vaccine as a child are advised to contact their GP to check and discuss getting a booster if needed.
“The biggest risk is people who haven’t had their two MMRs, definitely. We’re most concerned about school-going children who don’t have the MMR,” Ward told us.

She said herd immunity is vital to protect “vulnerable” people who cannot be vaccinated or babies who are too young to be vaccinated.
Speaking about this on The Explainer, cancer researcher Dr David Robert Grimes noted that a lot of patients with cancer are “immunocompromised” – meaning their immune system “has been modulated or augmented otherwise by the medicines they’re on”.
He said there are “heartbreaking stories, particularly of paediatric cancer patients succumbing to this illness” because they were exposed to an unvaccinated measles carrier.
Some of the reluctance by parents to vaccinate their children stems from an erroneous claim that linked the MMR vaccine to autism and other conditions. This claim can be traced back to a 1998 study by former British doctor Andrew Wakefield which was later retracted and debunked.
Ward said dealing with misinformation spread by the anti-vaccine movement is a “constant battle”. Her advice in this regard is straightforward: “Don’t listen to people who are not medically qualified or don’t have a medical background.”
Pregnant women and rubella
Also on the podcast, broadcaster and former GP Dr Ciara Kelly noted that while measles is the most talked about condition the MMR vaccine protects against, it protects people against mumps and rubella as well.
She noted that rubella, also known as German measles, is “a mild childhood illness”. However, it can have very serious consequences for pregnant women.
Kelly said if a woman contracts rubella while pregnant, there is “a very high risk” of their baby “being born blind or deaf or with other sorts of neurological conditions”.
Mandatory vaccination
Vaccinating children against conditions such as measles is mandatory in a number of countries. During the week, Italy’s governmentreinstated a lawbanning children from attending crèches and nursery schools if they have not been vaccinated.

The law makes it compulsory for children in pre-school education to be vaccinated against 10 diseases, including measles, tetanus and polio. Parents in Italy, as in a number of other countries, face fines for not vaccinating their children.
File photoShuttersotck / adriaticfotoShuttersotck / adriaticfoto / adriaticfoto
In a number of US states, every student entering or attending a public or private school has to be vaccinated against a range of conditions, including measles, mumps and rubella. However, there are medical, religious and personal exemptions to the law.
Some states are currently looking into getting rid of the personal exemption – California did this back in 2015 after an outbreak of measles which began at Disneyland subsequently spread to other parts of the US and Canada.
Australia is known for taking a particular tough stance in relation to non-vaccination under rules sometimes referred to as ‘no jab, no play’.
Parents face large fines and could lose up to $15,000 (over €9,000) in benefits if they don’t vaccinate their children. And schools and daycare centres face larger fines if they allow a child who isn’t vaccinated to attend.
Ward said there are “pluses and minuses” to mandatory vaccination, describing it as “a road that hasn’t been explored” in Ireland.
She said the HSE instead focuses on providing people with accurate information so they can make informed decisions about vaccinations. She added that many of the childcare facilities the HSE works with already request that children who attended their facilities are vaccinated.

Another issue in terms of spreading the condition is travel – both people coming into Ireland and Irish people unknowingly contracting measles while abroad and bringing it back when they come home.
Ward noted that people with measles may not display symptoms for about four days, stating: “Everyone doesn’t go around with a big, red, blotchy face.
On The Explainer, Kelly also discussed how “aggressive” measles is, noting: “We’re in major trouble because you will see it spread like wildfire and that’s the difficulty … Measles happens to be particularly contagious.”
The global picture
A Unicef reportreleased last monthnoted that 98 countries around the world reported an increase in measles cases in 2018.
The World Health Organization said cases worldwide soared by nearly 50% in 2018, killing around 136,000 people. There were at least 72 measles-related deaths in Europe in 2018, up from 42 in 2017, but none in Ireland.
The countries with the highest jumps in the number of cases reported last year were Ukraine, the Philippines and Brazil.
In Ukraine, there were over35,000 cases in 2018– a huge jump from 4,782 in 2017. This figure could well be topped in 2019 – the Ukrainian government said over 24,000 people were infected in January and February alone. At least 30 people have died in the country from measles since 2017.
Authorities believe anti-vaccine sentiment is partly to blame as well as shortages of vaccine supplies and cuts to health services amid an economic slowdown worsened by the ongoing conflict with Russia.
In the Philippines, there were 15,600 cases last year – up from 2,400 in 2017. This year looks set to be even worse – there have been 12,700 cases and over 200 deaths to date in 2019.
The jump in cases is partially due to fewer people getting vaccinated – in general and against measles – because of a number of children experiencingsevere side-effectsand some reportedly dying after receiving an anti-dengue vaccine, the makers of which are now being sued by the Philippine government.
Turning to Brazil, there were more than 10,200 cases last year, but none in 2017. The vast majority of cases have been reported in Amazonas state, which borders Venezuela; and about two-thirds of the confirmed cases involve people from Venezuela – a country obviously currently going through huge upheaval.
What are the symptoms of measles?
Measles can cause chest infections, fits (seizures), ear infections, swelling of the brain and/or damage to the brain.
The Department of Health gives the following advice in relation to the MMR vaccine:

https://www.thejournal.ie/gambling-regulator-stanton-4551166-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said it could take up to 18 months for a gambling regulator to be established.
Today, the government approved a plan to establish a gambling regulatory authority.
Minister of State at the Department of Justice David Stanton brought the proposals, which are contained in a report from an inter-departmental working group on issues around gambling, to Cabinet today.
The government has sought to introduce new legislation for the gambling industry as far back as 2013, but so far failed to do so, and it’s understood that to enact that legislation now wouldn’t be sufficient given the technological advances in the industry in the past six years.
In light of that, Stanton’s working group has been working to update the legislation to better reflect the situation in 2019.
The new gambling authority would be given the power to develop and enforce necessary and appropriate licencing and regulatory measures in respect of all gambling activities, including online betting.
Provision will also be made by the gambling authority to regulate in respect of the protection of vulnerable persons.
It is expected a social fund will be established to support research, information campaigns and even treatment. This fund will be supported by levies on betting companies.
In the most recent Budget, Minister Paschal Donohoe raised gambling duty from 1% to 2%which is expected to bring in an extra €50 million this year. The government resisted lobbying from the gambling industry on the matter, but had indicated recently that monies raised here wouldn’t be ring fenced for problem gambling treatment.

Furthermore, the HSE has admitted that its statisticson problem gambling do not paint a full picture of the extent of the problem, with the only recent data suggesting that there are around 40,000 problem gamblersin Ireland – a far lower proportion of the population than in Northern Ireland.
Officials at the Department of Justice have begun work on drafting the heads of legislation and acquiring the resources needed to establish the regulatory regime.
Fianna Fáil TDs, Jack Chambers, Anne Rabbitte and Jim O’Callaghan said its party’s proposed legislation would ensure thee ministerial oversight of the new regulator.
Spokesperson on Justice, Jim O’Callaghan said large-scale events with major online marketing investment such as last week’s Cheltenham Racing Festival shed light on a growing and very serious problem in Ireland.
“We need to be in a strong position to monitor the industries operations in our country and a Minister should have a direct say in that. I hope it’s ensured that the independent regulatory authority is promptly established so that we can have proper regulation of gambling in Ireland,” he said.
Fianna Fáil’s Children’s Spokesperson, Anne Rabbitte said the gambling companies employee a great number of people in Ireland, and invest in establishing business in towns across Ireland. But she added that it is a multi-billion euro industry that has been let away for too long without effective regulation.
“I am not entirely satisfied that today’s move represents anywhere near the same degree of change as I believe is absolutely necessary but I will continue to work closely with my party colleagues to push for this regulator to be introduced. There’s still some while to go before the tenacious link between sports and gambling here in Ireland is broken.”
In addition to regulator proposals, the government also approved the publication of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019 today.
This piece of legislation will update the previous Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 by bringing changes to the permit and licencing approach to small-scale, local gaming and lottery activity. It will also update certain stake and prize limits and standardise the minimum gambling age at 18.

An Garda SíochánaAn Garda Síochána
GARDAÍ ARE EXAMINING a potential link between a security alert at a postal depot in Limerick this morning and the letter bombs detected in London and Glasgow earlier this month.
Around 175 An Post staff have been evacuated from two postal buildings on the Dock Road following the discovery of a suspicious package at a centre that handles undeliverable parcels.
The unit at the centre of the alert processes all national and international undeliverable parcels that originated in Ireland – meaning it’s possible the parcel that sparked today’s alert could have been sent to the UK and then back to the Limerick centre in recent weeks.
In a statement gardaí confirmed that they had been deployed to the scene after the alarm was raised shortly after 6am and that, “this parcel appears to be identical to parcels (pending closer forensic and ballistic examination) discovered earlier this month in London and Glasgow”.
An Army bomb squad arrived at the scene shortly before 10am and the device has since been made safe. The device has been handed over to gardaí for further investigation, the Defence Forces said in a statement.
An Garda SíochánaAn Garda Síochána
The Defence Forces said its team had found “a viable improvised explosive device contained in a plastic envelope”. Investigating gardaí are now liaising with authorities in the UK.
Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said earlier that intelligence in Britain had noted that there could be five such letter bombs and that “this could well be the fifth”.
Asked whether there were similarities between the parcels delivered in the UK and the one found this morning, he said there were.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Today with Sean O’RourkeFlanagan said: “I understand that to be the case with particular reference to the postage stamp that was used.”
An Post has confirmed that there will be no postal services in Limerick today and that any backlog in the area would be made up tomorrow.

Flanagan said it was “a dreadful consequence of the uncertainties around Brexit where in the context of the heightened tensions in Northern Ireland, in the island of Ireland that people have taken it on themselves to send letter bombs”.
He called it an “absolutely despicable act” and “totally unacceptable” and added that he hoped those responsible could be brought to justice.
UK bombs
Police in the UK confirmedearlier this monththat they were investigating a claim made by a group styling itself as the IRA that it was behind the delivery of the parcel bombs to the locations in Britain.
The group said that five devices had been sent, but at the time only four had been detected, officers said.
The claim was received by a media outlet in the North using a recognised code word, according to a joint statement issued by Police Scotland and London’s Met Police.
On Tuesday 5 March Met Police launched a terrorism investigation after three small explosive devices were reported at a building near Heathrow Airport, London City Aviation House and the mail room of Waterloo station in London city centre.
The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags – were assessed by specialist officers and found to be small improvised explosive devices.
One was opened by staff, causing a small fire, but no-one was injured.
The following dayseveral buildings at the University of Glasgow were evacuated. Bomb disposal experts were called, but the device found there did not go off and no-one was harmed.
Met Police said in a statement today that they were in contact with gardaí over the Limerick device:
The unit at the centre of today’s alert processes returned parcels originally posted from Ireland with incorrect or out of date addresses in addition to items returned from depots (for example, in cases where the addressee doesn’t pick the item up from their local depot after receiving a docket through their letterbox).
The mail delivery unit handling all deliveries for Limerick and the surrounding area was also evacuated.

LEO VARADKAR’S PARTNER will join him for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations at US Vice President’s house today.
Last year, Mike Pence told the Taoiseach his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome in Pence’s home if he decides to attend this year.
Pence made the comments during a private conversation between the two, during which Varadkar raised LGBT rights and equality issues.
The US vice president describes himself as a “Christian, a conservative and a Republican” and has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT people.
The vice president was criticised last year forbreaking with the traditionand not allowing media access to the conversation. Members of the press were left on the lawn of the vice president’s home during the meeting.
At the time, the Taoiseach said it was the US administration’s decision to have the meeting in private.
Prior to it, Varadkar repeatedly said he would talk with Pence about social issues, including LGBT rights.
Breakfast meeting
Confirming Barrett’s attendance yesterday, Varadkar said:
“He’s going to be at the breakfast tomorrow. He was able to get time off work and make the journey. He’ll be taking up the invitation from Mike and Karen Pence to attend tomorrow. Karen can’t be there because she’s in Abu Dhabi for the Special Olympics.”
Barrett will also attend the traditional shamrock ceremony in the White House but it is understood he will not take to the stage during the presentation.
The media are permitted to attend the breakfast meeting this year.

Speaker’s Lunch
After breakfast, Varadkar will attend the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, and meet with senior members of Congress.
All eyes will be on the Taoiseach afterlast year’s kerfufflewhen he went off script during his speech.
During the luncheon he told a story about Trump contacting him in 2014 in relation to a matter concerning Trump’s golf course and hotel at Doonbeg in Co Clare.
Varadkar said that he inquired about the planning permission for a proposed wind farm after he received a call from then-businessman Trump.
Varadkar was Tourism Minister at the time.
In his comments, Varadkar said that he made contact with the council about the plan.
“So I endeavoured to do what I could do about it. I rang [Clare] County Council and inquired about the planning permission and subsequently, the planning permission was declined, and the wind farm was never built, thus the landscape being preserved,” Varadkar said.
Varadkar added that Trump “has kindly given me credit for that, although I think it would probably have been refused anyway”.
Just a joke
Varadkar later had to issue a clarification, stating that he had gone back to check with his staff and records following the controversy caused by his remarks, adding that he had done nothing wrong.
Varadkar said the luncheon is the kind of occasion where people make jokes and tell anecdotes.
Later this evening, the Taoiseach will join Trump and his wife Melania, for the traditional shamrock ceremony at the White House, in advance of attending the Ambassador’s St Patrick’s Day Reception.
In his meetings he will also emphasise the strength of Irish-US relations, and will recall the important role of the US in supporting peace and the Good Friday Agreement, and outline Ireland’s position on Brexit.
He will also press the case for resolving the situation facing the undocumented Irish in America.

Speaking at Pence’s house, Varadkar said that growing up in Ireland he had always been fascinated by US politics saying that “in many ways it helped to inspire me to believe in the power of politics to do good because ultimately that is what politics is all about”.
“It helped inspire me to run for office. I also knew at the time that I lived in a country where if I tried to be myself, at the time I would have ended up breaking laws.
“But today that has all changed. I stand here as leader of my country, flawed and human, where I am judged by my political actions and not my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.

https://www.the42.ie/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-3-4527905-Mar2019/,"WHO KNEW THAT all we needed in the millenia-spanning quest for cosmic justice was a little TV screen by the side of a football pitch?
To deal with the banalities of football justice for a moment: Presnel Kimpembe’s jutting his arm out in blocking Diogo Dalot’s late shot was a penalty under the game’s rules, so the correct decision was (belatedly) reached.
The laws need to be reviewed if decisions continue to be so in slow motion, but under the rules both sides implicitly accepted by turning up in the place, the officials made the right call.
Granted, PSG have never shown themselves to be too keen on the Champions League’s rules, but it is their misfortune that the ones governing life between white lines are more strictly enforced than those outside outside them.
Uefa are investigating the club following Der Spiegel’s publishing of documents exposed by Football Leaks, claiming that that PSG inflated the value of sponsorship deals to circumvent the FFP rules and while the club deny any wrongdoing, the fallout will be their last Uefa-related tangle of the season.
Referee Damir Skomina reviews the incident that led to Marcus Rashford's winning penalty.John WaltonJohn Walton
They are out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the third-straight year, once again contriving to blow a comfortable first-leg advantage while United’s improbable run under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shows no signs of running out of road.
After triumphing against a side whose expression of self-identity has thus far consisted of becoming a ‘lifestyle brand’, Solskjaer returned to his idea of United as being a brand of a certain way of living.
Advertisement
“This is how we do things at Man United”, said Solskjaer, having hewn into history one of the club’s greatest European nights.
Solskjaer’s constant referring back to the club’s identity can become cloying, but it serves a purpose on nights like these.
The promotion of youth has become a central plank of this approach, and lost amid the plaudits for Rashford’s coolness from the penalty spot was the fact that he was, relatively speaking, a grizzled veteran among United’s attackers: Dalot, Chong and Greenwood are all teenagers.
Ashley Young, Chris Smalling, Victor Lindelof, and Luke Shaw were genuinely outstanding as rugged, determined presences at the back for United, with Fred suddenly transforming from delicate figure of excess to a kind of wild and snapping dog of war.
All of these players seem liberated by the fact they are playing for some kind of purpose; of playing for something bigger than themselves.
Jose Mourinho’s higher cause was a miserly, limiting one: an underdog, siege mentality rarely works at the second-richest club on the planet.
To enforce it, he relied on a kind of warping of reality, and thus all value judgements on players’ attitude and contribution had to be filtered through Mourinho’s own, deliberately distorting view. How else to explain his ludicrous assertion that United are lacking in “football heritage?”
Marcus Rashford celebrates the decisive goal.John WaltonJohn Walton
Rather than making United’s purpose bigger than anyone, he made it no larger than his capricious self.
Solskjaer has given the players something else to play for, and central to it his showing a characteristic Mourinho has squashed to the deepest, darkest corners of his self: humility.

The selection of Eric Bailly at right-back was the most egregious error of Solskjaer’s reign thus far, and for 34 minutes he was shredded by Angel Di Maria and Juan Bernat. He was bewilderingly lost, constantly drifting in-field to play as the third centre-back that nobody wanted.
Bailly’s dawdling was the most significant contributing factor to Bernat’s early equaliser, but Solskajer creditably admitted his own mistake. Dalot replaced Bailly before half-time, with Ashley Young dropping to right-back.
Contrast that to the decision-making of Neurotic Alpine Scientist Unsure If He Should Really Be Executing A Bond Villain’s Desires Thomas Tuchel, who left Timo Kehrer chastened at right-back for 70 minutes while the much better Thomas Meunier sat on the bench.
While United relied on considerable amounts of fortune for their goals, to attribute it just to luck is to ignore their superb defensive display, in which Lindelof and Smalling found levels that had hitherto never touched.
They were also helped by a curiously muddled second-half performance by PSG in which they didn’t decide to attack or defend, instead merely waiting for time to pass in hope.
This was a night to show that Manchester United remains an occasionally audacious idea worth believing in, and against a club still a little unsure of what they are…that can count for something.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rural-direct-provision-centres-4543608-Mar2019/,"CONCERNS HAVE BEEN raised about the location of some Direct Provision centres as two planned facilities damaged by suspected arson attacks are still to open.
The new centres, former hotels inMoville, Co DonegalandRooskey, Co Leitrimwere due to open in January.
There are concerns about the centre in Moville in particular, given its rural location and distance from Dublin. Residents would likely have to travel to the capital for appointments related to their asylum application.
The quickest method, by either car or public transport, would involve crossing the border into Northern Ireland – a criminal offence for asylum seekers.
It would take about three hours and 40 minutes to drive non-stop from Moville to Dublin city. However, asylum seekers generally rely on public transport – this method of travel could mean having to get more than one bus and could take upwards of seven hours one-way.
The journey time would be again extended if the person wished to remain within the Republic, something they are supposed to. As such, asylum seekers living at the planned centre would be unable to travel to and from Dublin in the same day.
Google MapsGoogle MapsGoogle Maps
Sinn Féin’s Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin toldTheJournal.iethe suspected arson attacks at the sites of the proposed centres in Moville and Rosokey are “absolutely unjust”.
He added, however, that these locations are “not suitable places to be putting asylum seekers”, noting that residents at the Moville centre “wouldn’t be able to get to Dublin and back in a day and would have to take a circuitous route via Sligo”.
A spokesperson for Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre, echoed these sentiments, noting that people staying in Moville “will have to travel a roundabout route to Dublin for interviews in order to stay within the borders of the Republic”.
“We know from our experience working with asylum seekers in remote centres, such as Clonakilty in west Cork, that travelling to Dublin for interviews or meetings with their solicitor ends up inevitably being an overnight trip.
The spokesperson said this presents asylum seekers, in particular families, with “serious difficulties”.

The Irish Refugee Council has also highlighted transport and other issues faced by residents living in rural Direct Provision centres such as Moville, Kenmare in Co Kerry and  Lisdoonvarna in Co Clare.
Almost 6,300 people live in 38 Direct Provision centres across Ireland.
As of last week, 729 individuals have been granted protection status or permission to remain in Ireland – 206 people have refugee status; 441 people have permission-to-remain status and 82 people have subsidiary protection status.
Adults and children living in DP centres each receive a weekly allowance of €21.60.

Overnight stay in Sligo
When asked about the location of the Moville centre and the provision of overnight accommodation, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice and Equality said “arrangements will be put in place to provide overnight accommodation in Sligo to assist applicants to get to their appointments in Dublin”.
They added that as part of the contractual agreement between the department and accommodation providers, “arrangements must be put in place to meet the reasonable transport needs of residents”.
The spokesperson said the department is “still committed to opening the accommodation centre in Moville”.
They added that the department is liaising closely with the contractor, but has no set date for the completion of the necessary repairs.
In relation to the planned centre in Rooskey, along the Leitrim-Roscommon border, the department is “awaiting the completion of works and the submission of regulatory compliance documentation prior to the commencement of the Shannon Key West Hotel as an accommodation centre”.
‘Forced to take what it can get’
The Nasc spokesperson said in addition to transport issues, asylum seekers living in isolated areas have difficulty accessing further education and training, childcare, English language courses and employment opportunities.
Such issues were addressed in the McMahon Working Group and its subsequent report into improving conditions at Direct Provision centres.
McMahon ReportMcMahon Report
McMahon ReportMcMahon Report
The2015 reportmade a number of recommendations in relation to RIA seeking contracts with centres in locations with easy access to educational, medical, transport and other services to meet the needs of residents.
The Nasc spokesperson said these recommendations are being somewhat ignored due to difficulties in sourcing accommodation.
“This certainly points to the need for the Department to start looking beyond the privatised model they have been using for asylum accommodation and start seriously looking at alternative models.”
The spokesperson welcomed recent statements from the department noting that it is open to “exploring alternatives to the current model”.
A number of regional procurement competitions for Direct Provision centres are being rolled out in 2019.
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said it “would be inappropriate to speculate on the location of premises that may be offered to the department in upcoming public procurement competitions”.
However, they added that it is a requirement of the tender that bidders who are located more than 2km from required services provide a transport plan.
They stated that “significant improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been made over recent years, in particular with the implementation of the recommendations of the Justice McMahon Report”.
The spokesperson noted that the introduction of a right to work for qualified applicants who have not received a first-instance decision about their asylum status after nine months can result in “the achievement of economic independence allowing applicants more options to source their own accommodation”.
‘Friends of the Centre’ groups have also been established in each centre. This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration and developing greater community links with residents, the spokesperson added.

Clondalkin Towers
During the week it was announced that the Direct Provision centre in Clondalkin in Dublin is set to remain open for at leastanother two years.
Prior to the announcement, there had been calls for the planned closure of the centre at Clondalkin Towers, another former hotel, to be postponed on humanitarian grounds as residents struggled to find alternative accommodation,as reported byTheJournal.ie.
There were 235 people, including 78 children, living in the centre as of last month.
About 70 residents already have protected or leave-to-remain status and faced having to find private rented accommodation; this figure includes 19 refugees.
The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and the Peter McVerry Trust (PMVT) have been helping residents at Clondalkin Towers source new accommodation.
Clondalkin TowersDonated to the Asylum ArchiveDonated to the Asylum Archive
Prior to the centre’s contract being extended, David Moriarty, Assistant Director of JRS, said there was “huge anxiety” among residents about where they could be sent as they had put down roots in the community and many children had settled in local schools.
He said residents had concerns about being sent somewhere more isolated with fewer services and supports. He added that being made to leave “the only place they’ve known” could have a negative impact on people’s mental health.
“They could be told they’re going to Cork, Donegal, Mayo, wherever it may be – they may or may not have heard of these places,” Moriarty said, adding that organisations like the JRS try to bridge the gap created by such an “information deficit”.
At the start of October, residents were informed that the Clondalkin centre would close on 3 December as the company running the centre was not renewing its contract. However, a deal was later reached to keep the centre open until June.
The company, Fazyard Ltd, has beenpaid €27.5 millionfrom the State over an 11-year period for operating the centre. It reapplied to run the centre in the recent tendering process and was successful. The company plans to increase the centre’s capacity from 225 to 250 people.
During the week it was also announced that three other centres – two in Co Kildare (Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin and the Eyre Powell in Newbridge) and one in Co Laois (the Montague Hotel in Emo) – are due to be granted two-year contract renewals once mobilisation works to deliver on the proposals have been commenced. A further one-year extension may be added to each contract.
Fazyard Ltd is also behind the proposal for the centre in Co Laois, which has a planned capacity of 202 residents.
Oscar Dawn Ltd is the bidder for the Hazel Hotel proposal, which has a planned capacity of 143 residents. Peachport Ltd is behind the Eyre Powell bid, which has a planned capacity of 125 residents.
The government has paid tens of millions of euros to private companies running Direct Provision centres around Ireland. It has also paid over €1.6 million to a private contractor tosource emergency accommodationfor asylum seekers since September 2018.
This week,TheJournal.ierevealed that nearly 100 asylum seekers have been relocated from a hotel in Co Monaghan tomake rooms availableahead of peak tourist season.

ISLAMIC CUSTOM DICTATES that people have to be buried as soon as possible after death – but the scale and devastation of Friday’s massacre of 50 people in Christchurch has delayed the handover of bodies to next of kin.
As the first bodies of the Christchurch mosque shooting victims were returned to their grieving families, Muslim volunteers from across New Zealand and Australia have stepped in to help with the burial process.
Police said today that just six bodies have been released so far, and a total of 12 victims identified. Waves of volunteers have driven or flown in to Christchurch to help ease the burden on exhausted locals.
“We are a Muslim community, regardless of where we are situated through the country and the world, there is always going to be a connection with other Muslims when tragedy occurs,” Javed Dadabhai, a volunteer from Auckland, told AFP.
While there has been no figures on the number of volunteers who have travelled to Christchurch, large numbers have been walking in and out of a family support centre near the Al Noor Mosque where dozens were killed by a white supremacist.

Washing of bodies
Sohail Ibrahim was among the volunteers who packed his bags and hopped onto a plane from Sydney when a call came from his mosque for helpers.
“The problem is, many men and many women can’t face the body,” Ibrahim told AFP of why he felt compelled to lend a helping hand.
Dadabhai said the volunteers were divided into several teams which would help in the washing of bodies — required under Islamic custom — and the burials in the cemetery.
Mohammed Bilal, another volunteer from Auckland, said the “coming together” was a good way for Muslims to show they wanted to “live peacefully”.
“That’s why we are here,” he told AFP. “This is a hard time but we have to be strong and faithful and believe that we are going to overcome this.
“People come here to help each other and do something good for our society.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/nurse-bus-driver-4524763-Mar2019/,"A NURSE WHO intervened when a Dublin Bus driver took ill and the vehicle veered into traffic in the city centre has said she is grateful she was there to help.
Aoife McGivney was on her way to work at the Mater Hospital when she noticed the bus veering off track and other passengers “started screaming”.
“We were going through red lights, there were cars beeping and we actually ran over a bicycle, which was quite frightening at the time,” she told RTÉ’s Ryan Tubridy this morning.
The bus had knocked a cyclist off his bicycle but he managed to jump out of the way before the bus drove over it. He suffered only minor injuries.
McGivney ran to the front of the bus where another woman told her there was something wrong with the driver. He was unconscious and his breathing was “very poor”.
At this stage the bus was approaching O’Connell Bridge and she said people on the street were running alongside the bus, trying to see what was wrong.

McGivney and the other passenger managed to open the driver’s door and she said she moved his legs to get his feet off the pedals. The bus cut out and rolled to a stop.
After putting the driver in  the recovery position she said she noticed his breathing and heart had stopped. With the help of some other passengers with first aid training, she started CPR.
The nurse said she was told by paramedics who took the man to hospital that he was up and talking by the time the ambulance left the scene. She said she planned to visit him today.
“I need to see him alive. We’re just so lucky, it was a very very scary situation to be in.”
She said she wanted to highlight the importance of first aid training so members of the public can “recognise when someone is that sick and when it’s time to intervene”.
“My training helped me out a lot yesterday.”
McGivney, who had almost missed the bus that morning, said she is “grateful” that she was able to be there.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-city-council-needs-e750000-to-enforce-new-short-term-letting-rules-4515549-Mar2019/,"IT’S ANTICIPATED THAT Dublin City Council will need up to €750,000 to set up a dedicated team to enforce new short-term letting rules in the city – €350,000 more than originally thought.
From 1 June, regulations will kick in to tackle potentially illegal short-term lets in areas of high housing demand, like Dublin, and local authorities have said they will need to be sufficiently resourced.
Green Party councillor Patrick Costello has said, however, that Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has yet “to provide real details” of the new regulations.
“The councils will no doubt bear the weight of implementation and enforcement so it’s imperative the department consult with us,” says Costello, who argues that a lack of details is unfair for those using short-term letting platforms, too. “As much as the council, they need clarity and certainty”.
Last November, Dublin councillors were told that an estimated €400,000 would be required in order to establish a team to enforce these new rules.
The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, meanwhile, has said that it will provide additional resources to local authorities, though so far it’s understood that Dublin City Council has been given no additional resources.
And there are concerns that, even when these rules come in, they will not be effective in returning lettings to the long-term rental market.
‘Logistically very difficult’
According to thelatest figuresfrom Inside Airbnb, there are 9,530 listings in Dublin and 4,152 of these were by hosts with multiple listings.
In areas of high demand, there have been concerns for some time that professional landlords are withdrawing houses and apartments that would normally be rented on a long-term basis and are instead renting them out as short-term lets, reducing the availability of long-term rental accommodation.
Under new rules proposed by Murphy, it’s anticipated that home sharing on platforms like Airbnb will only be allowed where it is a person’s primary residence. Homeowners who currently let a second property on a short-term basis will have to apply for ‘change of use’ planning permission.

The new regulations will also require people renting out their homes to register with their local authority.
An annual cap of 90 days will apply to renting out a home and homeowners can only rent out their homes to visitors for 14 days or less at a time.
Map showing Airbnb listings in DublinInsideAirbnb.comInsideAirbnb.com
But with the cost for Dublin City Council now anticipated to be approximately €750,000, local representatives have queried a lack of resources and some remain unconvinced the new rules will work at all.
Workers Party councillor Eilís Ryan has said that the rules will be “incredibly hard to regulate” even if the council is resourced sufficiently.  Once it “gets down to the nitty gritty of trying to prove how many nights people have let bedrooms out for”.
“We don’t have a enough resources to regulate illegal dumping,” says Ryan. “Why should public money be used to regulate a private industry?”
With in excess of 5,000 separate properties listed on short-term platforms like AirBnB in 2017, tackling potentially illegal short-term lettings in the city is likely to be “resource intensive”, council management said back in November.
“The enforcement of short-term lettings is logistically very difficult with problems establishing ownership, gaining access to apartments and houses and most importantly a requirement to prove illegal occupation,” the council has said.
‘Bear the weight’
On several occasions from September last year, Airbnb representatives met with TDs, councillors and several ministers to discuss the proposed short-term letting regulations.
Laying out its business case to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in late August, Airbnb wrote – in documents released toTheJournal.ieunder Freedom of Information – that the company “are in full agreement with the government that there needs to be rules put in place”. However, community support head Aisling Hassell added that these rules “need to be balanced and targeted at only those who are acting ‘commercially’ and not damage the lives of those who are benefiting from the abovementioned extra income”.
Sinn Féin housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin has argued that the rules should force platforms like Airbnb to inform the local authorities and the department which properties are let out and for how many nights these are let out.
Such a system, Ó Broin has said, could ease the burden on local authorities and prevent a Barcelona-style system whereby inspectors go from dwelling-to-dwelling to determine if rules are being broken or not, which in turn puts pressure on resources.
Related ReadsExplainer: What will the new Airbnb laws mean for homeowners and landlords?
A spokesperson for Airbnb toldTheJournal.ie, however, that “imposing an obligation on platforms to monitor what their users do across not just their own platform, but all platforms, is inappropriate and could be in contravention of EU laws”.
“It is also not clear how the Irish government could effectively enforce this obligation on large booking platforms that are headquartered in other countries (for example, Booking.com, Expedia, and Trip Advisor), and for rules to be effective they need to be applied equally by all platforms and providers”.
“We want to be good partners to authorities and work together to help people share their homes and follow the rules, but local authorities are best placed to lead enforcement efforts,” the spokesperson said.
‘Lead-in time’
According to a housing department spokesperson the new regulations are “to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws”.
“The issue of additional resources is an important factor in underpinning the proposed new arrangements and one which the department will be engaging with local authorities on,” the spokesperson said.
The department, “in recognising the acute pressure on rents particularly in the Dublin area” has said that “additional resources will be provided to assist in proactive monitoring and enforcement of these amended regulations”.
Asked had the department allocated additional resources yet, a council spokesperson said that it is a matter for the department to decide upon.
The Green Party’s Costello has said that “the so-called sharing economy needs to do some sharing of its own” when it comes to enforcement of new regulations.
“There must be a requirement on Airbnb and similar platforms to share information when clients breach regulations. That needs to be part of any regulations. This will also help keep the costs down for Dublin City Council”.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has led tributes to people killed in mass shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
At least 49 people have been killed in what police described as a “well planned” attack with dozens of people also injured. There are reports of close to 50 people in hospital with gunshot wounds.
The two mosques which were targeted were filled with worshippers for Friday prayers.
Varadkar, who is visiting the United States for St. Patrick’s Day, has expressed “condolences” and “solidarity” with the people of New Zealand following the attacks.
“New Zealand and its people are open, tolerant and welcoming,” Varadkar said in a statement. “We join them today, united in our condemnation of this appalling attack and determined in our resolve that hate will not triumph.”
“I will be writing to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to express sincere sympathies and support. I would also like to pay tribute to the valiant work of Christchurch’s emergency services”.
Meanwhile, Ardern has described the shootings as a terrorist attack, saying today is “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.

“Clearly, what has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” Ardern said this afternoon.
“Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home.”
“They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.”
‘Stand in solidarity’
Police in Christchurch have said that one person, a man in his 20s, has been charged with murder and is due to appear in court tomorrow.

Four people in total are now in custody – three men and one woman – and a number of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) have been discovered around the city. The explosive devices were attached to vehicles belonging to the detained suspects. None had detonated and were subsequently made safe by the military.
The attacks took place during lunchtime at mosques on Deans Avenue and Linwood Avenue.
Following the attacks, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan paid tribute to the victims saying he was “heartbroken”.
“My heart goes out to all the victims, their grieving families and friends,” Khan said, adding that Londonders “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Christchurch.”
“We stand in solidarity to say that those who seek to divide us, to break our communities and destroy our way of life will never succeed.”

London mosques have been targeted in the past. One man died and several others were injured in 2017 when Darren Osborne drove a van into people leaving evening prayers.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said today that one of the Christchurch attackers was a “right-wing terrorist” with Australian citizenship.
“We stand here and condemn, absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist,” an emotional Morrison told a press conference today.
“We are not just allies, we are not just partners, we are family,” he said.
Meanwhile, New Zealand rugby player Sonny Bill Williams paid an emotional tribute to the victims in a video posted on Twitter.

“As President of Ireland may I offer the sympathy of the people of Ireland to the families of the victims, and express the solidarity of the people of Ireland with the people of New Zealand at this time.”
“This attack on innocent lives at spaces of worship for a religious community will be condemned by all those who believe in freedom and democratic values.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/alice-morrow-murder-psni-appeal-4540264-Mar2019/,"THE POLICE SERVICE of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has appealed for witnesses as they investigate the murder of grandmother Alice Morrow in Belfast.
The 53 year-old’s body was discovered at her flat at Whincroft Way, east Belfast on Sunday, and investigators believe she may have been killed between 12pm and 8pm that day.
A 42-year-old man remains in police custody following his arrest on suspicion of murder, and investigators are following a number of lines of inquiry.
Detective chief inspector Pete Montgomery said his thoughts were with Alice’s family and friends as he appealed for witnesses to her killing.
“I know that at 8.45pm on Saturday 9 March, Alice travelled from the direction of the Bevloir area to Ballyduff where she visited friends,” he said.
“She drove her car in both directions, a Silver Peugeot 106, registration FCZ 1913.

“She was last seen on CCTV at 2.52am at Brackenvale Eurospar on Saintfield Road where she purchased a number of items and then headed in the direction of Belfast.”
Police have appealed to members of the public who may have seen Alice in her car in the Bevloir or Ballyduff areas of the city, as well as those who may have seen her elsewhere on Sunday.
They suggested that Alice may have been walking her two Jack Russell dogs, and asked if anyone who saw her noticed whether anyone was with her while she was doing so.
Police also say they want to know if anyone noticed a person or people entering Alice’s home at Whincroft Way on Sunday, or whether an altercation took place there.
“I would appeal to anyone who has any information, no matter how insignificant they think it is, to contact us,” Montgomery added.
“Your information could be key in bringing Alice’s murderer to justice.”
He called on members of the public who may have information to call the PSNI, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

POLICE IN LONDON have said that tackling knife crime remains a “top priority” following a “tragic ten days” of violence in the capital.
Two 17-year-olds were killed in separate stabbing incidents this weekend in London and Manchester.
Jodie Chesney was killed on Friday evening in a park in East London. Yousef Makki was killed in the village of Hale Barns on Saturday evening.
Their deaths – as well as several more deaths resulting from knife crime over the past few weeks – have sparked renewed calls for a dedicated office to tackle a rise in youth violence in the UK with West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson calling knife crime a “national emergency”.
Speaking today, the Met’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty said that “one incident, one injury, one death is one too many” and that the police force has been “working day and night to make progress” in tackling knife crime in the capital.

More officers from the Met’s Violent Crime Taskforce have been put on duty, McNulty said, with extended shifts aimed at increasing visibility throughout London.
Over the last three days, police officers have conducted over 2,500 stop-and searches. “To give some idea of the scale of our activity around tackling knife crime, in the last 12 months we have seized thousands of weapons by utilising stop and search,” McNulty said today, in response to the recent violence.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNultyMetropolitan PoliceMetropolitan Police
“However, we are not complacent and I would appeal to the public to contact police if they are aware of anyone carrying a knife”.
Chesney’s death on Friday comes after David Lopez-Fernandez (38) died from stab wounds in Tower Hamlets in London on 25 February. Che Morrison (20) was stabbed to death in Ilford in London the following day.
McNulty has encouraged people who are not comfortable with contacting police to still act and to report knife possession.
“If you are not comfortable about speaking directly to police, please do contact Crimestoppers where you can provide information anonymously. By doing this, you could save a life.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/gambling-charity-4548708-Mar2019/,"A NEW CHARITY has been set up to fund services providing research, education and counselling related to gambling addiction in Ireland.
The Gambling Awareness Trust receives funding from several sources, including the gambling industry. This is similarto the set-up of Drinkaware, which receives contributions from both the alcohol and grocery retail industries.
The trust will be overseen by an independent board of directors chaired by Tom Hayes, former minister of state for agriculture.
The other members of the board are Kathleen Lynch, former minister of state for primary care, mental health and disability, John Forde, a retired garda superintendent,Willie Collins, former CEO of Aiseiri addiction services and retired district court judge Gillian Hussey.

It will have access to a fund of over €1 million a year and it will shortly invite proposals from service providers in the fields of research, education and counselling.
Hayes said it is hoped that in time other commercial organisations who benefit from gambling will also contribute.
A government bill published in 2013 proposed the creation of a social fund, financially resourced by gambling licence holders to promote socially responsible gambling and counter-act the ill-effects of irresponsible gambling.
“While we are waiting for the government’s Gambling Control Bill to be enacted, today’s announcement is a recognition that action in this area is needed now and should not wait for the political system. The charity is an independent body and expects financial contributions from across the gambling industry,” Hayes said.
“We are confident that this report will give considerable insight into the areas where the board should focus its attention,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poverty-single-parents-ireland-4524043-Mar2019/,"POVERTY AMONG WORKING lone parents has more than doubled between 2012 and 2017, according to a new report by the Society of St Vincent de Paul (SVP).
The report –Working, Parenting and Struggling– found that in 2012 one in 11 working lone parents were living below the poverty line, but by 2017 it had increased to one in five.
It found that the living standard of lone parents in Ireland are among the worst in Europe as they have the second highest rates of income poverty, persistent poverty and severe deprivation among 15 EU peer countries.
“High housing and childcare costs combined with low levels of income mean that it is very difficult for many families with children to make ends meet,” SVP social policy development officer and author of the report Dr Tricia Keilthy said.
“These factors significantly reduce the standard of living of working lone parents who face additional challenges as both the primary earner and primary caregiver for their families.”
Advertisement
In 2017, 45% of lone parents reported a heavy financial burden due to housing costs and almost 18% were in arrears on mortgage or rent repayments. The rate of arrears for other households with children was 8% in 2017.
The report also found that in 2017, 84% of lone parents in Ireland were unable to meet unexpected expenses, compared to an EU-15 average of 58%.
In 2017, 58% of lone parents were working compared to 46% in 2012. This is the lowest rate among the 15 EU countries. However, the rate increases to 66% for those with children over 12, indicating that when childcare needs are lower, the labour market attachment of lone parent is higher.
Almost 60% of lone parents reported that they couldn’t access childcare services due to cost – the second highest rate in the 15 EU countries, just after Spain.
Employment rates are three times higher among lone parents with third level education but one in five lone parents reported that they couldn’t access formal education for financial reasons.
“The first SVP members began their work in Dublin in 1844. However, many of the same issues of poverty – low paid, precarious work and poor quality housing – persist for the people we assist,” SVP national president Kieran Stafford said.
“Our members see the strain on working lone parents who are trying to combine spending time with their children and meeting their caring responsibilities with jobs which can be inflexible and insecure, and often do not provide a sufficient income to meet all of the household needs”.","7.59am, 5 Mar 2019",

CRISTIANO RONALDO SCORED a spectacular hat-trick to fire Juventus into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday that saw his side claim a thrilling tie 3-2 on aggregate.
The Portuguese superstar scored two headers either side of half-time and a late penalty to clinch a place in Friday’s last-eight draw with a dominant display by the Italian champions in Turin.
Diego Simeone’s Atletico were a shadow of the team who had run riot in the first leg in Madrid, and crashed out of the tournament they had been hoping to win in their own Wanda Metropolitano Stadium on June 1.
It is the eighth time that Ronaldo has scored a hat-trick in the competition and mirrors his improbable triple which lifted former club Real Madrid past Wolfsburg in April 2016 with the Spaniards 2-0 down after the first leg.
The Champions League’s record scorer took his tally in the tournament to 124, with four goals this season.

Juventus signed 34-year-old Ronaldo last summer from Real Madrid for 100 million euros ($117 million) in order to make the difference on the continent for the Italian champions, who have not won the Champions League since 1996 and have finished runners-up twice in the past four season.
And five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo pulled out a spectacular performance as he spearheaded the attack along with Federico Bernardeschi and Mario Mandzukic.

- Dominant Juve -
Massimiliano Allegri’s side came out firing, dominating the first half with nine shots on goal compared to three for the Spaniards.
Atletico had an early scare when Juventus skipper Giorgio Chiellini, making his 500th Juve appearance, had the ball in the back of the net after four minutes.

But a VAR review confirmed Ronaldo had fouled goalkeeper Jan Oblak in a scramble on front of goal before defender Chiellini had finished off.
Defensive specialists Atletico held off the Juventus pressure until the 27th minute, when Ronaldo met a pin-point Federico Bernardeschi cross to head home the opener.
Bernardeschi sent a curling free kick just wide minutes later with Ronaldo missing a chance for a second when he headed wide.
A Chiellini header from a Miralem Pjanic corner was cleared by Oblak, before Alvaro Morata missed a chance for an away goal before the break when he shook off Leonardo Bonucci only to head over.
But back after the break Ronaldo levelled the tie with his second goal with a move he began from his own half with a pass to Leonardo Spinazzola down the left.

The ball was worked to Joao Cancelo, who crossed into the penalty area for Ronaldo, whose powerful header was pushed out by Oblak but not before it had crossed over the line.
Teenager Moise Kean missed a chance to put Juve ahead just after coming off the bench, sending wide with only the goalkeeper to beat.
But the decisive goal came with four minutes left when Bernardeschi burst into the penalty area from the left and was brought down by Angel Correa.
Ronaldo made no mistake from the spot to score his 25th goal against Atletico to spark pandemonium among the home crowd.

AN 18-YEAR-OLD has appeared in a New Zealand court charged with distributing the livestream video of a deadly mass shooting at Christchurch’s Al Noor mosque.
The teenager, whose name was suppressed by the judge, was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message “target acquired”, and for inciting violence.
He faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, prosecutors said.
A judge did not grant him bail and he is due back in court on 8 April.
The hearing came after 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant allegedly carried out the shootings at Al Moor and Linwood mosques in Christchurch on Friday in which 50 people were killed and dozens more injured.
Investigators had said that the teenager was so far not believed to be directly involved in his attacks.
District Court Judge Stephen O’Driscoll added that details related to the charges were also to be suppressed.
Lawyer
The court-appointed lawyer to Tarrant, meanwhile, has said the alleged attacker plans to represent himself and appears “rational”.
Duty lawyer Richard Peters, who represented him during the preliminary court hearing, told AFP the 28-year-old “indicated he does not want a lawyer”.

“He wants to be self-represented in this case,” said Peters, who played down suggestions that Tarrant may not be fit for trial.
“The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. That’s how he appeared. He seemed to understand what was going on,” Peters said.
Tougher gun laws
New Zealand’s government agreed measures today “in principle” to tighten gun control laws in the country.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said details of the measures would be rolled out before a cabinet meeting next Monday, saying “the time to act is now”.
“We have made a decision as a cabinet, we are unified,” she added, flanked by her coalition partner and deputy prime minister, Winston Peters.
Peters, whose New Zealand First party has previously opposed changes, said he backed the prime minister fully.
“The reality is that after 1pm on Friday our world changed forever and so will our laws,” he said.
Ardern has also announced that an inquiry will be launched into how and why the suspected gunman was not picked up by intelligence agencies prior to last Friday’s attacks.

BOHEMIANS STRIKER DINNY Corcoran has made a surprise appearance on the long-running Channel 4 quiz show, Countdown, hours after winning the SSE Airtricity League/Soccer Writers’ Association of Ireland Player of the Month for February, having helped his side to an impressive start this season.
Addressed as ‘Daniel,’ the player could not repeat his on-pitch heroics in the TV studio, losing out to his opponent by a score of 97-50.

Presenter Nick Hewer asked Corcoran about his footballing experience, quizzing him on why Irish football has adopted summer football, with the perplexed Bohs star unsure of the answer.

While his Countdown skills could do with plenty of improvement, the same could not be said of the Dubliner’s on-field performances. Corcoran netted three times during the opening weeks of the campaign, including the winner in the Dublin derby victory over Shamrock Rovers, as Bohs secured three wins and two draws from their first five Premier Division outings.

The 30-year-old, who has been a consistently prolific goalscorer for Keith Long’s side over the last two seasons, claimed the monthly prize ahead of team-mate James Talbot, who finished runner-up, and Ciaron Harkin of Derry City in third.
“It’s great to win the award,” Corcoran said. “Personal achievements are always good, but more importantly we’ve had a great start to the season as a team and hopefully we can push on and get more points on the board now.
“I’m feeling good and I had the perfect start to the season personally with the three goals. We also kept three clean sheets in those games, which is nice.”
Bohs, who sit second and just two points off early pacesetters Rovers after five rounds of action, travel to Turner’s Cross to face Cork City on Friday night.
“We lost three or four big players last season, but I think Keith must be used to it at this stage as it has been happening regularly over the last few years due to other teams having more money,” Corcoran added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/abbott-ireland-tax-avoidance-4528308-Mar2019/,"IT HAS BEEN held up as one of Ireland’s biggest success stories in driving regional employment – a medical products giant with a 70-year history in the country and more than 3,000 staff dotted across 10 sites.
But Abbott, which has benefitted from around €50 million in IDA grants, has also deployed an aggressive tax avoidance structure to legally siphon billions in profits through Irish-registered companies to Bermuda, a notorious tax haven.
Meanwhile, through a myriad of subsidiaries and system of inter-company charges involving a variation on the infamous so-called ‘double Irish’ structure, its local operations have also legally shaved their tax bills with the Exchequer despite pulling in huge sales.
Most of the company’s financial dealings involving Ireland have been shrouded in secrecy until late last year, when EU-led changes to accounting rules exposed its subsidiaries to public view.
Since it was founded in Illinois just over 130 years ago, Abbott has steadily grown to become a global behemoth with more than 100,000 staff and over $30 billion in global sales.
Its interests span from making artificial replacement heart valves to selling protein drinks and snack bars.
In Ireland, where it first set up a presence in 1946, the company operates manufacturing sites in several counties, making diagnostics tests in Lisnamuck, Co Longford, infant formula at Cootehill in Cavan, vascular devices at Clonmel in Tipperary and other products from sites in Sligo and Donegal.
It maintains that in the past five years, while adhering to all tax laws and regulations in Ireland, it has added €2 billion to the economy.
The company’s main operations here are run through a Bermuda-registered company, Abbott Ireland, set up in 1983.
This company pays its taxes in Ireland. However it is owned outright by one of two Abbott subsidiaries incorporated in the Republic but resident in Bermuda, a country which has been labelled as theworld’s worst corporate tax haven- and where no company taxes apply.
It is through these two companies that billions of Abbott’s income earned outside the US is funnelled.

The Bermuda triangle
Abbott Ireland’s parent company, the Bermuda-resident Abbott Laboratories Vascular Enterprises (ALVE), had no staff on its books in 2017 but was listed as being responsible for sourcing and distributing the firm’s healthcare products and licensing its technology to related parties.
ALVE was incorporated in 2003 and reported a combined pre-tax profit of €1.96 billion in 2016 and 2017 on revenues of €5.2 billion. The firm’s registered office is listed as the address of its Dublin law firm, Matheson.
Its accounts noted that the firm would have owed €244.8 million in Irish corporate taxes at the full 12.5% rate, however that sum was reduced to zero due to its Bermuda residency.
The loophole, involving multinationals setting up Irish subsidiaries that are tax resident offshore,was closed to new entrantsby then-finance minister Michael Noonan from 2015 after international pressure to crack down on tax avoidance.
However multinationals with the structure already in place were given until the end of 2020 to change the makeup of their subsidiaries.
In 2017, ALVE paid out dividends of €1.7 billion to its parent company, a sum that was followed with dividend payments totalling more than €1 billion in 2018.
As well as owning Abbott Ireland, it is the umbrella company for a string of international subsidiaries, including various firms based in the Netherlands, Belgium, Costa Rica, Gibraltar and the Bahamas.
The firm itself is a wholly owned offshoot of a second Irish-incorporated but Bermuda-resident operation, Abbott Products, a holding company that provides financing to other firms in the group.
This company, which also had no staff on its books, took in ALVE’s dividends and tens of millions in interest income in 2017, all of which were shielded from any company taxes.
Profits at the firm totalled more than $2 billion that year, a sum that would have resulted in a potential tax bill of $259.6 million (€229 million at current exchange rates) if the company had been resident in Ireland.
Abbott Products’ 2017 accounts include a note that from 2021 the company “may be regarded as tax resident in Ireland” assuming certain conditions weren’t met, meaning its worldwide taxable profits would be subject to Irish corporate tax after the ‘double Irish’ loophole closed permanently.
The company was sitting on accumulated profits of $7.1 billion at the end of 2017, worth some $887 million (€782 million today) in corporate taxes at Ireland’s full 12.5% rate.

Hidden from view
Due to their ‘unlimited’ share structures, neither ALVE nor Abbott Products were required to file publicly accessible accounts under Irish laws, effectively concealing their finances.
However this changed late last year when accounting changes introduced on the back of an EU directive forced most unlimited firms to lodge annual accounts with the Companies Registration Office.
For this reason, it is not possible to determine the full scale or source of any profits garnered by either firm for the majority of the past decade.
Meanwhile, Abbott Ireland – the company’s main Irish operating arm with more than 3,000 staff on its payroll – is designated an ‘external company’ with a branch in the Republic, a structure that sheltered its finances from inspection for over three decades.
That also changed from 2017 with the new accounting rules. Abbott Ireland’s accounts for that year revealed that it reported turnover of nearly €1.6 billion in 2017 – up from €1.4 billion the previous year from distribution of its medical devices and nutritional products.
The billion-euro income was trimmed to a pre-tax profit of around €138 million for 2017 after €657 million was deducted in royalties for the use of the group’s intellectual property.
The company’s latest accounts show that Irish taxes of €19.4 million were due for the year, down from €23.9 million in 2016.

Other business
Abbott also owns a string of smaller subsidiaries in Ireland to handle aspects of the business like its local sales and distribution, international consulting and intra-group financing.
Abbott would not say how much corporate tax it had paid in Ireland across all its subsidiaries when contacted byTheJournal.ie, however a spokeswoman said that over the past five years it had contributed “almost €2 billion to the Irish economy” in taxes, payroll and purchases.
The company was “in full compliance with all local laws and regulations”, she added. A spokesman for the Revenue Commissioners said the agency could not comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers.

Double Irish
Abbott was one of four major pharmaceutical firms whose tax affairs were put under the spotlight last yearin an Oxfam report, which suggested the firm could be underpaying close to $200 million in annual taxes worldwide.
That was based on applying the same profit margin to Abbott’s sales in all territories without the firm shifting profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions. Much of the sum was being stripped from the national finances of developing countries, the report said.
Abbott’s spokeswoman said the company was “a responsible and transparent taxpayer, paying all of its taxes owed in every country in which it operates around the world”. It previously labelled the Oxfam report misleading.
The company is just one of a string of multinationals to use Irish-registered companies resident in tax havens like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands in parallel with its main local operations: a structure that coined the ‘double Irish’ nickname several years ago.
These non-resident firms based in countries with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty are usually used to hold the companies’ valuable intellectual property, which the offshore entities license related firms to use.
Such structures are completely legal under Irish regulations as they stand.
Google has continued in recent years to use the loopholeto funnel billions in profits to Bermuda, while Apple shifted two of itsIrish-registered offshore subsidiaries to Jerseyin response to increased criticism of its tax affairs and changes to local rules.
Abbott did not respond to a question on when it planned to discontinue its use of the tax-avoidance structures.
Abbott and Ireland Inc
For one of the State’s largest employers and a poster child for regional development, Abbott has traditionally kept a low profile, courting little publicity despite its presence in six counties.
Behind the scenes, however, the company has been more active, participating in trade missions to China, Vietnam and the Middle East in recent years alongside Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.
The firm also met with Creed to make sure its interests were protected in the case of Brexit in late 2016, while in early 2017 then-housing minister Simon Coveney invited the company to make a presentation at the launch of the National Planning Framework.
Abbott has also been held up as a success in the government’s attempts to drive more regional development, with the company name-checked by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in July for its investments in Donegal.
Similarly, it has been held up by government ministers as being among the most prominent IDA client companies in response to various questions about job opportunities being created in Tipperary, Sligo and Longford.
Over the past two years, Abbott has been the single biggest recipient of IDA grants, receiving €19.2 million in aid during the period. Total State grants to the company to date are estimated at around €50 million.
In a statement, a spokesman for IDA Ireland said the organisation’s role was to “win foreign investment for Ireland … an extremely competitive sector internationally”.
Grants were “matched and multiplied” by client companies and their provision was assessed based on the potential impact on job creation and other factors, he added.
Neither IDA Ireland nor the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation responded directly to questions on whether it screened client companies based on their use of Ireland-centred tax avoidance structures such as those deployed by Abbott.
IDA Ireland said all its clients agreed binding contracts that tied the firms to confidential conditions and milestones before they received funding.

The international spotlight
Despite its participation in international efforts to crack down on tax avoidance, Ireland’s resounding success in attracting multinationals has been accompanied by intense focus on its perceived cosy relationship with US tech and pharmaceutical firms.
It was one of seven EU countries – alongside the likes of Belgium, the Netherlands and Malta – accused of displaying “traits of a tax haven” recently by a European Parliament committee on tax avoidance.
The government has repeatedly said Ireland does not meet any of the international standards – such as applying no company taxes or refusing to exchange tax information with other administrations – for being considered a tax haven.
Nevertheless, the country’s dependence on foreign investment has placed it at the centre of an ongoing global tug-of-war over where large, usually American companies pay their taxes.
Heavyweight EU member states like France have been pushing for multinationals’ taxes to be more closely linked to where their sales are generated, while Irish officials argue the right approach is to levy taxes based on ‘value creation’ – through the likes of intellectual property, product development and staff.
For its part, the US until recently laid claim to domestic firms’ global profits – although taxes only applied when the money was brought into the country. This effectively  incentivised American firms to stockpile cash in offshore tax havens.
However under President Donald Trump-led changes introduced in late 2017, the US shifted to a “territorial system” like most other developed nations, meaning foreign profits would be taxed at their source.
As part of the changes, a reduced, one-time 15.5% ‘transition tax’ was payable on cash the firms were holding overseas, leading to a flurry of companies transferring offshore funds back to the US.
In the case of Abbott, US filings show the firm came up with an initial estimate that it owed $1.46 billion for the transition tax based on all the profits since 1986 that had previously been sheltered from the Internal Revenue Service.

https://www.thejournal.ie/google-video-game-platform-stadia-4550974-Mar2019/,"GOOGLE HAS TODAY unveiled a video game streaming platform called Stadia.
The platform will store a game-playing session in the cloud. It will allow players to use Stadia across devices operating on Google’s Chrome browser and Chrome OS, such as TVs, laptops, tablets or mobile phones.
Google said its aim is to make players favourite games available in resolutions up to 4K and 60 frames per second with HDR and surround sound.
The platform will be launched later this year in countries including the UK, US and much of Europe. No exact release date has been confirmed.
Google has also unveiled a new controller that can be used to play cloud-based individual or multiplayer games.
The WiFi-enabled controller has a button that lets players launch a microphone and use Google Assistant to ask questions about the games being played. Another button lets users share gameplay directly to Google’s video streaming service, YouTube.

“Using Google’s vast experience, reach and decades of investment, we’re making Stadia a powerful gaming platform for players, developers and YouTube content creators of all sizes,” Google said in a statement.
“We’re building a playground for every imagination.”
Google has said it provided the platform technology to more than 100 game developers.
Ubisoft, the French game studio known for Assassin’s Creed and other titles, said it would be working with Google.
“The power and accessibility of streaming will give billions unprecedented opportunities to play video games in the future,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said.
The move comes as video games are following television and music into the cloud, with console-quality play on its way to being a streaming service as easy to access as Netflix or Spotify.

https://www.the42.ie/federico-macheda-2-4542130-Mar2019/,"FEDERICO MACHEDA WAS at home in Athens watching Manchester United conjure their superb Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month.
“Every United fan probably jumped off their sofas celebrating that goal, including me,” he tellsThe42.
“It was a tough game because United had a lot of injuries and nobody expected them to win but I had a feeling they could make it through. Because the United spirit has always been the same. You know they’re going to give everything in that kind of game. And with that win, United are a dangerous team in the Champions League now. Because with that mentality and passion, you can go far.”
The Italian, who burst on the scene by scoring a famous winner for United against Aston Villa as a 17-year-old back in 2009, has been in the Greek capital since last September, having signed a three-year deal with Giorgos Donis’ young Panathinaikos side.
After a two-year stint with Serie B side Novara, he made an instant impact in his new surroundings, assisting on a goal in a 15-minute cameo in his first appearance and then scoring in back-to-back Super League games. In total, he’s managed six this season but after an early burst, there’s only been one since the turn of the year. Still, he gives an honest appraisal of his debut campaign and insists there’s more to come from him.
“I came here with high hopes after not having the best season in Italy and I have an important role in this team,” Macheda says.
“That makes me happy. I have the trust from the club, the manager and my team-mates. I’m enjoying the moment. I’ve scored a few goals and I should probably score a little bit more but my confidence is coming back. And hopefully I can grab one in the biggest game of the season and that will make everyone happy. Panathinaikos is a big club so I’m really enjoying it here.”
The fixture he’s referring to is the Derby of Eternal Enemies, one of the most intense rivalries in football. It pits Panathinaikos against Olympiacos, two teams separated by just eight miles but a huge societal, cultural and historical chasm. Panathinaikos is the older and more upper class club while their neighbours originated in the immigrant-heavy port area of Piraeus. At a basic level, the supposed differences are clear: on one side there’s big city bourgeois while on the other is runt-of-the-litter realness.
It’s Olympiacos who’ve held the upper hand for a long time. They’re the most successful Greek team in history with 44 league titles compared to Panathinaikos’ 20. In the last two decades, the Piraeus side have claimed 17 championships. So, the battle for bragging rights has been pretty one-sided.
Macheda is enjoying his football at Panathinaikos under boss Giorgos Donis.Adam DavyAdam Davy
Panathinaikos have been off the pace for a while and haven’t won a league since 2010. Last season was the worst in their history as they slumped to an 11th-place finish. Huge financial instability played its part and led to Marinos Ouzounidis’ departure as boss. Donis, who was part of the Panathinaikos side that famously reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1996, was brought in as his replacement and with a litany of young players handed their chance, they currently lie in seventh.
Still, despite their recent struggles, the derby carries plenty of electricity and, later tonight, the teams meet for the second time this season, the reverse fixture back in November having ended 1-1.
“It’s an amazing game to play in,” Macheda says.
“It’s a big fixture in Greek football, the atmosphere is incredible and there’s always a big expectation. Playing at home this weekend, we want to give something good to our fans. We know it’s going to be a difficult one but we’re going to make sure we win because we know how important it is for us, for our fans and for the city.”
“It’s a game where you know you have to give that extra bit more in terms of a fighting spirit. You need to put more of a shift in to make sure you come off the pitch and feel satisfied with how you’ve done in the game. Some of the younger players in the team weren’t used to it because it’s their first season as pros. But now the season is going really well for them so I think we’ll will be ready for this. The season has been better than expected so far. We’ve had some difficulties but stuck together and, though the last few games haven’t been good for us, we can rise up.”

Macheda is the first to admit that he’s struggled for consistency over the last few years.
He remained a registered Manchester United player until the summer of 2014 but his last appearance came as a substitute in a Champions League defeat to CFR Cluj in December 2012. Previous loan spells at Sampdoria and QPR didn’t work out and subsequent temporary arrangements in the Bundesliga (Stuttgart) and the Championship (Doncaster) were similarly underwhelming. But, a stint at Birmingham saw him finish as the club’s top scorer in the division with 10 goals in just 18 appearances in the latter half of 2014 and Cardiff snapped him up on a permanent deal, with his former United reserve boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signing him. However, the Norwegian didn’t last long. As it turned out, neither did Macheda. In 2016, after another disappointing loan at Nottingham Forest, he returned to Italy.
“I had a bad injury at Cardiff and things were going up and down for me,” he says.
Macheda was brought to Cardiff by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but his time at the club was underwhelming.Julian HerbertJulian Herbert
“But that’s part of the game and you’re going to get knocks. I’ve been working on my body much, much better than in the past. I look after myself more and for the last two seasons I didn’t have any injuries so I’m very happy with my physical condition and it’s something I’ve improved on and it’s given me more time on the pitch. So I’m heading in the right direction to get back to where I want to be.
When things are going down for you, you’re willing to work harder to make sure things will go your way again. I’m in the best shape I could be in at the moment and I’m enjoying my football. I think I’ve improved both as a person and a footballer and I think I’ll end up with a good run of performances this season because I can see myself rising up again. Something is working for me. I want to push on even more and make sure I can play on a bigger stage.”
Macheda’s career has always been defined by an Old Trafford moment that’s quickly coming up on its ten-year anniversary.
Having suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats, including a 4-1 thumping at home to title rivals Liverpool, United hosted Aston Villa in early April and were desperate to rediscover some momentum that could drive them to another championship. Victory would see them move ahead of Rafa Benitez’s pretenders at the top of the table but with 10 minutes of normal time remaining, they were 2-1 down.
Macheda, who had only signed pro terms with United at the start of the campaign, scored a hat-trick for Solskjaer’s reserves earlier that week, a feat considered good enough for Alex Ferguson to include him in the first-team squad. When Villa grabbed their second goal to go ahead just shy of the hour mark, Macheda was summoned from the bench and handed his chance.
Cristiano Ronaldo equalised with a low left-footed strike to the bottom corner and Villa braced themselves for the onslaught. But, for a long time, they held firm. Until, Macheda – in the second minute of injury time – turned beautifully after being picked out by Ryan Giggs and curled a magnificent shot to the far corner. In the pantheon of United’s late, late comebacks, it can be filed alongside Steve Bruce’s winner against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.
“It’s a crazy feeling,” Macheda says, looking back.
“Even now it’s hard to explain. It wasn’t something I was expecting but I was working very hard to make the moment happen – just to make a first-team appearance and to play for a big club, even for one game. It’s why I went to Manchester when I was very young. To score the winning goal was an amazing moment, my most important moment. And having my family there was extra special.”
Macheda's career will forever be defined by his winner for Manchester United against Aston Villa when he was just 17.Martin RickettMartin Rickett
“When you do good things, you always look back on them and it’s almost 10 years now. Of course I enjoyed that moment. There have been ups and downs over the rest of the decade but the downs make you think a lot, they make you grow and work harder. You have to look to your future and when the future is working out you renew yourself as a player and improve as a person.”
Macheda has been seriously impressed with his old gaffer too and watched with interest as Solskjaer’s interim spell as United manager has gone from strength to strength.
“When Ole came to the reserves, my football improved a lot,” he says.
“He wanted to improve you. If you were a good player, he wanted to make you better. He played a big part in my career. He always wanted the best for you. He was always there for you. When I made my first team debut and established myself with the side, he was always the one to offer advice. At Cardiff, he signed me and unfortunately it didn’t go that well for him but we always had a good relationship and I’m very, very happy for him. I know what it’s like to work with him. He gives you the time to play, even on a big stage. He knows what you need and I can see the Man United players enjoying their football, probably for the first time this season. And I can understand why the team is doing so well under him.”

After grabbing the winner against Aston Villa, Macheda repeated the trick against Sunderland the following week.Mike EgertonMike Egerton
“He’s done an amazing job and nobody expected him to come in and do so well. As a fan, I would want him there. But, knowing him, I think he’ll want to win something this season. They’re through in the Champions League with an amazing performance in Paris so I think he’s fully focused on the end of the season. As a fan, I’d like him to stay because you can see he’s changed everything in the team – mentality, freshness and guys like Pogba, Rashford, Lukaku, Martial have been performing like the proper players they are. I’d like to see him get the job permanently.”
When United needed something late on against PSG, Solskjaer turned to his bench and brought on Tahith Chong and Mason Greenwood – a couple of teenagers. It seemed a throwback of sorts and for Macheda, it was reminiscent of the Ferguson era.
“It’s amazing to watch those kinds of things,” he says.
“This is the mentality of United. Ole worked under Sir Alex and alongside him there’s Mike Phelan now so there’s still that connection with having a young team. Giving young players a chance is always a part of Man United. When you see them come on in big games, it can only make you happy. It shows to every club that it’s not only about the money. It’s about sending those young players in, whatever age they are, and making them improve.
Ole has been brought up with this mentality. He knows all the good things about the club. And he’s giving younger players opportunities, like Sir Alex did. Also, Mike knows the club so well because he’s been there so long. It’s like having somebody from the family back at Old Trafford. That’s why United keep winning, I think.”

Macheda is 27 now.
There’s no bitterness or whingeing about how things have played out. He’s thankful for the experiences and at ease with where his career has taken him. He’s quick to acknowledge how the circumstances of his United start meant everything that followed always seemed anticlimactic.
He feels there’s still plenty of unfinished business and remains optimistic for what the future holds.
“In football you’re always going to have ups and downs,” he says.
“It’s not easy to make that kind of debut at such a big club. I was a young kid then and now I’m a man. I understand it a lot more than I used to. I have some regrets but in life you’re always going to have them. The most important thing is to make sure you’re heading in the right direction, that you can be the best player you can be. I’ll always be grateful for the memories I made at Man United. It wasn’t easy but that’s football. I’m enjoying my football here and I want to do the best I can to get back to the biggest stage – with this club or with another one.”

SEASONAL CLOCK CHANGES should be scrapped by 2021, a committee of MEPs decided today.
The European Parliament’s Transport and Tourism Committee voted to end the twice-annual practice of changing the clocks and EU states, like Ireland, must now decide which time – summer or winter – they will stick to after a report was backed by 23 votes to 11.
Ireland South MEP Deirdre Clune confirmed today’s decision and said that member states should notify the European Commission of their choice by April 2020.

Consultation conducted by the Commission last year found that over 80% of people favoured abolishing seasonal clock changes, according to Clune.
Last year, 1,000 people were asked on behalf ofTheJournal.ieandClaire Byrne Live/Amárach Researchif Ireland should stop the ritual of changing clocks twice a year with 67% of people saying ‘Yes’.
“There are many benefits to ending the process of changing the clocks each year such as improved outcomes for road safety and economic benefits,” Clune said today. “In addition brighter evenings in winter would have a positive benefit for public health”.
Summertime arrangements in the EU require clocks to be changed twice per year to cater for the changing patterns of daylight and to take advantage of the available daylight in a given period.
Clocks go forward this year on Sunday 31 March.

It’s understood the two individuals, believed to be former US soldiers, breached the airport perimeter as part of an attempt to reach an aircraft used to transport US troops.
The Omni Air International jet was parked at the terminal building at the time.
The pair, who didn’t reach the aircraft, were spotted at around 10.30am by gardaí and airport police.

They were quickly detained and taken to Shannon Garda station for questioning.
An arriving cargo flight was delayed for a time following the incident, but operations at Shannon were otherwise unaffected by the breach.
A Garda spokesman confirmed that two people have been arrested and are being questioned at Shannon Garda station.
The two individuals are believed to be part of a group called US Veterans for Peace, who are visiting Ireland giving talks and highlighting their opposition to the use of Shannon Airport as a refuelling stop for US military flights.
A spokesperson for Shannon Airport confirmed: “Two intruders were apprehended on the Shannon Airport airfield at approximately 10.25am.
“They were intercepted and detained within five minutes and taken into Garda custody.”

TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
THIS LAST YEAR, Kerry TD Michael Healy Rae raised concerns about the rhododendron problem in Killarney National Park.
Killarney National Park is being neglected because not enough resources are put into the maintenance and care of it, the Kerry TD claimed at the time.
He told the Dáil that therhododendrons are “taking over completely”, despite efforts to cut them back.
“The rhododendron situation has gotten so bad in Killarney National Park, minister, that nothing short of calling in the army would put it right,” he claimed
Rhododendron ponticum was introduced to Ireland as a form of hunting cover in the late 19th century. It thrives in the temperate, humid climate and poses a significant threat to Irish woodlands by starving native flora of light and food and preventing regrowth.
It has firmly taken root in the national park and efforts to manage it have been ongoing for more than 30 years.
In a bid to get a hold on the situation,volunteers from the Men’s Shedsfrom around Ireland descended on the park in 2018 to help tackle the rampant rhododendrons. It was the second year Men’s Sheds members from 23 sheds across Ireland had to travel to Kerry to help combat the pernicious plant.
One year on…
One year on since Healy Rae raised the issue in the Dáil, is it any better?
No, according to the Kerry TD.
“In fact, it is getting worse by the week,” he toldTheJournal.ie.
“Despite the best efforts from the Men’s Shed’s volunteers last year, the situation with the weed is getting worse. It is widespread in the park, and it is doing untold damage.
Advertisement
He said nothing is happening to deal with the problem, stating that while employees of the park are doing their best to get a handle on it, a lot more dedicated staff are needed in the park, “or else we will lose the war of the rhododendrons”.
Healy Rae said:
Millions being spent on national park
But the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht takes a different view to that of Healy Rae, saying it has “invested heavily” and is committed to tackling the spread of invasive species in Killarney National Park, most particularly Rhododendron ponticum.
A statement toTheJournal.iesaid that dealing with the plant is “difficult, costly, and labour intensive”, adding that the management of the dynamic and aggressive Rhododendron ponticum is “a long-standing on-going programme in the National Park”.
They said there a robust management programme by experienced National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).
Since 2011, the department said it has invested over €700,000 to tackle rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park.
In 2017, the Department spent over €2 million in Killarney National Park, which included monies spent on Killarney House.
This figure includes a spend of some €228,355.30 on the eradication of Rhododendron in Killarney National Park, it added, stating that it represents a large proportion of the department’s overall budget for National Parks and Reserve.
In 2018, the department spent €223,972.84 on eradication within Killarney National Park.
Staff dedicated to the plant eradication
An updated Strategic Rhododendron Management Plan has been finalised and the department said it has suitably qualified vendors to carry out works over a four-year period.
The department said it employs a number of specialist staff for the park, and this includes one person who is specifically dedicated full-time to its Rhododendron problem.
The statement added that “new invasive alien species legislation” is at an advanced draft stage in the department. This new law will update and strengthen current restrictions around invasive alien species and will also deal with outstanding issues concerning trade in invasive alien species, said the department spokesperson.
This new legislation will bring into force a number of important national measures on foot of the introduction of EU regulations, which deals with invasive alien species across the union, and will provide officials with clear functions and powers in tackling such invasive plants, particularly where these species may have an adverse effect on National Parks and protected sites.

The Munster second row hasn’t featured in this year’s championship yet, having missed the first two rounds with a knee injury.
However, it appears that 27-year-old Beirne could make his Six Nations debut and win his fifth Ireland cap against Wales, with Iain Henderson believed to be struggling with an injury issue.

Schmidt is expected to name a relatively settled team for the clash with Warren Gatland’s Grand Slam-seeking Wales, although an injury to Josh van der Flier is likely to see the experienced Sean O’Brien return at openside flanker.

O’Brien was omitted from the matchday squad for last weekend’s win over France and would be highly motivated to make a big impact if recalled by Schmidt.
Rob Kearney, who missed last weekend’s victory with calf tightness, is set to return at fullback but Ireland could be unchanged otherwise.
Cian Healy, captain Rory Best, and Tadhg Furlong are set to be retained in the front row, as James Ryan seems likely to continue in the second row alongside Beirne. It is understood that Ulster’s Henderson, who started against France, may be ruled out of Saturday’s clash.
Peter O’Mahony, O’Brien and CJ Stander could make up the back row, while Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton seem likely to continue as the halfbacks.
With Robbie Henshaw still out injured, Bundee Aki and Garry Ringrose are favourites to start in midfield, while Jacob Stockdale and Keith Earls are expected to be retained on the wings.
Schmidt is set to officially name his matchday 23 on Thursday afternoon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/snow-traffic-delays-ireland-sunday-3-march-4523136-Mar2019/,"TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IRELAND (TII) has said that a “compounding” of events caused long delays on a number of roads around the country yesterday.
Thousands of motorists were caught in long tailbacks yesterday afternoon, as snow and poor visibility hit sections of the M4, M7, M8 and M9 motorways.
One woman who was travelling from Cork to Dublin with her five-month old baby told RTÉ Radio’sNews at Onethat she spent more than seven hours in her car on the journey, which normally takes under three hours.
“It was a very long day, and my poor husband was exhausted from being behind the wheel for so long,” Louise O’Connor told the show this afternoon.
She said delays were compounded by a number of collisions on the way, as well as roadworks on the N7 near Newbridge.
“I think the information didn’t get out in time. We wouldn’t have travelled if we knew it was bad. We were expecting rain, but we weren’t expecting snow,” Louise said.
“I think the information on the overhead signs needed to be up to date. We passed a few, and there was no information at all on them.”

TII Director of Corporate Communications Sean O’Neill told the show that signs were up-to-date yesterday, and insisted that information about delays was circulated via other channels.
“We were treating the roads, we did notify AA Roadwatch, we were getting out the alerts on AA Roadwatch and in the media,” he said.
“The problem with this event is that it was too compounded by an incident in which the gardaí had to close the road. That caused backups.
“Traffic wasn’t able to get off the road, and ploughs weren’t able to get out and deal with it. It was almost like a flash flood of snow.”
O’Neill also defended the closure of roads by gardaí while they dealt with collisions, saying they had a duty of care to the public to do so.
He added that while it was unfortunate that traffic had to be disrupted as a result, gardaí had to take a “safety first” attitude when closing roads.

The motion proposed seeking an extension until 30 June and noted that if the House passed the Withdrawal Agreement by Wednesday then the three-month extension would be sought “for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation”.
The vote isn’t legally binding and the EU must agree to any extension. Some people have argued that delaying Brexit is largely pointless as European leaders have said the deal struck between Britain and the EU cannot be renegotiated.

In the case at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), the woman was sacked for gross misconduct arising from the incident at the home in August 2017 involving the man.
The WRC has now dismissed the woman’s claim for unfair dismissal after finding that her claim was not well-founded.
In the case, the woman claimed that the male resident “had a history of violence” and that she was “placed in danger in having to deal with him”.
The woman also asserted that “as part of his medication he was provided with pornography on stream and that putting a female employee in to deal with this service user was appalling”.
However, the ‘porn access’ claim was sharply contested by the care home operator who flatly denied that any service user in their responsibility had access to adult material.
The care home operator stated that the care support worker’s ‘porn access’ claim was not raised during the investigation or disciplinary process.

According to WRC Adjudication Officer, Rosaleen Glackin, the care support worker confirmed that she had not raised this issue with her employer.
The woman was sacked arising from a complaint from the service user alleging psychological abuse during an incident at the care home on 8 August 2017.
The employer found that the care support worker had called the care home resident a little s**t, had raised her voice to the user, had pointed her finger at the user and she had threatened the user with retaliatory violence.
At a staff supervision meeting over a week prior to the incident, the worker had expressed issues regarding how she felt about service users and she was reminded to walk away from situations where she felt frustrated
In response, the care support worker – who commenced working at the home in June 2013 – told the hearing that in relation to the incident she had reacted to “a risky situation”.
The woman asserted that this service user should have been assigned a male employee.
She argued that rather than being dismissed she should have been assigned to other clients. The woman’s employer made findings and conclusions in relation to eight areas of concern over the 8 August incident and sacked her for gross misconduct on 2 May 2018.
The employer stated that the sanction of dismissal was proportionate to the alleged conduct.
Solicitor for the care support worker, Richard Grogan confirmed on Monday that the WRC ruling is being appealed to the Labour Court adding that it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment on any other aspect of the case at this stage pending the outcome at the Labour Court.","10.51pm, 11 Mar 2019",

Ryan Bailey reports from Donnybrook
ONE WONDERS HOW many of these ‘learning experiences’ must it take for Ireland to find a solution to the obvious defects which continue to hinder any tangible progress under Adam Griggs.
There was so much to like about this Saturday night under the lights at Donnybrook. A record crowd for an Ireland women’s international crammed inside to create a boisterous atmosphere from start to finish, with many of the 6,047 having travelled from clubs right around the country.
Boujard was outstanding for France.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
On the field, Ireland were strong in the areas we know they’re strong in. The set-piece, led by the ever-willing duo of Ciara Griffin and Claire Molloy, caused the French problems early on and was the source of two first-half tries.
It meant the hosts were game for 30 minutes of this contest, but — much like against England here on the opening weekend — there was an inevitability about the outcome as the evening progressed. Once France hit their straps, Annick Hayraud’s team ruthlessly exposed the gulf in class.
There can never be any questioning the heart, bravery and willingness of this Ireland side, yet those characteristics will only get you so far at international level when the fundamentals — tackling, an effective exit strategy and an ability to retain possession — consistently let you down.
There is only so much talking about development, blooding young players and building for the future you can do before something has to give. Griggs admitted as much during the week, conceding his side have reached a point when they now need to start winning matches.
“We want results and at the moment we are not getting those,” he said pre-match. “We need to fix that.”
Subduing the formidable French threat was always going to be a nigh-on impossible task, and certainly the defending Six Nations champions will leave Dublin knowing they had to work for their victory, but it’s now seven defeats in eight games for Ireland. They never really came close to winning this one either.
The concession of seven tries again shows where Ireland need to improve. It has been the story of the championship, both this year and many more before it. The target of a top-three finish is looking increasingly fanciful.
France winger Caroline Boujard, named player of the match, ran riot here, scoring one try and setting up a couple more, while World Player of the Year Jessy Trémoulière looked every inch of that in a classy return from injury.

Even when the visitors were reduced to 14 for the final quarter after Marine Ménager was harshly shown red, they still had the power and authority to dominate, tacking on another two scores.
Griffin and Molloy led from the front for Ireland, both crossing in the first half, but after throwing everything at the visitors during a frantic opening salvo, Griggs’ side were simply unable to contend with the physicality, athleticism and power of the French.
Ali Miller was lively on the wing for Ireland.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
It took France, ranked third in the world, all of three minutes to find the breakthrough score, and display a clinical edge which would ultimately prove the difference.
Give this French back three loose ball to feed off and they will punish you, a lesson Ireland failed to heed from all of their video analysis work during the week. Boujard chipped and chased and the home side were torn apart.
Defence turned to desperation for Nichola Fryday, as the second row cynically tackled Yanna Rivoalen off the ball just as the visitors appeared set to strike after a sweeping move down this right side.
Fryday was sent to the bin by referee Ian Tempest — receiving the fastest yellow card in Women’s Six Nations history — and the French maul was set in motion, Ireland offering little in the way of resistance and all hooker Caroline Thomas had to do was simply fall over the whitewash.
Ireland, to their credit, summoned an instant response but their vulnerability in defence always meant they were chasing the game. Ali Miller was unlucky not to get over in the corner after a storming surge, and the hosts again showed their set-piece power when Griffin finished off the back of a close-range scrum.
At one end, a direct approach built on the relentlessness of a well-oiled set-piece, and at the other, a lethal, free-flowing backline capable of cutting loose from anywhere. Two vastly contrasting styles, both equally effective, but there was only going to be one winner.
Ireland will be disappointed with the four first-half scores they coughed up, as again they failed to lay a hand on Boujard, who didn’t need a second invitation to run with ball in hand and cause utter destruction through the heart of the green defence.
Collecting a poor clearing box-kick, the French winger showed pace and agility to slalom through some feeble tackle attempts and even when she was hunted down by Eimear Considine just short of the line, Boujard had the smarts and skills to offload for the supporting Ian Jason to finish the job. Trémoulière’s touchline conversion was exquisite.
Fryday was back from the bin and, not to be deterred, Ireland rebounded strongly. No prizes for guessing the source of the score, but it was another well-worked try, as this time the tireless Molloy barged over after excellent retention and control from the forwards.
Ireland celebrate Molloy's first-half try.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
France knew they were in a scrap, and turned to their own set-piece in a bid to reassert some authority. Once they did so, focusing on executing the basics of their game, it was all one-way traffic.
Loosehead prop Lise Arricastre put the head down and got the legs pumping after a period of sustained pressure on the Ireland line, before the visitors created further daylight on the scoreboard through the outstanding Boujard just before the break.
Again, it was too soft from an Irish perspective as mistakes crept into their performance. Deirbhile Nic a Bhaird lost the ball in contact and, recognising that the green shirts were out of position, scrum-half Rivoalen chipped in behind for Boujard to streak clear.

France remorsefully poured forward in the same vein after the break, showing absolutely no design on taking their foot off the pedal. Ireland scrambled, but when you clear straight back down the throat of Trémoulière, with a non-existent chase, you’re asking for trouble. And it arrived, Ménager crashing over for a fifth.
There was a real danger France would run riot in the closing quarter but having remained valiant in their defensive duties, Ireland were given a second wind when Ménager was sent off for leading with the forearm into Griffin’s neck.
They immediately took advantage as some well-worked phase play up front resulted in the space being created out wide for Sene Naoupu to finish, and the hosts had their third try. Too little, too late.
France weren’t finished, either. Audrey Forlani and Marine Ménager caused further damage in the closing exchanges, ending any hope of a late rally from Ireland, who go to Wales on the final weekend.
No faulting the desire and effort, but this is a results business. Victory next weekend looks imperative to salvage something from this championship.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bloody-sunday-explainer-4526297-Mar2019/,"This piece was first published on Saturday 9 March
LATER THIS MORNING, a number of former British soldiers could find out if they are to be put on trial for murder in relation to the Bloody Sunday killings.
Almost 50 years on from the deaths of unarmed civilians at the hands of British soldiers, the PSNI could be set to charge ex-army personnel for their role in the killings.
It comes many years after investigations into Bloody Sunday first got under way, and generated reaction on both sides of the Irish Sea.
But how have we got this far? And what happens next?
Bloody Sunday
On 30 January 1972, British soldiers fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians who were taking part in a civil rights march in the bogside in Derry.
In all, 28 people were shot. 13 died while another person succumbed to injuries sustained a number of months later.
The shootings intensified the armed conflict during the Troubles, leading to a surge in anti-British sentiment in Ireland and boosting recruitment for the IRA.
An inquiry commissioned into Bloody Sunday by the British government of the day – dubbed the Widgery Tribunal – pinned the blame on the march organisers, and his main criticism of the army was limited to describing their firing as being “bordered on the reckless”.
Widgery’s report was widely denounced and dissatisfaction with these findings persisted throughout the peace process in the 1990s.
This led to British Prime Minister Tony Blair ordering a new inquiry in 1998.
This inquiry lasted a full 12 years before the Saville Report was published in 2010.
As well as savaging the result from the Widgery Tribunal, it was sharply critical of the soldiers who opened fire.
The report said: “The firing by soldiers of 1 PARA on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.”
It also noted that these actions were “unjustifiable”, and that the soldiers had “lost control”.
Following the report, then-Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons he was “deeply sorry” and apologised for Bloody Sunday on behalf of the British government.
“It is clear from the tribunal’s authoritative conclusions that the events of Bloody Sunday were in no way justified,” he said.
PSNI probe
In the wake of the Saville Report, a murder investigation was launched by the PSNI into the deaths of the civilians who were shot on Bloody Sunday.
In this case, like many others that occurred during the Troubles, no one has ever been prosecuted in relation to the deaths of these civilians.
In fact, roughly one-third of killings during this period are the subject of PSNI legacy investigations. This applies to cases where republican groups, loyalist groups and security services were believed to be responsible for the killings, but no one was ever convicted.
According to figures obtained by the BBC last year, the PSNI had 1,188 killings listed as legacy investigations. This included 530 attributed to republicans, 271 to loyalists and 354 attributed to security forces.
However, progress in this investigation was slow.

In 2014, families of those killed on Bloody Sunday challenged a decision to delay the PSNI inquiry,claiming it now appeared the statutory dutyon the PSNI to investigate crimes “does not extend to murdered committed by the British army”. The proberecommenced in 2015.
After a 66-year-old former soldier was arrested by police in November 2015, a number of former members of the parachute regiment launched legal proceedings challenging the lawfulness of their potential arrest in Northern Ireland.
Then, in 2017, the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service was reported to be considering whether to prosecute 18 British soldiers for their role in Bloody Sunday.
And, in the past two weeks, media reports have indicated thatfour ex-British soldierscould be charged with the 1972 shooting of unarmed marchers in Derry on Bloody Sunday.
There were so many people killed during this time, and the PSNI is not investigating all of the 1,000+ cases at once.
To decide how cases are managed and progressed, it usesa case sequencing modelwhich takes a number of factors into consideration.
For a case to be prioritised and progressed, the PSNI analyses four aspects of the case – contemporary persons of interest, forensic potential, criminal justice status and the progression of the case so far.
In most cases, the PSNI said it will prioritise more recent cases as those who committed crimes “may be more likely to present a contemporary risk to public safety than those committed in the 1970s and 1980s”.
Exceptions can be made, however, when the head of legacy investigations “has accepted the rationale for a variation on humanitarian grounds”.
Last August, PSNI detective superintendent Ian Harrison said that the police had a “legal obligation” to investigate Bloody Sunday, after former head of the British Army Lord Bramall said it was “absurd and grossly unfair” to the soldiers involved.
What’s happening now?
The issue around ex-soldiers being prosecuted for killings during the Troubles was put under fierce scrutiny this month, as British politicians expressed their anger at the idea of soldiers being prosecuted.
Firstly, Conservative MP Boris Johnson suggested that soldiers could be charged with murder for political reasons.
Writingin the Daily Telegraph, Johnson claimed that there would be “a storm of utter fury” if the four men were charged later this month while the government let former members of the IRA “get away with” their actions throughout the Troubles.
“They did not get up in the morning with the intention of killing and maiming innocent civilians,” he said.
Although Johnson added that nobody should be exempt from justice, he claimed it was now impossible to know the truth about what happened on Bloody Sunday, suggesting that the marchers’ deaths could have been the result of “confusion and panic”.
“The reason this whole thing stinks to high heaven – and the reason it should be denounced – is that there is absolutely nothing new for any trial to discover,” he said
In a later tweet, the former mayor of London said that justice would be trumped by politics if a trial went ahead.
His comments were roundly criticised by political parties in the North, with Alliance MLA Stephen Farry saying that the “rule of law” must be respected.
And then, on Wednesday, the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told the House of Commons “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
As this FactCheck shows, this claim is false.
Bradley has faced calls to resign since making these remarks, and she later apologised and said she was “profoundly sorry” for the offence caused and that she did not believe what she said.
In the Telegraph’s report earlier this month, it cited sources which said that the four paratroopers in question are set to be told next Thursday 14 March whether they will now face murder charges.
If there are charges brought against any individuals, it is also likely to be some time before a trial is held.
In apologising for her comments, Karen Bradley vowed that the British government would help to “deliver justice for those families” of the victims of unlawful killings during the Troubles.
Nearly 50 years on from Bloody Sunday, whether that justice that families seek will be delivered still remains to be seen.

https://www.the42.ie/donie-sheahan-dr-crokes-all-ireland-club-4544787-Mar2019/,"BEFORE LOOKING FORWARD to tomorrow, he can look back to when it all began.
Donie Sheahan maps out his itinerary for the weekend. He will board a train today from Killarney, land in Dublin where he’ll be collected by his daughter and base himself in the capital.
For a starter he’ll be watching the footage from Tralee later as Kerry and Mayo square off before the main course of his sporting weekend tomorrow afternoon. Dr Crokes make their latest assault on a national title against Galway’s Corofin.

The patron of the Kerry club will lend his support, a figure who provides a neat symmetry between the 2019 All-Ireland club instalment and the original version back in 1971 when he coached East Kerry, the maiden victors and the only divisional team to have achieved that honour.
In the interim he acclaimed the Dr Crokes breakthrough in 1992, savoured their return to that summit two years ago and is profoundly grateful to be witnessing their bid for a third All-Ireland crown.
“I’ll be 93 in April, the same day as the Queen of England. She’ll be 93 as well. The 21st of April 1926, I was born.
“The one thing I’ll say is I didn’t drink or smoke all my life, I’d say twas a help. I kept working all my life. I’d an interest in everything.
“And I’m very lucky, I’ve people and my family organising for me. To be going up to an All-Ireland final now with my club, it’s a big thing. I thought ’92 was the end of it and now here I am.”
Before there were recognisable club heavyweights, TG4 cameras documenting every step through the winter and the doors of Croke Park being opened up on St Patrick’s Day, the grassroots game lived in a different world.
The clamour for club All-Irelands to be introduced grew louder in the 1960s. Provinces took matters into their own hands in organising meetings between county champions and by the 1970 GAA Congress, there were two motions on the agenda from Galway and Wexford looking for an official national competition. The vote swung 92-74 in favour of All-Ireland recognition for clubs.
If the thorny issue of GAA fixtures continues to generate a feverish debate, consider the schedule in 1971. In the spring East Kerry won a Munster final against Cork’s Muskerry before they were placed in cold storage until 5 September.
In a year where Offaly lifted Sam Maguire, Gracefield flew the Faithful flag in that All-Ireland semi-final but East Kerry prevailed by five points and then struck five goals against Down’s Bryansford in the final. Croke Park was the setting on Sunday 21 November but the win was greeted with little fanfare as outlined by Murt Galvin, the Kerry county treasurer at the time in Jack Mahon’s book ‘For Love Of Town And Village’.
“When we arrived back that night in Killarney at about 11.30pm, there were two people at the railway station, the father of one of the players and the player’s brother. Coming home that night we might as well have been out playing a club game in Duhallow or Rathmore.”
Listowel native Donie Sheahan marvels at the explosion in stature since.
“I never thought it would come to be such a good competition. I thought there was only once or twice they’d have it but they deserve great credit for it.
“There’s lads there winning All-Irelands in Croke Park and who could you win it better than with your own fellas? There’s great pride in it.”

He can cherish that East Kerry victory, the products of five clubs blended together to make a formidable outfit. They stitched together a local three-in-a-row between 1968 and 1970, conquerors of a south Kerry team who had a famed figure in their ranks.
“You see, we beat Waterville in three county finals.
“And I’d always say to (Mick O’) Dwyer, ‘Three-in-a-row Mike’.
“Ah shag you he’d say, ye had the pick of the county.
“True but I had to put them together. They were there three years in a row in the final, the last time we beat them was close now alright. Dwyer always maintains he should have got a penalty. But I thought it was no penalty anyway.”
They only got one shot at All-Ireland glory and seized it. Divisional sides were soon exempt from competing as it became the preserve of the clubs.
“We’d have won more I think. We’d a great team. We were giving four or five to Kerry at the time, we’d great players like Mick Gleeson, Dan Kavanagh, Pat Moynihan. If the players weren’t Kerry seniors, they were Kerry juniors.
“I had the two best fellas ever behind me. There was Brendy Walsh, chairman of the board, he was from Glenflesk and he was a great organiser.

“And Denis Fenton was out from Spa there, he was the best secretary I ever met. Now that’s his nephew Brian that’s playing for Dublin at the moment. He’s a very good footballer, very good.
“Brendy I suppose must have asked me to train the team. I knew Dr Eamonn (O’Sullivan) well, he was the trainer of Kerry, I learned from him.
“He used give me a formula to make up an old bottle for the team, as a rub for my own fellas. There was no physios then. I mostly fixed them up myself. It was different times. We plodded away anyway.”
His affection for that winning class of 1971 is clear. One player would go on to provide the voice that chronicled the feats of Kerry teams for years, Weeshie Fogarty finding a natural home in the radio gantry. He passed away last November, a week before Dr Crokes lifted a Munster title.
“Weeshie would talk the leg off a pot of course! Ah but he was a fine fella. I was Crokes and he was Legion but we were the best of friends.
“They were all great friends of mine. A lot of them are dead, I mean it’s sad for the likes of me. I do miss them, chatting about football and that.”
If he had been a foe of Mick O’Dwyer’s on the club scene in Kerry, their careers would soon intersect to see them work side by side.
“In ’75 I was one of the fellas elected (as Kerry selector) and Dwyer was elected. Dwyer had a meeting and said he’d train the team and we all agreed. That’s how he started. It was a lot of running. I always think of Dwyer in ’75 and he said there was only one way we’d beat Dublin and that was if we were fitter than them.
“I worked with him for about three years. You’d thrash out before the match whatever it was. In ’75 I met him the morning of the final in the hotel. I was saying if a fella gets hurt, who’ll we bring in. He said Ger O’Driscoll from Valentia and I agreed with that. Anyway when Mickey Ned (O’Sullivan) got knocked out, Dwyer called in Ger and he got a goal and a point.
“Dwyer was cool and tough. He never got ruffled. They were great rivals that time, Kerry and Dublin. There’s a son now of Tony Hanahoe’s, he’s working with my son above in Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin. It’s amazing that you come across fellas after.”

They supervised the Kerry U21 side in 1975 as well, a collection of players that would go on to be such dominant forces in the sport. Scan an eye over that star-studded teamsheet and the surnames leap off the page – Nelligan, Ó Sé, Kennelly, Spillane, Walsh, Sheehy, Moran, Doyle and O’Shea.
Sheahan spent three years in Kerry senior dressing-rooms. They discovered gems in different ways around the county.
“I’ll tell you how we found the Bomber. The chairman of the Beale club was a fella called John Francis Aherne. I knew him well.
“That time to be elected for a selector, you had to go around and meet the clubs and get voted by the clubs. So I was out canvassing one winter and I met John Francis. I said, ‘Have ye any fella?’
“Then he said, ‘We’ve a fella, they call him the Bomber.’ I said to send him in. Now he was a big, strong, awkward man. But by God, he went down to Waterville for 12 months and Dwyer definitely made a footballer out of him down there.
“We’d have debated in ’77 whether we’d play him or not. We didn’t play him but we did in ’78 and that was the start of him, he got three goals (in the final against Dublin). He was a big active fella and had a great football brain.”

Another player from that part of North Kerry been in his thoughts from earlier.
“Ogie (Moran) was in Rinn in the Irish college with my lads when he was younger. One of them came back, I don’t know was it Liam or Kieran, and told me there’s a fella called Ogie Moran and he’s a great footballer. And when I became a selector, I had him in the back of my mind the whole time.”
Those were chapters in Sheahan’s GAA tale but the overarching theme revolves around Dr Crokes. He settled in Kerry after a circuitous route around the country. Work as a chemist kept him on the move, wherever he landed the GAA provided a natural outlet.
“I worked in Thurles for nearly a year. I was football naturally. I tried to get an old junior team going there in Thurles Sarsfields. The one thing they were interested in was hurling.
“And from there I went up to Dunleer in Louth. I played with St Mary’s of Ardee, they’d some great players for Louth like Paddy Markey. One day the Mary’s represented Louth in the O’Byrne Cup, they were that good. They were mad for football, like myself.”
He opened the doors of Sheahan’s Pharmacy in Killarney in 1953. It’s still going on 34 Main Street under the running of his son Liam. They expanded in Kenmare with another son Paul opening a pharmacy there in 1994.
“I got a job in Killarney first, I was dispensing the medicine in two hospitals and the county home as well. I knew a lot of the patients, they were fine fellas. The nurses were great, looking after them.”
He had been roped in to play for Dr Crokes for a summer in 1946, fell back in with the club when he returned in the 50s and has never left.
“I was around 20 years chairman. My wife used to say to me every year, ‘Did you give up?’. But sure at the AGM, every fella would be saying that I was doing a great job and no fella wanted the bloody job. One year finishing up, I talked Tom Long into taking it over. I stayed on as the delegate of the county board for nearly 50 years.”
His mind is crammed with rich football tales that tumble out. That seismic win for Dr Crokes in 1992 against Dublin’s Thomas Davis.

“An official went to stop me from going down and they were getting the cup in the Hogan Stand. I shoved him out of my bloody way. I was excited. You do things that you wouldn’t do normally. Ah to see the Crokes win in Croke Park was great.”
The corner-forward that day is now in the control room, expertly pulling the levers to ensure the Dr Crokes trophy cabinet has been heaving in recent years.

“I see Pat (O’Shea) there could get 30 fellas out a few days after Christmas to go out training. There’s no one else who’d get that. He’s a great trainer and he has great command. He’s respected by the players, they think highly of him.
“He’s no nonsense. I remember one day we were above after beating The Rock (Austin Stacks) in the final of the county league. I went in to congratulate the lads because I knew a lot of them and Pat was inside and he making a show about all the mistakes they’d made. He has high standards.”
After 1992, Dr Crokes only managed one county senior triumph in the next 18 seasons. But the autumn of 2010 kick-started an era that has left Sheahan marvelling. Since his 84th birthday he has witnessed a title collection comprising of seven in Kerry and five in Munster along with national treks to see games against Armagh, Dublin, Mayo, Galway, Derry and Longford opponents.
The 2017 All-Ireland was special for Sheahan in seeing the Dr Crokes goalscorer that day experience his moment of club joy after a long wait.
Colm Cooper celebrates with Pat O'Shea after the 2017 final.
“I was delighted for the Gooch, I put my arms around him above in Croke Park that day. He’s one of the best I’ve ever seen. He’s a great football brain, he’s in the right spot at the right time. He can do amazing things.
“If he was below there in the bank years ago and a fella came into me wanting to meet the Gooch. I could walk down to the bank and he would be upstairs and he’d come down to me and shake hands with whoever. A great man that way.”
As we talk in a small room at the back of the pharmacy, he is regularly switching his gaze to monitor the Saturday afternoon running at Gowran Park and Sandown Park. This week was never just about the GAA clubs finals, Cheltenham always set to command his interest as he hoped Willie Mullins could end his pursuit of the Gold Cup.
Horse racing has always been a passion. He sent For William to the Kerry Grand National in Listowel and finished second twice. For Bill gave him many afternoons in the limelight, a victor under Davy Russell at the Fairyhouse Easter Festival in 2010.

“I used to go to Cheltenham when it was only a two day meeting. There’s a big meeting there in November and I had one (Dromhale Lady in 1998) there alright and I was beaten in a photo finish by a horse called Lady Rebecca, I’ll always think of it, and she went and won nine races after.
“(Michael) Hourigan used to train for me at the time and I’d a runner in a big National Hunt trial stake above at Punchestown one time and we won. Robert Hall was interviewing the two of us after the race and he said, ‘I suppose there’ll be big celebrations Michael after this?’
“Says Hourigan, ‘Well I’ll tell you, Donie has the free travel and he came up on the train, and Done’s going home on the train and I drove up and I’m going home in my car. So that’ll be the celebrations. And he was right, that was it!”
“I was very lucky, I’d a lot of very good horses. I enjoy Cheltenham a lot.”
Home is on the Lewis Road just across from Fitzgerald Stadium.
“They all say to me if I could I’d have built inside in the stadium! It was pure fluke, I got a site there. I’m at the front of the Crokes as well, I walk around the corner and I’m into the pitch.
“Liam my son was secretary of the stadium and I was treasurer for a bit and I was stuck a lot in the stadium.”
Anytime there is a match in the Killarney venue he ventures over, slipping into the press box to watch on. He has five children, 13 grand-children and three great grand-children. His family and football have always consumed him and kept him active.
“It’s been a great interest all my life and I’ve met a pile of friends and a pile of people. My wife (Carmel) often said there’s nothing in the house but football and horses. And I always said to her I can’t dispute that!
“Football was always like a drug for me I suppose. I never thought I’d live to see the day the Crokes club on their own would win an All-Ireland club. Well I did in 1992 and again two years ago. I’m hoping I can see it a third time.”
48 years on from his first trip, he’s back on the All-Ireland club final trail.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-drivers-licence-ireland-4552108-Mar2019/,"THE ROAD SAFETY Authority (RSA) has told those living in Ireland who have a UK drivers licence to swap it for an Irish licence sooner rather than later.
As the Brexit deadline approaches, so does the prospect of a no-deal.
The authority said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit the driving licence of a UK licence holder living in Ireland will no longer be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue driving on that licence.
Fianna Fáil transport spokesman Robert Troy said RSA confirmed to him a demand of up to 500 applications per day was being seen in relation to the number of people applying to switch their UK licence to an Irish one.
“In the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement in place, the driving license of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive in Ireland on that licence,” chief executive Moyagh Murdock states in a letter to Troy.
The RSA confirmed toTheJournal.iethat the numbers are up, but they are making a lot of process and working its way through the applications.
A spokesperson for the RSA sid that in 2018, 6,500 people swapped for an Irish licence. So far this year, 11,000 licences were physically produced.

As of yesterday, the RSA said it is working on producing 4,000 licences at the moment. About 500 applications are being received each day. They added that about 600 applications were processed yesterday alone.
The spokesperson said that those with a UK licence need to swap it over as soon as possible, as it will be invalid in a no-deal scenario. If there is a deal, there is nothing to worry about, they added.
“It is better to be safe than sorry. Get your application in now and we’ll swap it over,” they said.
The RSA said that anyone living in Ireland for longer than a year are meant to surrender their UK licence and get an Irish licence, however they said that many people have not done this.
In order to tackle the high number of applications, the Licence Exchange section of the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) has had its operation increased six-fold since 11 March.
Murdoch said that 20 RSA staff have been assigned to licence exchange, as well as 11 Abtran staff to assist in the processing of UK licensing applications.
As of 12 March, waiting times for the swapping of licences were down to 7.5 days.
The RSA toldTheJournal.iethat they are “ploughing through” the applications, with licence exchanges being prioritised.
The spokesperson concluded by appealing to those with UK licences to “be prudent” and get their applications in.

PARENTS OF CHILDREN with a rare genetic condition have called for negotiations between the HSE and a pharmaceutical company over access to a drug to be sped up.
Last month, the HSE confirmed that itwould not reimburse Spinraza(also known as Nusinersen) at its current price.
The organisation said the medication would cost more than €20 million over a five-year period – €600,000 per patient for the first year and €380,000 per patient per year thereafter.
Biogen, the company which makes Spinraza, said these figures are out of date but, when asked byTheJournal.ieto elaborate, said it “cannot comment on pricing”.
Twenty-six children in Ireland who have Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare and life-limiting muscle-wasting condition, could benefit from Spinraza.
Fiona Bailey, whose son Sam has SMA, said it is “heartbreaking” and “frustrating” for parents to watch protracted negotiations while their children become weaker.
Twenty-five of the 28 countries in the European Union have granted access to the medication, except Ireland, the UK (bar Scotland) and Estonia.
SMA Ireland has called on the HSE to reverse its decision; andheld a protestoutside Leinster House on 28 February.
Negotiations, and clashes, over pricing are ongoing behind the scenes. Biogen has hit out at the process used by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) to assess the cost-effectiveness of medication.
In turn, the NCPE’s Director, Professor Michael Barry, sharply criticised the “exorbitant” prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for certain medication, such as Spinraza.

In December 2017, the NCPE did not recommend the reimbursement of Spinraza as it was not deemed “cost-effective”. Its estimated the cost at that time was €37.88 million over five years.
As well as the cost, the HSE also cited the “limitations of the current evidence on clinical effectiveness” of Spinraza when announcing its decision not to reimburse the drug last month.
‘Urgent reform needed’
Biogen has criticised the process used by the NCPE in assessing medication. A spokesperson said: “In SMA there are challenges associated with producing the type of data that the NCPE need to see when reviewing Nusinersen in a general health technology assessment process to determine cost-effectiveness.
“For example, measuring quality of life in a young paediatric population is very difficult, and yet it is a major determining factor of cost-effectiveness in the NCPE process.”
The spokesperson said other challenges “include the uncertainty around long-term health outcomes that inevitably come with a significant therapeutic advancement”.
“In more specialised reimbursement methodologies, such as what is now available in Scotland, these kinds of factors are considered.”
Biogen has repeatedly called on the HSE to “urgently reform the appraisal process for orphan medicines like Nusinersen – to allow a greater degree of flexibility for the assessment of such treatment options”.
‘An easy target’
When asked about Biogen’s comments, Professor Barry defended the process used by the NCPE, saying the company’s statement is “typical of what we have come to expect from the pharmaceutical industry here in Ireland”.
He toldTheJournal.iethe assessment process is “an easy target for the industry” and “an excuse for not dealing with the fundamental problem of exorbitant pricing of medicines that frequently add little in terms of health outcomes”.
“The failure to reimburse these extremely high-cost drugs is not due to the assessment process, it is due to a funding issue. One of the main purposes of the assessment process is to support the HSE in its discussions and negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies.
Barry said we often hear the industry talk about pricing but “rarely about value”.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK met again last week to discuss reimbursing Spinraza. A decision is expected next month.

Barry added that highlighting what is going on in other countries is “also of limited value”.
“I have not heard anyone discuss the Orkambi situation in England, where reimbursement is still not approved almost two years after the drug was reimbursed in Ireland.
Barry said the problem is “a direct result of pharma pricing strategies”, adding: “The answer is in their own hands.”

Last month Barry told the Sunday Business Post the HSE had already “almost exhausted” the available funding for new drugs for the whole of 2019.
‘The weakest children in Ireland’
Aboutone in 11,000 babiesare affected by SMA – a debilitating disease that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of movement due to muscle wasting.
SMA is the number one genetic cause of death of infants and is in the same family as motor neurone disease.
The most common form of the disease is 5q SMA, which has four different types:1, 2, 3 and 4– based on age of onset and the highest physical milestone achieved. Type 1 is the most severe form of SMA and accounts for between 50–70% of cases of childhood onset SMA. About 95% of children with Type 1 who are untreated die before the age of two.

Children who have been granted access to Spinraza,  have generally responded well, with some gaining strength and motors skills and reaching milestones previously thought impossible. The medication is delivered through the lower back via a lumbar puncture.
Sam Bailey is one of the 26 children who could benefit from the drug; he has SMA Type 2. His mother Fiona is among the parents who have been campaigning for access to Spinraza. She gavean impassioned speechat the recent rally outside Leinster House.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Fiona said waiting for a decision while negotiations go on behind the scenes is “heartbreaking”.
“Twenty-five other countries [in the EU] granted access to Spinraza, some as long as a year ago.
“The details are up to Biogen and the NCPE to hammer out. Our lives are full with trying to contain this disease and keep out children pain-free.”

Fiona said she’d “move over [to Scotland] in the morning if Sam could get the drug” but that it isn’t available to people from other countries.
Parents in Ireland are keeping a close eye on Spinraza negotiations in the UK. Two babies and a teenager have died since the start of the campaign there. “Is that what’s going to happen in Ireland? It’s just terrifying for parents,” Fiona said.
She said families “will be back outside the gates of the Dáil” if they need to be but she hopes the situation will be resolved soon.
“It’s terrible to have to put our children through that – children in wheelchairs outside Leinster House, literally begging for their lives.”
‘It’s a miracle he’s still alive’
Sam celebrated his ninth birthday last Wednesday. Fiona said her son is “the same as any other kid” and “was delighted with himself” on the day. However, he is aware of what is going on.
“He was borderline Type 1 at diagnosis, those children don’t normally see their second birthday.
“One chest infection could put Sam in hospital, could put him in ICU. If he gets sick, his life hangs in the balance – he’s one of the most severe sufferers of Type 2 in the country.”

Fiona said she is obviously aware that Spinraza is an expensive drug but pointed out that so is a spell in ICU or full-time care, which would need to be provided if “God forbid, anything happened me or Paul (Sam’s father)”.
She said getting access to Spinraza would not only be life-changing for Sam but for the whole family. “Sarah and Kayla (his sisters, who are about to turn three and seven) are watching him get weaker, they’re seeking reassurances too,” she said.
“He is losing strength every single month, every single week.”
‘Very vulnerable group’
When asked about the ongoing negotiations, a spokesperson for the HSE said “it would be inappropriate to comment” beyond its recent statement until the process is complete.
In its statement last month the HSE said it “regrets” that it has to date been unable to come to an agreement with Biogen.

The HSE said when assessing Spinraza, the organisation’s Drugs Group focused on two areas: reviewing the evidence of the clinical effectiveness of drug (the benefits for patients undergoing clinical trials) and the cost-effectiveness of the drug.
“While the HSE is anxious to provide all possible support to this very vulnerable group of patients and those who care for them, the decision reached by the Leadership Team concurs with the recommendation of the Drugs Group, which is that reimbursement could not be approved at the price currently being charged by the pharmaceutical company,” the statement said.
Under the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, Biogen has 28 days from the date of notification to respond or make representations to the HSE’s proposed decision.

TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN paid to Laura Brennan, one of Ireland’s leading HPV vaccine campaigners, who died earlier today.
Brennan was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 24. Since then, she became involved in the campaign to raise awareness of the HPV vaccine to try to save lives.
The HSE confirmed that she died at University Hospital Limerick today.
Although Laura Brennan went through treatment for her condition, and was predicted to have a good chance of recovering, the cancer spread to her lymph nodes. This meant that there was no treatment for her condition, other than palliative chemotherapy that would prolong Laura’s life.
The Brennan family said:
The family said she “wanted to make a difference, and use the time that she had to right what she felt was a great wrong”.
Interim HSE director general Anne O’Connor has expressed her sincere condolences to the family and friends of Brennan.
“We are all deeply saddened to learn of Laura’s death, and we feel immense gratitude and admiration for her and her family.  Laura has defined courage and generosity as she supported our work to ensure girls get the HPV vaccine, and are protected from this terrible cancer,” O’Connor said.
“We know that Laura has made a difference, and will have saved lives through her great effort and her tremendous generosity of spirit,” she said.
Campaigner Vicky Phelan paid tribute to Brennan on social media today.
“I have no words, just tears and emptiness at the loss of another young woman who used what was left of her time to campaign so that others would not suffer her fate. Please, please vaccinate your children,” Phelan wrote.

Minister for Health Simon Harris said he is “deeply saddened” to hear of Brennan’s passing, adding that “the State owes her a debt of gratitude”.
“Laura was an incredible young woman and a powerful campaigner,” Harris said.

“As a person, she was kind, funny and full of life. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Every time I met Laura or spoke with her, I was inspired by her. Amazing doesn’t do justice to her or her courage. I want to extend my deepest condolences to her family and friends,” he said.
President Michael D Higgins echoed the words of Harris in his tribute to Brennan.
“I am sure that I was among very many who were greatly saddened on hearing that Laura Brennan has died. Laura impressed so very many with her campaigning and her work as a patient advocate has had a real and positive effect on countless young women across the country,” Higgins said.
Many other campaigners, organisations, politicians and members of the public took to social media today to pay tribute to Brennan.

Clare County Council has confirmed that it will open a book of condolence in memory of Laura Brennan tomorrow at 10am in the public foyer of Áras Contae an Chláir.
Brennan spoke at and was honoured at many events over the past year, receiving the inaugural Patient Advocate Medal from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, and most recently being named Clare Person of the Year.
She was conferred with an honorary doctorate by UCD in acknowledgment of her advocacy work.
She spoke at the time about how she wanted to use her voice for the good of others:
“This vaccine saves lives. It could have saved mine but it can save yours.”
The human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to a number of cancers, including cervical, penile, throat and anal cancers in men and women.
Every year in Ireland, 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer – of that number 90 women will die of the disease.

https://www.thejournal.ie/kildare-farmer-thomas-reid-lodges-fresh-objection-in-ongoing-battle-with-intel-4527582-Mar2019/,"THE COUNTY KILDARE farmer who took on the IDA – and won – is now seeking to prevent the go-ahead for a planned new $4 billion (€3.5bn) facility at Intel’s Leixlip plant.
This follows farmer Thomas Reid lodging an objection with Kildare County Council against the new application by the US micro-chip giant for an extended and revised manufacturing fabrication facility, known as a “Fab”.
Reid has long been a thorn in the side of the US multinational in the planning arena and this is the seventh Intel Leixlip application the farmer has objected to since 2012 with six previous Intel applications brought before An Bord Pleanála by Mr Reid.
In 2016, Intel secured planning permission for the first phase of the ‘fab’ facility valued at $4 billion and the new application, which is an extension of the original plan, represents an additional investment of $4 billion.
In total, the $8 billion (€7bn) investment – which will employ 6,000 construction workers at peak and 1,600 full time jobs on completion – will represent the largest single private investment in the history of the State on one project if given the go-ahead by Intel globally.
Consultants for Intel have told Kildare County Council that the firm has already invested $12.5 billion (€11bn) on its site at Leixlip and the firm is seeking a 10 year planning permission for its new application.
However, Reid of Hedsor House, Blakestown, Carton, Maynooth, is seeking to frustrate the multi-national’s plans after lodging a two page hand-written objection against the new application.
The objection will now entitle Reid to appeal any decision to grant permission by Kildare County Council to An Bord Pleanála.
Advertisement
‘Centre of excellence’
In his objection, Reid claims that the planning application is contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.
In the objection, Reid – subject of a award-winning documentary last year over his successful Supreme Court battle with the IDA – stated that he is calling on Kildare County Council to refuse the application outright.
Former Labour TD, Emmet Stagg has lodged a submission, but in favour of the Intel application stating that the proposed development will reinforce the Leixlip site as a centre of world class excellence in the knowledge based economy.
Reid unsuccessfully opposed the $4 billion first phase of the ‘fab’ plan in 2017 when lodging an objection against the application and then appealing the Council decision to An Bord Pleanála.
In 2015, Reid emerged victorious in his battle with the IDA where a unanimous Supreme Court found that the IDA making of a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) for Reid’s 72-acre farm adjacent to the Intel campus had been in excess of the IDA’s powers.
The five-judge court overturned an earlier High Court decision, which would have cleared the way for IDA to purchase the site, for development, against Reid’s wishes.
The costs associated with the case left the IDA with a bill of €1.375 million.
Kildare County Council is due to make a decision on the Intel application before the end of this month.","7.42pm, 6 Mar 2019",

MANCHESTER UNITED WILL face Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals while Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur clash in an all-Premier League tie following today’s draw.
Liverpool were drawn to play FC Porto in the knockout rounds for the second year in succession, as Ajax’s reward for eliminating the holders Real Madrid is a two-legged tie against Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus.
English hopes are high that this could be their year in Europe’s elite club competition after all four of their representatives made it through to the last eight.
However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United will have their work cut out if they are to go any further as they take on the Barcelona of Lionel Messi in the headline tie.
For Solskjaer, the second leg will bring back memories of the 1999 final, when the Norwegian came off the bench to score a stoppage-time winner for United against Bayern Munich at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium.
With City and United not allowed to play their home leg in the same week, United will entertain the leaders of La Liga at Old Trafford on 9 or 10 April, with the return a week later.
The last time the Premier League had four teams in the quarter-finals, in 2008/09, Barcelona beat the Old Trafford side 2-0 in the final in Rome. The clubs clashed again in the final at Wembley in 2011, with Barca winning 3-1 on that occasion.

Uefa also drew the semi-finals on Friday, meaning the winners of the Barcelona v United will face either Liverpool or Porto in the last four.
Jurgen Klopp’s side, fresh from knocking out Bayern Munich in the last 16, will be confident of beating the Portuguese champions after defeating them 5-0 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the final last season.
Liverpool will host two-time European Cup winners Porto at Anfield in the first leg before heading to the Estadio do Dragao in the return on 16 or 17 April.
Liverpool and Porto met in the last 16 a year ago.Martin RickettMartin Rickett
There is guaranteed to be one English team in the semi-finals after Tottenham and City were paired together, with the first leg to be played in London.
With Pep Guardiola’s team top of the Premier League, 13 points ahead of Spurs in third, City will be the favourites to advance to their first semi-final since 2016. City have also won their last three meetings with Mauricio Pochettino’s team.
The draw means there will be three clashes between the sides in 10 days — they are also due to meet in the Premier League at the Etihad Stadium on 20 April.
The winner of that tie will host either Ajax or Juventus in the first leg of the semi-finals.
The latter tie is a repeat of the 1996 final, which the Italian club won on penalties against an Ajax team who had won the trophy the previous year.

Juventus have lost five finals since then but are hoping Ronaldo can fire them to glory this season after his hat-trick knocked out Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.
That result ended Atletico’s dreams of reaching the final, which will be played at their Wanda Metropolitano stadium on Saturday, 1 June.

The burst happened on a combined storm and sewage main on Quay Street, between the pumping station and the wastewater treatment plant.
Once the burst was reported, the pumping station was shut down to limit the impact on the locality, according to Irish Water.
Irish Water crews are on site assessing the repairs required and a clean-up of the impacted area is underway.

Traffic management will remain in place for the duration of the repairs.
Tankers are also on site transferring wastewater to the treatment plant until repair works are complete.
“We understand the concern of property owners affected by the incident and apologise for any inconvenience caused,” Irish Water said in a statement.
“We would also like to apologise to any other members of the public inconvenienced as a result of this issue,” it said.
Irish Water said it is “aware of issues associated with this main” and that it is “prioritising plans to address this problematic section of main as soon as possible”.

First up is St Thomas’ (Galway) against Ballyhale Shamrocks (Kilkenny) at 2pm, before Dr Crokes of Kerry and Galway’s Corofin meet at 3.45pm.
It’s an experienced quartet – all four clubs have been crowned All-Ireland champions at least once before.
There are plenty of interesting talking points to discuss ahead of the mouth-watering ties.
1. Attack vs attack
Dylan Canney and Michael Farragher celebrate after their 2018 All-Ireland win.Gary Carr / INPHOGary Carr / INPHO / INPHO
The football final pairs two clubs who shared five All-Irelands between them. Both can trace their success back to the 1990s when they claimed their maiden crowns – Dr Crokes in 1992 and Corofin six years later.
It will also bring together the two most formidable attacks in the club game. Corofin’s freewheeling forward unit put 2-19 past Nemo Rangers in a breathtaking display in last year’s final.
All-Star Ian Burke is joined by Martin Farragher, who shot 0-6 that day against Nemo,  former Galway players Gary Sice and Micheál Lundy, in addition to Jason Leonard and Michael Farragher.
Defenders Liam Silke, Dylan Wall and Kieran Molloy all love to drive out of defence and join the attack.
The Dr Crokes forward line is so strong, meanwhile, that legendary figure Colm Cooper is used as an impact sub. Micheál Burns, Gavin O’Shea and Brian Looney occupy the half-forward line with Tony Brosnan, Kieran O’Leary and David Shaw employed on the inside line.

Then they’ve Cooper and Jordan Kiely to spring from the bench. It promises to be a tough afternoon for the defenders.
2. Family ties in hurling decider

The Ballyhale Shamrocks side are backboned by household hurling names Reids, Fennellys and Shefflins. Just like they’ve always done.
King Henry is in charge alongside his brother Tommy, while his nephew Evan Shefflin will take the field later today. Brothers TJ, Richie and Eoin Reid fill up one-fifth of the team, while the Fennelly brothers Michael – if he’s fit to start – and Colin fly the flag for their illustrious family.
And Joey Holden has a connection on the St Thomas’ team where his first cousin Cian Kelly is part of the panel.
The Galway side are dominated by two families – the Burkes and Cooneys. Seven Burkes and three Cooneys started the semi-final, which two sets of brothers and two cousins.
That includes county stars David Burke and Conor Cooney, who helped spearhead the Tribe’s All-Ireland victory in 2017.
3. Ballyhale look for record seventh crown
Ballyhale Shamrocks have the chance to move three titles clear of Birr and Portumna in the All-Ireland club hurling roll of honour with a record seventh victory.
The Kilkenny champions lifted the crown for the first time in 1981 and they added further titles in ’84, ’90, ’07, ’10 and ’15.
Galway clubs have enjoyed a good deal of success in the competition over the years.
St Thomas’ are bidding to become the fourth club from the county to win a second All-Ireland. Portumna (’06, ’08, ’09 and ’14), Athenry (’97, ’00 and ’01) and Sarsfields (’93 and ’94) have all won multiple crowns.
4.Serial winnersGooch and Fitzgerald

Not too many footballers in the country have as many medals jangling in their pockets as Kieran Fitzgerald and Cooper.
Fitzgerald is still going strong at 40-years-old and searching for his third All-Ireland club medal. A senior All-Ireland winner with Galway in 2001, Fitzgerald also won two All-Ireland U21 titles and four provincial medals during his inter-county career.
On the club scene, he’s also won 12 Galway county titles and four Connacht club medals.
Cooper, 35, annexed five Celtic Crosses with the Kingdom, in addition to eight All-Stars and nine Munster championships. On the club scene, he’s won seven Kerry county finals, six Munster deciders and the Andy Merrigan Cup in 2017.
The pair of serial winners will be seeking to add to their extraordinary collections later today.
5. Corofin hoping for rare feat
Corofin have the opportunity to become the first side to retain the All-Ireland football title since Crossmaglen Rangers in 2000.
It’s a feat that’s only been managed twice before. Cork’s St Finbarr’s did the double in 1980 and ’81, while UCD won back-to-back crowns in ’74 and ’75.
They could be going for three-in-a-row had Crokes not dumped Corofin out in the 2017 semi-final.
It’s a remarkable achievement to make it back to St Patrick’s Day on successive years given the drawn-out nature of the club competition. If they do repeat, this Corofin team will go down among the very best club teams we’ve ever seen.

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER Scott Morrison has said a far-right senator should face “the full force of the law” over comments he made about the New Zealand terror attack and a subsequent altercation with a teenage boy.
Queensland Senator Fraser Anning drew international condemnation for blaming the mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques, in which50 people were killedand dozens more injured, on immigration.
“I would normally not want to give this any oxygen, but I want to absolutely and completely denounce the statements made by Senator Anning … in his conflation of this horrendous terrorist attack with issues of immigration, in his attack on Islamic faith specifically.
“These comments are appalling and they are ugly and they have no place in Australia, in the Australian parliament also, and he should be frankly ashamed of himself,” Morrisontold a press conference.
The Australian government plans to censure Anning over his comments. A bipartisan motion condemns him for “inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion”.
Themotion statesthat “violence such as that witnessed in Christchurch is an affront on our common humanity” and condemns “an attack on our common values and way of life”.
In a statement issued in the aftermath of Friday’s mass shooting, Anning said the attack was the result of Muslim immigration into New Zealand.
“As always, left-wing politicians and the media will rush to claim that the causes of today’s shootings lie with gun laws or those who hold nationalist views, but this is all cliched nonsense,” Anning said.

He added that “the real cause of bloodshed” is the country’s immigration programme.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also condemned Anning’s comments, describing them as a “disgrace”.
Australian-born Brenton Tarrant (28) filmed himself carrying out the horrific attack on Friday. He made a white power gesture as he appeared in court charged with murder.
Egging
Yesterday Anning had to be restrained by security officials afterpunching a teenagerwho egged him at a press conference in Melbourne over his remarks.
The boy has been named locally as 17-year-old Will Connolly. He was arrested by Victoria Police after the incident but was released without charge.
In a statement issued after the incident, Anning thanked people for their support.
The senator was elected in 2017 by a fluke of Australia’s proportional voting system, having received only 19 first preference votes. He is unlikely to be reelected when Australians go to the polls in a vote expected this May.
Anonline petitioncalling for Anning’s expulsion from parliament had received more than one million signatures at the time of publication.

“I can categorically confirm that our office has never been lobbied by Enda Kenny or his office,” ODPC head of communications Graham Doyle said.
In a statement to reporters, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that it was up to enda Kenny whether he commented on the story, but added that he doesn’t feel Kenny has to.
Varadkar says he gets lobbied all the time from the large multinationals, and that Ireland has a “good relationship” with all big tech companies, but Facebook is no different from the rest.

Thearticle published detailsfrom a Facebook memo which described Kenny as a “friend of Facebook” and said that the company had a “great relationship” with the former Taoiseach.
The memo claimed that Kenny stated that Ireland’s presidency of the EU provided “the opportunity to influence the European Data Directive decisions” and that Ireland could also influence other member states, “even though technically Ireland is supposed to remain neutral in this role”.
The memo was reportedly contained in court documents as part of a California court case involving Facebook.

Ireland held the presidency of the EUbetween January-June 2013during Kenny’s first term as Taoiseach.
Facebook’s international headquarters are located in Dublin and the article notes the critical role played by Ireland’s data protection commissioner on an EU-wide basis.
In response to the claims made in the article, Fianna Fáil’s enterprise spokesperson Billy Kelleher TD said questions needed to be answered.
“This will require a statement to clarify it (sic) the government and its diplomatic services were being used to lobby other EU member states on behalf of Facebook,” Kelleher tweeted.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Minister for Communications Richard Bruton said that “there’s some things that are absolutely clear”, as he addressed the reports.
“Firstly, there is no watered down rules in Ireland on GDPR. Secondly, it was Enda Kenny himself who dramatically strengthened the powers and resources of the Data Protection Commissioner here in Ireland. Thirdly, both holders of that office have stated that they had no interference from government,” Bruton said.
“I think there’s very strong indication as to the position that Ireland has taken and it has always been that we need strong and fair regulation of these companies,” he said.
“Of course these companies are important players and if they express a view about developing legislation they have to be listened to, just like any other view will be listened to in framing legislation.”
Kenny’s office has been contacted for a statement.

https://www.the42.ie/letter-from-gibraltar-4556073-Mar2019/,"Gavin Cooney reports from Gibraltar
“YOU CAN UNDERSTAND why they fight over it”, said the Irish fan sitting besideThe42as our plane dipped to bring the Rock of Gibraltar into view.
Britain may only now be coming to terms with the loss of their empire, but they are at least invading most conversations these days.
The squabble over Gibraltar is between Britain and Spain, and we doubt that Ireland would have much interest in its massive limestone protuberance anyway.
Such an ostentatious display of sedimentary rock is a poor metaphor for our relationship with our own history; whereas Gibraltar is happy to show off this millenia-spanning collection of past events, our history is an altogether more reserved affair, lurking in strange and quiet places.
Like, as it turns out, Declan Rice’s Instagram.
Declan Rice has found controversy yet again.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
The42landed to a statement made by Rice, meaning we had to reverse-engineer the apology to discover he had posted “Up the Ra! Wait ‘til we draw England” back in 2015.
Rice said his comments were “naive”, while Gareth Southgate called the surfacing of the comments prior to Rice’s England debut “uncanny”.
This was a Freudian slip in a very real way from Gareth, given it was ol’ Sigmund who defined the uncanny as “strangely familiar”, which he derived from his belief in the “double”.
The idea is a good fit for Rice, who has by the age of 20 lived the full-throated patriotism of fully two different national identities.
The realities of Gibraltar’s identity is evident as soon as you leave the airport. Spain is literally within walking distance; otherwise, turn left for Gibraltar, and walk down Winston Churchill Way.

It runs perpendicular to the airport’s runway, meaning the airstrip is the firstThe42has seen that simultaneously works as a level-crossing.
Handily our AirBnb was only a 20-minute walk from the airport, the only slight downside being the fact we had to stay in it.
The hallways were straight out ofBarton Fink:narrow, dimly-lit and laid with a grimy red carpet on which each stain told a story that nobody really needs to hear.
Meanwhile, the television’s only channels were all four ITVs, making it a long way to come to watch someTipping Point.
Still, the fact a guy can amble down Winston Churchill Way and then watch seven-straight hours ofMiss Marpleis a sign of how classical British emblems festoon the place.
It’s different overhead: gaze upward and away from the rock and the place looks like a typical Spanish seaside resort.
The skyline is a bar chart of high-rise apartment blocks with barred verandas and shabby shutters, looking down on a scattering of red and apricot terracotta roofs.
On the ground, however, it’s been made distinctly British. Red phone boxes are dotted around the streets, while there are numerous memorials to fallen British soldiers engirdling Grand Casemates Square. Said square is yet to be invaded by Irish fans, with many choosing to linger longer in Malaga before arriving for the game.
Just as in Ireland, Brexit is dominating the news cycle here, with Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo yesterday calling on the British government to revoke Article 50 and “take back control” of Brexit.
96% of Gibraltar voted in favour of Remain, but they are in a uniquely complex situation as they also want to remain tied to the UK. A referendum in 2002 to thrust Gibraltar into shared sovereignty between the UK and Spain was defeated by 98.97%.
So while Picardo wants the UK to remain in the EU, he has also had to assert Gibraltar’s right to stay with the UK. He responded to the prospect of an EU-backed Spain renewing its claim on Gibraltar by saying that for all their  “sticks and stones”, it won’t change Gibraltar’s relationship with the UK.
The fact Gibraltar shares a border with the EU means that locals understand the talk of backstops, with a local journalist tellingThe42that “we were expecting to be the backstop, rather than Ireland.
“We thought we would be the ones who would be causing the most problems.”
Amid all the uncertainty, this remoaning column has shown solidarity with the 96% and published this using the EU’s friendly roaming charges rather than the AirBnb WiFi.

There is another union in the news, withThe42touching down on what was the 50th anniversary of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s wedding on the peninsula.

A British couple decided to use their wedding to re-enact it, with Paul and Merilyn Drummond saying that “Sadly war isn’t over and there’s no peace in the UK, so we came to Gibraltar for some peace and love.”
Unlike Mr and Mrs Drummond, Mick McCarthy isn’t in Gibraltar for either. He’ll take three points and, ideally, a few goals, but he may find the conditions as challenging as the opposition tomorrow night.
While much has been made of the artificial pitch – none of it, it must be said, by the manager – it is ferociously windy, with the 2,300-capacity Victoria Stadium sitting by the airport runway and at the base of the Rock.
While there are stands running alongside the length of the pitch, there is no seating behind either goal.
Instead, there’s an ‘Airport End’ and a ‘Rock End’, the latter a pretty spectacular sight.
McCarthy’s team should eventually make light of all of this, though, and by Saturday night the football teams should be comfortably separated.
Ireland and Gibraltar, however, are two places united by anxiety as to what happens next.

Setting up the new Strategic Threat Analysis Centre was one the proposals made by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.
Last year, Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan moved to immediately establish threat assessment body.
The new centre will co-ordinate security and intelligence at central government level.

In light of the increase of terror attacks internationally, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said:
“We have seen horrendous terrorist attacks occur across the water in Britain, France, America and now in New Zealand. You know, countries can only be so prepared for acts of appalling violence that are carried out by individuals or small groups.
“But among the things we are doing for example in light of the recommendations from the O’Toole Commission is putting together a strategic threat assessment centre, essentially a coordinating body which will be under the aegis of my department and that will coordinate the work of the gardai intelligence, of defence intelligence and also the cyber security unit,” he said.
Varadkar said the government is doing a few things to bring together and coordinate intelligence and national security.
He said the new centre should be set up this year.
“We should have the national security coordinator appointed and the office set up I say… certainly this year.”

HILLARY CLINTON HAS for the first time ruled out running for president in 2020.
“I’m not running, but I’m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,” Clinton said Monday in an interview with News 12, a local TV channel in New York.
Clinton was the frontrunner in 2016 but ended up losing to Donald Trump.
“I want to be sure that people understand I’m going to keep speaking out,” Clinton said.
“I’m not going anywhere. What’s at stake in our country, the kinds of things that are happening right now, are deeply troubling to me.”

Clinton has held meetings with some of the Democrats who are now vying for the party nomination or considering a run.
CNN has reported that they include former vice president Joe Biden, who has not yet said if he is running.
“I’ve told every one of them, don’t take anything for granted, even though we have a long list of real problems and broken promises from this administration that need to be highlighted,” Clinton said.
Asked if she would run again for some kind of public office, she seemed to avoid ruling that out.
“I don’t think so, but I love living in New York and I’m so grateful that I had the chance to be a senator for eight years and to work with people across our state,” said the former secretary of state and senator for New York state.

Met police last week launcheda terrorism investigation after three small explosive devices were reported at three public transport locations in London on Tuesday afternoon.
The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags – were assessed by specialist officers and found to be small improvised explosive devices.
The following day a package was received at the University of Glasgow. The package was not opened and no one was injured.
Police said that a claim for responsibility had been received yesterday by a media outlet in Northern Ireland using a recognised code word.
The claim was allegedly made on behalf of the ‘IRA’, police said.
They also said that the group claiming responsibility had indicated that five devices had been sent, but that to date only four packages had been recovered.
As the packages resembled devices sent in the past that were linked to dissident groups associated with Northern Ireland, police said they were already following this line of enquiry.
They said they were continuing to keep an open mind and that enquiries were continuing.

“Extensive advice has already been issued to relevant businesses and sectors to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police,” police said in a statement.
“This advice was previously sent to armed forces personnel and is being reiterated again in light of this claim.
People in England can report suspicious activity by calling the confidential phone line 0800 789 321 or filling in a secure form at www.gov.uk/act. In case of an emergency, people can call 999.
The incident
At around 9:55 am on Tuesday last week police received a report of a suspicious package at The Compass Centre, Nelson Road, Hounslow, which is a building near Heathrow Airport.
The package was opened by staff at the building, causing the device to initiate. This resulted in part of the package burning. No one was injured and the building was evacuated as a precaution.
At around 11.40 am the British Transport Police were called to reports of a suspicious package in the post room at Waterloo Station. The package was not opened and specialist officers attended and made the device safe.
At 12.10 pm the Met Police were called to a report of a suspicious package at offices at London City Aviation House in Newham.
The package was not opened and no one was injured, but the building was evacuated as a precaution. Met Police issued advice to transport hubs across London to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.
The following day, a suspicious package was received at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The emergency services were alerted and several buildings were evacuated as a precaution. Specialist officers then carried out a controlled explosion of the device.

https://www.thejournal.ie/second-case-ever-of-hiv-remission-4524014-Mar2019/,"
A LONDON MAN appears to be free of the Aids virus after a stem cell transplant, the second success including the “Berlin patient,” doctors reported.
The therapy had an early success with Timothy Ray Brown, a US man treated in Germany who is 12 years post-transplant and still free of HIV. Until now, Brown is the only person thought to have been cured of infection with HIV, the virus that causes Aids.
Such transplants are dangerous and have failed in other patients. They’re also impractical to try to cure the millions already infected.
The latest case “shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a fluke and can be recreated,” said Dr Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who had no role.
He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely.
The case was published online Monday by the journal Nature and will be presented at an HIV conference in Seattle.
The patient has not been identified. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and started taking drugs to control the infection in 2012. It’s unclear why he waited that long. He developed Hodgkin lymphoma that year and agreed to a stem cell transplant to treat the cancer in 2016.
With the right kind of donor, his doctors figured, the London patient might get a bonus beyond treating his cancer: a possible HIV cure.

Improbable event
Doctors found a donor with a gene mutation that confers natural resistance to HIV. About 1% of people descended from northern Europeans have inherited the mutation from both parents and are immune to most HIV. The donor had this double copy of the mutation.
That was “an improbable event,” said lead researcher Ravindra Gupta of University College London.
The transplant changed the London patient’s immune system, giving him the donor’s mutation and HIV resistance.
The patient voluntarily stopped taking HIV drugs to see if the virus would come back.
Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the Berlin patient, was the first person to be cured of HIV infection, more than a decade agoManuel Valdes via PA ImagesManuel Valdes via PA Images
Usually, HIV patients expect to stay on daily pills for life to suppress the virus. When drugs are stopped, the virus roars back, usually in two to three weeks.
That didn’t happen with the London patient. There is still no trace of the virus after 18 months off the drugs.
Brown said he would like to meet the London patient and would encourage him to go public because “it’s been very useful for science and for giving hope to HIV-positive people, to people living with HIV,” he told The Associated Press Monday.
Stem cell transplants typically are harsh procedures which start with radiation or chemotherapy to damage the body’s existing immune system and make room for a new one. There are complications too. Brown had to have a second stem cell transplant when his leukaemia returned.
Compared to Brown, the London patient had a less punishing form of chemotherapy to get ready for the transplant, didn’t have radiation and had only a mild reaction to the transplant.
Dr Gero Hutter, the German doctor who treated Brown, called the new case “great news” and “one piece in the HIV cure puzzle.”

https://www.the42.ie/gaa-football-league-2019-promotion-relegation-4552640-Mar2019/,"THE FINAL ROUND of the 2019 Allianz football league is pencilled in for this Sunday afternoon with league final placings, promotion races and relegation battles set to be decided.
Here are all the permutations across the four divisions with a reminder that head-to-head is used to split teams if two are joined together and scoring difference coming into play if more than two teams finish on the same number of points.
Kerry (1o points), Galway and Mayo (both 8) and Tyrone (7) are all in with a chance of reaching the final. A win or draw will guarantee Kerry’s progression while scoring difference could also work in their favour if Galway and Mayo end up joining them on 10 points.
If Galway win they will progress as they can better Mayo if head-to-head comes into play, while a draw would also suffice if Mayo draw or lose. Mayo must win and hope Tyrone do them a favour. Tyrone’s chances revolve around a win over Galway and Mayo losing to Monaghan.
Advertisement
Dublin are the only side in the division who have nothing to play for on Sunday. The relegation battle is between Cavan (2 points), Roscommon (3) and Monaghan (4). Cavan must win, hope Monaghan draw with Mayo and Roscommon lose to Kerry, while also improving their scoring difference. Monaghan are definitely safe if they win or if Roscommon lose. A loss for Monaghan and a draw for Roscommon can see them demoted.
Meath are on the cusp of promotion on 10 points. A win or draw at home to Fermanagh on Sunday rubber-stamps their graduation but even if they lose they’d need to suffer a heavy defeat and for Donegal to win so as to not finish in the top two. That latter scenario would see Meath (+20), Fermanagh (+2) and Donegal (+5) all finish top together with scoring difference currently weighted in the Royals favour.
Donegal will be aiming to beat Kildare and hope for a Meath victory. If Donegal and Fermanagh finish level, the head-to-head record swings in Fermanagh’s favour. Kildare (7 points) must win in that away game against Donegal and hope Fermanagh lose if their outside hopes are to be realised of promotion.
Armagh are safe leaving the Munster trio of Clare (-8), Tipperary (-9) and Cork (-22) all locked together on three points. Cork need to beat Armagh and hope Tipperary win or draw against Clare to survive. If Clare win they will escape while if Tipperary win, they’d need Armagh to get a positive result against Cork. Draws in both games involving the Munster counties would see Cork and Tipperary relegated due to Clare’s superior scoring difference.
Last weekend’s postponement of the Louth and Westmeath game complicates the promotion picture here. Currently Down (10), Laois (8), Westmeath and Longford (both 7), and Louth (6) are all in with a chance of going up. If Down win or draw at home to Louth on Sunday, they will be promoted and similarly a win for Laois over Carlow could be sufficient for them. If Westmeath or Louth pick up full points from their last two games, they would enter the frame, while Longford will also pursue a win to keep their hopes alive.
At the bottom Sligo are already relegated. Offaly (3 points) must beat them away from home in their last game while hoping Carlow (5 points) lose to Laois and then the head-to-head factor would favour Offaly.

Everything has already been wrapped up in this tier with Derry and Leitrim having bagged the promotion places. They will meet in the Division 4 league final on the weekend of 30-31 March. This weekend’s final series of games are split between Saturday and Sunday.
* -An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the points of some counties in Division 1. Tyrone (7 points), Monaghan (4) and Roscommon (3) is the state of play ahead of Sunday’s game.

https://www.the42.ie/keith-earls-try-ireland-france-analysis-4534038-Mar2019/,"THE JOE SCHMIDT specials keep on coming.
There were a number of other times when Ireland went extremely close to cracking France with their intelligent set-piece plays yesterday but the standout example was Keith Earls’ second-half try.
“It was probably just designed around what we felt we could maybe get today,” said Schmidt post-match, confirming that this play was created to exploit possible French weaknesses that had been identified in Ireland’s pre-match analysis.
“We just felt that if we got a couple of good drives at them that they would have to commit people to the drive and if we got out and if it was on, it was on. If it wasn’t on, then CJ [Stander] could carry.”
Guinness Six Nations/ YouTube
Earls joined the front of the Irish lineout and remained cleverly hidden for this try, with Stander providing the deft inside pass.
The successful instance above was the second time Ireland used this set-up against the French in Dublin yesterday.
“We tried the same play with Keith in the first-half but we didn’t go through with it,” said Stander.
That first example came in the 14th minute as Ireland attacked from a right-hand-side line0ut.
As we can see below, Earls is at the front of the lineout.

It’s a 7+1 lineout set-up for Ireland, meaning seven players in the lineout itself and one – Josh van der Flier – in the ‘receiver’ position just off the lineout.
Rory Best throws to Iain Henderson [red below], with van der Flier [yellow] moving into position to accept the transfer from Henderson as he comes to ground.

We can see that Earls [white] is doing his best not to attract attention, still facing towards the touchline even as Henderson wins the ball.
Earls wants to remain as hidden as possible here, not attracting the attention of the French defence.
But as van der Flier [yellow below] receives the ball from Henderson and splinters off to the left, as France commit to the maul defence, we can see that Earls [white] has burst around to strike on the inside of van der Flier.

Bundee Aki [blue] is arriving on van der Flier’s outside shoulder to provide an option there, which van der Flier takes in this instance.
We can see van der Flier’s pass going to Aki in the shot below but there are a number of other important factors to note.
Firstly, van der Flier’s run off the back of the forming maul has attracted Louis Picamoles [indicated in yellow below], who is France’s ‘tailgunner’ – the defender coming from the defensive ‘receiver’ position in behind the lineout.

Aki’s run, meanwhile, lures in Yoann Huget [blue], who is the first defender in France’s backline defence which starts 10 metres back from the lineout.
On the inside of van der Flier, we can see that Earls is running into clear space on Picamoles’ inside shoulder but the retreating Arthur Iturria [white] is actually blocking off the possible pass.
Had van der Flier turned the ball inside, it would probably have hit Iturra – who has jumped in the lineout and landed over on Ireland’s side – and brought about an offside penalty for Ireland.
Either way, the space on the inside of Picamoles is clear, accentuated by the fact that tighthead prop Dorian Aldegheri [on as a blood sub for Demba Bamba] at the very back of the French lineout has committed into the maul defence [red below].

Tadhg Furlong has hooked in underneath Aldegheri’s right arm, keen to ensure the France tighthead remains locked into the maul, therefore adding to the possibility of Earls running into space on the inside of Picamoles.
Although van der Flier hit Aki on this first occasion – and Iturria blocked the inside option anyway – Ireland would have noted the space that opened up as they had felt it might.
“We realised there was a bit of space there,” said Stander. “We trained it a lot but it didn’t really work [in training] because if you do it against your own team-mates, they already know the play so it doesn’t really work!”
Before we go further, it’s worth looking at how and why Ireland realised there was a bit of space there – i.e. in behind the lineout on Picamoles’ inside shoulder.
Different teams have different defensive set-ups for lineouts in different areas of the pitch.
France tend to use hooker Guilhem Guirado [blue below] as their ‘tailgunner’ the majority of the time out the pitch, as indicated here against Ireland.

The lawbook states that the tailgunner, like the attacking receiver [Conor Murray here], must be two metres away from their team-mates in the lineout, and between the five-metre and the 15-metre lines.
Advertisement
With Guirado as tailgunner above, France scrum-half Antoine Dupont [white] defends in the five-metre channel, in case Ireland attack back down there.
However, close to their 22-metre line or inside the 22, France’s set-up changes, as we see below against England in round two of this Six Nations.

Guirado [blue above] has now moved into the five-metre channel to defend there, while Picamoles [yellow] is the French tailgunner.
Fascinatingly, England start with a wing, Jonny May [white below], at the front of this lineout.

England win the lineout and initially appear set to maul, luring France into piling in to defend it, with tighthead Demba Bamba [red below] committing in.

But Billy Vunipola instead passes away from the back of the forming maul to scrum-half Ben Youngs.
Youngs surges forward diagonally and drags Picamoles with him [indicated in yellow below].

May [white] has looped around from the front of the lineout to pop up on Youngs’ outside shoulder but the sheer amount of space [indicated in green] on the inside of Picamoles is blatantly obvious in the shot above.
It’s unclear whether May was supposed to arrive to the inside of Youngs but the scale of the missed opportunity as Youngs passes to Manu Tuilagi on the outside is clear.
Ireland weren’t the only team who noted the opportunity.
Jump forward to round three of this Six Nations and we see Scotland attempting to pick the French apart on the inside of Picamoles.
As we can see below, Guirado [blue] is in the five-metre channel again, while Picamoles [yellow] has set up as the tailgunner as France defend on their 22-metre line.

This shot also shows us that wing Huget [red] is the first defender out in the backline again.
If we zoom out, we can see below that scrum-half Dupont [white] has dropped into a position 10 metres behind the lineout, covering the kind of space that a wing like Huget generally would further outfield.

The Scots win the lineout and Josh Strauss moves into position to accept the transfer from jumper Magnus Bradbury.
As he does so, we can see hooker Stuart McInally [yellow below] looping around after his throw to take a pop pass from Strauss.

At the same time, Scotland scrum-half Greig Laidlaw [red] is darting back towards the right, the apparent intention being to draw Dupont into closing up to that side of the lineout, drawing him out of the position we’ve seen him occupying in behind the lineout.
McInally receives the ball from Strauss and as he moves infield, we can see that Picamoles is dragged with him, as indicated in yellow below.

McInally has centre Peter Horne [blue below] running a hard line to his outside, but the target here is wing Tommy Seymour [white] switching back towards Picamoles’ inside shoulder.

Unfortunately for Scotland, Seymour doesn’t take the pass and the ball bounces forward off his chest.
Even if Seymour had caught the ball, we must note that Bamba was coming across on Picamoles’ inside, as we can see below.

Whether or not Bamba would have stopped the fast-moving Seymour is unclear but Scotland’s bid to exploit this space on the inside of Picamoles comes to nothing.
Schmidt’s Ireland, however, were watching closely and conjuring up their own idea of how to exploit this potential weakness.
And they were only encouraged by the first-half show of space when van der Flier passed outside to Aki.
Fast forward to the 56th minute and the analysis pays off as Earls gets the pass this time and makes it count to the tune of seven points.
The initial defensive set-up is familiar to us now, with Guirado [blue below] in the five-metre channel, Picamoles [yellow] the tailgunner, Dupont [white] in behind the lineout, and Huget [red] defending in the backline.


Ireland’s set-up is the same as their earlier effort, with a 7+1 lineout.
Earls [white below] is present at the front again.

As with the first example, Henderson wins the lineout with a good lift from Peter O’Mahony at the front and James Ryan at the back.
Van der Flier is off the pitch injured at this stage, with Stander now at openside flanker and therefore filling the role van der Flier had earlier, accepting the transfer from Henderson as the lock lands.
Importantly, Ireland are a little more patient this time, just holding the ball into the dummy maul for a second longer.
As that is happening, Picamoles [yellow below] is concerned by the traffic Ireland are showing away from the lineout.

Conor Murray [green] is drifting outfield slightly, while Aki [blue] is threatening to arrive on a hard line that also occupies Huget.
We can see above that Picamoles is already leaving that familiar space on his inside shoulder.
Bamba briefly engages in towards the dummy maul [red below].

As that’s happening, Dupont [white above] is beginning to close up towards the left-hand edge of the defence, concerned about Ireland possibly bouncing back to that side. His hint of movement will be crucial in a matter of seconds.
It’s worth noting how deep Ireland make their maul here, with Furlong [green below] right up at the tip just ensuring that the late-folding Etienne Falgoux [blue] wouldn’t have any chance of getting a hand to Earls.
Furlong does briefly grab out at Bamba too, but the France tighthead frees himself. The work of O’Mahony and Jack Conan in bracing on the right side of the maul against the France counter-drive is also important.

Ireland are ready to strike after the brief dummy maul, with Stander [yellow below] splintering off infield and running at Picamoles.

Bamba [red] disengages from the maul and breaks off to arrive on Picamoles’ inside shoulder
But Earls [white] has remained completely hidden to the France tighthead and Bamba doesn’t become aware of the Ireland wing until it’s too late, Stander delivering the pass back inside after keeping his balance in breaking off the maul.

Stander has completely fixed Bamba and Picamoles and slips the pass inside for Earls to break.
“There are a few people who think I can’t pass or offload, so it was good to show them that I can pass,” said Stander.
Earls gleefully accepts the ball and accelerates into the gap, with Dupont [white below] left trying to cover back across having initially closed up towards the touchline.

“If you can put Earlsy in space like that, he’s going to slice them and he’s going to score a try,” said Stander. “It was great pace that he showed.”
The players’ delight at pulling off this pre-planned play was clear at the time and though Schmidt’s men will have frustrations at how they finished the game after this bonus-point score, it was another satisfying example of their excellence on lineout attack.
With Schmidt’s intellect ably supported by hard-working analysts Vinnie Hammond and Mervyn Murphy, as well as a group of players who relish working hard to get their detail right on these plays, they remain a major weapon for Ireland in this World Cup year.
“It’s a great feeling,” said Stander of this effort. “Scoring a try is great but when it’s a team try like that.
“Besty, big throw. A bit of mauling, the outside guys running a few decoys.
“A real team try.”

COUNTER TERRORISM POLICE in London have said they are exploring the possibility that suspicious packages sent to buildings in the city yesterday came from Ireland.
Met police yesterday launcheda terrorism investigation after three small explosive devices were reported at three public transport locations in London yesterday afternoon.
The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags – were assessed by specialist officers and found to be small improvised explosive devices.
The devices, at the early stage of the investigation, appeared capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened.
Gardaí confirmed toTheJournal.ieyesterday evening that they were helping the Met Police with their investigations.
In an update this afternoon, Commander Clarke Jarrett, head of the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command, said:
“The Met Police is working closely with the CT Policing Network and police partners more widely. We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry.
Jarrett said that the force’s “utmost priority” was to ensure the safety of the public and staff working with mail.
“Yesterday we quickly shared images of the packages with staff at transport hubs and mail handling companies and offices, to aid them in identifying similar packages, however we have not received any further reports,” he said.
Police released images of the exterior of the three packages today, which show that they had An Post stamps on the front and the return address can be seen as Dublin.
The stamps which can be seen were issued at Valentine’s Day last year. A return address on the packages is given as Bus Éireann, Dublin.
In an earlier statement, Met police said they were treating the incidents as “a linked series” and were “keeping an open mind regarding motives”.

Safety advice
Jarrett said that extensive advice had been issued to different bodies to be vigilant and report any specific packages.
“We have issued extensive advice to transport hubs and mail sorting companies to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police, as always we encourage anyone who sees something suspicious to report it,” he said.
Incident
At around 9:55am yesterday police received a report of a suspicious package at The Compass Centre, Nelson Road, Hounslow, which is a building near Heathrow Airport.
The package was opened by staff at the building, causing the device to initiate. This resulted in part of the package burning. No one was injured and the building was evacuated as a precaution.
At around 11.40am the British Transport Police were called to reports of a suspicious package in the post room at Waterloo Station. The package was not opened and specialist officers attended and made the device safe.
At 12.10pm the Met Police were called to a report of a suspicious package at offices at London City Aviation House in Newham.
The package was not opened and no one was injured, but the building was evacuated as a precaution.
Met Police issued advice to transport hubs across London to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.
No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/climate-change-protests-2-4545725-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the huge turnout by students at the Climate Change protest in Dublin is to be welcomed.
Today, thousands of second level students swapped the classroom for the streets to  demonstrate against government inaction on climate change.
The marches in Dublin and Cork this afternoon form part of a global movement initiated by 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, who began protesting outside Swedish Parliament last August.
There are over 1,000 similar marches taking place worldwide today.
Thousands gathered near Dublin’s St Stephen’s Green just after midday before marching on to Leinster House.
Protests
In Chicago this evening, Varadkar toldTheJournal.ie:
“I think the protests were really welcome. It is inspiring that school children and students are getting politically active and are taking on the issue of climate change and they are really putting it up to us, as adults, and as political leaders to do a lot more to tackle this climate emergency, and make sure we pass on to them a better planet than we found it.
“So we get the message, we hear it loud and clear. We will be doing a lot more in the years ahead with our cross-government climate action plan to deal with the issue.”
Earlier this month, the Taoiseach said he supported school students going on strike, stating that he would listen to the concerns of students.

Ireland’senvironmental woes have been well documented, with the country well on course to miss vital emissions targets and face hefty fines.
Varadkarpreviously said that the childrentaking part in the protests are “telling all the adults in all parties to get our act together and to do more about climate change because it is their future that is in jeopardy”.
More to do
The Taoiseach defended the government’s record, but admitted that more needs to be done.
He said there has been a real development in renewable energy in Ireland, with over 30% of the country’s energy now coming from wind.
“We will expand that in the coming years,” he said, pointing out that Moneypoint is going off coal.
“Electric cars are really taking off, we need to put in the charging points. There are a lot of other things we need to do there is not one solution to climate change but a lot of things put together, we can do it and as well as that there is potentially economic opportunities in it as well, creating future jobs, jobs for future.”
The Taoiseach was recently asked what he was doing to reduce his carbon footprint, he said he istrying to eat less meat.
“I am trying to eat less meat, both for health reasons and for reasons of climate change. But I imagine given the amount of travel I do I am probably not the best example,” he said.
However, he said the government and its ministers should “lead by example” adding that the government owns a lot of vehicles and rolling out more hybrid and electric cars in the fleet should be looked at in the future.
Farmers and many rural TDs were unhappy with his comments stating that he should be heralding Irish beef.
The Taoiseach failed to answer what other actions he was personally taking to reduce his carbon footprint. When asked if had reflected on what else he could do, other than reducing his meat intake, he said he had not.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-cycling-tourism-4543899-Mar2019/,"DUBLIN SHOULD GET its own version of the Wild Atlantic Way to encourage tourism in less popular parts of the city, a Fianna Fáil politician has said.
Local election candidate Eoin Neylon has proposed a new cycling route that runs through the south-west of the city.
The plan, which Neylon calls The West Dublin Historical Cycle Route, would run from the Phoenix Park through Kilmainham, into Inchicore, Drimnagh and Walkinstown before looping back towards Christ Church Cathedral, and would be a way to increase visitors to tourist attractions in the west Dublin area which are currently under-visited.
He said the project will require “outside the box thinking” from those elected in May.
“It’s an issue that needs to be driven primarily by the City Council in conjunction with the NTA,” he said.
Neylon said that many tourist attractions in the West Dublin area go under-visited. The Grand Canal, for example, “is a great but underutilised amenity that we have,” he said.
Based on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, Neylon’s plan aims to draw more attention to the “non-traditional tourist sites”.

“We very much don’t get a slice of the pie when it comes to that, despite the fact that we’ve some great sites to be seen.”
The initiative aims to spread the wealth of tourism that Dublin already sees every year out to less visited areas. He wants to see “pride of place” brought back into these communities.
He said the initiative will not only be beneficial for promoting cycling in Ireland but also for small businesses in these areas.
It aims to increase and spread the €2 billion that almost six million tourists that visit Dublin every year already bring in. Neylon hopes for the intake to be spread more evenly and for a boost job creation in areas such as Inchicore and Drimnagh.
Some concerns are expected, said Neylon, mainly from pedestrians. “Cyclists, pedestrians, and motors can cohabit the roads quite easily if the right infrastructure is in place.”
“We’re well aware that we’re far behind global norms of the number of people cycling to and from work.”
He said this is down to how far behind the cycling infrastructure in the city is. Neylon said that the infrastructure for the West Dublin Historical Cycle Route could be completed in as little as two years if all goes well.
Fáilte Ireland had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.

DUBLIN CITY COUNCILLORS have rejected proposals to allow for ‘log cabins’ in the gardens of family homes in an effort to ease the housing crisis.
Independent councillor John Lyons proposed amending the city’s development plan, in particular its “Ancillary Family Accommodation” section which states that this type of accommodation must have access to the main house and not be separate.
Lyons, however, has argued in favour of allowing for free-standing structures to ease the pressure on those renting, those who’ve lost their homes and those saving for a deposit to buy a home.
Following a report from Head of Planning Richard Shakespeare, however, councillors this evening voted against Lyons’ proposal.

Relaxing current planning regulations to allow for ‘log cabins’ “will result in the provision of small substandard dwellings,” the report notes.
“There are genuine concerns that a major relaxation or variation of the policy or standards to facilitate the construction of free-standing structures in rear gardens will result in the provision of dwellings with poor residential amenities and detract from the amenities of adjoining residential properties,” it said.
Crucial to the matter, the report notes, is the “issue of access which could have safety implications for future residents in the event of a fire”.
According to the report, there have 175 complaints directly relating to structures erected in back gardens over the last three to four years.
Independent councillor Mannix Flynn, however, argued in favour of allowing ‘log cabins’ in back gardens at this evening’s meeting while Labour councillor Alison Gilliland cautioned against such a move, saying there was a risk of creating “shanty towns” in Dublin should ‘log cabins’ be allowed.
Green Party councillor Ciarán Cuffe said that Lyons’ solution to the housing crisis was a “slippery slope” and that it could result in sub-standard homes.
In the end, councillors voted against the proposal 36 to 11.

https://www.the42.ie/six-nations-team-championship-awj-4546811-Mar2019/,"ANOTHER 15 TEST matches are in the books, and it all ended in another superb Slam for Wales while their domestic rugby sides endure turmoil.
Here’s who stood out since February and earned a nod into our totally subjective Team of the Championship.
Let us know if there’s anyone you’d sub in.
15. Liam Williams (Wales)
A brilliant talent who gave Wales enormous assurance in aerial exchanges and, as usual, proved an elusive runner in attack.
14. Damian Penaud (France)
Billy Stickland / INPHOBilly Stickland / INPHO / INPHO
Poor in Twickenham, but otherwise a bright spark in France’s troublesome tournament as he offered a solid wide threat. Most impressive on the final day when assisting scores and defending stoutly to deny Italy a shock.
13. Henry Slade (England)
Made for an exciting addition to England’s midfield and really knitted the back-line together. Combined well with Manu Tuilagi, who he shades for a place here.
12. Hadleigh Parkes (Wales)
Try-scoring hero of the Grand Slam game, but had already earned his place in this XV after getting through mountains of work in setting that dominant Welsh defence.
Advertisement
Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
11. Darcy Graham (Scotland)
Jonny May scored twice as many tries, but Graham helped ease Scottish concerns amid a spate of back three injuries. Showed brilliant footwork in tackles and electric pace to give England a real fright in Twickenham.
10. Finn Russell (Scotland)
Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
Call it recency bias, but the tournament’s final game was a thrilling watch and Russell was at the heart of it as he padded out his assist stats. Also impressed in breaking down Wales’ defence in week four with a slick set-play execution. With the two Lions playmakers off form at different points of the tournament Wales sharing their 10 duties, Russell’s exceptional skill gets the nod here.
9. Ben Youngs (England)
His half-back partner lost form as the tournament wore on, but Youngs continued to set the tone for England with zippy passing and consistently accurate kicking.
1. Cian Healy (Ireland)
A consistently positive presence in the Ireland pack amid so much stuttering as Ireland lost hold of the winning feeling.
2. Ken Owens (Wales)
Found himself playing back row for Scarlets before the tournament, but there’s never any doubt about his quality at hooker as his diligent work set the tone for Wales’ slow march to glory.
Bryan Keane / INPHOBryan Keane / INPHO / INPHO
3. Tomas Francis (Wales)
The cornerstone of Wales’ Grand Slam. Francis was brimming with intent on every carry, tackle and set-piece.

4. George Kruis (England)
A tower of strength in the England pack, the consistent presence Eddie Jones has built his pack and set-piece around and he doesn’t skimp on work around the field.
5. Alun Wyn Jones (Wales)
Captain, leader legend.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
A stand-out candidate for player of the tournament, his performance against England was a wonder of the modern game as he bent the match to his will one ruck at a time.

7. Tom Curry (England)
The top tackler in the Championship and you could feel the thump of every last one. The 20-year-old was a tremendous addition that looked like it would bring Eddie Jones’ men back to the top of the podium until it went sour in Cardiff.

Played blindside more often than not, but we’ve nudged Billy Vunipola out of this selection to accommodate the relentless workhorse that kept Wales ticking in tough times away to France and Italy. He didn’t let up in the battles with England and Ireland either.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-st-patricks-day-4546610-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
THE TAOISEACH IS used to being the centre of attention in the US during the St Patrick’s Day celebrations.
But he was somewhat overlooked yesterday when MMA fighter Conor McGregor arrived to march in the Chicago parade, which he led alongside the city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel.
Photographers and camera people crowded around McGregor as he put on a sash which had his name on it, and clenched his fist, posing in his fighter stance.
The Taoiseach, who was left on the sidelines, later clarified that he was not awarethat McGregor was attending the parade, stating that the MMA fighter wasn’t representing Ireland in the parade, he was.
Some have dubbed it a PR gaffe, but the Irish-American contingent in Chicago are not happy one bit with how the parade played out.
It’s become somewhat of a tradition for the Taoiseach to attend parades in the US, though it is usually in New York. Marching in the Chicago parade was a departure from the usual.
Last year, chants of “Leo, Leo, Leo”could be heard, with Varadkar later telling the media he assumed those shouting his name were Irish people who were here on holiday.
“I doubt I am that well-known here in America,” he joked at the time.
There wasn’t so much of that this year, however,he has made a name for himself inthe States this time around.

Notably, headlines in the international press were dominated this week by the Taoiseach’s breakfast meeting with Vice President Mike Pence.
Pence, who has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT rights, told Varadkar last year that his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome at his official residence at this year’s St Patrick’s breakfast.
And speaking at the event – which was open to press, in a departure from last year – the Taoiseach gave remarks noting that in modern day Ireland politicians were judged not by their sexual orientation, “skin tone, gender or religious beliefs” but by their actions.

Speaking in Chicago afterwards, Varadkar said that while he did not discuss his speech with Pence, they had a “good chat” about various issues.
“Obviously we have very different views on social policy but I think the best way to manage these things is to engage with people,” he added.
There’s no doubt he knew the significance of his speech before delivering it, but the Taoiseach might not have predicted the reaction.
While the American people might not have known the name of Ireland’s ‘Tee-shuck’ (as Donald Trump pronounced it this week) they are more likely to know it now that US TV presenter Ellen Degeneres tweeted out a Buzzfeed article about the visit, stating:
“Mike Pence met with Ireland’s openly gay PM and his boyfriend. This makes me very happy.”

But how does Matt feel about being thrusted into the limelight? We’re not sure, and either is the Taoiseach, telling the media yesterday that he hasn’t asked him.
Varadkarsays he wasn’t nervous about delivering the speech, stating that he just wanted to convey “Ireland’s values” to the vice president.

The Taoiseach added that while his boyfriend doesn’t always like to be his “plus one” at official events, he was keen to accept the invite to breakfast at the Pences.

Last year, the Taoiseach made the headlines back home for all the wrong reasons, when he went off script and joked at a Capitol Hill lunch about intervening on behalf of Donald Trump in order to stop a wind farm being built near Doonbeg.
Today, Varadkar strolled down the streets of Chicago, flanked by secret service officers,  and last year’s gaffes seemed a million miles.
Like the parade, where the attention was elsewhere other than the Taoiseach, a similar turn of events occurred at a packed-out dinner of over 1,000 Irish-American’s at the Irish Fellowship Club on Friday night.
It was a rowdy event, with speakers, including the Taoiseach being drowned out by raucous crowd of Irish-Americans who were kicking of St Patrick’s Day a little early.
Silence only prevailed when the priest gave his blessing, with jokes heard after about how he was giving them all a special dispensation for lent.
During a speech at the Irish Fellowship Club dinner on Friday evening, Varadkar reiterated what he has been saying about Irish immigration all week.

He said immigrants from all countries and religions have helped build the United States.
“But sometimes as well they were scapegoats and blamed for things that went wrong just because of where they came from and because of their religion,” he added.
“We saw an example of that in New Zealand.
“For us in Ireland we believe the time has come for us to play a greater role in the world 100 years after independence. We really want to share our culture and share our identity.”
Governor of Illinois J B Pritzker paid tribute to the Irish immigrants who travelled to US in the 1840s.
“We would do well to remember those who immigrated to this country during the Irish potato famine, those who faced their share of prejudice and discrimination but persevered, taking the jobs that were available to them and working hard to build a better life for themselves and for their families.
“There are Irish-American descendants who would go on to become our teachers, our nurses, our police officers, our firefighters and our presidents of the United States.
“They educate our young and care for our sick, contributing to our culture and character as a nation.”
Pritzker, who is a Democrat, pointed out that the Taoiseach is the son of an immigrant, adding that as long as he is governor, the State of Illinois will be a welcome place for all (a sly dig at Trump with that one).

The final official engagement for the Taoiseach, after marching down the streets of Chicago, was a boat trip down the river, which, as is tradition, had been dyed a bright, bright green.
There was a harpist, Galway Girl was playing in the background, as Irish-Americans, the Irish ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall, Minister Michael Ring and Senators Michael McDowell and Ian Marshall joined the Taoiseach on board.
Giving his final St Patrick’s Day speech of the trip, he reminded people of how important the US trip is to the serving Taoiseach, stating that many a world leader has asked him how they get access to the likes of US President Donald Trump, and politicians on the Hill. Varadkar said the tradition has been nurtured over the years, because it is an important relationship to keep up.
So, how did Leo do on his second time around in the US as Taoiseach?
One Irish politician commended the Taoiseach, stating that he had “played a blinder” this year. Though the same politician stated that Varadkar had made a mess of it last year.
“Leo is finally getting it. He is seeing the value and importance of these events. He is now understanding that the smiles and a bit of plámásing to the Irish-Americans is needed. Enda knew it, and he did it very well. Leo is starting to understand how it is done, and that was clear on this trip,” they said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-nurses-4534164-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Mar 2019
TALKS BETWEEN THE government and nurses have been referred to the Labour Court after nurses’ unions rejected government draft contracts as “unreasonable”.
It follows an extraordinary general meeting of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation this afternoon to decide what steps to take in the ongoing nurses’ dispute.
Negotiations ended without a deal last night, when representatives for the nurses and midwives said there remained “a very large gap” between their side and the Government.
Talks come after nurses went on general strike for a number of days in February, protesting against what they call a recruitment and retention crisis in the sector.
The government initially refused to budge on its position over wage increases for nurses, before the Labour Court intervened to avert further strikes.
As part of that recommendation, negotiations are ongoing between all sides on a new contract for nurses.

Balloting on the proposals had been expected to start today, but INMO chiefs decided to postpone the start of balloting by two weeks, in line with a decision that members would not be balloted without what the union felt was a satisfactory contract.
Following the latest breakdown in talks, discussions have once again been referred to the Labour Court.
The Court is expected to examine the disputed clauses of the new draft contract, and the HSE, the Department of Health, and the Department of Public Expenditure are expected to attend.
“We are deeply disappointed with the government’s attempt to stretch the limits set by the Labour Court in these contract talks,” INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said.
“The government’s contract proposals are unacceptable to us and would only worsen the recruitment and retention problems.
“We believe that the government’s proposed contract goes far beyond the Labour Court recommendation and will be making this case firmly to the Court on behalf of our members.”
INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha previously toldRTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sean O’Rourkethat they were “very disappointed” that their employer only met with them this week following the Labour Court recommendation last month.
“We engaged all over the weekend and on a couple of evenings last week with the employer, with the view to getting a contract that would actually improve recruitment and retention,” Ní Sheaghdha said.
“The contract that was presented was way outside of the scope of what the Labour Court had instructed and we sought to get it back into that space over the weekend,” she said, adding that “at the moment, we’re at a point where it still isn’t there”.
“There isn’t any indication from our end that this contract would be acceptable to our members,” she said.
The union’s executive council is expected to meet again on 20 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/volkswagen-nazi-gaffe-4543169-Mar2019/,"VOLKSWAGEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE Herbert Diess has apologised for making a play on words with a Nazi slogan at a company meeting, insisting he was keenly aware of the German firm’s roots in the Third Reich.
Diess told business magazine Wirtschafts Woche he had not aimed to cause offence when he said “EBIT macht frei” during a VW management gathering on Tuesday.
EBIT refers to earnings before interest and taxes and Diess said he wanted to emphasise their importance to the company’s bottom line.
But the phrase echoed the infamous slogan on the main gate of the Auschwitz death camp “Arbeit macht frei” (“Work will set you free”).

“It was in no way my intention to put my statement in the wrong context – I honestly didn’t think it would at the time,” he said.
Diess added that he, the company and its staff were “aware of the particular historical responsibility of Volkswagen in connection with the Third Reich”.
In 1938, Adolf Hitler himself laid the foundation stone for the first Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg in northern Germany, tasked with building an affordable car for all Germans – which would go on to become the iconic Beetle.
During World War II, VW used concentration camp internees and prisoners of war as slave labour in its factories.

THE GREAT AMERICAN writer Gay Talese put it best when he said: “Every journalist’s most intimate fear is to check the weekend schedule and see their initials beside the Sunday hurling match tracker.”
This writer’s job has been made all the easier, however, by the fact that a series of fixtures across Division 1A and 1B have been called off this afternoon due to the teeming rain.
In Division 1A, Cork-Tipp and Wexford-Kilkenny have fallen foul of the weather, while in Division 1B Waterford-Galway has also been postponed.

The latest we’re hearing is that there will be another pitch inspection at Parnell Park before a final call is made on Dublin v Laois in 1B.
We might end up with only Clare-Limerick and Carlow-Offaly, which is still better than this same weekend last year when the snow put paid to pretty much all of the sporting action.

https://www.thejournal.ie/former-soldier-case-settled-anti-malaria-drugs-4550872-Mar2019/,"A FORMER SOLDIER has settled his damages action against the State over health problems he claimed he suffered as a result of being prescribed the anti-malaria drug Larium.
Patrick Fedigan brought proceedings over what he claimed were the effects of taking the drug while he served with the Defence Forces during UN peacekeeping deployments to Africa that occurred between 2001 and 2009.
The claims were denied.
Today, John Gordan SC, appearing with Bruce Antoniotti S, John Nolan Bl instructed by Kenty Carty Solicitors, for Fedigan told Justice Bernard Barton that following out of court talks between the parties the action had been resolved.
Counsel said that case could be struck out. No further details of the settlement, which are understood to be confidential, were given to the court.
The State defendants, represented by Eoin McCullough SC, Declan Buckey SC, Garreth Cooney BL and Joe Jeffers Bl, had denied negligence or were liable for any injuries suffered by the plaintiff.
The defendants had also argued that Fedigan had delayed in bringing his claim, meaning that his action was statute barred.
Justice Barton welcomed the settlement.

The action is one of several similar actions brought against the State by members of the Defence Forces who claim they suffered various illnesses as a result of being prescribed the drug.
Health conditions
In his action, Fedigan from Lobinstown, Navan, Co Meath claimed that he was prescribed Mefloquine Hydrochloride (Larium) when he served in Eritrea in 2001, Liberia in 2002 and Chad in 2010.
The 51-year-old claimed that as a result of his exposure to Larium he has suffered from various conditions including loss of balance, anxiety, panic, insomnia, vertigo, and memory problems.
He claimed the Minister for Defence, Ireland and the Attorney General were negligent and in breach of their duty towards him on grounds including he was not a suitable person to be prescribed Larium.
His prior medical history had not been ascertained before he was prescribed Larium and the defendants did not provide him with adequate support, treatment or management when he made complaints of symptoms of being prescribed the anti-malaria drug he claims.
He further claimed that the defendants failed to provide him with a safe system of work, and exposed him to risk of injury which they ought to have known.
He retired from the Defence Forces in 2013.
The case, had it proceeded, was expected to take up to ten weeks to hear.","6.38pm, 19 Mar 2019",
https://www.the42.ie/corofin-dr-crokes-all-ireland-final-2019-report-4547930-Mar2019/,"Kevin O’Brien reports from Croke Park
AFTER DELIVERING A third All-Ireland title in five years, Corofin have a strong argument to go down as the greatest club football team of all-time.
They’re right up there with the Crossmaglen Rangers side that won three in four years between 1997 and 2000.
Regardless, Corofin are the best we’ve seen this decade. They became just the just the fifth club to win back-to-back All-Irelands, after Armagh’s Crossmaglen (twice), St Finbarr’s of Cork and Dublin’s UCD.
Kevin O’Brien’s men won the Andy Merrigan Cup for the fourth time in their history with another clinical attacking display in a surprisingly one-sided final against the 2017 champions.
Last year they put 2-19 past Nemo Rangers to win by 15 points, this time it was 2-16 they dispatched against Dr Crokes.
James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
The concession of two goals inside the opening 22 minutes and John Payne’s straight red card five minutes later badly hampered Dr Crokes’ chances. By the time Colm Cooper was sprung from the bench in the 36th minute, Corofin had powered into a 2-9 to 0-7 lead.
An outfit with this level of experience and intelligence was never going to let a lead like that slip.
Gary Sice, Jason Leonard and Martin Farragher did the bulk of the scoring with 2-12 between them, while man-of-the-match Daithi Burke and wing-back Kieran Molloy also shone for the champions.
The battle of the last two winners of this competition in front of 17, 819 was far more one-sided than expected.
Leonard’s seventh-minute goal gave Corofin the ideal start.
Martin Farragher’s shot at the posts was blocked by Mike Moloney, but the ball fell into the path of Kieran Molloy who side-footed it to Leonard. The wing-forward dispatched it low past Shane Murphy.

Dr Crokes fought back with points from Daithi Casey and a brace from Tony Brosnan, but eight minutes before the break Corofin hit the net for a second time. A free-flowing handpassing move involving Farragher and Daithi Burke saw Ian Burke set-up Sice for an easy palmed finish.

Sice clipped over a free a minute later to leave Corofin 2-4 to 0-5 ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Dr Crokes when John Payne received a straight red card for kicking out at Dylan Wall.
Dr Crokes went into the interval seven behind as Sice twice and Leonard added white flags.
Corofin passed up on a couple of goal chances in the third quarter as Sice and Leonard opted to take their points, while Daithi Burke saw his shot well-saved by Murphy.
Cooper and talented youngster Jordan Kiely were on the field by the 40th minute and the Dr Crokes attack immediately improved. David Shaw forced a good save from Bernard Power and then Michael Potts had a shot stopped near the line from Kieran Fitzgerald.
But four frees – two from Daithi Casey and one apiece from Brosnan and Cooper — was all Dr Crokes could score in the second-half.
Leonard, the Farragher brothers, Burke and Molloy all clipped over efforts in the closing stages to round off the victory for this marvellous group of players.
Scorers for Corofin:Gary Sice 1-5 (0-3f), Jason Leonard 1-3, Martin Farragher 0-4, Daithi Burke 0-2, Mike Farragher and Kieran Molloy 0-1 each.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boeing-737-max-flights-grounded-explained-4537615-Mar2019/,"AVIATION AUTHORITIES AND airlines around the world have suspended the operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft in recent days.
The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is among those to have suspended flights involving the aircraft, with two US-bound Norwegian planesgrounded at Dublin Airport yesterday.
Ryanair has also ordered 135 of the planes, and has options on 75 more, although chief executive Michael O’Leary says the company does not plan to change this.
The move follows the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Sunday, in which 157 people – including Irishman Michael Ryan – were killed.
Yesterday evening, the European Aviation Safety Agency also announced a Europe-wide suspension of flights involving the aircraft.
Around 350 of the planes are currently in service around the world, while Boeing has also taken more than 5,000 orders for different versions of the carrier.
It means a potential headache for both passengers and the aircraft manufacturer, with suggestions that this week’s developments could shape Boeing’s fortunes for years.
‘No evidence’
Safety concerns surrounding the 737 Max were first sparked after a Kenya-bound Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed minutes after it took off from Addis Ababa on Sunday.
That alone may not have been enough to ground flights involving the aircraft, but it came four months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people.
Although no problems with the 737 Max have been identified, authorities and airlines felt compelled to act because the aircraft has only been in the air since 2017.
One aviation expert who spoke anonymously to AFP outlined the similarity between the two crashes.
“Like Lion Air, the [Ethiopian Airlines] accident took place shortly after takeoff and the pilots signaled they were experiencing problems, then the plane crashed,” they said.
“The similarities are clear.”

But Diarmuid O’Gorman, an aerospace engineering lecturer at IT Carlow, suggested that authorities may be jumping to conclusions.
“Anyone could look at it and say they’re similar, but really we won’t know that until more information comes out,” he tellsTheJournal.ie.
“If you’re cynical, you could say that the regulatory bodies had to be seen to be doing something, even though they had no evidence.
“It’s so new and so fresh that it’s possible that the regulatory bodies might be jumping the gun a little bit.”
Future importance
Since going on the market, dozens of airlines around the world have embraced the 737 Max for its fuel efficiency and utility for short and medium-haul flights.
But it’s not the first time the aircraft has faced skepticism from the aviation community.

In May 2017, the company stopped test flights of the aircraft over concerns about the engine produced by CFM International, jointly owned by France’s Safran Aircraft Engines and GE Aviation.
After October’s Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the aerospace community raised further questions about the lack of information on the plane’s anti-stall system.
Following an initial investigation, Boeing issued a bulletin telling pilots what to do when faced with problems with its airspeed indicator and angle of attack sensors.
In fact, the plane’s future is so important for the company that if any technical corrections are needed, the company says it will make them.

But this week’s incidents have caused huge damage to the company, according to O’Gorman.
“It could be incredibly damaging to Boeing, especially from a business point of view,” he says.
“This new plane was going to be their show pony, so when lawmakers make a shout to ground flights like they have done, it doesn’t look good.”
If investigators find a common cause for the Ethiopian and Indonesian tragedies stemming from the aircraft’s design, it could be a serious blow to Boeing and prompt airlines and passengers to shun the jet.
“This could go worldwide if you see passengers voting with their feet,” O’Gorman says.
“The worrying thing is that both incidents involved new aircraft in similar circumstances, even though there are many factors that can cause an airline to crash. It’s a tricky one.”
Initial assessment
But despite authorities in the EU, Australia, China, and airlines in Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa grounding the planes, the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, has yet to do the same.
On Monday night, the FAA issued a statement saying that while others have drawn similarities between the Indonesia and Ethiopia crashes, it was not willing to do so.
“This investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions,” the FAA said.
This, as well as economic pressure from airlines and manufacturers may also see the planes take to the skies again, as carriers may struggle to source other aircraft for routes served by the 737 Max.

O’Gorman suggests that while a full investigation will take months, a preliminary analysis by Ethiopian authorities into Sunday’s crash could resolve the issue sooner than that.
“They could certainly make an initial assessment of the accident and rule out an issue within weeks,” he says.
“The flight recording equipment from the Ethiopian Airlines flight could show the aircraft itself is safe, and these kind of worrying problems could be sorted quite soon.”
Until then, Irish passengers travelling with Norwegian from Dublin and Shannon airports have been advised to check with the airline for updates.
A spokesman for Norwegian toldTheJournal.iethat the company was continuing attempts to re-allocate passengers onto other Norwegian flights, while the company is also offering re-bookings to passengers affected by the grounding of 737 Max planes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/cardinal-philippe-barbarin-lyon-jail-term-4528193-Mar2019/,"THE ARCHBISHOP OF Lyon has been given a six-month suspended sentence after being convicted of helping to cover up child abuse over a two-year period.
Cardinal Philippe Barbarin was found guilty of failing to report the abuse of a child between 2014 and 2015.
It follows long-standing allegations from victims’ groups that he failed to report a priest under his authority to police after learning of abuse that took place in the 1980s and 90s.
However, prosecutors judged that those crimes were beyond the statute of limitations – meaning they were too old to prosecute – and declined to press charges.

Barbarin becomes the most senior French Catholic cleric caught up in the paedophilia scandals that have rocked the church in recent years.
The 68 year-old’s legal representatives said that he would appeal the judgement.
“The reasoning of the court is not convincing,” his lawyer, Jean-Felix Luciani, told reporters. “We will contest this decision by all the means possible.”
During the trial, victims accused Barbarin of being aware of the abuse allegations from at least 2010, and then trying to cover up the scandal under orders from the Vatican from 2015.
Francois Devaux, who leads a victims’ group in Lyon, called today’s verdict a “major victory for child protection”.

TheJournal.iefirst met Kelly Priestly, Glen Kilty and their two-year-old son Alan in November last yearwhen they were living in a homeless hub.
They had lost their rental accommodation and found it impossible to find somewhere affordable to move into, even though both have jobs.
“We don’t earn enough to buy, to be approved for a mortgage and the rents are gone up that high that we can’t rent either so where do we go? What do we do? We’re stuck. And then the stress of trying to get up to go to work everyday and trying to rear your child,” Priestly said at the time.

The council is examining a number of sites it owns including the delivery of 155 social and affordable homes at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, in partnership with the Housing Agency and Respond and Túath approved housing bodies. Lands at Shanganagh Castle have been earmarked to deliver approximately 550 homes when infrastructure is in place.
The council is also asking vacant property owners who are willing to sell to the council to get in touch.

Whyte’s Auctioneer is advertising the rocket launcher along with two inert rocket-propelled grenades, inter booster rocket and accessories.
The item, which goes on sale as part of the auctioneer’s“Eclectic Collector”sale on 6 April, is expected to fetch between €4,000 to €6,000.
According to the auctioneer’s catalogue, the RPG-7 was “used by the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1998″.

“Most notably in Lurgan, County Armagh, where it was used against British Army observation posts and the military base at Kitchen Hill in the town”.
Defending the decision to sell the item, Ian Whyte toldRTÉ’s News at Onethat the rocket launcher in question is “part of history”.

“We sell weapons dating back to the beginning of time. Some of the weapons we have go back a good bit before BC. It was in the collection of a Republican who decided to sell off his collection.”
Whyte added that he was unsure whether or not the rocket launcher was actually used in Ireland but said it had been deactivated in Birmingham to EU standards.
When asked if a putting a weapon like this up for public auction was in bad taste, Whyte said:

https://www.thejournal.ie/backbenchers-warn-may-will-have-to-accept-her-share-of-responsibility-if-any-harm-comes-to-mps-2-4554125-Mar2019/,"SOME LABOUR MPS in the UK have warned that Theresa May’s speech last night could incite hatred against members of parliament.
The British Prime Minister’s address to the nation last nightreceived a poor receptionfrom politicians across the political spectrum.
As she attempts to bring her twice-rejected Brexit divorce deal before the Commons for a third time next week May insisted she was on the side of the public and that voters wanted politicians to get on with Brexit and stop in-fighting.
“It is high time we made a decision. So far parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,” she said in her TV address.
May said she will continue to work “night and day” to get MPs to vote for her deal so the UK can leave the EU by 30 June at the latest.
“You’re tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows,” May said, appealing directly to voters. “Tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children’s schools, our National Health Service, knife crime.”
“You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide.”
Conservative Sam Gyimah said May “resorting to the blame game” was “a low blow”, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy described the speech as “disgraceful”.

Others, however, went further in their criticism, warning that if MPs came to any harm May would be partly to blame.
Labour MP for Ilford Wes Streetingsaid on Twitter: “I’ve thought long and hard before saying this, but@theresa_mayknows that MPs across the House are subjected to death threats – some very credible. Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible. If any harm comes to any of us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.”
His parliamentary party colleague Luke Pollard agreed with the sentiment: “I agree Wes. It’s not just MPs but all those who work tirelessly for MPs who are now at greater risk because of the dangerous words chosen by the PM tonight.”
Roberta Blackman-Woods, a Labour shadow minister, wrote that many of her colleagues were facing “real and serious threats” and that May was “being irresponsible and misleading as most of the delay has been due to her running down the clock”.

Politicians have warned that the Brexit debate has heightened tensions to the point where they regularly receive death threats and other threatening messages.
One MPwho spoke to The Guardian recentlysaid she still received death threats every day.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-bans-boeing-planes-4537002-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Mar 2019
THE UK HAS banned the flying of any Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in its airspace, following the deadly Ethiopian plane crash at the weekend which killed 157 people.
The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight to Nairobi in Kenya on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia killing 189.
One of those killed was 39-year-old Michael Ryan, who was Deputy Chief Engineer at the United Nations’ World Food Programme.
This afternoon, the UK Civil Aviation Authority has issued instructions to stop any Boeing 737 MAX passenger flights from any operator arriving, departing or overflying UK airspace.
“Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by the tragic incident in Ethiopia on Sunday,” it said in a statement.

This directive will remain in place until further notice.
The move comes as airlines around the world remove the model from their schedules, while US regulators have ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to the jet.
Ethiopian Airlines said investigators had found the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders yesterday.
It said it had grounded its fleet of six remaining Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes pending analysis of the black box data.
“We assume we will find out the cause of the crash in the black box data,” the airline said.

Australia, Singapore and Malaysia also banned the model from its airspace today.
Norwegian has confirmed that it is temporarily suspending its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX.
“We will do our utmost to take care of our passengers in the best possible way,” it said.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement it was “temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into and out of Singapore in light of two fatal accidents involving Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months”.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) yesterday ordered Boeing to improve anti-stalling software and the model’s maneuvering system, giving the company until the end of April to make the updates. However, it ruled out grounding the fleet for now.
Airlines in Ethiopia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and the Cayman Islands said yesterday they were suspending operations by their 737 MAX 8 fleets.
China also ordered domestic airlines to suspend commercial operation of the MAX 8.
Indonesia, which has 11 of the MAX 8 model planes, said it would “carry out inspections and temporarily prohibit Boeing 737 Max 8 from flying”.
South Korea ordered an inspection of two MAX 8 planes flown by low-cost Eastar Jet.
Some other airlines said they were not cancelling MAX 8 flights, including Oman Air, flydubai, Turkish Airlines and Russia’s S7.
Fianna Fáil transport spokesperson Robert Troy has called on the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) to “immediately suspend Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft from use of Irish Airspace and withdraw the certificate of air worthiness from all Irish registered Boeing 737 Max 8 until such a time as their safety is clarified”.
“This is the second deadly incident involving this model of jet in less than five months. Passengers are understandably frightened and aviation experts are trying to ascertain how this has happened,” Troy said.
The plane that crashed on Sunday was less than four months old. Ethiopian Airlines said it was delivered on 15 November.
The jet went down near the village of Tulu Fara, some 60 kilometres east of Addis Ababa.
The IAA has been contacted for comment.

He was arrested on Monday after gardaí were called to the Poppintree area of Ballymun amid reports of a man with a gun.
He appeared before the Criminal Courts of Justice this morning, charged in connection with this incident.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bloody-sunday-charges-2-4541006-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Mar 2019
ONE FORMER BRITISH Army soldier is to be charged with murder over the killing of civilians in Derry on 30 January 1972.
The Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service (PPS) announced its decision this morning following a review of cases involving 19 individuals.
A man, known just as Soldier F, is to be prosecuted for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney and for the attempted murders of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick O’Donnell.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Herron, said there was “sufficient evidence” to charge Soldier F.

However, he added that the “available evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction” in respect of the other 18 suspects, including 16 former soldiers and two alleged members of the official IRA.
“In these circumstances the evidential Test for Prosecution is not met,” he said in a statement this morning.
Bloody Sunday
On 30 January 1972, in what would become known as Bloody Sunday, British soldiers fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians who were taking part in a civil rights march in the bogside in Derry.
In all, 28 people were shot. Thirteen people died while another person succumbed to their injuries a number of months later. The Widgery Tribunal was held immediately afterwards and largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame.

A second investigation, the Saville Inquiry, was set up in 1998; in 2010 the report was published, and found that the killings were both “unjustified” and “unjustifiable”. The Prime Minister at the time David Cameron apologised on behalf of the UK.
The British government has said that it will cover the legal costs of the soldier who faces the serious charges.

‘Expectation’
The PPS noted that it will now consider allegations of perjury in relation to the 19 individuals.
The decisions come after a years-long review by a prosecution team led by the Deputy Director of the PPS Michael Agnew, which was to consider a range of offences including murder, attempted murder and wounding.
Both men met with families of victims this morning, with Herron noting there has been a “high level of expectation” around today’s events, particularly in light of the findings of Saville.
“However, much of the material which was available for consideration by the Inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings, due to strict rules of evidence that apply,” he explained.
“I wish to clearly state that where a decision has been reached not to prosecute, that this is in no way diminishes any finding by the Bloody Sunday Inquiry that those killed or injured were not posing a threat to any of the soldiers.
“We recognise the deep disappointment felt by many of those we met with today. As prosecutors we are required to be wholly objective in our approach. However, that does not mean that we do not have compassion for all those who are affected by our decisions.
“Our role is to independently assess the available evidence and apply the Test for Prosecution. We are making a summary of the reasons for our decisions available today to provide assurance to the public that our statutory responsibility was undertaken in this case with absolute integrity and impartiality, without fear or favour.”
A statement from the families, issued through Madden & Finucane Solicitors, described today as a “remarkable achievement”.

“Notwithstanding the unprecedented attempted political interference with the independence of the judicial process, the families have not only succeeded in consigning the Widgery report to history, and securing the complete vindication and declaration of innocence of all of the victims of Bloody Sunday through the Saville Inquiry, they have now secured the prosecution of Soldier F for the murder and attempted murder of six innocent people.”
However, they added: “We are disappointed that not all of those responsible are to face trial.
Madden & Finucane represents the families of Jackie Duddy, Michael Kelly, Hugh Gilmour, Michael McDaid, John Young, Kevin McElhinney, William McKinney, Gerard McKinney, Gerald Donaghey, Paddy Doherty and Bernard McGuigan who were murdered on Bloody Sunday; together with Damien Donaghy, Alana Burke, Joe Mahon, Joe Friel, Patrick McDaid and Michael Quinn who were wounded, as well as the families of John Johnston, Peggy Deery, Patrick O’Donnell, Patrick Campbell and Daniel McGowan who were wounded but who are now deceased.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
‘Vindication’
The Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign described the news as “vindication” for its decades long fight.
The campaign was set up in 1992 with the goal of overturning the Widgery report, gaining formal acknowledgement that the victims were innocent and prosecuting those responsible.
“We would like to remind everyone that no prosecution, or if it comes to it, no conviction, does not mean not guilty. It does not mean that no crime was committed. It does not mean that those soldiers acted ‘in a dignified and appropriate way’,” the campaign said.
Speaking in Washington, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “The most important people in this matter are the families of the victims.”
“I know that the Department of Foreign Affairs is in contact with them on behalf of the Government. All of our thoughts are with the families on what must be a very emotional day.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-taoiseach-no-deal-brexit-4546515-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Mar 2019
Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the Irish government will press on with a suite of support measures for businesses and farmers as Brexit day edges close.
Speaking to reporters in Chicago, where hewas marching in the St Patrick’s Dayparade alongside MMA fighter Conor McGregor, the Taoiseach said he had a busy week ahead.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk is going to be in Dublin for talks with the Taoiseach on Tuesday.
Varadkar said the weekly Cabinet meeting will be held on Wednesday.
“On Wednesday at the Cabinet meeting, we will be in a position to sign off on a package of support for business, for farmers, for the agri-food sector, for exporters, for anyone who may be adversely affected by a no-deal Brexit. We are hoping the deal will be ratified
“Obviously we are hoping that the deal will be ratified by the House of Commons before then but if its not we are ready. We have already passed the legislation to provide for a no-deal Brexit,” he said.
The Taoiseach reiterated that the government is ready to deal with whatever may happen, but added that it won’t just be business as usual after Brexit.
“We’ve protected the common travel area and this package will be there to supports incomes, to support jobs. It is not going to be a case of everything being alright. Brexit is bad news and a no-deal Brexit would be very bad news.
“But the package of supports that we will put in place for hundreds of millions of euros and will support and protect incomes and jobs in those most exposed sectors, particularly in the agri-food sector and will also help other businesses and other exporters to be orientated away from the UK markets to other markets. And the country is in a good space to deal with this if we have to,” said Varadkar.

DUP and the deal
A question mark now hangs over the DUP and what they are minded to do next week.
Varadkar has said he believes the DUP do not want Britain to crash out of the EU.
“I had a chance actually to meet with Arlene Foster yesterday in Washington DC so I got to hear her perspective and she heard mine,” he said.
Varadkar and Foster both attended the Ireland Funds dinner on Wednesday evening in Washington. While Foster was seated on the table next to Varadkar, she was seen moving tables at the end of the evening and sitting next to the Taoiseach.
She was also present for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations at the White House, as well as the Speakers lunch on Capitol Hill.
“I certainly have the sense that the DUP would like the UK to leave the European Union with a deal, that they don’t want no deal either so at the moment they’re in discussions with the British government about how they might approach the next vote but they’re discussions that I’m not party to,” said Varadkar.
The DUP is set to resume discussions with the British government on Monday ahead of an expected third Westminster vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal next week.
It is understood that a team led by deputy leader Nigel Dodds yesterday met a range of high-ranking Tories about the withdrawal agreement, with the discussions described as “constructive”.
Varadkar has said that Ireland has always been open to an extension of Article 50, which push out the date for Brexit, but he told the media in Washington this week that an extension would have to have a “purpose”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveneytold France 24 news channelthat he also does not want to see “rolling” deadlines for Brexit.
He added that the Irish government “won’t be an obstacle” to an extension to the Brexit process, which Theresa May is expected to request next week at a meeting of EU leaders.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hpv-uptake-rate-ireland-4534859-Mar2019/,"THE HSE HAS confirmed that the uptake rate for the HPV vaccine is now at 70%, marking an increase of 20 percentage points in just over two years.
The confirmation comes as the HSE vaccination teams return to second level schools across the country to administer the second dose of the vaccine to first year girls.
Head of the HSE national immunisation office Dr Lucy Jessop said it was “extremely encouraging and important that Ireland had achieved such a marked increase in such a relatively short period of time”.
Dr Jessop said that “the World Health Organization has remarked on Ireland’s achievements and I urge all parents to ensure they get the vaccine which is safe and effective”.
“It has been well articulated in recent months that eliminating cervical cancer is now an achievable goal, nationally and internationally,” she said.
The HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) represents a family of very common viruses that are passed on during sex. Most people will get a HPV infection in their lifetime and it usually clears up by itself.

For women, ongoing HPV infections can cause abnormal changes to the lining of the cervix that, if left untreated, can lead to cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers are caused by the HPV virus.
HPV patient advocate Laura Brennan said: “I’m thrilled that people are listening – listening to the reality of what life with cervical cancer is really like and finding out for themselves that this vaccine is safe and effective and along with cervical screening, it’s the best tool that we have to help us move towards eradicating cervical cancer.”
Dr Jessop today also reiterated the importance for parents of speaking directly with the school vaccination teams, their local GPs and their local pharmacists.
“It is so important that parents access trusted sources of information and our website hpv.ie continues to be updated and continues to act as an excellent resource for everyone seeking information,” she said.
She further reminded parents that a catch up facility is available for girls still in second level school.
“Anyone who may have hesitated previously can contact our schools teams and get their daughter vaccinated,” Dr Jessop said.
A HSE media campaign begins this week to coincide with the arrival of HSE vaccination teams into secondary schools.","1.56pm, 11 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/ross-outram-paddy-lyons-murder-trial-4530483-Mar2019/,"A JURY HAS convicted a man of murdering a 90-year-old retired farmer, who was found beaten to death in his own home.
The panel of eight men and four women rejected 28-year-old Ross Outram’s claim that he repeatedly struck Paddy Lyons in “self defence” after the pensioner, who suffered from osteoporosis and only had the use of one arm, attacked him with a stick.
The trial heard that the farmer’s body was discovered slumped in his armchair at his home. Blood was smeared down his face and his penis was exposed through his underpants. Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster told the trial that Paddy Lyons suffered multiple blows to his head and neck from a blunt weapon and had fractures of his hip joint, jawbone and ribs.
Ross Outram, of Ferryland, Waterford Road, Clonmel in Co Tipperary, had pleaded not  guilty to murdering Paddy Lyons at Loughleagh, Ballysaggart, Lismore, Co Waterford, at a time unknown between February 23 and 26, 2017.
It was the State’s case that Outram had carried out “a vicious and sustained attack on a defenceless old man with a non-functioning arm” and his claim of self-defence did “not bear thinking about”.
The jury took three hours and 29 minutes to come to their unanimous verdict.
Outram told gardaí in interviews that he had “fought back” after Paddy Lyons hit him with a walking stick and shovel, and that he had taken up to 100 Xanax that day.

However, a pharmaceutical expert told the jury that there was “no proof” that Outram had taken Xanax.
Trial
The three-week trial heard medical evidence that Mr Lyons suffered a “stiffness or fusion” of his right shoulder during childbirth and could only keep it in one position.
Forensic scientist John Hoade testified that he examined a grey hoodie belonging to Outram and found blood on the right sleeve and hood which matched Paddy Lyons’ DNA profile.
Defence counsel, Michael O’Higgins SC, argued in his closing speech that Outram had acted in self-defence and that he could not be made liable for “a fall” which saw Paddy Lyons break his hip if it was unconnected to the original injuries inflicted on him by the defendant.
However, prosecution counsel John O’Kelly SC told the jury in his closing speech that it “flew in the face of all common sense” to suggest that Lyons’ hip injury could have occurred after he was subjected to the attack or could be seen as something entirely independent. “There is no evidence to show that it could have happened later or was entirely separate and independent,” he outlined.
Furthermore, Mr O’Kelly submitted that no one knew how much truth “if any” was in Outram’s version of events as he had lied consistently in his first six garda interviews.
In charging the jury, Mr Justice Paul Coffey said that in order to convict Outram of murder they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Paddy Lyons’ fall and the fracture of his hip was either directly caused by the multiple blows inflicted on him or it was reasonably foreseeable that it was a natural consequence of these blows.
If the jury found that Lyons fell on the ground or collapsed in the course of being repeatedly beaten by his attacker, the judge said they could find that causation had been established.","12.34pm, 8 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/tornado-alabama-march-2019-4522531-Mar2019/,"AT LEAST 23 people have been killed after two tornadoes swept through the US state of Alabama on Sunday.
The storms caused catastrophic damage to buildings and roads, leaving more than 20,000 homes in Alabama and neighbouring Georgia without power and a number of people missing.
Images showed trees snapped in two, debris-strewn roads and wrecked houses left in the wake of the tornadoes, estimated to be half a kilometre in width.
Authorities have warned that the death toll could rise as rescuers search through the debris.
Search operations for those still missing had to stop due to hazardous conditions on Sunday night, but a local sheriff said they were expected to resume this morning.
“Unfortunately our toll, as far as fatalities, does stand at 23 at the current time,” sheriff Jay Jones told reporters, acknowledging that children were among the dead.

“The devastation is incredible. I cannot recall at least in the last 50 years… a situation where we have had this loss of life that we experienced today.”

US President Donald Trump later expressed his condolences to those who had been affected by the tragedy.
“To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe,” he wrote on Twitter.
“Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!”
While Jones referred to a single storm, CNN reported that two tornadoes had hit Lee County in quick succession, some of “at least a dozen” it said tore through Alabama and the neighboring state of Georgia on Sunday.
The National Weather Service suggested that there were multiple twisters in the area, reporting that the first tornado was at least an EF-3 – meaning it had wind speeds of 218 to 266 kilometres per hour.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lisa-smith-dundalk-islam-liveline-4535136-Mar2019/,"A DUNDALK WOMAN who says she helped Lisa Smith convert to Islam says she was “shocked” to hear about her alleged link to the Islamic State group.
Carol Duffy, who grew up and attended the Dundalk Community Mosque with Smith, also claimed that she has “no idea” what brought her friend to Syria.
Her comments come after it emerged on Friday night that Smith is being held in northern Syria on suspicion of membership of the terrorist group.
It is understood she is currently being detained by the US armed forces based in northern Syria.
Duffy toldLiveline on RTÉ Radio 1that Smith was a “very funny, very approachable” woman, and claimed she could not believe that the former Air Corps member was in Syria when she heard the news.
“If anyone had said to me before that Lisa would do that, I’d have said ‘Lisa Smith, definitely not’,” she said.
She also revealed that Smith began attending the mosque in Dundalk around 2010, and that while the former Air Corps member hadn’t initially converted at the time, she had a keen interest in the religion.
“Lisa’s one of those people who’s interested in all sorts of different things. She hadn’t converted then; she was just looking for information,” she said.
“But she had friends who were Muslim and she knew a fair bit about the ins and outs of it, but obviously nothing in depth, and that’s why she came to us.”

However, Duffy believes that shortly after converting to Islam, her friend began to drift, saying the last thing she heard about Smith was that she had met a man and moved to Tunisia, where he was originally from.
“She seemed to be very happy there for a while…but I know she was talking to people online before she moved to Tunisia; we had conversations about it,” Duffy said.
Duffy also claimed that Smith was brainwashed by people online, and even came to attention at a mosque in Dublin because she began sharing extremist views before moving to Syria.
“She was talking to a man and a woman online and they were telling her things and she’d come back and tell us,” she said.
“She slowly started isolating herself. She moved further and further away.”
She added that she was conflicted by news that Smith was now being detained with her child in Syria, saying that she did not know what should happen to her friend.
Duffy said that while she was “adamant” that anyone who was involved with Islamic State should be punished, she believed the Smith she knew would not physically hurt anyone.
“I don’t believe she ever lifted a gun, I don’t believe she killed anyone. I don’t even believe she was sympathising with them,” she said.
“I think she was looking for something idealised and it didn’t work out that way and I think she got duped.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/blackmailed-garda-nudes-4488095-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ IN DUBLIN are investigating after a woman claims she was blackmailed by a man she once dated who managed to access intimate photographs and threatened to share them.
The woman, who is in her mid 20s, went to a garda station in north Dublin and alleges that she told officers that a man had sent her a private message to her Instagram account which brought her to a caché of her own photographs.
These included what she described as “nudes” she had sent her boyfriend previously. But there were also photographs which she believed she was the only person to have access to in the collection.
The woman went to the garda station late last month and explained to the desk sergeant that she wished to make an official report in relation to the matter but no formal statement was taken.
A few days later, the woman returned to the same garda station and asked to speak with a female officer and spoke at length about what she had experienced. It is understood an official statement of complaint was also not given at this time.
The alleged victim said that the man insisted on being paid €500 or he would publish the images online. She had evidence of the blackmail including messages to and from the man, as well as an online account used to deposit the money.

The man did not reveal his identity to her but she eventually learned that she had met him once – months before the Instagram message – and they have a number of mutual friends.
It is still unclear how he came to be in possession of the private images.
Currently, the only law protecting against the distribution of these images without permission is contained in the Non Fatal Offences Against The Person Act. There is a subsection of this act which deals with harassment. However, there are no specific laws in place to guard against this type of online incident.
Last year, Labour leader Brendan Howlin said that Ireland is lagging when it comes to dealing with the issue of ‘revenge porn’.
The Wexford TD said Irish laws covering so-called revenge porn – the posting of sexually explicit images of a person online without their consent, generally by a former partner or date – are not adequate, which is why his party is bringing forward its own Bill to tackle the issue.
The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill would provide for a six-month prison sentence upon conviction. It is still before the Oireachtas.
The Garda Press Office confirmed officers are investigating the claims.

https://www.thejournal.ie/disability-centre-issues-4534352-Mar2019/,"HIQA HAS SAID that further improvements are needed in care centres for people with disabilities in Dublin operated by a single provider which were found to have serious compliance issues in the past.
Hiqa today published an overview of the inspection and monitoring activity of eight care centres run by Stewarts Care Limited in Dublin.
Previous inspection reports into the care provider found serious areas of non-compliance in the health, safety and quality of life of 160 residents across eight different centres in Palmerstown.
These included issues around fire safety, cases of allegations or suspicions of abuse,and one case where a resident classed as “malnourished”had not been seen by a dietician since October 2014.
Inspectors found a resident who was identified as experienced unexplained weight loss and had lost 10 kilogrammes in a 14-month period.
Major issues of non-compliance were also found in medication management, and governance at the centre.
Earlier reports foundissues of potential abuse, including peer-to-peer physical abuse, unexplained bruising and unexplained injuries to residents, among other issues.
Reports
A total of 16 announced and unannounced inspections were carried out by Hiqa between May 2017 and July 2018 in eight designated centres operated by Stewarts Care.
Inspectors found overall that a poor quality of service was being delivered to the 160 residents of the centres, and that Stewarts Care was failing to make adequate improvements.
In particular, high levels of non-compliance were found in areas relating to:

Following initial inspections of six centres, Hiqa issued legal notices proposing to cancel the registration of the centres over the course of the summer in 2017.
Stewarts Care responded with an outline of its plan to improve the quality of life for residents and to bring the centres into compliance with the regulations.
However, a follow up inspection in December 2017 found that while there had been some improvements, the centres still weren’t meeting regulations and that this failure “continued to adversely impact on the safety and wellbeing of residents”.
Officials from Stewarts Care were asked to attend a meeting with Hiqa in January of last year.
At the meeting, Stewarts Care acknowledged that all residents at its centres were not receiving the quality and safety of service to which they were entitled.
Stewarts Care then laid out it plans to improve its services. Under the improvement plans, it was required that Stewarts Care provide Hiqa with monthly updates; that monthly meetings be held with inspectors; and that announced and unannounced inspections be carried out.
Hiqa has found that to date improvements have been made in the safety and quality of life of many residents.
However, Hiqa found in its overall report that these improvements were not consistent in all centres and that further action was needed.
Stewarts Care is a voluntary-run organisation providing community based services to people with an intellectual disability.
In a statement following the publications of the Hiqa report, a spokesperson for Stewarts said that the board had applied to to Hiqa for the registration of its newly reconfigured Designated Centres in Palmerstown.
“Stewarts has always been committed to providing a high standard of care and support to persons with an intellectual disability,” the spokesperson said.
“The conditions described in those reports were not acceptable and the governance and management systems which pertained at the outset of this period (pre-2107) were not capable of addressing the shortcomings.
Although the scale and complexity of services means that change can be difficult, and slow, the board accepted fully its responsibility to resolve the issues of non-compliance highlighted by Hiqa’s work.

The inspector noted: “Around the taps of all wash hand basins were filthy with a build up of dirt. The seals of all fridges and freezers were extremely dirty along with the shelving and/ans in some of the fridges.
“The pest control bait boxes were in a filthy condition especially underneath the double sink and in particular behind the chicken machine. Grease was dripping onto the bait boxes on the floor and one was submerged in oil behind the chicken machine. The floor in the press where the hot tank was located was dirty and mouse droppings were observed.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/defence-forces-lebanon-4548790-Mar2019/,"IRISH DEFENCE FORCES members have been honoured for their peacekeeping roles in south Lebanon at a special medal ceremony.
In all, 147 members of the 113th infantry battalion were recognised for their service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil).
To reflect the sizeable Galwegian contingent among the personnel stationed there, one of the main areas in the Unifil camp was renamed Connemara Square following the medal parade.
The Unifil mission was set up in 1978, following the invasion of Lebanon by Israel. Since 2000, following the Israeli withdrawal, Unifil has continued to operate in the region.
Irish personnel stationed there, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Caimin Keogh, patrol, monitor and report on developments in the area.

They also correct violations of the so-called Blue Line – the border demarcation with Israel – and prevent the escalation of incidents.
There are 458 Irish personnel attached to Unifil, and a decision was made to increase its contribution by 106 troops last November.
Speaking at the ceremony, Minister with responsibility for defence Paul Kehoe said there was an affinity between the Irish Defence Forces stationed there and the local community.
“As Minister, I want to dedicate a huge word of gratitude to the local community, whose representatives are here,” Kehoe said. “Your support for the Irish Defence Forces over the last 40 years cannot be understated. You not only allowed us in, but you welcomed us with open arms.”

The minister added that he was aware of the sacrifices the troops made, given they were unable to celebrate St Patrick’s Day at home with their families.
“I am very mindful of the great sacrifices you make here in Lebanon,” he said. “I understand how much you all miss your homes, your families and your loved ones. I know the dangers you face and the hardships you endure as part of your mission.”
He added that the government is proud of them.

In recent weeks, Dublin council workers have been protected by officers as they built a plinth wall in the area. Garda assistance was sought by the council to make sure the construction work went smoothly.
Staff have received physical threats against them in recent months.
Locals are not satisfied that gardaí are on hand to protect workers but have not dealt with the ever-present drug problem in the vicinity.
One local toldTheJournal.iethat garda cars can be seen from 6am around the area, either protecting workers or monitoring what the local described as “free-for-all drug dealing”.
Drug dealing has always been a problem in the area, but one woman who contactedTheJournal.iedetailed how the level of dealing has escalated to such an extent that she won’t let her children out the front door due to her fear they could become involved in criminality.
Speaking under condition of anonymity, the woman said: “I’ve seen too many go along and become dealers.”

She said that Sheriff Street has great people living there and that it is the actions of a handful of people who are giving the area a bad name.
She added: “They start at half six in the morning while the street cleaners are going by. There are people hanging around already at the time looking for crack. It’s just everywhere now.”
Sheriff Street and its surroundings have borne the brunt of a lot of criminal activity in the past 20 years.
It was whereinnocent Martin O’Rourke was shot deadin a case of mistaken identity during the Hutch/Kinahan feud. Guns and drugs have been seized onnumerous occasions in the last two years.
One local dealer gardaí are monitoring has been accused of involvement in the Kinahan/Hutch feud. He has at least 40 convictions including one for possession of a firearm.
Security sources toldTheJournal.iethat he is openly dealing around the Sheriff Street and Spencer Dock areas of the capital.
Dublin City Council confirmed that council workers received protection from gardaí recently.
A spokeswoman said: “I have been advised to tell you that Dublin City Council were erecting a plinth wall and gates at this location.
“The plinth wall was shuttered and erected with a concrete pour and the assistance of the Gardaí was sought to ensure the concrete wall had time to set correctly.”

Teresa Jordan is challenging a decision of the Court of Appeal that a bereaved next of kin can only bring a claim for damages arising from the State’s failure to hold an inquest promptly, after the inquest has been concluded.
Jordan’s solicitor, Fearghal Shiels of Madden & Finucane, said that allowing the appeal had vindicated Teresa’s decision.
“This judgment now gives those families an opportunity to access the courts and enforce their rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in the domestic courts without recourse to Strasbourg.”
In 2001, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the UK for rights violations in connection with the killings of 14 people in Northern Ireland by British security forces between 1982 and 1992. This included the death of Pearse Jordan.

THE WAVE OF protein bars and ‘healthy’ snacks muscling their way into primary retail space shows no sign of abating – and retailers are reaping the extra gains of heeding to the desires of calorie-counting consumers.
Earlier this week, retail giant Musgrave announced a €30 million investment in three new SuperValu stores that will showcase what managing director Martin Kelleher calls “shopping concepts” like salad bars and “health and wellness aisles”.
Announcing the rollout, Kelleher said the new store layouts will add “both theatre and on trend ranges for the new shopper’s evolving tastes”.
But it’s not just the giants that are taking a punt on health kicks.
Supermarket chain Fresh – which operates five outlets in Dublin city – underwent a merchandising makeover about three years ago when it shifted away from traditional confectionery and towards healthier snacks.
“Brands such as Quest and Nutramino would have come into the market, and we would have implemented them into our impulse sections fairly quickly,” says Shane Byrne, head of marketing and sales at Fresh.
The chain still stocks standard bars, but Byrne says they’re positioned in less prominent spaces and the range isn’t as large as it was several years ago.
Protein bars and snacks – which often retail at almost twice the price of ordinary sweets – share the same impulse space as crisps and chocolate by the checkout, but they are currently winning a bigger slice of promotional spend.
“The standard traditional items would still have quite a high revenue base, but the alternative protein and vegan snacks are growing significantly,” says Byrne.

Demand versus re-brand
Sugary foods in general account for a smaller proportion of the average punter’s grocery basket than five years ago, according to Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at consumer knowledge agency Kantar Worldpanel.
“Consumer perceptions and behaviours are changing substantially when it comes to sugar,” he tellsFora, which is what’s driving the wave of protein bars across sweet counters.
Faughnan believes intense media scrutiny of the health implications of sugary foods is a key driving factor behind the sea change:
Shane Byrne says Fresh has simply witnessed a change in its consumer base and “when we see that in any department or any category we adapt and try to innovate”.

“People are looking more and more into what’s in food, and how they can get the best quality out of a snack that’s impulsive,” he says.
For example, the spike in interest in vegan snack foods is also “a big thing” for Fresh.
Different bars, same shoppers
But as consumers re-write their shopping list to reduce the amount of sugar they purchase as part of their overall grocery spend, big brands have begun to reformulate existing recipes and launch ‘healthier’ variants of what is generally considered indulgent or unhealthy categories.
For example, Mars, Snickers and Boost bars have been re-imagined as high-protein, low-sugar options.
“It’s an obvious attempt from the big food and drink players to try and adapt to meet the changing demand from consumers for healthier products,” Faughnan says, adding that many people who purchase ‘healthier’ offerings still buy junk food.
“There are very few people that exclusively buy only the healthier variants,” he says.
“It’s definitely going to continue to grow, but the shoppers that will drive the growth are the ones that are already buying into the existing (confectionery) category.”
But the emerging category has still provided an opportunity for smaller outfits to get their product into bigger stores.
For example Rathcoole-based Absolute Nutrition – which makes a variety of vegan, refined-sugar free and gluten-free snacks – has managed to flog its wares in several supermarket chains, including SuperValu, Fresh and Avoca.
Founder Jo Davey tellsForathat after attending a local gym stocked with bars and muffins, she saw a gap in the market for something without refined sugar but that “people would actually like the taste of as well”.
The biggest focus for small players like Absolute Nutrition, Davey says, is standing out from the competition – which is why the brand has chased another key market.
“A lot of people bring out new bars and things like this, and they’re trying to compete with everybody else. But it looks the same … it has the same kind of packaging, the same colour.
“From the outset we’ve tried to position ourselves a little differently, from our packaging and where we’re positioned in supermarkets. We’re in fresh food grab-and-go fridges; we’re a lunch add on.”

https://www.the42.ie/ireland-rory-best-retiring-world-cup-4532210-Mar2019/,"IRELAND CAPTAIN RORY Best has officially indicated that he is planning to retire from playing rugby after this year’s World Cup.
While the 36-year-old says he hasn’t 100% finalised his decision, he gave the strongest public indication yet that he will hang up his boots after the global tournament in Japan.

Best, who is set for his final home Six Nations game for Ireland tomorrow against France, will hope to finish in style by leading Ireland to their best-ever World Cup performance.
“I think it’s fairly certain that the World Cup will be the end for me,” said Best today after Ireland’s captain’s run at the Aviva Stadium.
“I think that I feel really good, I don’t feel I’m playing any worse, I’m really enjoying rugby. I haven’t 100% made the decision but I’m fairly sure it will be, and part of the reason I’m enjoying rugby so much and I hope playing well is because there’s that weight lifted off.
“When you’re playing, you start to get fixated with what’s coming, or if you’re playing well in this Six Nations, can you put yourself in the window for the World Cup.
“And if you play well in the World Cup there’s two more Six Nations and you’re in the window to the Lions tour, and you start to get bogged down with things that don’t really matter.
“I’m feeling very relaxed now that the body feels that it’s happy to go on and at the minute, mentally, I’m really enjoying the rugby.

“But I’m in a really lucky position at the minute that the way I’m feeling, I can go to the World Cup and be at the top of my game. And for me, the way I’m thinking at the minute, that will be a really good time for me.
“And plus Joe said he didn’t want me to keep going without him!”
Best, who has won 115 caps for Ireland so far, will lead the side out tomorrow at the Aviva Stadium for the final time in the Six Nations.
While the Ulsterman is focused on the collective performance, he admits he has had some thoughts about the occasion.

“I suppose in the early part of my career, I thought that every home game was going to be my last home Six Nations game!” said Best.
“It’s something I haven’t really given a whole lot of thought to, but it has been in the back of my mind that this will be my last home Six Nations game.
“With the World Cup coming up and having aspirations to play there, you hope that my last game for Ireland isn’t going to be until the very start of November.
“Now that we’re upon this, the captain’s run, being out there with the sun shining for the first time this week, it just reminded me how special this championship has been, for me personally, but also to be able to do captain’s runs, play out there, pull on that jersey in the Six Nations.
“It’s been incredibly special for me and it’s very hard to believe that in just over 24 hours, you’ll potentially not get that opportunity again to play in a Six Nations here.
“It’s a little bit sad but you also have to understand how incredibly lucky and special it’s been, and how lucky I’ve been to play for Ireland in so many Six Nations games.

“Whenever the game finishes and I get a little bit of time to reflect on it, it will be [special]. For me and my career, it’s always been about making sure that we do everything we can as a team to make sure we can perform.
“Especially with this group, when we perform, we win games by and large, and I think if I make it into something other than that, I’m not doing a service to how I feel rugby should be played in the team environment, but also my duty as a captain.”
And will there be a swarm of post-match photographs, as when other players have had their last big outing for Ireland in Dublin?
“I don’t think there will be too many kids in the crowd or too many kids who need to see that,” said Best. “It would be like a scene out of Shrek, maybe leave that one off!”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-english-out-sign-4547437-Mar2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has criticised Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald for posing beside an anti-English banner at the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York.
Sinn Féin yesterday shared images of McDonald standing beside a number of banners at the parade, including one which read: ‘England Get Out Of Ireland’.
The banner, or a variation of it, has been theonly political bannerallowed in the parade for decades.
Coveney was not impressed, this morning tweeting that the gesture was “offensive, divisive and an embarrassment”.
“Grow up, this is NOT Ireland in 2019! We are better than this!,” he wrote.

The DUP also took offence to the image, saying it sums up Sinn Féin’s “attitude to explanations, truth and respect”.
Derry MP Gregory Campbell said: “When slogans such as “Brits out” or “England out of Ireland” are used the unionist community are well within their rights to see themselves as the intended focus.
“The ‘British presence in Ireland’ is the unionist population in Northern Ireland.”
In response, a spokesperson for Sinn Féin toldTheJournal.ie: “The most divisive and offensive act on this island for almost the last 100 years has been the partition of Ireland.
“However if Simon Coveney and the government is serious about achieving a new and agreed united Ireland then he should immediately convene an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity.”
The party has recently stepped up calls for a border poll as Brexit negotiations continue, noting the negative impacts Britain leaving the European Union could have in Northern Ireland.
Opinion polls have shown that the majority of people in the Republicwant a border pollin the event of a no-deal Brexit, and thatsix in 10 peoplewant to see a united Ireland in their lifetime.
However, others fear holding a poll in the near future would only intensify divisions in Northern Ireland, which has been without a devolved government since January 2017.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dub-cabinet-brexit-4545062-Mar2019/,"THE DUP HAS held talks with the British government about Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which is due for another House of Commons vote next week.
“We have had a long series of discussions with Cabinet ministers,” DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said to reporters this afternoon. “We have had a constructive dialogue.”
He said that the key problem remains the Irish backstop, which he said would “separate Northern Ireland from UK while we’re in the backstop”.
“Our focus has always been how can we ensure that Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK together as one country.”
Chancellor Philip Hammond joined the British government’s talks with the DUP earlier, fuelling suggestions that Northern Ireland could be offered more money in an attempt to win the DUP’s support for Theresa May’s deal in what would be the third ‘Meaningful Vote’.

Responding to a question fromSky News, Dodds said: “The Chancellor is a key member of the government, and also responsible for HM Revenue and Customs, which is a key concern for us… that’s an area we have discussed.”
Speaking to the Guardian, Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg said that he would support Theresa May’s deal if the DUP agreed to vote for it.
I am a unionist, but I’m not more unionist than the Democratic Unionist Party, he said.
There are just two weeks left before Brexit happens on 29 March; yesterday, MPs voted to postpone that date by at least three months. This is on condition that her deal is passed by the UK parliament next week.
In the event that it is passed, Theresa May would then ask the EU for a three-month extension, which needs the unanimous support of the 27 EU leaders.
The European Council is to meet next week, on Thursday 21 and Friday 22 March.

https://www.the42.ie/edinburgh-leinster-pro-14-4556839-Mar2019/,"Lewis Stuart reports from BT Murrayfield
DESPERATION DOES FUNNY things, Edinburgh, caught in a fierce scrap to try to qualify for the Guinness PRO14 playoffs, had it; Leinster, who are already guaranteed a home semi final did not.
The result was that the Scots went full-metal jacket with all the international selections they could manage and their experience was too much for a young, experimental Leinster team.
The game had started just about perfectly for the Irish province with almost five minutes of non-stop action from the kick off ending in a penalty under the hosts posts with Cieran Frawley, the fly half, slotting the points.
Advertisement
It was soon even better when a series of penalties put them on the Scottish line and, with home lock Fraser McKenzie in the sin bin, they drove the line out for Sean Cronin, the hooker, to break off the back and find a huge gap to go over.
That was as good as it for for the Leinster youngsters, though. The Edinburgh experience started to take its toll, the breakthrough coming when they got a line out drive going, settled down for a series of picks-and-drives until eventually prop WP Nel found enough of a hole fo barge his way over the line.
That gave the home side all the encouragement they needed to turn to their formidable pack, who started to turn on the power and Leinster struggled to cope, conceding a penalty try when they dropped a scrum and they into the break trailing despite claiming another penalty from Frawley.
The second half was even more one-sided with Edinburgh turning the screw up front and reaping the reward when Ross Ford, their hooker, was at the back of yet another line out drive with Dan Leavy, the flanker, in the sin bin.
More forward pressure, more pick and drives – nobody has ever accused Edinburgh of over-imagination or turning down a successful ploy – and this time it was Vilame Mata, the Fijian No8, who found the space to go over.
There was some encouragement for Leinster when they mounted a spirited last-ditch attack in the final minutes to try to rescue some pride only to be denied by the television replays in the last move of the game.

https://www.the42.ie/lynne-cantwell-ireland-rugby-sport-ireland-gig-4528962-Mar2019/,"MANY WILL REMEMBER the highs of Lynne Cantwell’s Irish rugby career.
The 2013 Grand Slam, beating the Black Ferns and becoming the first-ever Ireland team to beat a New Zealand side at the 2014 World Cup, finishing fourth there. From her debut in 2001 to her farewell in 2014, the legendary 13 donned the green jersey with distinction.

There was much more to that than meets the eye though for Cantwell herself.
“Things weren’t ok for those 13 years,” she reminded the audience as she was unveiled in her new role as chair of Sport Ireland’s Women in Sport steering committee yesterday.
“There were lots and lots of locked doors, we felt suffocated by constant resistance and lots of decicions [were made] on our behalf as a women’s team that were not ok.”
She hopes that in five years’ time, we’re not talking about resistances and barriers. That we’re not talking about Women in Sport. That we’re talking aboutPeople in Sport.
Cantwell recognises that not every sports person has barriers. That was her experience back then, but it’s on to bigger and better now.
“Definitely some of them were not how they should have been. I think if we were in a different time, they’d be exposed to being not ok. They’re not ok when other teams, just of different gender, are not being treated that way.”
There have been improvements across the board thankfully, she smiles. There’s more transparency, and people are tackling mindsets. There’s a culture shift underway.
Driving that on is top of the job spec of her new role,as she implements Sport Ireland’s first Women in Sport policy.
A Performance Support Director, mother to 16-month-old baby Scarlet — and loving motherhood — and rugby pundit among much, much more; Cantwell is a busy woman.

Her new role was one she jumped at how and ever, her passion and belief in the policy, and enthusiasm with her committee shining through with every word.
“It’s exciting and it’s so worthwhile,” she smiles. “If you’ve been campaigning for this type of thing along with other Irish sportspeople and women for so many years… if you get an opportunity to be able to back it and push it forward at a strategic level, you’re going to bite the hand off.
Chair of Sport Ireland's new Women in Sport committee Cantwell at yesterday's launch.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
“The steering committee is so, so strong. The policy is really strong. There are some great guys in Sport Ireland behind it as well. It’s in a really, really good place to make a big impact. We want to make sure that’s done.”
It’s fairly easy when you’re so passionate about it, so?
“It takes so little for somebody to be inspired and go in a direction. If I think of who are my role models as a kid: Sonia O’Sullivan, Susan Smith, Mary Robinson. Those people that you see as a kid, you go, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s only now as I’m older, I realise, ‘Jesus Christ, Mary Robinson was out of this world amazing.’ That was 30 years ago.
She’s visable on television screens across the length and breadth of the country anyway, sharing her knowledge and expertise on the women’s — and men’s — rugby beat with RTÉ.
Cantwell is evidently enjoying her duties on that front and while it might be difficult to share more critical opinions of players from time to time considering she’s still involved in those circles, that doesn’t bother her too much.
“I’m very happy to continue to contribute once you’ve got expertise. I think it’s important on the line of visability for anybody new to a sport when they tune in, they want to see people of knowledge that are delivering the content. From that point of view, I have that and I’m very, very happy to contribute.
Since the pretty disastrous home Rugby World Cup in 2016 and the controversy and backlash that followed, and even since last year’s Six Nations, there have been improvements this year.
In Six Nations action in 2014.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
But there’s still a long, long way to go for Adam Griggs’ side.
“There’s so much change to the team from year to year, every year,” she nods, agreeing that there have been improvements.
“We’re on a little bit of a hamster wheel at the moment.”

The time to exit that is nearing thought, she feels.
But to the present first. France on Saturday evening at Donnybrook.
After a heavy opening round defeat to England, bouncing back to beat Scotland across the water, but losing out to Italy in Rome, a massive challenge awaits.
“Fingers crossed for the weather, ‘France don’t travel well’, all of those clichés; you never know what’s going to happen.”
You do never know.
Little did Lynne Cantwell know she’d be in this new role, with a world of opportunity at her feet.
Sport Ireland yesterday launched a new Women in Sport Policy which aims to achieve equal participation between males and females in sport. Coaching and Officiating, Active Participation, Leadership and Governance and Visibility are the four key target areas that will be addressed by Sport Ireland’s new Women in Sport Policy.

A CHICAGO JURY has indicted American actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime.
Police say Smollett – who gained fame on Fox musical drama “Empire” – staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.
Instead, the 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show’s current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.
Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.
He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police he had been attacked when he knew “there was no reasonable ground for believing” that such crimes had occurred.
Smollett has denied the allegations against him and in a statement to the media, his attorney Mark Geragos criticised the charges as “prosecutorial overkill”.
“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos said.
The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.
When asked about the indictment, a Fox spokesman declined to comment.
Smollett was released on bond in February. He is next due back in court on 14 March.

THE UK’S NORTHERN Irish Secretary Karen Bradley has been faced with calls to resign, after remarks she made yesterday regarding killings in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.
She told the House of Commons that the deaths in Northern Ireland “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
Political parties and victims’ families were angered by the claim, and it prompted Tánaiste Simon Coveney to seek clarification from Bradley in a meeting last night.
On her part, Bradley later said her comments did not refer to any specific case, and was more of a “general view”.
But is that true to say that the cases of British soldiers and police who killed people during the Troubles were “not crimes”? Let’s take a look.
This arose in the House of Commons yesterday, when DUP MP for Belfast South Emma Little-Pengelly took the floor.
She said that “well over 90%” of murders and injuries during the Troubles were as a result by acts of terrorism.
She asked Bradley when mechanisms would be put in place to investigate these cases where people were shot dead by armed groups during the Troubles.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Bradley replied: “The honourable lady sets out the figures very powerfully. Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists. Every single one of those was a crime.
Reaction to these comments outside of Westminster was swift, with Bradley coming in for heavy criticism from the SDLP and Sinn Féin.
Roughly an hour later, she stood up again in the House of Commons and said she wanted to clarify her comments as she believed they could be “open to misinterpretation”.

Bradley said: “At oral questions, I referred to deaths during the Troubles caused by members of the security forces. The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, integrity and within the law.
Speaking to the Press Association last night, Bradley was asked if she wished to apologise for what she said in the House of Commons and she stopped short of doing so, and has not retracted the comments.
TheJournal.iehas contacted Bradley’s office asking for clarification on her statement made yesterday. She did not respond to the request for this FactCheck.
The Northern Ireland Secretary’s statements provoked uproar from victims’ families and nationalist political parties in the North.
The SDLP and Sinn Féin called for her to resign. John Teggart – whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings – told the BBC what she said was “insulting, despicable to families” and an “absolute disgrace”.
Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill also criticised Bradley for refusing to retract her statement and said it should be “withdrawn immediately”.
In Ireland, Bradley’s comments were also condemned, with Fianna Fáil’s Brendan Smith describing them as “ignorant and hurtful”, while Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he’d be seeking a clarification from her over what was said.
There are varying figures for how many people died as a direct result of the conflict, but it is generally accepted that well in excess of 3,000 people died during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, an armed conflict that lasted around 30 years.
According to the commonly cited Sutton Index of Deaths, there were 3,532 deaths related to the Troubles between 1969 and 2001.It is derived from Malcolm Sutton’s book Bear in Mind These Dead, and the online index remains a project of Ulster University.
Extending that time period, the Commission for Victims and Survivors for Northern Irelanduses a figureof 3,720 conflict-related deaths between 1966 and 2006. This commission was established by the British government in the North to promote awareness of the interests of victims and survivors of the conflict.
The Sutton index says that in the case of 363 people who were killed, British security services – encompassing police and army – were responsible.
This figuredoescorrespond to around 10% of the deaths caused during the Troubles being caused by British soldiers and police, as cited by Bradley in the House of Commons.
In the case of many of those killed during the Troubles, those responsible were never brought to justice.
Roughly one-third of killings during this period are the subject of PSNI legacy investigations. This applies to cases where republican groups, loyalist groups and security services were believed to be responsible for the killings, but no one was ever convicted.
Under the Good Friday Agreement, loyalists and republicans convicted of crimes were set free, but many of the killings at the time remain unsolved to this day.

According to figures obtained by the BBC last year, the PSNI had 1,188 killings listed as legacy investigations. This included 530 attributed to republicans, 271 to loyalists and 354 attributed to security forces.
Various inquests have returned verdicts of unlawful killings and, in recent years, the PSNI in the North has reopened investigations into a number of cases.
Furthermore, there are a number of cases where police investigating the deaths are considering, or have already brought, charges against former soldiers and are trying them for crimes such as murder.
This includes the case of Bloody Sunday, where British soldiers opened fire on unarmed Catholic civil rights protesters in Derry in 1972, killing 13 – with another person dying some months later in hospital.
The Saville Report – which took 12 years to compile and was eventually published in 2010 - noted that the actions of British soldiers were “unjustifiable”, and that they had “lost control”.
In a stark contrast in tone from Bradley’s comments yesterday, then-Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons he was “deeply sorry” and apologised for Bloody Sunday on behalf of the British government.
“There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities,” he said. “What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.”
Recent media reports have indicated thatfour ex-British soldierscould be charged with the 1972 shooting of unarmed marchers in Derry.
Legacy investigations by the PSNI also include the case of former British soldier Dennis Hutchings,who faces trialfor attempted murder in connection with the fatal shooting of John Pat Cunningham in Tyrone in 1974.
The inquest into the 1971 Ballymurphy massacre which resulted in the deaths of 11 people also remains under way at the moment, with families dissatisfied at the original investigation’s findings.
Currently, individual cases like Bloody Sunday are being investigated by the PSNI. Larger scale, sweeping investigations would be possible under the landmark Stormont House Agreement which was agreed in 2014 and would have set up anhistorical investigations unit.
However, with the Northern Assembly inactive for the past two years, politicians are no closer to enacting this agreement. In the meantime, the PSNI continues to conduct a number of probes into killings and atrocities committed by state forces and armed groups during the Troubles.
As well as investigations currently under way into crimes allegedly committed by members of British security services, there have already been cases where soldiers have been convicted over killings during the Troubles.
In 1992, 18-year-old Peter McBride was unarmed when he was shot and killed by two British soldiers.
Two Scots guardsmen – Mark Wright and James Fisher –were convicted of murderthree years later and sentenced to life in prison. They were released in 1998, and were allowed to rejoin the British army, provoking the fury of McBride’s family and the nationalist community.
In 1972, Catholics Michael Naan and Andrew Murraywere killed by British soldiers at a farm in Fermanagh. In 1981, Sergeants Stanley Hathaway and John Byrne were jailed for their murders and sentenced to life in prison. Two other soldiers pleaded guilty to lesser roles in the killings.
In 1990, 18-year-old Karen O’Reilly and 17-year-old Martin Peake were shot after British soldiers fired on a car they were travelling in at a checkpoint in west Belfast.
In another very high-profile case at the time, Sergeant Lee Clegg was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the killings. His conviction was later quashed in 1998, and he was cleared of the murder at a subsequent re-trial. He continued to serve with British armed forces.
To recap, Bradley told the House of Commons that the cases where people died at the hands of the police or army during the Troubles were “not crimes”.
“They were people acting under orders and instructions, fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way,” she said.
The Northern Ireland Secretary later said that she was “not referring to any specific cases, but expressing a general view”. Speaking to the Press Association last night, she said she “never intend[ed] to cause any offence”.
However, as highlighted above, there are a number of instances where British soldiers were convicted of murder in relation to people killed during the Troubles.
In British courts, it has been found that British soldiers did commit crimes – in some of the cases cited above, they were convicted in relation to killings during the Troubles.
It must be noted that of the 363 deaths attributed to British soldiers and police during the Troubles, only a very small number has so far resulted in a prosecution which found that a soldier had committed a crime. Nonetheless, it is incorrect to categorise all of the killings that British security services are responsible for during the Troubles as “not crimes”.
Furthermore, a number of investigations are under way into killings committed by various parties – including British soldiers – during the Troubles. In future, it is conceivable that more British soldiers could face trial accused of committing crimes in relation to killings in Northern Ireland.
Bradley said deaths caused by British soldiers during the Troubles were not crimes. However, a number of British soldiers have been convicted in British courts of murder.
As a result, we rate this claim:FALSE
As per our verdict guide, this means the claim is inaccurate.
UPDATE:This afternoon, Karen Bradley released a new statement related to her comments yesterday.
She said: “Yesterday I made comments regarding the actions of soldiers during the Troubles. I want to apologise. I am profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt that my words have caused. The language was wrong and even though this was not my intention, it was deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-trump-st-patricks-day-visit-4535573-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR is to travel to the United States this week to celebrate St Patrick’s Day in Washington DC and Chicago.
Yesterday, the Taoiseach wasforced to delay his travel plansafter moves were afoot with Brexit. However, it is understood that his plans had always been flexible and he will be heading to the States today.
As is tradition, Varadkar will meet with US President Donald Trump, with their meeting due to be held in the White House Oval Office on Thursday.
On that day, the Taoiseach will first be hosted for breakfast by Vice President Mike Pence.
Controversy surrounded this meeting last year, after the media were shut out from the meeting, which is usually open to the press.
It is not yet clear what the arrangements will be this year, or whether Varadkar’s partner Matt Barrett will attend. Last year, Pence told the Taoiseach that both he and Barrett, would be welcome in Pence’s home if he decides to attend this year.
After breakfast, Varadkar will attend the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, and meet with senior members of Congress.
The bowl of shamrock
That evening, the Taoiseach will join Trump and his wife Melania, for the traditional Shamrock Ceremony at the White House, in advance of attending the Ambassador’s St Patrick’s Day Reception.
In his meetings he will also emphasise the strength of Irish-US relations, and will recall the important role of the US in supporting peace and the Good Friday Agreement, and outline Ireland’s position on Brexit.
He will also press the case for resolving the situation facing the undocumented Irish in America.

The Taoiseach has said this year’s visit is an opportunity to deepen Ireland’s strong bilateral relations with the US, and to build even stronger transatlantic relations between the US and the EU.
During his stay in Washington, Varadkar will also focus on economic links, with a series of meetings to promote trade and investment between the US and Ireland.
The Taoiseach will also meet representatives of Irish companies successfully expanding their operations in the US.
Irish businesses
He will also meet the US Chamber of Commerce and IDA client companies, highlighting Ireland’s strengths as a location for international business and investment.
Varadkar will also attend the annual Ireland Funds Gala Dinner, and visit the exhibition ‘Blazing a Trail: Irish Women in America’.
After four days in Washington DC, the Taoiseach will travel to Chicago. He is due to meet with a number of emigrant support groups that receive Irish Government funding, and will attend a St Patrick’s Day dinner hosted by the Irish Fellowship Club of Chicago.
On Saturday, the Taoiseach will march in the Chicago St Patrick’s Day Parade, before concluding his programme by marking the launch of Tourism Ireland’s new book, ‘Ireland’s Greening of the World’, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Global Greening Initiative.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, who is staying in Europe due to the unpredictability of Brexit, said yesterday that the traditional pilgrimage by ministers abroad for St Patrick’s Day is somewhat different this year due to Brexit.
He said St Patrick’s Day is a really important time of year for the Irish government to get their message across abroad, however, he said this year they have ensured that “key decision-makers” are where they need to be in order to deal with any Brexit-related decision or fallout.

https://www.thejournal.ie/christchurch-shootings-suspect-4543985-Mar2019/,"THE MAN WHO is alleged to have been involved in the fatal attacks on mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch has been named as Brenton Tarrant.
At least 49 people were killedin today’s attack at the Masjid Al Noor and Linwood mosques in the city, with many more injured.
Police have arrested and charged a man with murder in relation to the attacks.
Tarrant, an Australian citizen is in his late-20s, identified himself online prior to the attack, before allegedly livestreaming himself carrying it out on Facebook.
He was not on any watchlists for suspected terrorist activity, authorities have said.

At a press conference, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the attacker at the Masjid al Noor mosque was an Australian.
“We stand here and condemn, absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist,” Morrison said.
Social media accounts bearing Tarrant’s name had posted a number of photos of guns prior to today’s attacks.
On a Twitter page with the same name and profile photo as the Facebook page, Tarrant shared a manifesto detailing his motivations for the attack.
In this manifesto, he declared hatred for Muslim immigrants in Europe and expressed admiration for extremist movements in the US.
He also identified himself as an Australia-born, 28-year-old white male from a low-income, working-class family in the manifesto.
The video of the attack – although widely shared – was taken down by Facebook and Youtube, and police asked people not to share it.

“Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” New Zealand police said in a Twitter post.
“We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.”
Although police declined to formally identify Tarrant, they did say a man in his 20s is due to appear in court charged with murder tomorrow.

https://www.thejournal.ie/japan-worlds-oldest-4532144-Mar2019/,"
A 116-YEAR-OLD Japanese woman who still enjoys studying maths and playing board games has been recognised as the world’s oldest person, the Guinness World Records said today.
Kane Tanaka was born on 2 January 1903, the year when the Wright brothers launched humanity’s first powered flight, according to Guinness.
Tanaka’s recognition was celebrated at the nursing home where she lives in western Japan’s Fukuoka by city mayor Soichiro Takashima and other well-wishers.
Asked what moment she was the most happy in life, she replied: “Now.”
She married Hideo Tanaka in 1922, giving birth to four children and adopting a fifth.

Kane normally wakes each morning at 6am and passes the afternoons by studying mathematics and practicing calligraphy.
“One of Kane’s favourite pastimes is a game of Othello and she’s become an expert at the classic board game, often beating rest-home staff,” Guinness said.
Japan has one of the world’s highest life expectancies and has been home to several people recognised as among the oldest humans to have ever lived.
They include Jiroemon Kimura, the longest-living man on record, who died soon after his 116th birthday in June 2013.
The oldest verified person ever — Jeanne Louise Calment of France — died in 1997 at the age of 122, according to Guinness.

https://www.the42.ie/eoin-brosnan-dr-crokes-2-4554730-Mar2019/,"EX-KERRY STAR EOIN Brosnan didn’t want his senior club career to end like this.
Eoin Brosnan and his Dr Crokes teammate Colm Cooper.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
If events had unfolded differently in Croke Park last weekend, Dr Crokes would be toasting a second All-Ireland title in two years.
But a 12-point trimming against the defending champions Corofin will have to do as Brosnan’s parting note, making his introduction in the 52nd minute of the tie.
It was always his philosophy to continue playing for the club as long as he felt fit, but over the last few seasons, Brosnan realised the end was drawing near.
He knew he was on borrowed time after they ended a 25 year-wait for All-Ireland success in 2017, and on Tuesday morning this week, he sent a text around to the group.
“Obviously fellas were very disappointed on Sunday and fellas stuck together on Monday,” Brosnan tellsThe42.
“I was back at work on Tuesday and when it’s the start of a new year, I thought I may as well let everyone know.
Brosnan is finishing up his senior football days at 38, the same age as Corofin’s Kieran Fitzgerald.
Brosnan says the pair began their inter-county careers at a similar time, as he casts his mind back to 2001 when Fitzgerald lined out at corner-back for Galway as they lifted the Sam Maguire for the second time in three years.

For Brosnan, his inter-county career yielded three All-Ireland crowns before he announced his retirement in 2013.
The parallels between the two filtered down to club level as well, with both Fitzgerald and Brosnan enjoying plenty of success with their local sides.
Their paths diverged last Sunday afternoon however, as Fitzgerald celebrated back-to-back All-Irelands with Corofin at the expense of Brosnan and his team-mates.
“Sport is a bit of a drug and Kieran is obviously a huge club man,” says Brosnan, who takes some comfort from the fact that Dr Crokes were simply defeated by a stronger outfit.
“I’d be a proud Crokes man as well. The one down side from the latter part of my career was that there were a few injuries and what not.
Advertisement
“But the last two years, I’ve been pretty much injury-free and I really enjoyed my football then. Every game was a bit of a bonus really.”
Colm Cooper’s Laochra Gael episode was aired last weekend to coincide with the All-Ireland club finals.

'I knew once it stuck the goal was on' Colm Cooper ar#LaochraGaelDé Domhnaigh@TG4TV.@Kerry_Official@DrCrokesGAA@Laochra_Gael@ballsdotiepic.twitter.com/buyYfH7SGS
Old footage shows a youthful Cooper in his early days of donning the black and amber of Dr Crokes. The Kerry legend also refers to his ‘street football’ days where he developed an instinctive style of playing football as well as the joy of being the club’s mascot when they won their first All-Ireland back in 1992.
It was a similar upbringing for Brosnan, who was just 11 years old when he went up to Croke Park to cheer on his club to victory.
“There were a lot of great memories, I suppose a lot of our careers would have crossed over between Crokes and Kerry.
“Colm was always behind the goals kicking the ball out and he was very slight. I think we won an U15 county championship. It was a real bonus to win county, we knew were on the right direction.”
The Dr Crokes team were forced to endure many years of heartache before tasting All-Ireland success again. Brosnan played a key role in the team that contested the 2007 All-Ireland final, where Armagh’s Crossmaglen brought them to a replay before edging them out at the second time of asking.
Three consecutive All-Ireland semi-final defeats followed between 2012 and 2014 and Dr Crokes subsequently went through a barren period in the Kerry championship.

They seemed to be regressing and it looked as though an All-Ireland title would not be their fate. Brosnan admits that he thought their opportunity had passed them by, but he never considered retiring.
And his patience was rewarded with that 2017 triumph.
“There’s plenty of people who told me they retired too early and they’d have regrets that they could have gone on a little bit longer,” he says.
“I still felt that while I was fit, I was competitive enough to be playing.
“After losing three semi-finals, we went two years without winning a county title in Kerry and I suppose at that stage, I was 36 or 37.
“I said , ‘listen my days of winning All-Irelands are gone.’ It would have been a regret. I know Colm called it ‘The Toughest’ and I suppose he was the flagship of the competition in that he’d had all these knocks and he kept coming back.
Dr Crokes have Division 2 and Division 5 teams for Brosnan to slip into, but he’s not making any plans to further his Gaelic football career at the moment.
He runs his own solicitor firm, which he took over from his father in 2016. Balancing his hectic professional life with the demands of a GAA player certainly brought several challenges for Brosnan over the years, but working in Killarney allowed him to maintain his commitments to both.

He has ambitions of fitting in a few 5km and 10km runs in the future while golf is another sport that he’s passionate about. Brosnan’s handicap is currently at 13 but he aims to cut that back to single digits inside the next 12 months.
Brosnan also has a young family. Along with his wife Mary, they have five daughters aged between four months and 10 years.
Brosnan has plenty to look forward to in retirement.Lorraine O'Sullivan / INPHOLorraine O'Sullivan / INPHO / INPHO
They were all in attendance at Croke Park last weekend and some of them have already started honing their craft with the underage teams in Dr Crokes.
“Annie will be 10 soon, Elizabeth is 7, Jane is five, Suzie is turning two in July and Maryanne is only five months old.
It’s rare that athletes get the chance to retire on their own terms, and after 22 years of service, Brosnan certainly didn’t get the exit from senior football that he wanted.
It was an unusual defeat for Dr Crokes too. They have often been involved in one-sided affairs where they cruised to victory, but on this occasion, they were the ones taking the punishment.
It’s not how Brosnan wanted to leave things but he can reflect on plenty of great days in Dr Crokes colours, something which their manager Pat O’Shea reminded everyone of after their defeat to Corofin.
“To win the last three counties, a Munster and an All-Ireland, we can hold our heads up high and be proud of our achievements.
“That’s what Pat said in the dressing room after.
“Obviously lads were very disappointed but that we had a lot to be proud of and to hold our heads up high after that effort.
“In an ideal scenario, we’d have won this week. That’s sport and life moves on. Everyone enjoys sport but there’s more important things. When you have to go to work and look after your family, they are the most important things.
“We enjoy sport but ultimately, it’s a past-time.”

TWO FOUR-YEAR-old twins who prevented their grandmother from suffering brain damage or death after she suffered a seizure were presented with bravery medals at their playschool in Clonakilty, West Cork today.
On 25 February, Sean O’Sullivan and his little sister Emma were being minded overnight by their grandmother, Ruth Clarke, as their parents May and Brian had gone to Tralee for a concert.
Sean woke at 6am and couldn’t rouse his granny Ruth. The pensioner had taught him how to play games on her phone so he went to her device and started pressing buttons. He managed to get through to his grandfather, Stephen Clarke, who was at home nearby.  Mr Clarke rushed to the scene and attempted to get in to the house.
Stephen said Sean was too short to reach the latch. However, he got his tricycle, climbed on top of it and let his grandfather in. Ruth (69) was rushed to hospital where she spent two days in a coma.
Doctors didn’t find anything amiss in tests and put her sudden collapse down to ageing epilepsy or an electrical malfunction in the brain. She is since on the mend.
Mr Clarke said he was amazed that Sean had the presence of mind to get on top of the tricycle to let him in.
“He is only four. A very bright kid. I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know if she was dead,” he said. “It was a terrible ordeal because you never know what the outcome is going to be. Fortunately the outcome is fantastic”.
‘He saved my life’
Ruth said her last memory prior to waking up in intensive care in Cork University Hospital was of texting her grandson at 1am.
“I can’t believe that Sean did what he did. He saved my life. He called his Mummy and said ‘Nanny is not waking up’ and he called his granddad. He got me help”.
Sean also managed to get through to his mother, May O’Sullivan, on the phone. She said he kept screaming “I can’t wake Nanny. I can’t wake Nanny”.
She said she was terrified at the idea of her two small children being in the house with her mother given that she was afraid she had died. She is astonished that Sean and Emma managed to raise the alarm. Sean stuck crisps in Ruth’s mouth and eyes in a bid to wake her and Emma then removed the crisps from her face when it didn’t work.
May O’Sullivan said she could never thank Sean and Emma enough for what they had done for her mother.
“I was certain my Mum had passed. One of the things the doctors said to us that she would possibly have been brain damaged. How do you thank a little four-year-old for having the sense to pick up a phone? Sean is going to get a big birthday present this year from everybody”.
May admits to being emotional about the fact that her children managed to save the life of her mother.
“It is a little four-year-old who had the presence of mind to understand that it is an emergency. That nanny is not just doing a good sleep. There is something wrong. He picked up a cell phone.  Luckily he got through to his grandfather at first”.
Mayor of Clonakility, Gretta O’Donovan, was on hand at Naiscoil Chloch na gCoillte this morning for the medal presentation. She described the two young children as amazing role models for all young people.
“How many of us at four years of age would have the presence of mind to call for help by telephone? Because of his Sean’s quick reaction to the impending loss of his nana he was able to get her the help she needed. In fact truth be told how many of us at fourteen or twenty four would have had the presence of mind to do this?”

GERMAN POLICE HAVE warned social media stars to rein in their followers after making several arrests during a brawl in Berlin when fans of two YouTubers squared off.
Berlin police said they made nine arrests last night after a fight broke out in Alexanderplatz in the city centre among some 400 backers of two rival stars of the internet platform.
Police said it took around 100 officers, two of whom was injured as a result, to break up the melee involving around 50 youths, which led to nine arrests. “Tear gas was also used,” they added.
A police spokesman said the fight continued in a nearby subway station when a 20-strong group started throwing rocks taken from the railway lines at each other.
According to media reports, the brawl started as a result of a turf battle between the rival YouTubers.
As a result, a senior Berlin police chief appealed to those with large internet followings to be more responsible.
“We see in the rapper scene, and increasingly also with other influencers, that they are sometimes very negligent with their influence,” said Norbert Cioma, head of the Berlin chapter of the GdP police union.
“It seems to be fashionable to deliberately open a powder keg to generate more followers, subscribers and clicks.”

‘Traumatised’
One of the YouTube stars involved, Berlin-based Bahar Al Amood, who has 13,000 subscribers, later apologised on his Instagram account, before rejecting any contact with the media.
“For all the press writing to and calling me or who want to meet up, you can keep your offers of ‘we will change your name’ or ‘we offer you 100 euros’ and the lies you have told,” he wrote.
His rival from the southern city of Stuttgart, who goes by his social media moniker ‘ThatsBekir_’ and has 262,000 followers, said he “needs to take a break” as a result of the fracas and wants to leave Berlin as quickly as possible.
“I’m traumatised and feel afraid to go out. I want to be with my family,” the 18-year-old YouTube star told Berliner Morgenpost daily.
The teenager accused his YouTube rival of going on his “live stream and insulting me”.
He also claimed to have been threatened, but had expected the meeting in Berlin to be peaceful.
Having been accompanied by five friends to meet Al Amood, ‘ThatsBekir_’ claims he was punched by his rival in the face and things quickly became ugly.
“He asked me why I had called him a ‘son of a whore’, that’s how things started,” said the teenager.
Videos of the meeting posted online appear to show the pair talking face-to-face, surrounded by their supporters, and after a brief conversation, punches started to fly.
‘ThatsBekir_’ believes his rival from Berlin wanted attention from the internet – “he wants fame and subscribers – nothing more,” added the 18-year-old.

The little souvenir of Ireland is found in the International Friendship Exhibition which is a massive pagoda-like structure in the mountains north of the capital Pyongyang.
The exhibition is guarded by soldiers with silver plated AK-47 (Kalashnikov) rifles.
All cameras are impounded when you go inside the exhibition but during a visit in 2012, I managed to sneak a notebook in with me.
Room after room, on multiple floors, was given over to different nations, and the elaborate gifts bestowed upon Kim Jong Un father and grandfather during state visits by foreign politicians.
As described in the 2009 book by Brian Hanley and Scott Millar Lost Revolution: the story of the Official IRA and the Workers’ Party, the Workers’ Party sent delegations to North Korea, which was then ruled by Kim’s grandfather, from the early 1980s onward.
While leaving crystal or china might seem like a standard courtesy, the paying of tributes to the leaderwas standard etiquette in ancient times, when Korea was a Confucian society ruled by a despotic emperor.
And despite being a product of the Cold War and spouting Marxist and Maoist sounding jargon, Kim is far more of a recreation of the Chosun Emperors who ruled Korea from 1392-1910, than a throwback to Joseph Stalin or Chairman Mao.
A typical sculpture in Pyongyang shows oppressed workers, soldiers and peasants bounding to victory against foreign aggressors.
A recent summit in Vietnam went nowhere, after grand plans to ‘de-nuclearise’ the Korean peninsula and wind down the American military presence in South Korea faltered.
The plans had been touted for months and so it is unclear where Kim Jong Un goes next.
But one thing is certain: North Korea’s strongman intends staying in power until his gravity-defying black hair has long turned white.
The demilitarised zone
Independent travel to North Korea is all but impossible. Visitors are invariably assigned ‘minders.’ These make sure you don’t photograph anything unseemly.
They are also keen to impress upon you that North Korea is an island of plenty in a sea of want, constantly besieged by envious foreign aggressors. There are always at least two minders, so one can keep an eye on the other.
During a visit in the early 2000s, my minders drove me south of Pyongyang to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a belt of no man’s land dividing the Koreas, 4km across, 250km long.
On either side of the DMZ are some of the deadliest concentrations of pent-up firepower anywhere on the planet.
Turning off a country road, our vehicle was welcomed by a bluff and burly Colonel named Kang Ho Sok. He escorted us up a winding and wooded path to a vantage point high above the DMZ.
After passing through a small hallway, my ‘minders’ and I stepped outside to a gallery that contained a row of mounted binoculars. Sweeping below were countless hills, crusted in scrub and thickets of spruce trees. In the distance, a tank wall marked the outer limit of South Korea.
Squinting into the binoculars, I could see a fortified encampment on one hill. I could also hear words in Korean squawking out of a loudspeaker.
Through my minder, I asked Colonel Kang what was being said. He shrugged and muttered words to the effect that the South Korean loudspeakers were “too far away.”
I found this rather hard to believe. But I had a fairly good idea what I was hearing: most likely tirades on the awfulness of North Korea. After all, the North had loudspeakers on their side of the DMZ, sending similar tirades in the opposite direction.

Parallel History
But I’d already had a taste of North Korea’s parallel reality back in Pyongyang. The city was a ghostly grey, almost alien looking metropolis. Beneath reefs of concrete towers, the streets were almost traffic free.
The original wooden city was incinerated by US air raids during the Korean war of 1950-3.

The Victorious Fatherland War Museum in Pyongyang was devoted to that horrific conflict. Mi-G and Mustang fighters sat alongside the wreckage of B-29 bombers, captured American munitions, uniforms and all the paraphernalia of a war where Washington twice considered the use of atomic weapons, something North Korea’s rulers have never forgotten.
Thepiece de resistancethough was a large revolving dais surrounded by life-sized reconstructions of battle.
Handsome North Korean soldiers cut down their murderous ‘Yankee imperialist’ adversaries. Communist Chinese soldiers, who saved the North Koreans from certain defeat in the winter of 1950-1 as American forces advanced north, were nowhere to be seen in the display.
A North Korea propaganda poster depicts US soldiers being slaughtered
My guide was a petite lady soldier, a star on her cap. At one point I asked her how many Americans had been killed in the Korean War.
“At least 400,000,” she replied calmly.
A Google search of reputable sources will usually turn up a figure of 33,686 combat fatalities. I repeated this to the lady soldier.
“Oh no, it was 400,000,” she retorted with a pitying smile for me, the poor deluded soul that I was.
Great Leader
Like any North Korean adult over 14, the lady wore a badge bearing the grinning and spectacled face of Kim Jong Un’s grandfather Kim il-Sung, North Korea’s ‘Great Leader.’
The first Kim had been a guerrilla fighter when Korea was part of the expanding Japanese empire in the 1930s. Taken under Stalin’s wing and installed in Pyongyang in 1945, within three years he ruled North Korea, a rival to a thuggish US-backed southern dictatorship.
Although the ludicrous claim of 400,000 American dead is accompanied by claims thatSouthKorea started the Korean War, both sides were exchanging fire across their shared border for two years before the Northern invasion of South Korea in June 1950.
While all Chinese troops had left North Korea by 1958, American troops have been in the South ever since the 1953 armistice.
Decades before North Korea’s first underground nuclear test in 2006, it was Washington, not Pyongyang that first nuclearised Korea.
That same year Chinese troops left North Korea, the Eisenhower administration abrogated the terms of the armistice to introduce nuclear capable MGR-1 surface to air missiles and M-65 Atomic Canon to South Korea. These were removed by George HW Bush in 1991.
Self Reliance
On my last visit to Pyongyang, I remember the darkened capital by night: high above unlit and unheated skyscrapers loomed the ‘Juche’ beacon, a massive tower surmounted by a glowing red torch.
The word ‘Juche’ translates roughly as ‘self-reliance’ and was first used by Kim Jong Un’s grandfather in a speech in 1955.
At the time, Kim il-Sung was reliant on aid from China and the USSR to rebuild his war-wrecked nation.
Books on a North Korean bookshelf laud Kim Jong Un's father, grandmother and grandfather.Tom FarrellTom Farrell
But he needed a home-grown ideology to consolidate his growing personality cult, one that fell back on Confucian concepts of discipline, hierarchy and ancestor worship. An uncle of Kim was an Evangelical pastor in the 1920s when Pyongyang was called ‘the Jerusalem of the East.’
And although Christians are brutally persecuted within North Korea today, ‘Juche’ is ripe with Biblical sounding notions of tribulation, a chosen people, paradise and all redeeming saviour.
The world looked on in horror and amazement in late 2011 after the death of Kim Jong-il, under whose watch North Korea was devastated by the last great famine of the 20thcentury.
The snowy streets of Pyongyang became a sea of wailing, contorted faces, thousands in apparent hysterics as his funeral cortege passed.
But in a society so carefully isolated (remember they have no Internet and movement of people is controlled) the Kim dynasty built up a worldview that appealed to a people humiliated by foreign dominance and traumatised by a war that killed two million civilians.
Kim Jong Un is unlikely to deviate from the ‘Juche’ path. Negotiations on weapons or sanctions may or may not continue. At 35 he can easily play the long game.
His nuclear arsenal keeps his monuments and palaces safe, including those containing Waterford crystal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/clodagh-hawe-murder-4521704-Mar2019/,"JACQUELINE CONNOLLY – THE sister of murdered woman Clodagh Hawe – has said that she was informed by a local man that he had seen Alan Hawe driving his car in the early morning of 29 August.
In a personal accountpublished in the Sunday Independent, Jacqueline, who appeared with her mother Mary Coll last Monday on the Claire Byrne Live show, said that she felt her family had been mistreated by the state.
Alan and Clodagh Hawe and their three children – Liam (14), Niall (11), and six-year-old Ryan – were found dead in their Cavan home in August 2016.
Aninquestthe following year concluded that Clodagh and her three sons were unlawfully killed by Alan who took his own life after the murders at their home at Oakdene, Balcony, Ballyjamesduff.
On Monday, Mary Coll and Jacqueline spoke out for the first time about the unanswered questions regarding the murders. They met with Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan on Thursday and are also due to meet Garda Commissioner Drew Harris.
The pair have raised issues with how the case was handled, saying they were mistreated by the state and that Clodagh, Liam, Niall and Ryan were failed.
The family have also called for a number of changes to how cases similar to theirs are handled.
They propose that immediately after the conclusion of an inquest in the case of a familicide and family annihilation, a book of evidence is published and that Tusla is responsible for independently monitoring all such cases and maintaining research on familicide perpetrators.
The family has also called for a review of the Coroner’s Act and laws surrounding exhumations.

Investigation
Writing in the Sunday Independent, Jacqueline Connolly said that she and her mother felt that key information surrounding the case was being withheld from them.

“The reason we have formed the view that key information is being withheld from us is because a local man told me he had made a statement to gardaí in which he said he and another person saw Alan Hawe driving his car, near the school, very early on the morning of August 29,” Jacqueline said.
Jacqueline said that when they raised this with investigating gardaí they were “accused of tampering with a witness”.
She said that her mother Mary told Minister Flanagan on Thursday:
Jacqueline said that the man who told her he had seen Alan may have been mistaken but that she “believed the man when he said he gave a statement to gardaí”.
“Overwhelming”
Jacqueline said that this week had been “overwhelming” and she thanked Minister Flanagan for meeting with her and her mother and giving them time to go through the case.
“It has been an overwhelming week and at last Clodagh, Liam, Niall and Ryan are at the centre of the review of the case,” she said.
Jacqueline spoke at length about the case and the initial media and local reaction to the news of what happened. She spoke about Alan Hawe and the particular features of family annihilation cases.
She also criticised the “online keyboard warriors” who attacked the family for their initial decision to bury Alan with the rest of the family, a decision which Jacqueline said was made “in the stupor of our grieving”.
She criticised the laws that meant it was Alan Hawe’s family that would have “the ultimate say whether there would or would not be an exhumation”.
Jacqueline called for more rights for next-of-kin in cases like theirs, and changes to the Succession Act.
Finally, she called for a zero tolerance approach in the state to domestic abuse “in any way shape or form”.
“We are now a tiny family, with my Mam and me and my little boy, but we hope to make a difference in this country to protect women and children, and let us not forget the men, who are also suffering through coercive control,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/utrecht-shooting-dutch-police-terror-motive-4550935-Mar2019/,"POLICE IN THE Netherlands are “seriously” investigating a terrorist motive for yesterday’s Utrecht tram attack because of evidence including a letter found in the suspected gunman’s getaway car.
The incident occurred on a tram at 24 Octoberplein, and the alarm was raised at 10.45am local time (9.45am Irish time).
Three people died and five people were injured in the incident. Those who died are a 19-year-old woman from Vianen, south of Utrecht, and two men aged 28 and 49 from Utrecht itself.
A suspect was detained yesterday evening after an eight-hour manhunt.
Police are now questioning Turkish-born suspect Gokmen Tanis (37) and two other men in relation to the attack.
“So far, a terrorist motive is seriously being taken into account. This is based on a letter found in the getaway car among other things and the nature of the facts,” Dutch police and prosecutors said in a joint statement.

Police have said they found a red Renault Clio that they suspect had carjacked before the attacked and used as a getaway car afterwards. They had also found a firearm after his arrest.
The suspect had been freed from jail in a rape case two weeks ago.
Tanis was originally arrested in 2017 then released from pre-trial detention, before being taken back into custody when he breached his bail conditions, the central Netherlands district court said.
He was freed again at the start of March.

In 2014, he was convicted of “illegal possession of weapons” and attempted theft but acquitted of attempted manslaughter. He was also convicted in recent months for shoplifting and burglary.
‘Filled with horror’
A stream of mourners, including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, laid flowers at the site of the attack.
“A day later, I am still filled with horror,” Rutte told parliament.

Flags have been flown at half-mast on many buildings around The Netherlands and on foreign embassies today.
Support for The Netherlands has poured in from around the world, including the United States, the EU and Russia.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: “America stands with you. We will continue to do all we can to help you in this terrible time of tragedy.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country’s intelligence agency was “looking into” the attack.
“Some say it is a family matter, some say it is a terror attack… Our intelligence agency is looking into the matter”, Erdogan told Ulke TV yesterday.
The Netherlands yesterday boosted security at airports and other key buildings in response to the incident. However, following the arrest authorities lowered the threat level in Utrecht from the maximum level five.

The socks are to mark World Down Syndrome Day today, for the reason that they look a bit like chromosomes, and people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome (making 47 altogether).

While people across Ireland and the UK have been showing off their odd socks (usually matched with a donation to a Down syndrome support organisation), a number of organisations have launched new information campaigns to help parents.

Down Syndrome Ireland is launching a new booklet today, called ‘…more than medical’, which is intended to be a resource for parents with a pre- or postnatal diagnosis of Down syndrome for their baby.
It has also launched a video for new parents, called ‘Having a child with Down syndrome’. On Sunday 24 March, it will hold its fourth annual Purple Run, which is held to raise funds for DSI.
There are about 7,000 people in Ireland with Down syndrome, and DSI works with about 3,500 of them. DSI says that children with Down syndrome can have increased risk of certain health issues, such as congenital heart defects and hearing, vision, thyroid and respiratory problems.
As the life expectancy of people with Down syndrome is increasing, it’s hugely important that the living and learning needs of people who have Down syndrome are supported, says DSI.
Along with this, ideas and attitudes about living with Down syndrome have changed, with the outdated beliefs around the capabilities of people with Down syndrome changing in recent decades.
With that in mind, The Down Syndrome Centre has a new campaign for today called I Could Be, which it says is “about supporting a brighter future for people with Down syndrome”.
Images of 18 children with Down Syndrome will be displayed around Dublin city centre today, each with the #ICouldBe message on it. The messages range from ‘I could be a TV presenter’ to ‘I could be a model’ to ‘I could be an artist’. It’s all about challenging the perceptions that people might have around what that one extra chromosome means:

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-brexit-deal-4536165-Mar2019/,"British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in StrasbourgVincent KesslerVincent Kessler
LAST NIGHT, THE UK and the EU announced they had reached an agreement on a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop.
It followed what was being described as a last-ditch attempt by British Prime Minister May to secure Brexit concessions from the EU ahead of a planned House of Commons vote on the deal later today.
For now, however, it remains to be seen whether the new guarantees will be enough to sway Brexiteers within her own party and the DUP to back her Brexit deal.
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
So, what does this all mean? Let’s break it down.
What happened last night?
First – a quick look back.
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
The backstop locks the UK, including Northern Ireland, into a customs deal and other regulations in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It’s basically been a bone of contention in the Brexit debate.
Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications & legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement &#backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or#Brexitmay not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.https://t.co/lfy9eehEZipic.twitter.com/XCqcLwZV7V— Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU)March 11, 2019Jean-Claude Juncker/ Twitter

Last night, following last-ditch attempts to secure Brexit concessions from the EU, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave a press conference in Strasbourg.
Both reading from prepared statements, the pair said they had agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop – “legally binding changes” to the old agreement aimed at addressing Britain’s needs and getting the deal through parliament.
The joint instrument is essentially a three-part package of changes from the EU to the terms of the withdrawal agreement.
These new documents have been agreed to run alongside the withdrawal agreement, which governs Britain’s exit terms, and the political declaration on future trade terms.
First is a “joint legally binding instrument” on the withdrawal text, which addresses the deal’s controversial backstop plan to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
A second document would supplement the political declaration, and outline commitments from both sides on moving swiftly to this new relationship.
Britain has also put forward a “unilateral declaration” with legal status in international law emphasising the temporary nature of the backstop.
This would clarify that Britain believes there is nothing in the Brexit deal to stop it seeking to exit the backstop if the EU fails to live up to its commitments to find a replacement.
What does this mean for the backstop?
The backstop is a sort of Plan B, insurance policy, or safety net that would kick in if a better deal isn’t agreed in the second stage of Brexit talks, which will focus on trade (a part of the Future Relationship).
It would kick in at the end of the transition period – which starts on 29 March and ends on31 December 2020- if a final deal is agreed.
Put simply, the backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
However, the new guarantees say that every effort will be made to ensure the Irish backstop never needs to be enacted and measures through which any attempt to make the backstop apply indefinitely can be legally challenged.

What did the EU say last night?
Juncker last night explained that the backstop was an insurance policy and that if it was ever used it would not be used as a trap.
The mechanism being announced last night complemented the withdrawal agreement agreed last November without reopening it, he said – noting that this was a “second chance” and that there would be no third chance.
“In politics sometimes you get a second chance, it is what we do with this second chance that counts because there will be no third chance,” Juncker said.
What did the UK say?
May last night said the backstop could not be a template for a future relationship and that so far that hadn’t been clear enough to MPs.
The EU, under the new proposals, will not be able to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, May said. If it makes any move to do so, that can be tackled through arbitration.
British Prime Minister Theresa MayJean-Francois BadiasJean-Francois Badias
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” May said.
She said it was the UK’s position that it believed it could withdraw, unilaterally, from the backstop if negotiations on the future relationship broke down.
What’s Ireland’s view on this?
Well, during his speech last night, Juncker implied that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had signed off on the strengthened guarantees offered to London.
“I have spoken to the Taoiseach this evening who would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal,” Juncker told reporters.
Varadkar had been due to travel to Washington, but remains in Dublin this morning.
He is expected to hold a press conference later this morning to outline the Irish government’s position.
What will the DUP have to say?
Up until now, May’s withdrawal agreement has proven unpalatable for Northern Ireland’s DUP, hardline Conservatives and the opposition parties.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.

Since last night, the DUP has said it will scrutinise the documents that have been agreed.
May needs the DUP’s support for the deal to pass through the House of Commons.
Finally, what on earth happens now?
Later today, the House of Commons will vote on May’s Brexit plan.
The vote is expected to take place at 7pm.
Another defeat would set the stage for additional votes in parliament this week that could postpone Brexit and possibly reverse it in the months to come.
If she loses the vote, May has promised to give MPs a vote tomorrow on whether Britain should simply leave without any deal at all.
If MPs would defeat the “no-deal” scenario, it would be followed on Thursday with a vote on requesting a delay from the EU.

Garry Ringrose is likely to make his return from a hamstring injury at outside centre, while captain Rory Best, loosehead prop Cian Healy and second row James Ryan are also in line for recalls having been rested for the win against Italy two weekends ago.

Iain Henderson is likely to be another addition to the starting XV after coming off the bench against Italy, while CJ Stander is set to be named at number eight having recovered from the fractured eye socket and cheekbone he sustained against England in round one.
Schmidt looks set to continue with a back three of Rob Kearney, Keith Earls and Jacob Stockdale, while Bundee Aki is favourite to wear the number 12 shirt as Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray continue in the halfbacks.
Ireland’s bench positions have also been closely contested, with John Ryan expected to provide back-up to starting tighthead Tadhg Furlong, while Jordan Larmour is set for a return in the number 23 shirt.

MARCUS RASHFORD SCORED a stoppage-time penalty awarded after a VAR review to give Manchester United a stunning 3-1 win away to Paris Saint-Germain tonight  as they improbably went through to the Champions League quarter-finals on away goals.
A seriously depleted United looked to have given themselves too much to do after losing 2-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie last month, yet a Romelu Lukaku brace in the first half at the Parc des Princes gave them hope.
Even so, Juan Bernat had netted in between for PSG, and it looked as though they would stumble on until the drama at the death.
Slovenian referee Damir Skomina awarded a spot-kick after reviewing the images when he had been alerted of a possible handball by PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe in the box.
Rashford duly beat Gianluigi Buffon from 12 yards, as United won a European tie after losing the first leg at home for the first time in their history.
Their improbable victory – following Ajax’s similarly stunning turnaround against holders Real Madrid 24 hours earlier – takes them through to the last eight for the first time since 2014.
Their remarkable revival under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continues, with the Norwegian now having overseen nine consecutive away wins, a club record.

While they celebrate, for PSG this defeat will feel like groundhog day.
For the third year running they fail to make the quarter-finals, after their defeat at the hands of Real Madrid a year ago and their humiliating collapse against Barcelona in 2017.
With what came before, this will feel even more painful for them and their Qatari owners.
Electric at Old Trafford in the first leg, Kylian Mbappe was poor here and Neymar was again missing, watching from the stands as he recovers from injury.
United were missing many more players, with Paul Pogba suspended and nine more sidelined due to fitness problems.
Despite that, they pulled off one of their greatest European results, up there with their 3-2 win at Juventus in the 1999 semi-finals, which came after they fell two goals behind early on.
Solskjaer was on the bench that night, and the Norwegian watched from the sideline here — curiously looking like a substitute with a bib on over his jacket apparently due to a colour clash with PSG’s kit — as his side somehow went in front inside two minutes.
A dreadful back-pass attempt by PSG defender Thilo Kehrer fell into no-man’s land, and Lukaku pounced on the loose ball before rounding Gianluigi Buffon and scoring. Surely PSG were not about to blow it again?

They did pull themselves together to equalise in the 12th minute, with Dani Alves releasing Mbappe in the box. As the away defence slept, Mbappe’s ball across goal was turned in at the far post by Bernat, the defender scoring his third Champions League goal this season.

Now it looked as though their start to the game would prove to be nothing more than a blip.
The depleted visitors, with Eric Bailly at right-back and Fred, Scott McTominay and Andreas Pereira all in midfield, were incapable of keeping the ball. However, they were gifted another goal half an hour in.
Not closed down 25 yards out, Rashford tried a shot that was powerful but straight at Buffon.
Yet the veteran Italian, still hoping to win the Champions League for the first time aged 41, spilled the ball, and Lukaku followed in to score. It was a sixth goal in three games for the Belgian.
PSG – so slick in France – were wobbling again at the business end of the Champions League.
Di Maria had a goal ruled out for offside in the 56th minute and Mbappe then managed to fall when clean through late on, with Bernat sending the loose ball against the post.
It still looked as though they would hang on, but then VAR intervened, and Rashford sent United into ecstasy.

He was last seen at around 11am on Saturday 9 February near the Bonnington Hotel in Whitehall, where he had been staying, while his fiancé had coffee in the hotel bar.
It is not known why Jón left the hotel, and despite a number of garda appeals, there have been no leads in the case.
Twelve members of Jón’s family travelled from Iceland last month to step up efforts to find him.
On 23 February, the search intensified as a large-scale search took place. Around 80 volunteers turned up to help the family.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump’s former campaign chief Paul Manafort has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison by a federal judge for tax crimes and bank fraud.
His is the highest profile case yet stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
Judge TS Lewis immediately came under fire from Democratic lawmakers for imposing what they described as a relatively light sentence on the 69-year-old Republican political consultant and lobbyist.
Prosecutors from the Special Counsel’s office had argued for a stiff prison term for Manafort, the first target of the Mueller probe to be convicted in a criminal trial.
Ellis said that while Manafort had committed “very serious crimes”, he had previously led an “otherwise blameless life”, and the advisory sentencing guidelines calling for 19 to 24 years behind bars were “excessive” and disproportionate to sentences for similar offenses.
“The government cannot sweep away the history of all these previous sentences,” the judge said.
Manafort was convicted by a jury in August of five counts of filing false income tax returns, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failing to report a foreign bank account.
He is one of a half-dozen former Trump associates and senior aides charged by Mueller, who has been investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
The charges against Manafort were not connected to his role in the Trump campaign, which he headed for two months in 2016, but were related to lucrative consulting work he did for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians from 2004 to 2014.
Prosecutors alleged that Manafort used offshore bank accounts to hide more than $55 million (about €49.1 million) he earned working for the Ukrainians.
The money was used to support a lavish lifestyle which included purchases of luxury homes and cars, antique rugs, and expensive clothes, including an $18,500 (€16,500) python jacket.
His conviction was a stunning downfall for a man who also worked on the White House bids of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and Bob Dole.
Speaking from a wheelchair and wearing a green prison jumpsuit with the words ‘Alexandria Inmate’ on the back, Manafort told the court that his “life, professionally and personally, is in a shambles”.
‘Pain and shame’
“I feel the pain and shame,” said Manafort, who the defence says suffers from gout. ”To say that I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,” he said.
Judge Ellis said he did not hear Manafort express regret or remorse but he said the sentencing guidelines were “way out of whack.”
Advertisement
“I think what I’ve done is punitive,” Ellis said. He sentenced Manafort to a total of 47 months in prison for the eight counts and credited him with nine months of time served.
Manafort was ordered to pay $24 million (about €21.4 million) in restitution and a $50,000 (€44,600) fine.
Manafort still faces sentencing in a €money laundering and witness tampering case in Washington next week, where the maximum penalty is 10 years and the judge has appeared more sympathetic to prosecutors.
‘Accepts responsibility’
Defence attorney Kevin Downing, speaking after the sentencing, said Manafort “accepts responsibility for his conduct”.
Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described Downing’s remarks as a “deliberate appeal for a pardon” from Trump, who has denied any collusion with Russia and has denounced the Mueller probe as a “political witch hunt”.
“The statement by Paul Manafort’s lawyers after an already lenient sentence — repeating the President’s mantra of no collusion — was no accident,” Schiff said. “One injustice must not follow another.”
Trump has dangled the possibility of pardons for some of those indicted by Mueller — including Manafort, whom he has praised as a “good man” who has been treated unfairly.
Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, also denounced the sentence.
“His crimes took place over years and he led far from a ‘blameless life”, Klobuchar said on Twitter.
During Manafort’s trial, much of the damaging testimony against him was provided by his former deputy Rick Gates, who reached a plea deal with the Special Counsel’s office.
Besides Manafort and Gates, four other former Trump associates face charges or have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the Mueller investigation.
Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials and is awaiting sentencing.
Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen is to begin serving a three-year prison sentence on 6 May for fraud, tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and lying to Congress.
George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and was sentenced to two weeks in prison.
Another Trump advisor, Roger Stone, awaits trial.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-reverses-north-korea-sanctions-4556747-Mar2019/,"
US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump abruptly announced today the cancellation of sanctions imposed by his own Treasury Department to tighten international pressure on North Korea.
“It was announced today by the US Treasury that additional large scale sanctions would be added to those already existing sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional sanctions!” Trump said in a tweet.
He appeared to be referring to measures unveiled yesterday that targeted two Chinese companies accused of helping North Korea to evade tight international sanctions meant to pressure Pyongyang into ending its nuclear weapons program.
They were the first new sign of pressure since talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in Hanoi less than a month ago.
However, Trump, who has previously spoken of “love” for the totalitarian leader, appears to retain hope that his strong personal relationship will bear fruit.

‘Gross incompetence’
“President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary,” the president’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said.
Adam Schiff, a Democrat who heads the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, blasted Trump for cancelling sanctions “imposed only yesterday and championed by his own national security advisor because he ‘loves’ Kim.”
“Foolish naiveté is dangerous enough. Gross incompetence and disarray in the White House make it even worse,” Schiff tweeted.
On Thursday, Trump national security advisor John Bolton had tweeted that the sanctions were meant to put an end to “illicit shipping practices” by North Korea.
“Everyone should take notice and review their own activities to ensure they are not involved in North Korea’s sanctions evasion,” he said.
China complained, saying that it did enforce all UN resolutions and opposed “any country imposing unilateral sanctions and taking long-arm jurisdiction against any Chinese entity according to their own domestic laws.”
This was Trump’s second major, unexpected foreign policy announcement by Twitter in two days.
On Thursday, he sent a tweet reversing decades of US policy and pledged to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the hotly contested Golan Heights border area with Syria.","8.33pm, 22 Mar 2019",

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
TWITTER WAS AWASH with people predicting a furious response to the airing of republican anthems like The Men Behind the Wire on an episode of the latest Alan Partridge series last night.
Fast forward to this afternoon though, and we’re still awaiting any substantial fury.
So far, the most noteworthy tweet on the affair has come from an Ian Paisley parody account (above) known for its regular satirical DUP-esque posts about, for instance, ‘Londonderry Girls’.
If you haven’t caught it yet and are wondering what all the fuss is about, the sequence in question plays out at the end of the show Partridge is presenting. An Irish farmer/folk singer, also played by Partridge creator Steve Coogan, hijacks the remaining airtime and proceeds to belt out an unrelenting medley of increasingly controversial ballads.
The initial social media response may have simply been a kind of instinctual shock response at the fact that a song like Men Behind the Wire – written in the aftermath of internment in the early 1970s – was being sung on primetime BBC.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet

‘More to Ireland den dis’
Respondents to those initial tweets were quick to point out that Coogan has Irish roots, and a pretty spot-on record in terms of his handling of matters pertaining to Ireland.
His best known creation – an unimaginably inept TV presenter who, in this latest series, has made an inexplicable return to the Beeb to co-present an inane daytime magazine show – never seems to fare particularly well in encounters with the Irish, but the joke is always on Partridge.
Fans of the character will remember how, in a former incarnation, the hapless host had an equally cringeworthy run in with a pair of Irish TV producers – played by Father Ted creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews – who were considering hiring him for a fresh, modern show about a changing Ireland. (Sample Alan quotes: “A good slogan for the tourist board… Dere’s more to Ireland den dis.”, “Could we come live from the Blarney Stone?”).
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
BBC Studios/ YouTube
Partridge’s sole cinema outing, Alpha Papa, also features a disgruntled Irish radio host played by Colm Meaney who stages a siege at a Norwich radio station.
Speakingat the time, Coogan said:
“I’m half Irish and Alan does make all sorts of Irish references. I spent nearly every summer of my life growing up in the west of Ireland and I’m very familiar with Mayo and Cork and west Cork.
Bearing in mind the adage that analysing comedy is akin to dissecting a frog (nobody laughs and the frog dies), it’s the main character’s unease with, frankly, anything that upends his middle-of-the-road, middle England sensibility that prompts the laughs in Partridge projects.

BRITAIN’S ROYAL FAMILY warned trolls on its social media accounts that they will be banned under new guidelines issued following abuse of Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle – the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex.
Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace said that they could involve the police if there was a breach of the law.
Under the new guidelines, comments must not “be defamatory… obscene, offensive, threatening, abusive, hateful, inflammatory or promote sexually explicit material or violence”.
“We reserve the right to hide or delete comments made on our channels, as well as block users who do not follow these guidelines,” it added.

Almost 1,000 online posts have already been deleted, according to reports.
The royal family have not mentioned any specific online problems, but British gossip magazine Hello! last month reported that royal staff were spending hours every week removing abusive posts sent by ‘rival’ supporters of each duchess, amid reports that the two had fallen out.
Tabloids reported that Meghan made sister-in-law Kate cry during preparations for her wedding last year with Prince Harry.
The family denies a rift, and insists that Harry and Meghan’s plan to move out from living next door to his brother Prince William and Kate is driven by the imminent arrival of their first child, due next month.
It asked users to show “courtesy, kindness and respect for all other members of our social media communities.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-as-a-teacher-should-i-encourage-my-students-to-strike-against-climate-change-4536434-Mar2019/,"AS A TEACHER, father and aspirant politician, when I consider this week’s proposed school strike on global warming I face a dilemma: Am I letting my students down if I allow them to skip school or am I letting them down if I don’t encourage them to strike?
For those who are not familiar with the planned ‘Schools Strike for Climate Action’ this Friday, it is a nationwide protest against the Government’s lack of action on climate change.
Students from all over Ireland will take part in marches in Dublin and Cork as well as demonstrations outside school gates in counties from Kerry to Donegal.
While there have been many days of protest across the country in recent years, from housing to health, this one is quite different.
To begin with, this protest is led by secondary students and the Irish strike is part of a growing international movement.
This is the latest of a series of school-student-led protests, strikes and demonstrations that began on 20 of August 2018 when 15-year old Swedish student, Greta Thunberg, decided to skip school and protest outside the Swedish parliament due to its inaction on global warming.
That first Friday Thunberg spent alone with a hand-painted banner that read: ‘skolstrejk för klimatet’ : ‘school strike for climate’.
On the second day, people started to join her and she hasn’t been alone since. This Friday she will be joined by students in more than 700 locations across 71 different countries.
The second difference is the strength of the message that this remarkable young woman has brought forward.
Thunberg’s message, which she has delivered passionately in front of audiences ranging from school children to billionaires at Davos, is emphatic, unequivocal and damning.
The world, the biosphere, the planet is dying. Our house is on fire. This young lady does not mince her words, firing daggers of truth at the world’s governments and business leaders:
These are uncomfortable truths for all of us – especially coming from a child as she describes herself.
But looking at the latest figures from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) we need to start listening to these kids.
According to the latest IPCC climate change report, published in October 2018, the world’s leading climate scientists have warned there are only a dozen years left for global warming to be kept under 1.5C.
Advertisement
Any further rises beyond that will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.
The final reason that this protest is different and has the potential to become truly meteoric is that it contains an action that may prove especially popular with the average student – skipping school.
If all this does not yet strike fear into the heart of politicians, principals or parents then they probably still don’t fully understand the power of the internet and social media.
This cluster of protests is close to tipping point, close to becoming an all-encompassing international movement, that each new protester, each hashtag, each video that goes viral helps to accelerate forward.
And this is where I become torn. The strikes have begun gaining momentum in other countries as a regular ‘Friday for Futures’ event.
Do I want to see this happen here? Of course, I don’t want my students to begin skipping classes and falling behind. But what is the point of teaching them algebra or Shakespeare if they face a future of total climate chaos when they are older?
Shouldn’t we be encouraging them to make their voices heard on such a serious issue as a route to become active citizens?
The sad truth is that we actually need this push from the children to do something – because so far we really haven’t pushed ourselves.
I sometimes show the 1997 Oscar-winning film ‘Good Will Hunting’ to my students.
I tie in a whole host of themes into it but at the heart of my choice is that I think it is a beautiful film that resonates with young people – a story of redemption, of love, of forgiveness, and of friendship.
There is a moment in the film when Matt Damon’s character’s childhood friend Chuckie tells him that his favourite part of the day is when he arrives at Matt’s house to pick him up for another dead-end day of menial labour.
He always hopes that his friend will have packed up and gone. Gone to a better life than the one that Chuckie and his other friends are destined to fulfil.
Instead, they’ll realise that safeguarding our planet is the most important job they may ever have.
They might be able to live with the consequences of skipping school – but none of us will survive the consequences of destroying our planet.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-vote-4549451-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Mar 2019
THE BRITISH CABINET is meeting today to discuss how to proceed with Brexit negotiations.
The process was thrown into doubt yesterday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said Prime Minister Theresa May cannot have another meaningful vote on her Brexit deal if changes are not made to it.
Bercow said MPs from both sides of the House had expressed concerns to him about being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
“This has given us quite a lot to think about in the immediate term. There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session – but we are now talking about not just days but hours to the 29th of March,” Buckland told BBC News.
Asked about this statement,May’s official spokesman today said: “If you were to look back to the speech which the Prime Minister gave just before ‘meaningful vote two’, she said that if MPs did not support ‘meaningful vote two’ we would be in a crisis.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.
Despite this, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has suggested a vote could still take place next week.
Advertisement
Barclay told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme, however, “serious consideration” is being given to Bercow’s intervention and that it is important to “respect the referee”.
Last week, MPs backed a motion calling for Brexit to be delayed until 30 June. The vote isn’t legally binding and the EU must agree to any delay. Brexit is due to officially happen in just 10 days
‘Can’t be renegotiated’
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea. Negotiations to get the DUP and other MPs onside are ongoing behind the scenes.

A MANCHESTER UNITED fan underwent surgery after being stabbed by a taxi driver following the English club’s stunning Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain.
A French police source confirmed to AFP that a man had been wounded on Wednesday after an argument with a cab driver but that his condition was not believed to be life-threatening.
Sky Sportsreported that the fan, who is 44, was travelling to the centre of the French capital with three friends when the driver objected to their boisterous celebration of United’s 3-1 win.
“The driver pulled over to get them out of his taxi, before pulling out a knife and threatening the female passenger in the group,” claimed Sky.

The supporter was taken to the European Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris where he underwent surgery to remove blood from his lung.
According to the report, a suspect has been arrested by police, but the weapon used has not been found.
Man United have released a statement, which reads: “We were shocked to hear about the incident with one of our fans who was stabbed while in Paris for the Champions League game.
“Everyone at the club wishes him well during his recovery.”
A spokesman for Britain’s foreign ministry also said: “We are in touch with the French authorities following an incident involving a British man in Paris on 6 March and stand ready to offer assistance if required.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-claims-culture-is-out-of-control-as-play-centres-closed-after-being-sued-for-kids-falling-4531438-Mar2019/,"“I’M A MUM of two small children so if I am negligent in any way, of course, people have a right of recourse,” said Linda Murray, of Huckleberry’s Den, in Navan. “But don’t claim from a business because your child was there having fun and tripped or fell which can happen anywhere.”
Murray was reacting to thethreat of closureto her own play centre because of spiralling insurance costs on foot of claims. 12 people are employed there.
What she said resonates with me because as a working mother of two, I know what it’s like trying to rear a family and run a business at the same time.
It’s tough. Juggling both is not without headaches. And when your business is threatened, so is your livelihood – and that of your children’s.
But there’s a deeper resonance, two of my children ended up receiving medical treatment after a fall at two separate play centres. Did I sue the play centres?
No, I did not – and nor did it enter my head for a minute to do so.
Why? Because children fall. That’s what they do.
The play centres were in no way at fault, on the contrary, they were facilitating my kids in having such a good time; they became excitable and weren’t watching where they were going.
That would be like cutting off our nose to spite our face because Granny is oftentimes the unpaid childminder.
But yet some people feel entitled to file a claim against a play centre, putting someone else’s livelihood at risk because it’s a business and sure won’t the insurance company shell out?
Advertisement
Yes, the insurance company may shell out but at a heavy price to the business and in this case play centres.
In Navan town alone the problem has reached a crisis point. Huckleberry’s Den has seen their insurance premium jump from €2,500 to €16,500 in just five years while another local play centre in Navan, LoLoTown has already closed as a result of the premium hikes.
Is this ridiculous situation being replicated in towns all around Ireland?
No one is arguing that in legitimate cases parents shouldn’t be allowed to file injurious claims but we’re not talking about finding a piece of glass in little Johnny’s pizza.
Quick healing injuries that are so blown out of proportion, falsely categorised to be deemed life-changing and having long term physiological and psychological effects.
We are all losers here. Mothers like me who rely gratefully on play centres for hosting birthday parties out of the home. New mothers who use play centres as a social outlet for mixing with other mothers.
Or fathers looking for somewhere dry and warm to take his kids on a winter day off.
And the biggest losers are the children. Not just for the obvious reason, that their favourite place of play with their friends is no more.
‘If you want a child’s mind to grow, you must first plant a seed’ – healthy seeds, culturing accountability, a sense of community and consideration for others.
It is time to stand up to the growing scourge of claims culture in our society, we need to radically overhaul the entire legal framework that facilitates massive claims for exaggerated injuries.
If we don’t move soon, it is only a matter of time until someone does try to take a claim against Granny!

https://www.thejournal.ie/man-arrested-manslaughter-drugs-cookstown-4552427-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019
A MAN WHO was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply by PSNI officers investigating the deaths of three teenagers at a St Patrick’s Day disco in Cookstown has been “de-arrested”.
However, he remains in custody on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to the deaths of 17-year-old Lauren Bullock, 16-year-old Connor Currie and 17-year-old Morgan Barnard.
The teens were killed inthe incident outside the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown, Tyrone on Sunday night.
Yesterday, detectives from the PSNI Major Investigation Team arrested two men aged 52 and 40 on suspicion of manslaughter. They were taken into custody for questioning.
Detectives conducted a search of a house in Moneymore at the time and seized a number of items.

The 52-year-old man who was arrested yesterday was then further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.
However, this evening, the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team said he was de-arrested on that suspicion.
In a statement, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton explained: “As a consequence of the arrest of a person on suspicion of manslaughter a search was carried out at the home of the suspect. The search discovered a medium size clear polythene bag containing an amount of a white powdery substance and pieces of tin foil.
“This discovery led to the suspicion that the substance was a Class A drug.”
In line with normal procedure, he said, the suspect was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. “This arrest was communicated to the media in line with procedure,” he said.
“Given the gravity of the investigation the examination of the bag was carried out urgently,” Hamilton said.
However, once opened by the Forensic Science Agency for Northern Ireland “the substance inside the bag was ascertained to be an innocent substance”.
“The suspect was then de-arrested in respect of the drugs offence and a communication made to the media,” Hamilton said.
“We will continue to carry out a rigorous investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of these three young people and we are deeply grateful for the huge assistance we are receiving from the community and we hope that people will continue to come forward and assist us with this enquiry,” Hamilton said.
Appeals
At a press conference yesterday afternoon, detective chief superintendent Raymond Murray – who heads up the Serious Crime Branch – said: “Over a day into our investigation I can tell you we have already traced the identities of over 160 witnesses and have already spoken to a number of young people who were in the queue at the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night.”
Parents are being urged to talk to their children and encourage them to come forward to tell their stories to police so they can “get an accurate picture of events that night”.
Detectives can be contacted at the dedicated incident room at Dungannon police station by calling 101, extension 53055.

https://www.the42.ie/jimmy-dunne-steve-staunton-ireland-sunderland-4545372-Mar2019/,"UNTIL JIMMY DUNNE’S career settles into its groove, there will be endless comparisons to Steve Staunton.
Both from Dundalk, both De La Salle College alumni and both defenders.
Replicating the feats of the Liverpool legend is certainly something he’d love to achieve, 102 caps for Ireland et al, but there are key differences. For Dunne, to be within “touching distance” of his country’s senior squad is an achievement in itself given the hurdles he’s had to overcome.
After all, at 16 and not long into his spell at Manchester United, an injury plague set in leading to a double hip operation and 13 arduous months on the sideline. The mental toll, for one so young, was significant. On a compassionate level, in a crocked state far away from family and home, the experience was brutal.
“I’d totally moved my life for football, but all of a sudden I was living there and not playing football,” he tellsThe42. “It kind of felt almost pointless until I began my rehab.
“The toughest thing is the mental state it can leave you in, especially at that age. I know a lot of the older players have gone through it and know how to deal with it, but I found it really tough.

“My attitude, even now and as a young lad, was always ‘never-say-die’, I suppose, and I wanted to always make the point that I was capable of coming back from things. I think I’ll be like that for the rest of my career, if bumps arise in the road I want to be able to deal with them without letting them affect me too much.”
His courage is admirable and evidenced by the manner in which he has responded to having another tonne of bricks collapse on his dreams. The Louth man’s release by United “broke” him, leaving the side he had dreamed of playing for, the only club he knew. So near. So far.
Armed, however, with a determination that could be confused with stubbornness, a transfer to another Premier League outfit, Burnley, transpired and, while the topic didn’t enter the fray, the sense is that things couldn’t have worked out much better.
Seán Dyche, the Lancashire club’s unmistakable, gruffly-spoken coach, has given him a platform from which to forge a career that he’s grateful for, even if it’s contrary to the one he pictured when making the move across the water alongside Conor Masterson of Liverpool.

The pathway vision he was given view to at Turf Moor consisted of getting out on loan, which he has done — going firstly to non-league Barrow in the autumn of 2017 before catching the eye of League Two Accrington Stanley last January.
There, in the jaws of England’s Football League, a boy became a man.
It’s tough as a young defender, it’s hard to gain the respect of managers.

“A lot of players find themselves in a scenario where they have to go lower first and I needed to do that to gain my experience because you only really learn where you are at and how you can improve by playing games.
“The loan at Barrow was up and I was like: ‘Now, have I earned myself the opportunity to go and play at a higher level?’
“That’s where Accrington came in and I got that opportunity. I think they were seven [points] from the top at the time, but we went on a great run and that was my first taste of ‘I’m actually playing for more of a purpose than just myself’. It was like: ‘what do we want to do?’ ‘We want to win the league’.
“It means something to everyone and more than just me developing myself as a player. It was: ‘Shit, I have to become a man here. There are wages on the line, families, that kind of thing…’
“We had a great period and I kind of just got lost in that Stanley run.”
A title-winning run, ultimately, the biggest achievement in the club’s history, and done under former Sligo Rovers boss John Coleman.

Dunne’s physical edge, and competency on the ball, was a trademark of that spell, and something he remains recognisable for. But then his grounding was solid. The mutual background point of every great Irish defender has been their playing of GAA as a child and Dunne, a classy centre-forward for both club [Geraldines] and school up until United came calling, is no different in this sense.
“As wild and aggressive as the games are at the level I’ve been playing at over here, playing Gaelic growing up has been so beneficial and I absolutely loved it; it’s put me in better stead than anything else because it toughens you up.”
Thus, now at Sunderland and battling for promotion to the Championship, a Wembley date in a fortnight’s time, as glamorous as a Checkatrade Trophy final against Portsmouth sounds, hasn’t the deep-down impact one would imagine.
It’s no Croke Park… but it’s not bad,” he quips.
“It’s funny, I play with a lot of English lads who dreamt of playing at Wembley, I never dreamt or thought about it. I thought about Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium, so it does feel different for me, but it’s a massive occasion and still very exciting.”
And, in a way, it’ll crown a season which began at Hearts with a bolt to the summit of the Scottish Premiership. With the aim of getting out of his “comfort zone”, August interest from the Edinburgh giants yielded a six-month loan deal, during which time his displays earned him top reviews on a weekly basis. He scored a few goals, too, and had a Twitter page set-up in his honour.
All the while Dunne, who never played for Ireland at underage level, was being picked in Noel King’s U21 squad without getting game-time. His first cap, in any grade, came in last October’s European Championships qualifier against Germany, a 2-0 defeat, but Dunne’s form at club level hadn’t escaped the attention of senior boss Martin O’Neill, who called the towering centre-half into his final panel for November’s Nations League encounter with Denmark in Aarhus.

“I basically had no international football at a young age and it’s hard being 18 and playing for Man United every week wondering why I wasn’t being involved with my country, so it became something that I couldn’t focus my attention on.
“But the experience was great when it came. It’s valuable for a 21-year-old at the time to watch and see how players and managers react.

“You learn as much as you can from them so that in the future you’ll know what you’re doing more.
“I know I’m within touching distance and it’s nice to have that recognition from my country, to know that that’s something that can be there, even at this age, it gives me a taster of something that I really want to be involved in in the near future.”
Mick McCarthy then named him in his provisional squad for the upcoming European qualifiers, and while he didn’t make the 23-man cut, Dunne, without revealing too much, says that he knows where he stands.
This, it seems, provides comfort and allows him to concentrate at the immediate tasks at hand, Wembley and promotion.
Injury forced the early termination of his time at Tynecastle, but Jack Ross wasn’t shy in looking to take Dunne to Sunderland upon his recovery and he’s been a mainstay since January, ensuring that he remained in the international picture.
“Luton [league leaders] are obviously doing really, really well, but I wouldn’t say that it’d be impossible to catch them, with nine games and 27 points to play for, anything can happen,” he says of the Black Cats’ current situation.
“Wembley will be a really good occasion and we want to win it, of course, but getting the club promoted is a big deal.
Dunne completes his warm-up prior to Sunderland's recent league game against Luton Town.EMPICS SportEMPICS Sport
“Sunderland, they’re not in the position where the fans or anybody involved with the club wants them to be. But the Sunderland I know is the League One Sunderland, which is not the Sunderland the fans are familiar with.
Obviously, they’re bitter and upset that they’re not where they were two or three seasons ago. I wasn’t involved then and for the players that are here now, it’s about trying to push to get the club slightly closer to where it belongs.”
Thereafter, for Dunne, it’ll be about discovering where he belongs. The breakthrough of Dwight McNeil, a fellow ex-Man United youngster, gives him hope of making it at his parent club, even if the margins are so fine.
Nonetheless, his dramatic rise from Holker Street and Barrow to Wembley and Sunderland in less than 18 months suggests a player of real potential.
Staunton potential, who knows…

Crowds of housing protestors gathered outside government buildings on 30 OctoberLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
Since last summer, the country has seen an increase in activists raising awareness over housing issues, as the rental crisis in Ireland deepens and homelessness continues to increase.
Take Back The City (TBTC) over the summerheld numerous protestsin Dublin city centre, alongside a range of occupations of properties in the north inner city.
The National Homeless and Housing Coalition (NHHC), which is made up of trade unions, politicians and campaign groups, made headlines in October, after holding theRaise the Roof rallyin Dublin city centre alongside a number of other campaign groups, which saw thousands take to the streets.
Most recently, thousands turned out for a major rally held by NHHCon 1 Decemberin Dublin city. That rally was help to mark theanniversary of Jonathan Corrie, whose body was found in a Dublin doorway on 1 December 2014. His death sparked an increase in action from housing activists across the country.
Today’s demonstration kicks off in Dublin at three different locations at 2pm.
“There was a real push from the community groups and the grassroots groups that we work with here in Dublin that we needed to do something in Dublin to keep the momentum going because people are livid. People want to come out and express their anger,”  NHHC co-chairperson Tina MacVeigh toldTheJournal.ie.

MacVeigh said it will be “hard to say” whether today’s rally will be as large as previous ones.
Today’s rally will see three separate starting locations. The crowds will then march to a “surprise collection point”. MacVeigh wouldn’t reveal any details about the end location.

MacVeigh hit out at the recent homelessemergency accommodation figures for January, which showed that there are now a combined total of 9,987 people homeless and living in emergency accommodation in Ireland, a significant rise of 234 people from December.
She also criticised the “disgraceful” comments made by Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keeganlast monthin which he said people may be reluctant to leave homeless services in Dublin because they are now “an attractive” option.
“There’s always stuff that’s happening that’s making people really angry because it’s painfully obvious that the government is not shifting and is not doing anything in relation to advancing the solution, which is to build public housing on public land,” she said.
“People want to vent their anger at this continued reluctance by the government to do what the people want,” MacVeigh said.
Growing movement
This weekend’s rally will be the first major one since thousands took to the streets on 1 December.
When asked byTheJournal.ieif she thinks the housing and homelessness grassroots movement could be losing momentum, MacVeigh said: “Take Back The City movement was amazing last summer with the wave of protests that we saw and occupations. A lot of that was driven by a lot of students who have probably gone back into their college life. They’re organising themselves in their colleges.

“While there might not have been the obvious and visible manifestation of the grassroots work on the streets the way we saw last summer, those same groups are now actually in their communities doing the work that we need to do which is to build at a grassroots level.”
Now, a number of regional demonstrations have been planned nationwide in the lead up to a national rally in May, beginning with today’s in Dublin.
A Raise the Roof rally is taking place in Cork on Monday evening. MacVeigh said there are plans for rallies in around 12 other cities and towns nationwide over the next month.
Take Back The City campaigners on O'Connell Bridge on 22 SeptemberEamonn FarrellEamonn Farrell
The Raise the Roof rally in October was held to coincide with a debate in the Dáil on a private members bill on housing drafted and signed by 47 TDs from Sinn Féin, People Before Profit, Solidarity, Social Democrats, Labour, the Green Party, Independents4Change and others.
MacVeigh said today’s rally will highlight that motion which called for “practical measures to be put into place which would at least put a block or a stop to the spiralling out of control of the housing crisis”.
“The government have not listened and we need to be on the streets to say to the government the people spoke last year, not only on the streets but also through our elected representatives.
“Our voices manifested in that motion, the Dáil voted for it, you are ignoring it. We will not be ignored.”

LIVERPOOL WERE LEFT to regret two huge missed chances by Mohamed Salah as Everton held out for a 0-0 draw in the Merseyside derby on Sunday.
Jurgen Klopp’s men now trail champions Manchester City by a point at the top of the Premier League with nine games remaining.

Salah was denied by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and a last-ditch challenge by Michael Keane either side of half-time as Liverpool dropped points for the fourth time in six league games.
Fabinho was also guilty of wasting a big opportunity 21 minutes from time as Lucas Digne cleared when the Brazilian took an age to control Virgil van Dijk’s knockdown.
Everton remain without a win in the Merseyside derby in 20 matches stretching back to 2010, but may have done enough to stop their local rivals from winning the title for the first time in 29 years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jacinda-ardern-global-fight-against-racism-4551244-Mar2019/,"NEW ZEALAND PRIME Minister Jacinda Ardern has called for a global fight against racism and right-wing ideology following last week’s terror attack.
Fifty people were killed and dozens more injured in the mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday.
Victims’ funerals have now begun, with a father and sonamong the first peopleto be laid to rest.
Australian-born Brenton Tarrant (28) filmed himself carrying out the horrific attack. The self-professed white supremacist made awhite power symbolwhen in court.

A “manifesto” he released before the mass shooting is filled with racist vitriol, detailing two years of planning for the massacre.
In an interview withBBC News, Ardern spoke about the rise of right-wing nationalism and extremism. She said there is a responsibility “to weed it out where it exists and make sure that we never create an environment where it can flourish”.
“If we want to make sure globally that we are a safe and tolerant and inclusive world, we cannot think about this in terms of boundaries.”
‘A disgrace’
Ardern defended New Zealand’s record on accepting refugees, saying: “We are a welcoming country.
Over the weekend, a far-right Australia senator drew international condemnation for blaming the attack on immigration.

Ardern was among those to label Fraser Anning’s comments a “disgrace”, and the Australian government plans to censure him.
A cross-party motion condemns him for “inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion”.
Anningpunched a teenage boywho egged him over the remarks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lisa-smith-flanagan-4533188-Mar2019/,"MINISTER FOR JUSTICE Charlie Flanagan has said that the State will make “every effort” to bring Irish woman Lisa Smith – who has reportedly been detained in Syria – back home.
On Friday night, it emerged that Smith was held in northern Syria early this week and the Irish government has been contacted and is aware of the case.
So far, there has been no official confirmation of her identity, but it is understood she became radicalised and it is alleged she has links to the Islamic State terror group. It is also believed that Smith has a young son.
Flanagan toldRTÉ’s The Week in Politics today: “I understand there is an Irish citizen… She’s keen to come home. Every effort will be made by Irish authorities to ensure she gets home.”
He added it’s a very complex situation, and that the relevant facts must be ascertained before further steps are taken.

“I think it would be extremely difficult and challenging to have Irish people there,” Flanagan said referring to the possibility of sending officials there given it is in a conflict zone.
“I don’t believe any Irish citizens go there on their holidays,” he added.
Speaking generally, Flanagan said there was “strong robust legislation” in place for individuals who may have been involved with the Islamic State to face criminal charges here in Ireland.
Security sources have toldTheJournal.iethat the woman left the Defence Forces in 2011 and married a Muslim man. She had earlier converted to Islam. It is believed she left for Syria in 2015 after her initial marriage broke down.
It is understood she is currently being detained by the US armed forces based in northern Syria.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, a garda spokesperson said yesterday: “An Garda Síochána are aware of an Irish woman who left Ireland 3 or 4 years ago having become radicalised. She was previously a member of the Irish Defence Forces.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/casual-employment-laws-4523667-Mar2019/,"NEW LAWS HAVE come into effect today that aim to regulate hours given to those who are in casual employment.
The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 affects new and current employment contracts – here’s a breakdown of what it means.
The new laws ensure that workers are entitled to a written statement of their terms of employment within thefirst five daysof being hired, and much-criticisedzero-hour contractsare banned (except in cases where emergency cover needs to be provided or in short-term absences).
The new laws also mean that workers are entitled toa minimum paymentif they show up for work but are sent home without work; this would be equal to three times the national minimum hourly rate of pay or three times the minimum hourly rate of pay set out in an Employment Regulation Order.
Another new employment law change is theband of hours,which ensures that the contract a worker is on accurately reflects the hours they work.
Trade union the ICTU gives the following example to illustrate that last point: “if a worker’s contract guarantees 10 hours per week but for the last 12-month period the worker has worked an average 25 hours per week, they are entitled to be placed on a band of hours that guarantees them a minimum of 21 hours per week.”

Here are the band ranges so you can find out where your job fits on:
Other amendments to employment law means that employees on a temporary contract must be given the expected duration of the contract. If it’s a fixed contract they must be told the end date.
Two new offences are being introduced as part of the new laws:
Employees who aren’t given their core terms of employment in time can bring a claim to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). An employee must have one month’s continuous service with that employer before they are entitled to bring the claim.
The amendment also provides that the evidence that a witness gives at an unfair dismissal hearing at the WRC or Labour Court is privileged.  It also means that a witness who is compelled to attend the hearing or provide relevant information, and does not do so, is liable to prosecution.
From this month, a person starts their first job aged 20 or over must receive the full National Minimum Wage rate of €9.80 (training rates vary between €7.35 to €8.82 an hour for those aged 18 and over).

https://www.thejournal.ie/teenagers-e-cigarettes-vaping-flavours-4541056-Mar2019/,"TEENAGERS ARE MORE likely than older adult vapers to use fruit and sweet-flavoured e-cigarettes, a new study has found.
E-cigarettes were first introduced as a smoking cessation tool. However, vaping has skyrocketed among young people in the US to the point that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Surgeon General both recently declared youth e-cigarette use as an epidemic in the country.
The FDA recently requested information on the role flavours may play in both attracting youth to tobacco products and also transitioning traditional smokers to e-cigarettes.
A new US study, led by Samir Soneji, has looked at the types of e-cigarette flavours used by adolescent, young adult and older adult users and compared across these groups the availability of appealing flavours for e-cigarette use.
“The availability of appealing e-cigarette flavours was a more salient reason for vaping among adolescents and young adults than among older adults,” Soneji said.
The researchers also found that current cigarette smokers who tried to quit smoking in the past year were more likely than non-cigarette smokers to use tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes.
Common components of fruit and sweet-flavoured e-cigarettes may have negative impacts on lung function and may contribute to respiratory cell inflammation, respiratory disease and irritation when inhaled, the research noted.
“We are looking to determine if adolescents who vape sweet-flavoured e-cigarettes are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking than their counterparts who vape tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes,” Soneji said.
“On the other hand, we’ll determine if adult cigarette smokers who vape tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes are more likely to quit cigarette smoking than their counterparts who vape sweet flavoured e-cigarettes,” he said.
By providing information on flavour types, Soneji’s study could help the FDA and other regulatory agencies in refining effective e-cigarette regulation.

“Stricter regulation or banning of flavoured e-cigarettes, such as fruit and candy, can achieve the dual goal of reducing youth vaping while not burdening older adult cigarette smokers who use e-cigarettes to help quit,” he said.
Ireland’s stance
TheHealth Ireland Survey 2018reported that 4% of the Irish population currently use e-cigarettes and a further 12% have tried them at some point. A total of 9% of current smokers use e-cigarettes, with 10% of ex-smokers using them.
Due to the fact that e-cigarettes are not medical products or medical devices, they are not regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
The EU Tobacco Products Directive regulates certain aspects of e-cigarettes. These include setting safety and quality standards, making health warnings mandatory, introducing notification requirements for manufacturers and importers, imposing stricter rules on advertising and monitoring market developments.
Under regulations, a manufacturer or importer of an e-cigarette or refill container must submit a notification to the HSE of any such products they intend to place on the market.
The government’s policy on tobacco control is laid out within itsTobacco Free Irelandreport.
The report, which was published in 2013, notes that “there appears to be general consensus that there is a lack of research in relation to the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes and a lack of sufficient evidence that they aid with smoking cessation”.
Hiqa was commissioned by the Department of Health National Tobacco Control Advisor to conduct a health technology assessment of stop smoking interventions, including e-cigarettes.
It found in 2017 that there was “insufficient evidence at present to reliably demonstrate their effectiveness as an aid to stop smoking” and identified various concerns regarding long term safety profile and potential implications for youth initiation of smoking.
Further information from the HSE on e-cigarettes in Ireland can befound here.

https://www.the42.ie/graham-shaw-hockey-ireland-4525680-Mar2019/,"GRAHAM SHAW, WHO was named RTÉ manager of the year for masterminding Ireland’s historic World Cup silver medal-winning campaign last summer, has resigned from his role as women’s head coach.
In a shock announcement on Tuesday evening, Hockey Ireland confirmed Shaw’s departure from the post just three months out from the start of the Olympic qualifying tournament.
Shaw enjoyed huge success as Ireland women's head coach.Morgan Treacy / INPHOMorgan Treacy / INPHO / INPHO
Shaw, who was in charge of Ireland for four years, will take up a role as New Zealand women’s head coach.
The news is a huge blow for Hockey Ireland, who also lost long-serving men’s head coach Craig Fulton before last year’s World Cup, with Ireland set to begin their Tokyo 2020 qualification bid in June.

Under Shaw’s tutelage, Ireland jumped from 16th in the world rankings to eighth on the back of last year’s magical run to the World Cup final in London.
In a statement, the 40-year-old said: “It was an honour to coach my country and I am very grateful for the opportunity. We have had some incredible times together that I will never forget. I have worked with an outstanding staff over many years; your professionalism, honesty and friendship will stay with me forever.
“I would like to thank Hockey Ireland, Sport Ireland, SINI and Sport Northern Ireland for your unwavering support over the past years and long may it continue. I’d also like to recognise the staff of Hockey Ireland for all their work behind the scenes and their friendships over the past several years.
“To the players I would like to say a massive thank you. Your drive, dedication and loyalty has been relentless and it has been an absolute pleasure to lead the program over the past 4 years. I would like to wish the squad all the best for the future. I hope you continue on this journey, inspiring the next generation of hockey players in Ireland and I hope to see you in Tokyo.”
Ireland captain, Katie Mullan, added: “On behalf of the Green Army I would like to thank Graham for all that he has given to our team. He led us to a moment none of us will ever forget at the World Cup and the Blacksticks are very lucky to have him, we wish him all the best with this new adventure.”

Shaw’s reputation soared over the last 12 months and his appointment as the new Black Sticks coach is a reflection of that, as he and his young family prepare to move to New Zealand.

The position became available following the resignation of Mark Hager in early January and following ‘an extensive global search’, Hockey New Zealand this evening confirmed Shaw’s arrival.
“We were very pleased to attract such a high calibre of applicants, which was recognition of the team’s talent,” Hockey NZ board member, Shane Collins, said.
“Graham is a world-class coach and we are fortunate to have secured his services as we work towards qualifying for Tokyo 2020.”
Shaw will start his new role on 1 May, as Hockey Ireland begin the search for his successor ahead of June’s FIH Final Series tournament.

The body of McCormack (24) was discovered in a field on the Meath/Kildare border at Walterstown, Dunboyne in December 2017. He was shot dead.
McCormack’s car was parked at the Aldi supermarket in Clonee village at 5pm on the Friday before his body was discovered, gardaí said at the time.

After parking his car, McCormack got into a black saloon and this car then left the carpark and turned right towards Dunboyne, gardaí said.
Shortly after 6pm that day, gardaí in Finglas responded to a call that a black Audi saloon car was on fire just off the M50 at Meakstown Cottages. McCormack’s body was discovered the following afternoon.
McCormack was the son of Noel Kirwan who was shot dead in December 2016. His death is believed to be connected to the Hutch-Kinahan feud.
The man, who is in his 40s, was arrested by gardaí today in connection with McCormack’s murder. He is currently being detained under Section 4 of The Criminal Justice Act.
This is the second arrest in relation to the investigation. No charges have been made.

House of Commons Speaker John BercowPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
FOUR AMENDMENTS HAVE been selected ahead of tonight’s House of Commons vote on whether to extend Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
MPs are due to vote again in the House of Commons this evening at 5pm and will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
If the government’s motion is passed, the UK would not leave the EU on 29 March. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the motion will ask politicians to vote on a ‘short, limited, technical’ extension to Article 50 until 30 June, a day before the new EU parliament begins.
However, it would have to ask the EU if it could do so.
MPs had submitted 10 amendments to the motion, four of which have now been selected by House Speaker John Bercow for MPs to vote on.
The amendments will be voted on before the Prime Minister’s motion; if they’re passed, they will be added onto that motion, and that motion will be voted on at the end. This means that the Prime Minister’s motion may be dramatically altered, by one or all four amendments, the time MPs vote on it.
The four amendments are:
Amendment B was not selected, which aimed to reject a second referendum on the basis that it would be “divisive and expensive”.
Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk has said he will ask EU leaders to be open to allowing a “long extension” to Brexit if the UK needs time to rethink its leaving strategy.

Tusk tweeted that he “will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.
During my consultations ahead of#EUCO, I will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its#Brexitstrategy and build consensus around it.— António Costa (@eucopresident)March 14, 2019Donald Tusk/ Twitter
During my consultations ahead of#EUCO, I will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its#Brexitstrategy and build consensus around it.
Tusk’s comments come ahead of tonight’s vote. As president of the European Council, he will be the host of a 21 March summit in Brussels that may be asked to decide whether to push back Britain’s 29 March departure from the Union.
May said that to get such an extension, there would have to be a deal in place, and that the only deal on offer is the current Withdrawal Agreement.
She said that parliament needs to accept that the only other option open to them if that motion is rejected is to opt for a much longer extension.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said a long extension is most likely and that Ireland won’t be an obstacle to an extension – but some other member states will be “quite demanding”.
He added that he got a courtesy call from his UK counterpart before they published theno-deal tariff plan yesterday morningand that the plan galvanised the EU to continue to back Ireland and the backstop.
The House of Commonslast night voted against a no-deal Brexitwith 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time. A total of 278 MPs voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
During last night’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as May had proposed.
A total of 312 voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while 308 voted against the amendment.

https://www.the42.ie/birmingham-fan-jailed-for-jack-grealish-attack-4535370-Mar2019/,"
A BIRMINGHAM FAN who punched Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish during a highly-charged derby in the English Championship was jailed for 14 weeks and banned from football stadiums for 10 years on Monday.
Grealish was attacked by Paul Mitchell in a shocking incident during Sunday’s clash between the bitter local rivals at St Andrew’s.
Mitchell sprinted onto the pitch in the 10th minute of the derby, punching Grealish from behind and sending him sprawling to the turf.
The 27-year-old was eventually led away by stewards, while the visibly shaken Grealish was able to continue playing and eventually scored Villa’s second-half winner.
On Monday, Mitchell pleaded guilty to assault and invading the pitch when he appeared at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court.
Advertisement
As well as his prison sentence and stadium ban, Mitchell was ordered to pay £100 ($130) to Grealish as compensation for the pain, discomfort and shock caused by the assault.
Passing sentence, magistrate Alison Fisher told Mitchell: “This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable — a view shared by your own football club.
“Mr Grealish has stated that he was shocked and scared and feels lucky that it wasn’t worse. Players such as Mr Grealish are entitled to protection. We have therefore gone outside of our guidelines in the interests of justice.”
Birmingham welcomed Mitchell’s sentencing and confirmed he has been banned from their stadium, and from buying tickets for away games, for life.
Another Birmingham fan who tweeted abuse at Grealish has also been banned.
“The club can confirm that Mr Mitchell is banned from our home ground, the St. Andrew’s Trillion Trophy Stadium, for life. And nor will he have access to purchase tickets for away games involving Birmingham City Football Club, or have tickets purchased on his behalf.
“The club has also banned another supporter for life for a series of vile and malicious tweets on social media, relating to Jack Grealish and his family.

“The individual in question remains the subject of an ongoing investigation by West Midlands Police.
“Birmingham City FC rejects all forms of anti-social behaviour. We will not tolerate the kind of incidents we have seen during and since Sunday’s derby fixture against Aston Villa Football Club.”

WHILE MICK MCCARTHY has been understandably keen to avoid the prospect of idle minds neglecting tomorrow’s game against Gibraltar in order to focus on Tuesday’s home clash with Georgia, those outside the camp can afford to take a wider view.
One such figure is Richard Dunne, who believes that it is vital Ireland begin the campaign with two wins out of two in order to steel themselves for the upcoming challenges of Switzerland and Denmark.
“I think it’s a given really that we will be aiming for six from six”, Dunne toldThe42.
“Every team in the group will be going to Gibraltar to win and with the Georgia game being at home, I think it would be disappointing if we didn’t come away with six points.”
Given that Ireland are third seeds in a five-team group, the incipient double-header is the only one in which they’ll play consecutive games against sides ranked below them.

While both Switzerland and Denmark are strong opposition – the Swiss are perennial qualifiers, while the Danes have recently taken up residence in the darker parts of our memories  – Dunne believes neither opponents are to be feared.
“They are tough games but if you can get off to that good start it just gives you confidence going into it.
“The teams in the group are strong, solid sides but they are not teams that I think we have to massively fear.
“We’re not a million miles away from their level so I don’t think we have reason to be fearful and this is a good opportunity.”
Switching attention to the more immediate challenge of Gibraltar on Saturday evening, Dunne believes a good result and a vibrant performance is vital in stirring the Aviva’s sleeping ears to cheer on Tuesday night.
Given last year’s miserable fare, the ground was often deathly silent, and the last Irish game at the ground ended in a cascade of boos for the now-ousted Martin O’Neill.
“I think the whole thing is sort of down in the dumps”, says Dunne.

“We’re not scoring goals, we’re not exciting the fans.
“But we have a great opportunity to score some goals against Gibraltar and excite the fans, and let it spill into the Georgia game
“A lot of it is down to the players and how they are seen by the fans. If Mick can do what he did in 2002 and he can build that camaraderie among the group and let them grow as people, and have fun and enjoy themselves, then the fans will see it on the pitch.
“We have to make sure we are as positive as possible.”

Last November UUP councillor Chris McGimpsey appeared on BBC Radio Ulster where he made remarks about James McClean.
McClean, through his solicitors, brought a defamation action against McGimpsey , who today unreservedly apologised for his words.

In a statement this evening, McClean’s solicitor’s said: “During the course of the hearing , UUP councillor Chris McGimpsey , through his legal representative, issued an unreserved apology to Mr McClean.
“In the course of that apology that was out in full, it was advanced that the offending statement made on BBC Radio Ulster on 7 November 2018 was false and completely inaccurate, and failed to consider the implication of his defamatory remark.
“The apology, whilst given four months since the comments were made, is welcomed. The level of damages that require to be awarded have yet to be assessed, and we are confident that this process will reflect the seriousness and gravity of the offending comments.
“Whilst this case was unnecessary and avoidable, it allows our client to demonstrate that he will protect and uphold his reputation and good name at every opportunity and with all of the determination that he displays as a professional footballer.”

Aaron CampbellPolice ScotlandPolice Scotland
A 16-YEAR-OLD boy has admitted raping and murdering a six-year-old girl during his sentencing hearing, after he initially pleaded not guilty during his trial.
Aaron Campbell was sentenced today to life in prison, and will serve a minimum of 27 years for kidnapping, raping and murdering Alesha McPhail in July 2018,Sky News reported.
Her body was discovered in a wooded area later. Campbell was latercharged with her murder, but due to reporting restrictions because of his age, his name wasn’t releaseduntil a judge in Glasgow lifted reporting restrictions in February.
Campbell had denied throughout his trial being responsible for Alesha’s disappearance and murder.
During sentencing, Judge Lord Matthews remarked that Campbell had to stop himself laughing at points during the trial, and had never shown remorse.

The judge said that reintegration and rehabilitation are “remote possibilities”.
The court had heard how Alesha was kidnapped from her bed in her grandparents’ home in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute just after 6am on 2 July 2018.
Her body was found just before 9am in a woodland area. A post-mortem revealed she had suffered 117 injuries.
After he was reported to police by his mother, Campbell was arrested and his DNA was later found on Alesha’s body and on items of her clothing.
Campbell had pinned the blame for Alesha’s death on the girl’s parents.
In an earlier statement, Police Scotland’s Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said that Alesha’s death was “senseless and barbaric” and in what was a “particularly harrowing case”.
“The effects of her death are still being felt today,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-delaney-bridging-loan-unusual-4552606-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has described a bridging loan given to the FAI by its own chief executive John Delaney as “a bit unusual”.
Delaney said he issued his employers a personal cheque worth €100,000 in April 2017 which he described as  “a once-off bridging loan to the Association to aid a very short-term cash flow issue”.
Delaney said that the money was repaid in full in June 2017, and that it was the only occasion on which he issued the Association with a loan.
He further addressed the loan in a second statement published by the FAI last week, in which he said he acted in the FAI’s best interests.
Speaking outside Government Buildings this evening, Varadkar said: “It is a matter for the FAI but it does seem a bit unusual that a body of that size given its operations and the funding it receives. I would have thought [it] had banking facilities that would have provided for a loan. I know that Sport Ireland and the joint committee of the Oireachtas will want to ask questions about that.”
Sport Irelandyesterday said it was seeking “urgent clarification” surrounding details of the loan.

The statutory authority released a statement to clarify that it had not received any notification regarding a reduction in the association’s financial position.
“Sport Ireland has written to the President of the Football Association of Ireland seeking urgent clarification from the Board of the FAI on media reports concerning a loan to the organisation by its Chief Executive, including the circumstances of the loan and its repayment,” the statement read.
“Sport Ireland was not notified at any stage in 2017 about any apparent material deterioration in the FAI’s financial position, as per Sport Ireland’s Terms and Conditions of Grant Approval, and has sought additional clarification in relation to this matter.”
In a statement this evening the FAI said:
“The FAI has answered all queries raised in the letter from Mr Treacy and looks forward to his response.
“The FAI are also willing to meet with Minister Ross and Sport Ireland to discuss these matters further.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/guns-heroin-trial-michael-brady-4537989-Mar2019/,"A DUBLIN MAN has gone on trial at the Special Criminal Court charged with possessing an assault rifle, ammunition and almost €3 million worth of drugs in a Kildare town two years ago.
Michael Brady (54), with an address at Brookfield Grove, Blackrock, Co Dublin is charged with possessing €1.5 million worth of cocaine, €1.26 million worth of heroin, an assault rifle and more than 180 rounds of ammunition at Sallins Bridge, in Sallins, Co Kildare on 24 January 2017.
Arraigned before the non-jury Special Criminal Court today, Brady pleaded not guilty to all nine counts on the indictment.
Opening the State’s case, prosecuting lawyers told the three-judge court that the property at Sallins Bridge was under surveillance as part of a wider garda operation concerning activities at Greenogue Business Park, Rathcoole, Co Dublin.
Fiona Murphy SC, for the DPP, said Brady was seen emerging from the premises at Sallins Bridge in a grey Volkswagen Golf at around 2pm on the day in question. He was stopped and arrested under the Road Traffic Act in Naas, where he provided a false name “Declan Brady”.
Murphy said two live rounds of ammunition were found during an initial search at Sallins Bridge.
As a result, Brady was rearrested and detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.

She said the owner of the property at Sallins Bridge came to clear out the premises four days later, on January 28. Murphy said the owner found what appeared to be a large amount of controlled drugs and a firearm at the base of one of the beds.
A further search warrant was obtained and gardaí found €1.5 million worth of cocaine, €1.26 million worth of heroin and €1,000 worth of cannabis.
Gardaí also seized a 7.62 x 39mm calibre VZ 58 assault rifle and a variety of ammunition.
It is the State’s case that forensic evidence links Brady to some of the items found and to the address itself, Murphy said.
The trial begins today before Mr Justice Paul Coffey, presiding alongside Judge Gerard Griffin and Judge David McHugh.
Brady pleaded not guilty to possessing cocaine and heroin for sale or supply under Section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act as well as a number of other drugs offences.
He also pleaded not guilty to possession of a 7.62 x 39mm calibre VZ 58 assault rifle in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he did not have it for a lawful purpose.
He also pleaded not guilty to possession of a significant amount of ammunition.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-is-brexit-advancing-the-cause-of-scottish-independence-from-the-uk-4525351-Mar2019/,"GIVEN THE CALAMITOUS state of the UK’s negotiation of its withdrawal from the European Union, the fairly comprehensive Brexit referendum result in Scotland, and the relatively small gap in the opinion polling evidence on Scottish independence, you could be forgiven for wondering – ‘what are the Scots waiting for’?
However, closer inspection of the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) handling of Brexit, considered alongside some of the tensions on ‘home turf’ exposes a real strategic paradox for the SNP.
The SNP leaderNicola Sturgeon regularlysays that she will announce plans for a second independence referendum, but has yet to do so.
During the independence referendum in 2014, Scots were warned that by voting in favour of independence they would be putting at risk their membership of the EU and the SNP won the Scottish Parliament election on a manifesto commitment that said that if Brexit were to go ahead they would push for another independence referendum.
That is if Scotland were to be ‘dragged’ out of the EU against its will (which it will be), and the views of the Scottish Government or Scottish Parliament are ignored, they would have grounds to demand a re-run of the independence referendum.
But the problem is that support for independence has not really increased beyond its 2014 level of 45% – and the appetite for another vote is fairly low.
Much to the disbelief and angst of many in the SNP’s, they do not appear to be any closer to winning such a vote, even in the extraordinary political times we’re living in.
The reality for the SNP, since 24 June 2016, has been far from straightforward and rife with strategic indecisiveness.
To make sense of this, it’s important to consider the parallel universe the SNP was hoping for as opposed to the one in which it now finds itself.
Challenges
When Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland in 2014, there was supposed to be a well-deserved break from the previous two years of independence-mania.
Her focus was to be on governing Scotland and taking the time (a long time) to examine the detailed reasons for their narrow defeat.
The problem with this strategy was that the membership of the SNP doubled as a result of the independence referendum and many of those members are itching for another ballot.
Nicola Sturgeon shares this woe with any nationalist leader in power – the need to reconcile the two, often mutually exclusive imperatives of governing domestically but advancing constitutional nationalism for your base.
Fast forward to the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, just two months before the EU referendum, and just a year after the unprecedented whitewash result for the SNP in the 2015 General Election.
Nicola Sturgeon is returned as First Minister with a greater share of the vote, albeit with fewer seats, on a manifesto which neatly dealt with the issue of independence.
Whilst the time was not yet right for another vote, if the situation were to materially change, for example by Scotland voting to remain in the EU but the rest of the UK voting to leave, then it would be a different story.
Of course, the problem arose when that material change, well, materialised.
The maths
Rushed into making a political decision in a matter of hours that would ultimately define her career, Nicola Sturgeon fired the starting gun on independence in the hope that the national sense of outrage and injustice would see a surge in the polls for a ‘Yes’ vote on Scottish independence.
But other than a brief increase to 59% the Sunday immediately after the vote, such a surge has not transpired.
Since then the SNP has found itself navigating a set of tricky currents in the ‘Yes’ movement.
There are some within the party who believe the chaos of a ‘no deal’ Brexit could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for many soft Scottish Unionists who voted Remain.
But then there are others who believe that the movement has not learned the lessons from the previous effort, and isn’t prepared for another vote.
The voter arithmetic is very complex.
One of the main problems is that one in three SNP voters actually voted to leave the European Union, and almost a quarter of those voters, knowing the SNP’s policy is for an Independent Scotland to immediately rejoin the EU have now switched their allegiance to a UK outside the EU.
Contrary to initial expectations, the so-called“Yes Leavers”(those who voted in favour of independence from both the UK and the EU) have offset the soft Remain ‘No’ voters who now favour independence in order to stay in the EU.
Those two cohorts have effectively replaced each other, meaning there has been little or no overall swing in favour of independence.
This dilemma explains the same constructive ambiguity on independence that the SNP has used to batter the Labour leadership on its Brexit position – although this ambiguity caused the SNP significant losses in the 2017 snap General Election.
As such, the SNP position on Brexit has evolved alongside its thinking on independence.
At one point, the First Minister travelled to London to make the case for what effectively formed the basis of Tory backbencher, Nick Boles’Norway Plus model,which envisaged that Britain could leave the EU but remain in the single market.
But when that proposal eventually got to the House of Commons some Scottish National Party MPs refused to back it.
Now the SNP’s favoured Brexit route is another referendum or People’s Vote.
Many in the party are deeply uncomfortable with this position given that it’s a slippier slope than Ben Nevis on a cold day because of the likely difficulties in successfully negotiating a Scottish withdrawal agreement from the UK.
Scottish Independence in the context of Brexit is Nicola Sturgeon’s Schrödinger’s Cat – it’s both alive and dead depending on who you ask.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-tds-vindicated-as-parliamentary-privilege-was-protected-in-dennis-obrien-case-4524800-Mar2019/,"LAST WEEK, THE Supreme Court issued a surprising judgment in the Angela Kerins case, holding that it was willing to oversee statements in Oireachtas committees in some limited circumstances.
The court foundthat the Public Accounts Committee acted “significantly outside its remit” in its questioning of former Rehab CEO, Angela Kerins.
But Denis O’Brien’s claim, which theSupreme Court dismissed today, was a step too far.
The Kerins case showed that there is no absolute bar on the courts overseeing the conduct of Oireachtas committees.
However, the O’Brien case shows that there is a near-absolute bar on courts ruling on privileged speech in parliament.
O’Brien claimed that statements made by two TDs in the Dáil, Catherine Murphy and Pearse Doherty, had violated his right to privacy by revealing information related to his banking arrangements.
The subject matter of the comments was, at the time, also under consideration in another High Court case where O’Brien was seeking to prevent RTE from broadcasting similar information.
The core of O’Brien’s appeal to the Supreme Court was that this incident had not been dealt with properly by the Committee on Privilege and Procedure (CPP), which found that the TDs had not abused their privilege.
O’Brien asked for the courts to declare that this process was inadequate.
This claim raised major issues about the scope of Oireachtas privilege.
Article 15.13 of the Constitution says that parliamentarians “shall not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself”.
That is, TDs and Senators are not answerable to courts for what they say in parliament; they are answerable to their peers in the Oireachtas.
If they abuse their privilege, the CPP can investigate statements of this sort and if appropriate, impose sanctions. This is a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers.
O’Brien argued in the Supreme Court that he was not trying to make the individual TDs answerable in court, but rather asking the court to review whether the Oireachtas’ procedure for dealing with abuse of privilege in the CPP was inadequate.
Advertisement
But the Supreme Court said that even this, it could not do.
O’Brien’s case was an “indirect or collateral challenge” to the statements made by the TDs in the Oireachtas.
The effect of a successful challenge to the committee on procedure would be to suggest or require a reconsideration of TDs’ statements.
In practice, the Court reviewing the CPP’s process would indirectly interfere with parliamentary speech, the very thing that the constitutional protection is designed to avoid.
This, the Court said, would be “a breach of Article 15.13 and would amount to an impermissible departure from the separation of powers.”
The Court admitted that rights might, from time to time, be violated by parliamentarians invoking privilege and there would be nothing judges could do.
That is not to say the rights are unimportant or unprotected, but rather that the Oireachtas has a “constitutional obligation to protect the rights of citizens in respect of that which transpires within the Houses themselves.”
The duty to defend these rights lies with the Oireachtas rather than the courts, and we have to trust the Oireachtas to perform this task well.
The Court did not quite say that intervention would never be possible.
However, that was far from the case here, and so the Court deferred considering this matter unless and until such an extreme circumstance arose.
The Supreme Court’s judgment is not surprising. This case went to the very core of parliamentary privilege and the very heart of the separation of powers.
It would also have had potentially significant consequences for freedom of parliamentary speech.
In the end, this judgment leaves the responsibility for policing Oireachtas privilege in the hands of our parliamentarians, who must use their powers responsibly, and acts as a check on any peers who do not.
If we are unhappy with how this is done – if we feel privilege is being abused or rights being violated – then we, the people, must demand change by lobbying our politicians or using our power at the ballot box.

VENEZUELA’S OPPOSITION LEADER Juan Guaidó returned to the capital Caracas today despite the threat of arrest from President Nicolas Maduró’s regime.
The self-declared interim leader left Venezuela 10 days ago in an unsuccessful bid to force through humanitarian aid stockpiled in neighbouring Colombia. He then went on a tour of regional allies Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Ecuador.
When he left Venezuela on 23 February, Guaidó said the military had helped him cross the border into Colombia, even though he was under a travel ban.
Tensions in the South American country have grown since 23 January when Guaidó declared himself president and called for fresh elections.
His reappearance in Venezuela poses a direct challenge to socialist Maduró, who must now decide whether to arrest Guaidó for defying a travel ban – thereby provoking strong international condemnation – or allow him to enter, undermining his own authority.

“We know the risks we face, that’s never stopped us. The regime, the dictatorship must understand,” Guaidó, who is supported by more than 50 countries, told a large crowd this afternoon.
Just before his arrival, US Vice President Mike Pence sent a warning to Maduró to ensure Guaidó’s safety.
“Any threats, violence, or intimidation against him will not be tolerated and will be met with swift response,” Pence wrote on Twitter.

So perhaps it is unsurprising then, that when The Beatles played Dublin in 1963 John Lennon declared on behalf of the whole band: “We’re all Irish”.
In the years that followed Lennon would record ‘The Luck of the Irish’ and ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’, while Paul McCartney sang: ‘Give Ireland back to the Irish’.
The Liverpool-Irish influence on John and the other Beatles is best understood once you realise that in the middle of the 19th century there were more Irish-born people living in Liverpool than in Limerick or Derry.
Liverpool had the fourth highest population of Irish born people of any city in the world, coming only after Dublin, Cork and Belfast.
The steady expansion of the city and its Irish contingent meant that by the 1890s, Liverpool had become the largest Roman Catholic diocese in England with over 400,000 Catholic citizens, one-fifth of the total Catholic population of Britain.
And in testament to the strength of faith within the city, previous to the outbreak of the Second World War, three Catholic parishes in the city offered confession as Gaeilge.
So why wasn’t the Irish influence on this global phenomenon that was The Beatles ever recognised?
An important element of the biography,The Making of John Lennon,is examining the effect that that Irish working-class culture had on the formation of The Beatles.
In 1964, at their first press conference in the US, The Beatles bewildered the American media with their irreverence and offbeat sense of humour; all of which had their roots in the Liverpool/Irishness of Scouse culture.
As Journalist Paul Morley observed: “Liverpool is always on guard”.
Advertisement
“They know that the English look up and over with suspicion and doubt, stumped by the language, needled by the snappy, mongrel confidence, outmanoeuvred by the fast logic-shredding wit.”
Liverpool has always had a deep-seated historical Celtic connection– the city sits with its back to mainland Britain, looking out instead to the Atlantic Ocean; so much so that the Mersey was viewed as an inland river of the Irish Sea.
This combined with its sense of otherness and the outlook of defiance that existed in Liverpool’s inner-city population’s irreverence to status, radical and verbal gymnastics, fitted John like a glove.
His search for rebellion was nurtured by his embrace of Liverpool’s Irish influence and the dynamic effect of the city’s seafarer culture via the movement of ideas across oceans.
Said Lennon:
Its seafaring internationalism made Liverpool open to exotic, non-English ideas. As a port of world status, it had the confidence to ‘choose’ its own nation-state. It wasn’t only England.
Although young John was not a Scouse in the true sense of the word, he readily threw himself into a world of poverty, shebeens, and communities of sharp-tongued, hard-faced, generous, quick-witted and quick-tempered people.
A world that was sensitive to injustice, was rowdy and was rock ‘n roll. The world of docklands Liverpool- this was the life that John wanted.
By the time The Beatles achieved fame the City and Port were past their peak which was not lost on John. He said:
The whole notion of being an outcast, in a city full of outcasts, located in a last refuge seaport, appealed to John.
Francis Kenny is the author of The Making of John Lennon, which is out now published by Indiana University Press.
The Making of John Lennonexamines the all-encompassing Irishness of Liverpool’s influence on Lennon and his traumatic childhood as well as the genius of the The Beatles and their bitter and prolonged breakup.","7.01am, 18 Mar 2019",

At a special sitting of Ennis District Court, Judge Marie Keane remanded both Ken Mayers (82) Monte Alto Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico and Tarak Kauff (77) of Arnold Drive, Woodstock, New York in custody after refusing bail applications for both.
Judge Keane said that the two are facing “very serious charges”.
Judge Keane refused bail after Inspector Tom Kennedy said that the State was objecting to bail for each accused.
Kennedy expressed concerns that if both men were granted bail, the two accused will leave the State for the US and not be answerable to the charges before the court.
Solicitor for the two Daragh Hassett said his clients assure him that they are “men of honour who have served in the US defence forces and will return to Ireland for their cases”.
Kennedy said that the incident involving the two men at Shannon Airport held up airport operations for 45 minutes yesterday morning.
Kennedy said that there was a demonstration by anti-war activists taking place at Shannon yesterday.
Refusing the two bail, Judge Keane said: “I have to take into account the two travelled to Ireland less than one week ago and have been apprehended relating to an alleged breach of security at an international airport.
Judge Keane said that she noted that the two men have exemplary records and are veterans of the US defence forces.
The two men are likely to be held on remand at Limerick prison unless they can secure High Court bail before their cases are dealt with.

Criminal damage
In the case, the two are charged with causing €2,500 worth of criminal damage to the airport perimeter fence at Shannon Airport and unlawful trespass into a taxi-way at Shannon Airport yesterday.
A small number of supporters – who later held banners outside court containing ‘anti-war’ slogans – were there to support the two men in court.
Giving evidence of arrest, charge and caution, Garda Noel Carroll said that Kauff replied “not guilty” when charged and Mayers made no reply.
Kennedy said that two arrived in Ireland last Wednesday and Garda Carroll said that the two were due to fly out of Dublin to the US on Wednesday.
Garda Carroll said that it will be alleged that the two were spotted crossing a runway at Shannon on their way to inspect a military aircraft after 10am yesterday morning.
Garda Carroll said that a cutter and gloves were found at a large hole in the airport security fence.
Solicitor for the two, Daragh Hassett said that there is no evidence that the two were involved in cutting the fence.
Hassett said that an alternative to allowing the two fly back to the US was that the two could reside with friends locally. He said that the two would give up their passports which would effectively ground them.
Hassett said that similar cases have been going forward to the circuit court on indictment.
Kennedy said that the State would be seeking a two month adjournment to allow the State get directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
Judge Keane remanded the two in custody to appear via video link from prison at Ennis District Court on Wednesday.

Friday, 15 March has been named as an international day of action on climate change, with students across the world staging a demonstration.
The issue was raised in the Dáil yesterday by Solidarity TD Paul Murphy, who spoke about climate change and the planned demonstration and asked the Taoiseach if he supported the students’ action.
“I note that 15 March has been named as the date for a global school student strike action. School students in Ireland will, hopefully, join that in large numbers,” Murphy said.
“The contrast of those young people with the inaction of the world’s leaders could not be starker.
Varadkar said that he would listen to the concerns of students.

“The fact that young people are taking action, protesting and are going to strike and take a break from school on 15 March is good,” he said.
“It is welcome. Unlike the deputy, I do not see it as a party political matter. It is quite different, and I have heard what they have said. These are young people standing up to adults.
“They are children, pupils and students telling all the adults in all parties to get our act together and to do more about climate change because it is their future that is in jeopardy.
Varadkar said that people in socialist parties like Paul Murphy’s should also listen as they are “climate tax deniers” who “deny the fact that a carbon tax or climate charge must be part of the solution to climate change”.
“We know that a carbon charge alone will not solve climate change but we equally know, and the science tells us, that without it we cannot achieve our objectives.  It must be part of the solution,” Varadkar said.
Murphy and his party colleague Ruth Coppinger called for the government to work towards cutting the country’s carbon emissions.
Murphy said that students next week should take Varadkar’s comments “as a green light to walk out next Friday week in protest against climate inaction”.
Following the taoiseach’s comments, a government spokesperson said he was commenting on the students’ “enthusiasm”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/construction-brexit-housing-crisis-4524909-Mar2019/,"RESEARCH BY THE Construction Industry Federation (CIF) has raised concerns that Brexit could hamper the response to the housing crisis by making construction more expensive.
The survey gauged the Brexit preparation of CIF members and found significant concern about spiralling costs in both the supply chain and in penalties due to Brexit induced delays.
It found that 42% believed that Brexit will have an immediate negative impact on their businesses.
“In the immediate term post-Brexit, the supply-chain will be extremely challenged to absorb costs and many companies have already been struggling with increasing input and labour costs in the industry with minimal cost recovery,” CIF director general Tom Parlon said in a message to members.
“With house building so tenuous outside the greater Dublin area, even minimal Brexit-driven increases could be the difference between securing development finance or otherwise,” Parlon added.

In further CIF warnings that accompanied the survey, the importance of the building sector in dealing with Ireland’s housing crisis is stressed and it is noted that it is critical that the industry is “both Brexit ready and proof”.
As well as the potential problems thrown up by an increase in costs, the CIF has also warned that Brexit could pose a problem in the access to skilled workers.
The survey of members found that just under a quarter feared problems in assessing the required talent after Brexit.
“A reduction, however limited, in an already small pool of skilled workers, will cause huge strain in an industry with a decade-long pipeline of activity,” the report states.
Business group Ibec said in January that between 80,000-100,000workers would be needed to meet government construction targetsand estimated that there is a shortfall of between 60,000 to 80,000.
Ibec suggested that there would need to be a significant growth in the number of non-Irish construction workers coming here to bridge that gap.
In its report, CIF said it did not envisage an influx of construction workers coming from the UK post-Brexit and that an increased demand for workers “will intensify the war for labour and talent in the sector”.

Connacht announced his exit in mid-April and Browne resolved to get his body freshened up over summer. He could have prolonged his career by leaping at offers from clubs in England and France, but there was just nothing that seemed worth uprooting himself from Galway and hitting the hard trail of the journeyman.
“They’re not looking for a 31-year-old second row who’s had quite a lot of injuries,” Browne tellsThe42.
And so he waited, immersing himself in the in-between stage.
“I wanted to take a bit of a break away from it. Get the body in order, but also reignite the fire to keep playing.
“I went away on holiday, got a couple of decent offers, nothing spectacular, but thinking about it was nearly ruining my holiday. So I said ‘no’ to them and thought: ‘I’m obviously not ready yet. I’ll take a bit more time’. Then the longer that went on the less and less I wanted to go back playing.
“Your body does get better, but your mind is saying: ‘no, I couldn’t imagine now, going into pre-season. I couldn’t imagine going into rugby training’ and stuff like that.”
Some players feel something almost akin to Stockholm syndrome when they are left to their own devices. No tight schedule laid out, diet restrictions lapse and even a day’s clothing suddenly becomes a choice. No more club suit, no navy training gear on a Monday, but grey in European week.
It was different for Browne. He thoroughly enjoyed the freedom and, in hindsight, he reckons his subconscious had already made its mind up. Though at the time, he would insist that he wasn’t retired and there was still a full array of options.
“I was losing weight at a rapid rate as well. There’s no real reason to keep it on.
“‘I’m not playing rugby at the minute, if I did go back I could easily put it back on,’ telling myself that. Knowing the reality is it’s not that easy.”
On he rolled to the autumn, and perhaps the sight of a new season in full swing brought the realisation to him.
“‘I’m pretty happy where I am at the minute,’” he said to himself and those closest, no need to alert the masses with a screenshot of his Notes app, “I’m happy to leave my rugby-playing career behind and move on.”
Putting rugby behind him was easy. The sticking point was the same one experienced by so many retired athletes from team sports. After 11 years at the heart of a seriously close-knit and energetic community that is a sporting changing room – quite literally in a pack – post-rugby the player becomes very much an entity unto himself.

Last week, Browne linked up with Rugby Players Ireland, Marcus Horan and fellow former Connacht men JP Cooney and Ronan Loughney to chat about their post-playing experience with the current crop at the Sportsground – many of whom won’t see the end of this dream job coming.
Rugby is not a career to sustain you for life, though, and matters of finance were his key point when speaking to the current squad.
“The big thing we tried to get across in the transition talk last week was that there might be a period when you don’t go straight into work. Probably the majority of rugby players leaving the game at the minute don’t necessarily know what they’re going to do. So there’ll be a time when they’re not bringing in any money.
The temporary solution during this point of transition is the obvious one. After 13 years in work, Browne has been collecting the dole to keep him from fully eating into whatever savings he gathered
“It’s a long way from rugby, financially, but any rugby player or anyone, shouldn’t have a problem going on social welfare. Especially if you’ve worked for so many years, you’ve earned a lot of that money back.”
He is far from fully removed from rugby, becoming increasingly enamoured with coaching after bringing his insights to Galwegians’ defence and line-out. But the very act of talking through his current state of affairs with former peers and fellow former pros was a benefit for Browne.

“It helped even just chatting about it. Marcus, Locks, JP and myself all went down different routes. It was a good idea by Rugby Players Ireland to have that and give players the impression of what it might be like when you finish — it’s good to let them know it’s not all bad when you finish rugby, but also to prepare for that time as well.”
***
Browne’s regular refrain is that there was no one day, no one instance when he became retired. The tag just formed itself gradually; an ‘i’ one week, an ‘r’ the next, then a ‘t’ and the new era before him dawned.
He knew he was a former player when Fionn Carr extended an invitation to play in the annual legends get-together/ tournament in Bermuda. He was keeping himself very fit and not long removed from rugby, so it sounded like a cakewalk. And he happily jetted  off to the Caribbean ready to run riot.
“‘Yeah this would be nice going out for a bit of a runaround,’” he thought, “I had visions of making big massive breaks and stuff like that.
“You get out there, get some contact and you’re sucked into a maul at one stage.
“That was the nail in the coffin to really assure me my rugby playing days were up.”
Those playing days were a hell of a journey. Browne has played and battled through some of the western province’s lowest ebbs and also the most sensational high. A Pro12 final victory over Leinster in Edinburgh was the most glorious glittering chapter for anyone connected to the club.
It was an unbelievable feat to witness. Imagining it was no small struggle either.
“I remember when Pat (Lam) came in and his vision was to make Connacht the best team in Ireland in five years. We all rowed behind it and said ‘yeah great’. But deep down I don’t think anyone fully believed it.”

Belief or not, they powered on and earned the reputation of a wonderfully entertaining team, flinging passes around with abandon. Yet when push came to shove in low-scoring contests at the business end of the season, the experience of all those hard days slogging it out came to bear and Connacht seemed to surprise Leinster and then Glasgow with their ability to hang tough and dig out a win in the lead-up to the grand finale.
Browne credits Lam with setting the vision and also driving the daily standards to make it a reality. The Samoan’s pre-match message that Murrayfield would be a celebration came to pass with devastating effect.
“Then the following day, back to Galway with thousands lining the streets. I still look at pictures of us up on the bus that day and it’s hard to believe that it actually happened.
“Not just for the players, for the fans who turned out you could see how much it meant.”

The Pro12 success was by some distance the pinnacle of Browne’s career.  But nine years earlier, he lifted silverware in an Ireland jersey as the engine room of Eric Elwood’s Grand Slam-winning U20s team.
It’s that quality crop of 2007 who Browne’s fellow Connacht men Niall Murray and Dylan Tierney-Martin are vying to emulate when they take on Wales in Colwyn Bay tomorrow.
In ’07, the Galway lock helped to set a firm base up front — with Cian Healy in the row ahead, Sean O’Brien or Tommy O’Donnell behind — for a stellar back-line featuring Felix Jones, Darren Cave, Keith Earls and Ian Keatley.

“Our first game against Wales, we were on the back foot for the whole game,” he says, digging into his memory bank, noting how Luke Fitzgerald’s withdrawal actually brought the match-winner into the game, “Felix came in at fullback and scored two tries and we won that game.
“We started believing then.”
England and France came to Athlone and those victories over the traditional superpowers marked very special nights for the Connacht contingent and they went on to complete the Slam in a dramatic finale, coming back from 20-7 down to Italy in Benevento to win 25-36.
The trophy-toting revelry would have done well to get out of hand.
“We were stuck in some hotel, it wasn’t even near the town, we were miles out. But the Italian team were back there too, so we had our celebration there. A few weeks after, we had a celebration dinner up in Dublin and properly celebrated… ended up in Coppers I think.”

However great a boost it was to taste serious success, lift a trophy and claim a medal, such feats remained the realm of fantasy for Connacht – not all that long removed from a threat of being wound up. The Grand Slam stands as a terrific achievement for Browne, but the rigors of a professional season would come as an enormous step up.
“The reality check of senior rugby comes in pretty quick. But (20s) does expose you to higher standards. The academies that time in Leinster, Munster and Ulster were far more advanced then in Connacht.
“We had huge battles of seasons where you’re struggling. We lost 13 in a row and finally getting a win in the Heineken Cup.

“It’s difficult because you’re going in week in week out, sitting through the review on a Monday and you’re trying to put a brave face on, trying to be as positive as you can.
“But it’s difficult for everyone in the organisation to keep grinding. I suppose it comes back to the nature of Connacht people they show a lot of resilience because of what happened in the past.
“Then over the years, the culture changes, we start to get more success and the standards of the whole place just rose. Better players coming in, better players coming from the academy and that had a vital part of Connacht’s success then.”
***
Browne was there through every step of the transition, through the long hard shoulder-to-wheel seasons with fruitless ends, the dispiriting losses and when the only constant was an honest will to get better.
He was established in the setup when Lam arrived and radically shifted the outlook and brought about an eye-opening 2013 win in Toulouse. A result that made so much more sense with three years of hindsight than it did on a dark December night.

It’s all behind him now. He is more than happy to put his gumshield away and shake off the tag of ‘rugby player’. The transition between careers is not one to be rushed through as there are so many aspects to come to terms with. Financially, he has applied to NUIG to build on his degree in economics and geography with a teaching qualification.
Mentally, the loss of the dressing room camaraderie has been a challenge, but he has worked to offset that with the physical challenge of training with his brother Damien – also a former professional rugby player, but currently intent on climbing the highest mountain on each continent.
“Back in November,” the younger Browne recounts, “he comes and asks ‘what are you doing in January?’ And I knew where it was going anyway, knew he was climbing Aconcagua (in the Andes) in January.
‘Eh, I’ve no plans, really’
‘Do you fancy climbing this?’
‘No.’
“Mountains… people who climb obviously know how tough they are, but I can’t imagine what he’s been through. He did Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, Elbrus and he says they’re some of the toughest things he’s ever done.
“He’s been really pushed to hislimit and his limit is,” he pauses, “wayout there.”
Andrew isn’t one to undermine what he might be capable of either. One offer he does take up from Damien is the an invite to join in with his training programme. And in August and the brothers found themselves acting as mutually beneficial drivers for one another as they pushed themselves physically.

A fraternity outside the dressing room and a routine to put some sort of shape on all that the freedom from constraints of rugby.
“It’s been really good, obviously physically, but really good on the mental side of things as well. That you have that physical outlet after finishing rugby.
“We’d train early in the morning, 7am most mornings. Then you might go for a sea swim after.”
“He has a really good way of looking at things. You’re starting your day with two really hard things: the gym session then a sea swim in the west of Ireland in winter when nobody really wants to get in. So if you start your day with two hard things, the rest of the day is easier after that.
“I must say, he’s on to something. After that, things seem easier and you go about your day and there’s no challenge that feels too big.”

FORMER BOSNIAN SERB leader Radovan Karadzic has been ordered to spend the rest of his life in jail for genocide and war crimes.
Karadzic (73) was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2016 but appealed his conviction. UN judges in the Hague this afternoon imposed a life sentence.

Karadzic was once the most powerful Bosnian Serb politician and was notorious for his role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
“I think this verdict is historical for justice,” Munira Subasic of the Mothers of Srebrenica victims’ said earlier today, adding that they wanted Karadzic to get a full life sentence.
A former psychiatrist turned political leader, Karadzic was arrested in 2008 in Belgrade after nearly 13 years on the run during which he posed as new-age healer Dragan Dabic.
In 2016, he was found guilty on 10 counts including orchestrating a nearly four-year siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. More than 10,000 people died in a campaign of sniping and shelling, according to prosecutors.

Karadzic was also found guilty of the Srebrenica genocide. Bosnian Serb troops slaughtered more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in eastern Bosnia, which was supposed to be under UN protection, and buried their bodies in mass graves.
Karadzic had appealed the sentence on 50 grounds, accusing judges of conducting a “political trial” against him.","11.40am, 20 Mar 2019",20 Mar 2019

https://www.thejournal.ie/rescue-116-anniversary-4540489-Mar2019/,"THE SISTER OF Rescue 116 Captain Dara Fitzpatrick has described how her family has been coping as the second anniversary of her death nears.
Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smith and winch operator Paul Ormsby all lost their lives after Irish Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116 went down.
Rescue 116 crashed after it struck Blackrock Island off the Mayo coast on its way to a refuelling stop at Blacksod. It was due to refuel before taking part in a rescue operation.
The bodies of Smith and Ormsby were never recovered.
Speaking on the Ray D’Arcy show on RTE Radio 1 today, Niamh Fitzpatrick described how Dara’s son Fionn, a baby at the time of his mother’s death, has become a little boy Dara would be “so proud of”.
She said: “Fionn is great.  He was a little baby when Dara died and he’s a little boy now. I think she would be so proud of the little boy that he’s become.  She gave him such a foundation, she’d be so proud of that.”

Niamh said the family has found the days leading up to the anniversary of the crash very difficult. She described how the initial aftermath Dara’s death was like a blur and now they’re feeling her loss without the shock – something Niamh said she finds more painful.
She added: “It’s a tough couple of days.  It gets different over time – maybe putting my psychologist hat on.  That first year, we were probably anesthetised. This year, we are dealing with the grief without anything to numb the pain, so there’s a reality about it.
“It’s shock the first year, with the trauma, as well as grief and it’s almost like you have to deal with that first before you deal with the grief.”
The search for the crew lasted 42 days. Fitzpatrick said she owes the people of Blacksod an eternal debt of gratitude for their warmth and support throughout the weeks..
She explained: “I’m really grateful for the opportunity to thank them.
“My way of putting this, is as a family member, it is in the absolute worst of times, that we were met with the best of humanity in that they could not do enough for us.
“This all happened in the middle of the night, we had a community woken up to this and they just dropped their lives.
“I don’t think we will ever be able to thank them but even to say the words, that I’m grateful for that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-coveney-4556726-Mar2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said there have been no formal discussions with the European Commission about how to prevent a hard border in Ireland, though he said they have “thought about” it.
The only way to avoid it would be to have regulatory alignment, but he said the they are still advocating for the backstop.
Pressure has been racketing up in the last week with a strict deadline of dates being given to UK Prime Minister Theresa May to get a deal done.
As the clock ticks on, the big questions about border infrastructure in a no-deal scenario are still largely unanswered.
Asked whether the EU Commission has thought about such a scenario, Coveney answered that there have certainly been “conversations around this, but there has been no formal discussion or negotiation as to how it would work”.
He went on to state that whether there is a deal or no-deal, the way to resolve the border issues will be some form of regulatory alignment.
No-deal
The Tánaiste went further in stating that “in fact arguably I would say the British Government has the prime responsibility here, because of course it is British government policy that has led to this challenge in the first place, insisting on leaving the customs union and the single market, which of course shaped the design of the backstop in the first place, which is as much a British creation as it is an EU one”.

Coveney speaking about the need for some sort of regulatory alignment though he says they are still advocating for the backstoppic.twitter.com/z75xkR6Qts
In a no-deal scenario, discussions with Britain, Ireland and the EU will have to take place.
“There will need to be a solution on the border question, we know that a backstop is the only solution that works, so there will be an onus on all three parties to work together to find a way of preventing a physical border infrastructure which causes unnecessary tension between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland,” he said.
“We have clear commitments that go back to December 2017 and I think all parties will have an obligation to work intensively to come up solutions that can work. It’s possible to do that, we have shown that in the context of the back stop, but there will have to three willing partners.”
The Tánaiste would not be drawn on the issue of a special taskforce being set up to deal with the possibility of a hard border. This follows reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to examine backup plan to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in a no-deal situation.
The Taoiseach has insisted a specialist taskforce has not been set up to address the issue of the border.
Coveney said the questions are the same even in a no-deal scenario.
“We still have to protect a functioning all-island economy that reinforces a peace process. Northern Ireland is part of the UK and that’s not changing but we have to find a way of protecting the EU single market and a the same time preventing physical border infrastructure,” said Coveney.
“We have a proposal that has been agreed between the British Government and the EU, it’s called the backstop.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-cooper-clarke-ireland-tour-luckiest-guy-alive-4517674-Mar2019/,"MORE THAN THREE decades passed between the publication of John Cooper Clarke’s last two poetry collections.
During that time, Clarke has appeared everywhere from The Sopranos, to Arctic Monkeys recordings, the UK school syllabus, and ads for Sugar Puffs.
But casual fans of the so-called ‘Bard of Salford’ might be hard pushed to name the 1983 collection,Ten Years In an Open NeckedShirt, that was his last published work beforeThe Luckiest Guy Alivecame out last year.
So what was he doing between both collections? “I don’t have an intelligent answer,” he tellsTheJournal.ie.
“I’m just bone idle. But you’ve just got to keep trying. Inspiration’s for amateurs – I’m a professional. Some days are better than others: sometimes it ain’t happening, sometimes it is.”
Instead, a unique performative style has seen him dubbed “the godfather of British performance poetry” and endeared him to fans across the world.
Clarke first shot to fame as the ‘people’s poet’ alongside British punk bands in the late 1970s, and his rapid delivery of humourous verse led to him being dubbed a “punk poet”.
The tag has no doubt been aided by his distinctive appearance, with Ronnie Wood-like hair and dark sunglasses a constant throughout his decades of fame.
But he jokes that, despite his rock star credentials, he could never be in a band.
“I’m not really a team player,” he says.
“From time to time I’ve worked with musicians in the studio on albums and things like that. But every school report I got back in the day said the same thing: no team spirit.
“I think that would forbid me from being in a band. I’m too much of a person of sudden impulse. You can’t do that when you’re working on a committee with five other guys.
“You just can’t work in the way that I like to work. Let’s give it a name: I’m a control freak, and as such, unbearable in a bad situation. I’m a tyrant.”
Bono’s trousers
Earlier this week, Clarke announced a series of April shows across Ireland – on top of an appearance at Dublin’s Vicar Street in March – to promote his new book.
The tour will take in dates in Letterkenny, Belfast, Sligo and Cork, locations Clarke says he has been to many times before and describes as “fantastic”.
On top of his thoughts on life, jokes, and classic material, fans can also expect to hear some of the poems in his latest collection.
Advertisement
The book contains verses on the destructive rampage of a 50ft tall woman, the fragile temperament of someone on psychedelic drugs, and an policeman who has a mental breakdown (“PC gone mad”).
There’s even a piece about Bono’s trousers.
“That’s something that actually happened – I heard it on the news on Radio 4,” he says.
“There was one of those ‘save the planet’ type meetings that they have, and I heard Bono had been robbed of his key pieces: the stetson, the shades, and the leather pants.
“So I converted it, hot off the news, into rhyme.”
But although the news might seem like an easy source of inspiration (“something’s happening all the time”), Clarke points out that he aims to avoid too much direct social commentary.
“I don’t really deal with politics at all, because it would date what I do in my poems,” he says.
“What I write is nothing to do with what’s happening this week. I like to think that I deal with all the eternal stuff, irrespective of things like Britain leaving the EU.
“I leave that to people who know what they’re talking about.”
The luckiest guy alive
At the same time, Clarke acknowledges that his work has social value when asked how he felt about his poems being taught on the UK’s school syllabus (“really glad”).
However, he’s almost as quick to distinguish himself as different to those he appears alongside in school textbooks.
“People have asked me since I began in poetry if I consider myself a romantic, because as everybody knows, the language of romance is poetry,” he says.
“My answer to that question is always the same: yes, I consider myself to a romantic – but to a sadistic degree.”
Despite his self-deprecation, Clarke doesn’t blink when asked if he considers himself the luckiest guy alive, as the title of his new book suggests.
“Oh without a doubt, no contest,” he says.
“I’ve got it all baby: a lovely wife, a beautiful daughter, a nice place to live. I make a living out of doing what it is that I’ll do anyway.
“What more could you possibly ask for than this?”
John Cooper Clarke will play in Dublin next month, and in Letterkenny, Belfast, Sligo and Cork in April as part of ‘The Luckiest Guy Alive Tour’.","8.01pm, 3 Mar 2019",

Trump declared in the Oval Office that he was “proud” to sign the veto.
“Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it,” he said.

Trump suffered an embarrassing defeat yesterday when senators, including fellow Republicans, voted to terminate his declaration of an emergency on the Mexican border.
Surrounded by law enforcement officials, senior aides and people who have lost loved ones to cross-border crime, Trump said the veto was to “defend the safety of all Americans”.
“The mass incursion of illegal aliens… has to end,” he said. “People hate the word ‘invasion’ but that’s what it is… Our immigration system is stretched beyond the breaking point.”
Trump’s emergency declaration allows him to secure funding for construction of border walls after he failed to get authorisation from Congress.
Opponents, who accuse Trump of executive overreach and overhyping the problem on the border, could now use court challenges to halt the emergency measure.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mr-moonlight-trial-bobby-ryan-antidepressants-4526800-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Mar 2019
A DOCTOR PRESCRIBED Patrick Quirke on a course of anti-depressants to help him sleep after he complained of being stressed over his affair with Mary Lowry, the Central Criminal Court has heard.
Tipperary General Practitioner Dr Ivor Hanrahan said Mr Quirke, who is on trial for the alleged murder of Bobby “Mr Moonlight” Ryan, was “upset and quite hurt” about Lowry’s relationship with Ryan.
Mr Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan. Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am.
His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013. The prosecution claims that Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Lowry (52).
Dr Hanrahan today told prosecution counsel Michael Bowman SC that Quirke came for a routine consultation in September 2010 and mentioned a number of work and financial “stressors” he was dealing with at the time and that he was having difficulty sleeping.
The doctor suggested medication but Quirke wasn’t keen, so the doctor referred him to a counsellor. Around mid-September, Dr Hanrahan received a phone call from the counsellor and as a result of what he heard he prescribed Mirtazapine, an antidepressant, to Quirke.
He said he primarily prescribed the drug to help Quirke’s sleep which was disturbed.
Confidential matter
In late 2010 and January 2011 the doctor had a number of phone conversations with the accused over a ten-day period and prescribed a number of other medications to help with sleep disturbance. He said Quirke remained upset and distressed and had other issues which he didn’t want to discuss.
Dr Hanrahan suggested a face-to-face consultation which took place on 3 February 2011. They had a long consultation during which Quirke told the doctor that he had been having an affair with Mary Lowry, his wife’s sister-in-law, which was a source of stress and upset to him.
Quirke asked the doctor not to make a note of the conversation so the doctor wrote in his file only that they discussed a confidential matter.
By the time this conversation took place, he said Quirke had stopped taking the medication as it didn’t seem to have helped him. They discussed the impact of the affair on Quirke’s mental health and well-being.
From what Quirke told him, the doctor believed that the relationship had at that point come to an end because she had started a relationship with another man.
He said his understanding was that Quirke still had feelings for Lowry and “was quite hurt and upset that she had become involved with somebody else”.
Adjustment disorder
The doctor further explained that he prescribed antidepressants rather than sleeping tablets as people can become addicted to sleeping tablets.
Under cross examination, he told defence counsel Bernard Condon SC that there are two kinds of depression, one brought on by a stressful life event and the other in the absence of a particular event.
He said he felt in Quirke’s case he was suffering from adjustment disorder which can be a consequence of a stressful life event. He said Quirke may not have met the criteria for depression.

The doctor agreed with Condon that Quirke may have thought he had been diagnosed with depression because of the medication he had been prescribed. However, the doctor repeated that he had prescribed the medication “mainly” to treat sleep disturbance.
The second witness of the day
Breda O’Dwyer told Bowman that she works as an artificial insemination technician and worked with Quirke’s cows for about 15 years. She had an understanding with Quirke that she would call to his farm every morning unless he texted her telling her he didn’t have any cows bulling.
By the time she arrived at his farm, she said, Quirke would normally have finished milking and the milking parlour would be cleaned and he would be on his way for his breakfast. He would leave a post-it note for her with the details of any cows that needed to be inseminated that morning.
On 3 June 2011, the day Ryan went missing, she said that as far as she could recollect Quirke was still in the pit milking his cows when she arrived. The time would have been “9.30 anyway” she said.
The witness told Bowman she referred to her diary previously when gardaí asked about what happened that day and discovered that she inseminated two heifers that morning.
Under cross-examination, she told Condon that she no longer has that diary and when gardaí asked her for it she could not find it. In her direct evidence she told Bowman that the insemination would have taken about 15 minutes and Quirke was still in the pit as she left.
The witness also said that Quirke texted her that morning at 7.24am but she doesn’t know what the text was about. She said normally if he were to text her in the morning it would be to tell her he had no cows and if he had no cows she would not call.
She said she spoke to Quirke about the discovery of Ryan’s body. She said she “wasn’t going to talk to him about the weather” when there were stories in the newspapers.
They would have a “general conversation” about it, she said. She remembered one conversation in which Quirke asked her did she remember that Sean Dillon – a youngster who worked on the farm at the time – was with him that morning of 3 June 2011.
She said she didn’t see Sean there but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t there. He could have been somewhere else on the farm, she said.
Under cross examination the witness said she was mistaken in an earlier statement to gardaí when she said it was “standard practice for all the farmers to text me every morning.”
She explained that she no longer has the diary as she is only required to keep it for between one and two years. The witness explained that she had the diary in June 2013 when she checked it to see if she had gone to Quirke’s farm that day.
Gardaí came looking for the diary six months later but she couldn’t find it then.
She denied that she could be mistaken about seeing Quirke milking cows on 3 June. She said the time she would arrive at Quirke’s farm does not vary much but it could vary sometimes.
He would normally, she said, be first or second on her list of farms to visit.Sean Dillon told David Humphries BL for the prosecution that he worked on Quirke’s farm from the age of about 7. He was 14 in June 2011.
The day after his school holidays began that month he was working on Quirke’s farm and moving bales on his own family farm a few minutes drive away. Milking usually finished around 9.30am, he said, but he agreed with Condon that the times could vary if cows were further out in the fields or if other jobs needed to be done.
When he heard about Ryan’s body being found in the tank at Fawnagowan he said he was frightened by it. He had been working close to it not long before.
Justice Eileen Creedon told the jury of six men and six women that they are not required tomorrow but will be required on Friday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/slovenia-woman-hand-cut-off-insurance-4536034-Mar2019/,"A SLOVENIAN WOMAN has been arrested after allegedly cutting off her hand with a circular saw to get nearly €400,000 in insurance compensation.
The 21-year-old and a 29 year-old relative, who was also arrested, face up to eight years in prison on charges of attempted fraud.
The woman is believed to have staged the incident with three relatives earlier this year, shortly after signing life and injury insurance contracts with five insurance companies.
All four were arrested initially, but two were released.

The woman was hoping to get around €380,000 in compensation and a life-long monthly payout of around €3,000, police said.
“With one of her accomplices, she intentionally amputated her hand at the wrist with a circular saw, hoping to stage it as an accident,” police spokesman Valter Zrinski told a news conference.
The group intentionally left the hand behind rather than bringing it with them to the hospital, hoping to receive three times higher compensation for permanent disability, police added.
But authorities managed to pick up the hand in time, and doctors in a hospital in the capital Ljubljana managed to sew it back on, Zrinski said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/increase-road-deaths-30-4528991-Mar2019/,"AN GARDA SÍOCHÁNA has issued an appeal to the public to be safe on the roads after initial figures for the year indicate that there’s been a 30% increase in the number of road deaths.
Of the 34 people who have lost their lives in fatal road traffic collisions so far this year, 25 have either been a driver or passenger.
There’s also been an increase in detections of intoxicated drivers, people not wearing their seatbelts and people using their mobile phones.

Chief Superintendent Paul Cleary, Garda National Roads Policing Bureau, said today’s figures “affect all parts of the country”.
“I call on every road user to play their part to make the roads safer. Think road safety every journey, and do everything you can to make the roads safer for all road users.”
Analysis from 2018 reveals that nearly 1 in 3 of vehicular fatalities had no safety belt on at the time of the collision. Early investigations indicate this trend is continuing into 2019.
Other factors such as speeding (or inappropriate speed due to weather or road conditions) and intoxicated driving are also significant factors in fatal road collisions, the Gardaí said.
An Garda Síochána said that “non-compliance creates risk on the road to all road users”.

Conor McGregor joins Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel during the St Patrick's Day Parade in ChicagoPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has marched alongside Conor McGregor in the St Patrick’s Day parade in Chicago today.
The Taoiseach followed his tradition of marching in the New York parade last year by taking to the streets of Chicago to march in the city’s parade this time around.
Government officials were left surprised when McGregor arrived to march in the parade, which he led alongside the city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel.
However, officials were not been informed that the MMA star – who was charged with “strong arm robbery and criminal mischief” in Florida this week – would be appearing, saying that the decision was made by Emanuel’s office.

The Taoiseach told reporters that he was not aware that McGregor would be marching in the parade.
“I wasn’t actually. I’d imagine the parade organisers invited him but that’s it really?
When asked if they had a chance to chat to each other, he said:
“No, no. We didn’t have a chance to talk.”
The Taoiseach was also asked if it was appropriate that someone like Mcgregor is representing Ireland, given that he has been convicted of a crime.It’s up to the organisers of the parade to decide who they want to march in the parade. I don’t think he was representing the country, that’s kind of what I was doing and Minister Ring as well. That’s why we’re here.”Conor McGregor pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, avoiding jail time, for his role in the UFC 223 media day fracas at Barclays Center in Brooklyn last year.

Varadkar’s appearance at the parade followed his meeting with US President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, before the Taoiseach arrived in Chicago last night.
Last night he attended the St Patrick’s Day dinner hosted by the Irish Fellowship Club of Chicago.

During his stay in Chicago, Varadkar will meet with a number of emigrant support groups that receive Irish Government funding.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fire-safety-in-kerry-nursing-home-lystoll-lodge-4522709-Mar2019/,"AN INSPECTION REPORT on a nursing home in Kerry has raised concerns after inspectors identified a “significant risk to the lives of residents and staff” in relation to its fire safety management.
Theunannounced inspectionat Lystoll Lodge Nursing Home took place between 7 and 8 November. Nine areas, such as management and social needs, were examined by the Health Quality and Information Authority (Hiqa) during the inspection. Eleven areas were found to be non-complaint.
Lystoll Lodge wasone of 34nursing homes recently inspected by Hiqa. Inspectors found evidence of non-compliance in 15 of the centres for older people. In these centres, the care provider failed to ensure that the service delivered to residents was effectively monitored in line with the regulations and standards.
On the day of inspection at Lystoll Lodge, there were 46 residents present. The inspectors met with the residents, relatives and staff members.
Residents told inspectors that they were happy with the staff and their accommodation.
Mattress evacuation
In the report, inspectors found a “significant risk to the lives of residents and staff” in relation to fire safety management of the nursing home and that adequate precautions against the risk of fire had not been taken.
Inspectors noted that three oxygen cylinders were stored in a bedroom with two residents, neither of which required oxygen. Staff were not aware of their location and there was no signage in place to indicate the presence of oxygen, nor were they stored on a suitable stand.
Fire doors at the centre required urgent review as inspectors found they did not appear to be capable of “adequately containing smoke and fire due to gaps down the centre where the smoke seals were located”.
The fire door to the laundry room was held open with a wooden wedge while there was a lot of dust and lint visible on the back of the tumble drier, which presented a high risk of fire.
When it came to the fire drills, they did not include a simulated full or partial evacuation of the upstairs area where there were a large number of highly dependent residents requiring evacuation on a mattress.

”Staff had no practical experience of doing this type of evacuation. It was therefore not possible to ascertain if all residents in the centre could be evacuated to a place of safety in a timely manner in the event of a fire,” the inspection stated.
Fire evacuation equipment was also found to be not adequate. Inspectors stated that they could not identify, “nor were staff able to demonstrate that appropriate assistive equipment was available for residents who require them to evacuate”.
“Fire evacuation ‘ski-sheets’ were not available for all residents requiring same. There were only 4 such evacuation aids on the premises.”
When it came to the fire alarms there was no evidence that it was serviced on a quarterly basis.
‘Significant concern’
The report also found deficiencies when it came to records. Resident records were found to be not securely stored. The staff roster was not complete as all staff were not included on this, mostly the cleaning, laundry, activity and the kitchen staff.
Four staff, three of which were on duty during the inspection did not have the required garda vetting in place.
Inspectors also found that not all staff had the required two references on file and that not all CVs were complete.
Inspectors noted that a “significant concern” remained in relation to the absence of the signatures of some nurses who checked or administered the controlled drugs.
Signatures were not available for all such transactions, similar to findings on the previous inspection.
In addition, discrepancies were noted in the duplication of signing times and days and not all drugs were transcribed properly. For example, paracetamol was transcribed in the drug administration sheet without a dosage or times of administration for the resident involved.
When it came to the food nutrition of the residents, inspectors found the food to be plentiful and nicely presented but noted in the report that “one resident who had been assessed as requiring a chopped diet was seen to be served a pork chop on the day of inspection”.
In response to the inspection, the home said a fire risk assessment is currently being completed and it has engaged an external consultant to mentor the management team and staff on implementation of recommendations arising from the report.

https://www.the42.ie/real-madrid-ajax-4525959-Mar2019/,"
REAL MADRID’S DISMAL run of form continued as Ajax won 4-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu to dump the Champions League holders out of the competition for the first time since 2014-15.
After winning Europe’s elite club tournament in three consecutive years under Zinedine Zidane, a tough first campaign since the French icon’s departure was capped in remarkable fashion on Tuesday in a 5-3 aggregate loss.
Madrid fell apart in the first half and saw their 2-1 first-leg lead overturned in the opening 20 minutes by goals from Hakim Ziyech and David Neres as Ajax ran riot.
The irrepressible Dusan Tadic added another with a controversial second-half strike, leaving Madrid requiring three goals to stay in the competition, and although Marco Asensio got one back, a fourth home defeat in a row never looked in doubt as Lasse Schone made it four.

With two of those reverses coming at the hands of bitter rivals Barcelona last week before this humbling, pressure will undoubtedly build on head coach Santiago Solari’s position.
The unmarked Raphael Varane headed against the crossbar inside five minutes, but Ajax settled into the contest thereafter and two superb pieces of creative play from Tadic swiftly wiped out Madrid’s away goals.
Tadic first darted in behind Nacho Fernandez to square for Ziyech to sidefoot into the bottom left corner and then the Serbia international left Casemiro in a spin and played in Neres for a calm finish.
Ajax passed up further chances before a horrible half for the hosts was compounded by injuries to Lucas Vazquez and Vinicius Junior in quick succession.
Substitute Gareth Bale, jeered off the pitch against Barca, was again whistled by his own supporters and almost gifted Ziyech a third goal before striking the post at the other end.
Madrid scarcely improved after the restart and Tadic was rightly the man to put the tie beyond them, slamming into the top-left corner before a lengthy delay as VAR finally advised the referee that the ball had not gone out of play earlier in the move.

A belated response saw Asensio slide a finish beyond Andre Onana, but there was no let up in Ajax’s attacking ambition and a glorious Schone free-kick caught out the scrambling Thibaut Courtois, before a frustrated Nacho was sent off in stoppage time.

https://www.thejournal.ie/james-kavanagh-animal-cruelty-jail-4550687-Mar2019/,"A MAN JAILED for one of the worst cases of animal cruelty in the history of the State has moved to appeal against the severity of his three-year prison sentence.
James Kavanagh (48) pleaded guilty to 30 counts of causing or allowing animal cruelty at his property at Raheenleigh, Myshall, Co Carlow in April 2015.
Carlow Circuit Court heard that the charges related to 63 animals.
Gardaí and animal welfare officers found a number of dead dogs and horses, as well as dogs feedings on the carcasses of horses, when they inspected Kavanagh’s dog breeding premises at Myshall.
The court heard that 340 dogs and 11 horses were removed from Kavanagh’s property after the inspection. Four horses and 20 dogs had to be euthanised due to their condition.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and ordered to pay €35,000 towards costs incurred by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) by Judge James McCourt on 22 February last.
His wife, Jennifer Kavanagh, was given a wholly suspended 12 months sentence on the same occasion after she admitted 30 counts of allowing animal cruelty.
Appeal
Opening an appeal against sentence today, Kavanagh’s barrister, Colman Cody SC, accepted that it was a serious case of neglect but there were no “overt acts of physical cruelty”.
Cody said Kavanagh had a dog breeder’s license from Carlow County Council but claimed he “wasn’t breeding dogs”.
He claimed Kavanagh’s premises had been “mischaracterised” by the media as a puppy farm but it was “nothing of the sort”.
Justice Patrick McCarthy said the claim that Kavanagh was not breeding dogs seemed “incompatible” with an objective view of footage from his premises, filmed by the ISPCA, which was played in court.
It was accepted that 114 puppies were found on his premises but Kavanagh claimed he “wasn’t aware some of the dogs were pregnant”.
Cody said dog breeding had been Kavanagh’s previous business but the transportation of dogs was subsequently “generating more money for him”.
He said legislative changes in recent years had required that all dogs in Ireland obtain “puppy passports” which involved a cost to owners. He said “the market had become flooded” and people were “offloading dogs” onto Kavanagh because they didn’t want to pay for puppy passports.
Cody said Kavanagh’s premises became “a dumping ground for all these animals” and a “holding premises” which Kavanagh allowed get out of hand.
The court heard that Kavanagh was being paid €40 – €50 depending on the breed of dog he transported and that charitable organisations, mostly in the UK, covered the cost of transport.
Puppy passports
President of the Court of Appeal Justice George Birmingham said the issue was being presented as if changes in the legislation, concerning puppy passports, had caused problems for Kavanagh “but in truth it seems the changes in the legislation created a bonanza for him”.
Cody said it was not a fair characterisation. He said a lot of people were “complicit in this”.
One of the judges commented that Kavanagh “wasn’t obliged to take them (the animals) in”.
“If you’re in the business of transporting dogs, the more dogs you can get your hands on the better,” Justice Birmingham said, adding that Kavanagh had been looking to bring street dogs in from Romania.
Cody said the sentencing judge was obliged to have regard to all of the background circumstances.
He said Kavanagh, and his family, had been subjected to the “most vitriolic campaign of hate and abuse online”. He said people were threatening to burn Kavanagh’s house down and to do violence to his family. “Even before he’s brought to court, he’s already suffered.”
‘He regretted that he was caught’
Cody said Kavanagh was the sole breadwinner in the family and not a man who lived a lavish lifestyle.
He said his client had been left with “shame and stigma” from adverse publicity.
He said Kavanagh had lost his business to which Justice Patrick McCarthy added: “It was a criminal business; he hadn’t paid a penny in tax.”
Advertisement
Cody submitted that the sentencing judge fell into error when he said Kavanagh had expressed no remorse. He said his client had expressed remorse to the ISPCA inspectors and had instructed his lawyers to express remorse on his behalf in court.
Justice Edwards commented that “anyone can assert remorse” but there wasn’t a “scintilla of evidence to suggest he (Kavanagh) had any appreciation of what he was doing or regretted it in any way. He regretted that he was caught,” the judge commented.
Cody said Kavanagh had acknowledged that the animals were neglected and had pleaded guilty in court.
Justice Birmingham said Kavanagh presented as somebody deserving of little sympathy. He said Kavanagh had been asked to look after the animals during the 11 days that the removal operation was in progress but “didn’t do so”. During that period, he said Kavanagh continued to neglect the animals and failed to provide them with the most basic needs such as food and water.
The three-judge court was shown a 10-minute video from Kavanagh’s premises, which included footage of dogs eating the carcasses of horses.
Kavanagh’s explanation was that they were “not his horses” but had strayed onto his property, Cody said.
After watching the video, Justice Birmingham said horses were clearly shown in some form of paddock and he asked how they could have strayed into an enclosed area.
Cody said they were originally “stray horses”, adding that Kavanagh had 15 of his own horses and efforts were made to get rid of the strays.
“The implication is they (the horses) were there to feed the dogs,” Justice McCarthy commented.
Cody said it was never suggested that horses were being brought onto Kavanagh’s property “for the express purpose of feeding the dogs”.
Justice McCarthy said there may have been no evidence to suggest the horses were being fed to animals “but de facto they were being fed to dogs. He (Kavanagh) was allowing them to be fed to dogs.”
Case of neglect
Cody said it was a case of neglect rather than overt acts of animal cruelty.
Justice Birmingham said it was a case of neglect on a massive, commercial scale. He said the Circuit Court judge may have considered consecutive sentences in respect of the dog offences and the horse offences.
Cody said that would have been grossly disproportionate.
Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Conor O’Doherty BL, said it was one of the single biggest animal welfare prosecutions in the history of the State.
“In terms of the scale of the offending, it has to be seen to be believed,” he said, referring to the video shown in court.
O’Doherty said it wasn’t a case of others seeking Kavanagh to “offload dogs” onto him, as had been suggested. There was evidence that Kavanagh had sought individuals out himself, he submitted.
He referred to a vet who outlined the conditions which animals suffered. The vet said it was one of the worst cases of animal cruelty he ever had the displeasure of dealing with. One dog in particular, photos of which were shown to the court, had to be euthanised.
O’Doherty also referred to comments from an inspector who said it was one of the worst cases of animal cruelty he had come across in his 20 years with the ISPCA.
Referring to Kavanagh’s previous convictions, O’Doherty said the Carlow man had brought animals from the UK during the foot and mouth crisis and claimed subsidies he wasn’t entitled to.
He said a judge doesn’t have to accept somebody’s remorse at face value, just because their barrister asserts it.
The three-judge court reserved its judgment.
Urgent bail
A fortnight earlier, Cody sought “urgent” bail for Kavanagh pending his appeal. He was given an early date for hearing instead.
Cody said Kavanagh’s teenage son was tragically killed in a road traffic accident shortly after his client went into custody.
Following the death of their son, he said Jennifer Kavanagh “had to be sedated” and admitted to hospital.
He said his client was on suicide watch in the Midlands Prison and had to be moved from his original cell to the sex offenders wing “for his own safety”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/childrens-hospital-malcolm-lewis-4524503-Mar2019/,"AN ENGLISH CONSULTANT working in two Dublin children’s hospitals has been before a fitness to practise hearing in the UK after he was found to have had inappropriate contact with the mother of a patient while working in Manchester.
Dr Malcolm Lewis has been employed as a paediatric consultant nephrologist in both Temple Street Children’s Hospital and Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital Crumlin since August 2016.
A spokesperson for Temple Street said that Lewis ceased employment in Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital in the same month he began working in Temple Street and Crumlin. On his retirement from the hospital in Manchester, parents took to the hospital’s Facebook page to describe the positive experiences their children had under his care.
A complaint was made against him in the UK a number of months after he began working in Dublin, and Lewis informed his Irish employers of this.
Lewis provided Temple Street and Crumlin with the details of the complaint as provided to the UK’s General Medical Council and a decision was taken that he remain employed at the Irish hospitals pending the outcome of the tribunal.
Fitness to practise
AUK medical tribunal was heard between 18 February – 1 Marchand is due to resume on 17 September.
The tribunal heard details of allegations against Lewis and made findings of fact in relation to them.
Among the allegations were that Lewis used his professional position in the hospital to pursue an inappropriate relationship with the mother of a patient.

The teenager in question had undergone a failed kidney transplant in which the mother had been the donor.
The tribunal found that it was proven that Lewis had inappropriate contact with the mother by meeting her outside hospital grounds to discuss her child’s treatment, and that he had also accessed the child’s blood test results and conveyed them to the woman.
During this period, Lewis was not the child’s treating consultant and it was also found by the tribunal that he had sent a gift to the patient’s address.
Lewis gave evidence in person during the tribunal and was found to be a “credible witness”.
The tribunal said that he “accepted elements of the charges but remained consistent that his actions were not inappropriate”.
“The Tribunal found that he gave careful and considered responses to the questions put to him,” the tribunal stated in its determination of the facts.
The tribunal noted testimonial evidence on behalf of Lewis suggesting that he “routinely provided patients with his personal details at the outset to the parents of seriously ill patients”.
The tribunal also determined that it was “more likely than not” that the interactions between Lewis and the mother began when they “bumped into one another” in the hospital.
In a response toTheJournal.ie, a spokesperson for Temple Street said Lewis had provided the hospital with documentation regarding the findings from the completed stage of the hearing.
“Dr Lewis has been found to have continued to communicate with the family in question after ceasing to be their treating consultant,” the statement said.
The tribunal will reconvene between 17- 19 September to consider whether the doctor’s fitness to practise is impaired.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump announced today that the United States should acknowledge Israeli sovereignty over the hotly contested Golan Heights territory.
“After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognise Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Trump said in a tweet.
Trump called the Golan – a strategic area seized from Syria and annexed in a move never recognised by the international community – “of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!”
The Golan is home to about 20,000 Israeli settlers.
Trump’s abruptly announced decision was immediately cheered by Netanyahu, who faces a tough reelection battle and visits Washington next week.
“At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognises Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” the right-wing prime minister wrote on Twitter. “Thank you President Trump!”
There was also quick approval from the senior Republican in the US Senate, Lindsey Graham, who is pushing for Congress to recognise Israeli control over the Golan.
“President Trump’s decision to recognise the Golan as part of Israel is strategically wise and overall awesome. Well done, Mr. President!” Graham tweeted.
Trump’s announcement came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Jerusalem, lauding warm ties with Israel and promising to step up pressure on Iran.

Pompeo has said his trip has nothing to do with politics.
Diplomatic bombshell
This is the second diplomatic bombshell dropped by Washington, which is Israel’s main backer, in seeking to redraw the fraught Middle East map.
In 2017, Trump went against decades of practice by recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, rather than the previously accepted Tel Aviv.
The Golan Heights move was hinted at a week ago when the State Department changed its usual description of the area as “occupied” to “Israeli-controlled.”
The Trump State Department has also dropped previous definitions of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as being “occupied” by the Jewish state.
Israel occupied the Golan Heights, West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Six-Day War.
It later annexed the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem in moves never recognised by the international community.
Trump’s latest shakeup comes ahead of the expected unveiling of a White House plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Palestinian leaders, who broke off contact with Washington after the recognition of Jerusalem by Trump, say they expect the plan to be blatantly biased in favor of Israel.
Trump will host Netanyahu at the White House next Monday and Tuesday. The Israeli leader will be in Washington for the annual conference of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) pro-Israel lobbying group.

There’s been an abundance of drama in the Champions League round of 16 already and this game is likely to be similarly thrilling.
Following a cagey first leg at Anfield that finished 0-0, the tie is finely balanced ahead of tonight’s encounter in Germany.
Bayern are expected to be far more adventurous than they were in that initial encounter, while Liverpool will be hoping to expose the spaces in behind in a way they were unable to do largely due their opponents’ cautious tactics in the first leg.
Both teams are in decent form with Bayern top of the Bundesliga and Jurgen Klopp’s men trailing Premier League leaders City by a point, with this match likely to have a big impact on both teams season.
Kick off is at 8pm, with 90 minutes of action (or potentially more) set to decide which of these sides secures a coveted spot in the competition’s quarter finals.

https://www.thejournal.ie/investigation-underway-following-claims-of-online-abuse-targeting-munster-rugby-player-4556735-Mar2019/,"A MAJOR GARDA investigation has begun into allegations of serious online abuse and harassment of Munster rugby players.
Senior gardaí revealed today that a probe into the claims has been ongoing for the past few months.
It’s understood some of the alleged abuse was posted online via fake player profiles.
The alleged abuse – believed to have targeted players as well as their loved ones – was reportedly posted via accounts on Twitter and Instagram.
Superintendent Derek Smart, Henry Street Garda Station, said:
Gardaí would not comment on the alleged nature of the complaints they received.
“All I can say is that an investigation is underway into complaints from individuals. The investigation has been taking place over the last couple of months,” Smart said.
“It’s ongoing. No arrests have been made,” he added.

‘Destroy reputations’
Gardaí said they were not aware of an actual complaint by the Munster Rugby club itself, but rather the complaints are understood to have been made by individuals linked to the club.
According to a report in theLimerick Leader, a source at the club claimed the alleged perpetrators were “actively looking to destroy reputations and falsely represent people”.
Social media accounts were manufactured “for the purpose of attacking and abusing players, while also falsely claiming to be Munster Rugby players online,” they claimed.
Gardaí said they were not aware of reports that the club had sought the help of a “forensic scientist” to help players deal with the alleged abuse.
The Leader reported that a club source told them: “It affects us all, but we all work together to try and get through it. This abuse has been going on for months.
“This is not rugby-related. This is targeted abuse and has moved beyond the players’ themselves. It has linked to their family and friends.
“With the online world you cannot control most of it. It’s other peoples’ accounts, other peoples’ posts. We cannot remove, we can’t delete them. Obviously, we report them, we use the mechanisms that are available to us with regard to reporting on the social media platforms, but it is on-going, it is continuing to happen.”
Munster’s season is reaching a critical stage with the team facing a crucial Guinness PRO14 clash with Zebre at Thomond Park this Saturday.
The squad travels to BT Murrayfield the following weekend, Saturday 30 March, for a Champions Cup quarter-final showdown with Edinburgh.
Munster Rugby did not respond when asked for comment.

https://www.the42.ie/stephen-rochford-mayo-donegal-interview-4527490-Mar2019/,"Stephen Rochford pictured before his last game in charge of Mayo.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
STEPHEN ROCHFORD CUTS a relaxed figure as he sits down for an interview in the hallway of Croke Park’s sixth floor, beside some of the busiest conference rooms at the Drumcondra venue.
Rochford is in town for AIB’s All-Ireland club championships finals media day, where his former club Corofin are bidding to retain their crown against 2017 champions Dr Crokes.
He’s extremely familiar with the Galway kingpins, having led the majority of the current panel to All-Ireland club success in 2015. He was just 36 when he managed Corofin to that victory and was considered one of the brightest young coaches in the game.
The four years since then have passed in the blink of an eye.
His three seasons in charge of Mayo included trips to the All-Ireland final in 2016 and 2017, where they came within a point of Dublin both times.
It’s nearly impossible to have a conversation with a man like Rochford without the four-in-a-row champions cropping up at some point.
For many pundits, those All-Ireland finals were the peak of this Mayo team. Rochford’s side were one of the very few sides who visibly grew in stature when they faced Dublin in the championship.
It was the defining rivalry of this decade and only for two desperately unfortunate own goals in the drawn 2017 decider, Mayo might have delivered Sam Maguire already.
It’s put to Rochford that no manager has come closer than him to beating this Dublin team since their present run began.
“That’s a great label to have,” he laughs self-deprecatingly.

He’s since decamped to Donegal as a coach under Declan Bonner. Along with his very obvious coaching acumen, Rochford’s years of study on the champions have been added to Donegal’s repertoire. While he never managed a victory against Jim Gavin’s side, he has his thoughts on the best way to go about it.
“You have to respect Dublin and the quality they have but you can’t go into your shell about it because they’ll absolutely annihilate you,” he says. “The same as with a soccer team, possession is nine-tenths of the law.
“If you don’t go and look to battle for that ball as much as the opposition, you’re going to find yourself on the back foot. So what you’re really looking to play is the margin of your defeat, not necessarily going to win it. In any of those championship games we played against Dublin it was always with a view to going out and winning the game.
With some of the best defenders in the game, Mayo were able to match-up with Dublin man-on-man all over the field in those ’16 and ’17 finals. Without giving away any state secrets, Rochford believes the day of beating Dublin with a blanket defence and swift counter-attack is long gone.
“There’s a number of different facets of it, that’s maybe a bit for the GAA nerd. Dublin are so comfortable in a number of different styles, playing against or playing with themselves.
“And all the details watching them, they have a kick-out strategy – and a lot of other teams will have as well – but theirs is such a winning formula based on their last four years. It becomes so much more distinct.
Rochford was speaking at the launch of the AIB All-Ireland club finals.Evan Logan / INPHOEvan Logan / INPHO / INPHO
“So I don’t think you’ll beat Dublin – and I don’t think any team has got inside that six- or eight-point margin – by playing 13 guys behind the ball.
“Because again, you’re giving quality footballers so much time on the ball that they’ll just pick you off. They’ll just isolate where the chink is.
“One of the hardest things in the game is to maintain your level of concentration in those defensive situations. They just go and look to pick you off. I don’t think there is a blueprint to say, ‘This is how you beat them.’
As he leans back into his chair to expand on his point, Rochford catches the eye of Cathal Cregg as the Roscommon forward walks past us down the hallway.
Cregg, who works as provincial games manager for Connacht GAA, bagged a goal for Roscommon against, incidentally, the Dubs on Sunday afternoon.
“Goal of the weekend!” Rochford directs at Cregg, before returning to his train of thought.
“But to come back to it, Dublin have kept most teams at arm’s length in whatever style they’ve wanted to take them on. That’s how your respect for them grows in the ways they’re not fazed by it.
“It’s going to be historic one way or another, it’s going to be a five-in-a-row or it’s going to be the team that dethrones certainly the best team in modern football history. So everyone’s looking forward to it.”

Before we look any further forward, the conversation is steered back to the past. Rochford’s tumultuous exit from the Mayo hot-seat arrived 58 days after they were dumped out of the All-Ireland qualifiers by Kildare.

Less than a fortnight earlier, Rochford had confirmed his intention to stay in charge for a fourth season. But on 27 August, he handed in his resignation over “a lack of support” from the board executive in relation to the new management team he’d put in place.
Just like that, it was all over.
Eamonn Fitzmaurice’s reign as Kerry boss ended early the same month. Following his departure and his revelations about the letters of abuse he received in the post, it sparked off a nationwide debate about the levels of scrutiny and criticism aimed at county managers.
So, just how pressurised a job was being the Mayo manager?
“I certainly would never have looked at it as a draining job,” says Rochford. “If that level of expectation wasn’t there what would it have actually meant in terms of where the team was at? So, with challenging at the top table comes a level of expectation, that’s just the nature of the animal.
“I felt very, very honoured to be that person that represented the management. And, look, we had a number of very enjoyable days. And we had a number of days where, yeah, it was disappointing in terms of performances and some days just disappointing with the result having gotten so far. But that’s sport.
“That’s why you saw Limerick absolutely overjoyed last year when they came out the right side of a one-point, close game. And I’ve no doubt that if Mayo come out that side of it or a Donegal or a Kerry in 2019 and stop Dublin getting the five-in-a-row, you’ll see unbridled joy.
Shortly after his resignation, Rochford appeared on Miriam O’Callaghan’s RTÉ Radio 1 programme to discuss his tenure. It led to an uncomfortable situation where O’Callaghan read out texts from listeners to Rochford.
Even bringing Mayo to within touching distance of an All-Ireland title didn’t insulate him from condemnation.
Many commended him on the job he’d done with Mayo, but inevitably some stinging criticism came his way too.

Said one texter: “If he’s struggling to understand why he’s in this position now, playback this interview to him. He won nothing with Mayo, brought in no new players and brought nothing new to the table despite promising the sun, moon and stars. Cop on, Stephen.”
Páidí Ó Sé’s ”the roughest type of f**king animals” comments spring to mind.
“That expectation or that there’s a sort of a hysteria around it probably comes a little bit more from supporters,” says Rochford. “That’s not something we can control.
“There’s a number of different elements to that. Social media now, wider media content and all of that makes the GAA just so much more…it’s a daily part of a paper or an online production or publication.
“Typically the culture of excellence or high performance, that’s what the players and the management or administration can look to control in that sense.
At just 40, there’s no reason Rochford can’t a second-coming with Mayo similar to James Horan at some point down the line. After stepping down in 2014, Horan went away and furthered his coaching acumen.
He stayed plugged into the game with his TV punditry work and undertook a Masters degree in coaching at UCC, while also studying various other sports.

Rochford doesn’t rule out a return to the Mayo job, although it’s not something he sees happening ”in the short or medium term.”
“Look, as a Mayo person I wouldn’t rule that necessarily out,” he says. “But I wouldn’t envisage it happening anytime soon.
“I’m above in Donegal now and I’m really enjoying working with a really energised, ambitious, playing group with a lot of potential there along with a very seasoned and experienced management team.
“It’s the Donegal job that’s my focus now, not sort of bettering myself for another coming in Mayo. It’s not something that’s on my radar in the short or medium term.
“But, look, nobody knows what’s happening or what’s coming around the corner or what things may develop in ten years’ time or something like that. But I don’t see it happening any time soon.”
He has watched Horan’s return to the role with interest from distance. The heavy loss to Dublin at Croke Park last month was the first time Rochford brought his son to see the county play.
“It was an opportunity to bring my young lad to a Mayo game,” he says. “I haven’t had the opportunity to do that previously, funnily enough.
“That was nice, but it wasn’t the result that we were looking for. I saw the game against Roscommon on TV and I watched the game, the Galway game, over the next week or so.

“(I’ve seen) one or two bits on highlights. But, you know, they’ve positioned themselves in a good position. Obviously winning the first three games they had good momentum. That’s come a little bit unstuck in relation to the last two performances.
“But I’ve no doubt they’ll be rallying the troops and getting themselves ready for Tralee (to play Kerry next weekend). I’d expect a higher level of performance, certainly going to Tralee.
Morgan Treacy / INPHOMorgan Treacy / INPHO / INPHO
“The last time they played in Tralee they won that game, so they’re used to going down there and giving a good, strong performance. We’ll wait and see.”
Some comparisons were drawn between Mayo’s recent 1-12 to 0-7 defeat to the All-Ireland champions and the 1-16 to 0-7 beating Dublin dished out during the 2017 league during Rochford’s reign.
“Certainly in 2017, we were probably only back training in January. So that’s probably why the last day’s performance is a bit more surprising on the back of having won the first three games, there was good momentum gathered.
“But Diarmuid (O’Connor), Chris Barrett, Cillian O’Connor – all those guys missing. All important players for that group. They’re all due to come back. Kevin McLoughlin came off the bench that night.
“So they’ve a nice bit of experience and quality still to come into the team. Some of those guys may return for the Kerry game and I’d be expecting them to lift themselves and give a really strong account of themselves in Tralee.”
For now, he’s very content with Donegal. It meant a return to what many consider to be Rochford’s best quality, his coaching on the training field.
Within a couple of months of leaving Mayo, a phone call came from Declan Bonner to gauge his interest in joining his coaching ticket with the Ulster champions.
“I’d said immediately afterwards that I would be involved with a team in 2019 – I didn’t whether that was going to be club or inter-county. But then when a team with the quality and potential that Donegal have and bring, that makes that decision a lot clearer.
Declan Bonner and Rochford.Evan Logan / INPHOEvan Logan / INPHO / INPHO
“Then it was just looking at the logistic elements of what that were, were they feasible? Plus the position as a coach, it doesn’t have the intensity of what the ask as a manager would have.
“When you’re dealing with media, the county board, medical teams and players. It’s very distinct and you know very much what the expectations of your role is as the coach. In that, I was very happy to make that.
“So bringing all those bits together, probably over a three-week period, a bit of talking and sensing around the opportunity that was there, things came together and the rest is history.”
He confirmed Donegal are expecting star midfielder Odhran MacNiallais back prior to the summer. After Gaoth Dobhair’s exit at the All-Ireland club semi-final stage in February, MacNiallais indicated he’d take some time out of football.
His physical and emotional reserves were empty after losing close friend Micheál Roarty in the tragic Donegal road accident the previous month, but Rochford is looking forward to MacNiallais’s return at some stage over the coming months.
“Himself and Declan would have spoken at the tail end of January around the start of the National League and it was a case that there was no expectation that Odhran was going to immediately return after the club.
It remains a distinct possibility that Donegal and Mayo will clash in the championship later this season, a prospect Rochford says he hasn’t given much thought to.
“I suppose that’s something that you won’t know until it happens. I wouldn’t like it to be in the back door because I wouldn’t like to be there in the first place.
“If it’s in the Super 8s or a more advanced position, so be it, it means both teams are positioning themselves well.
“So, look, if that materialises, I won’t have a particular problem with it and certainly would look to embrace the opportunity or challenge that it would present at that time.”
If it does transpire, he’ll take it in his stride.
Just like he’s always done.

THE US TRANSPORTATION Department has confirmed that its watchdog agency will examine how the Federal Aviation Administration certified the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, the now-grounded plane involved in two fatal accidents within five months.
The FAA had stood by the safety of the plane up until last Wednesday, despite other countries grounding it.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao formally requested the audit in a letter sent to Inspector General Calvin Scovel III on Tuesday.
Chao, whose agency oversees the FAA, said the audit will improve the department’s decision-making. Her letter confirmed that she had previously requested an audit. It did not mention that the inspector general and federal prosecutors have already started looking into the development and regulatory approval of the jet, as reported by news outlets, including The Associated Press.
The letter requests “an audit to compile an objective and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft.” It also says the audit will help the FAA “in ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively.”
Boeing said Tuesday that it will fully cooperate with the audit.
Inadequate
Senator Richard Blumenthal called Chao’s three-paragraph request for an audit “inadequate and incomplete.”
In his own letter to the inspector general, Blumenthal said the watchdog should examine whether problems with the plane were missed because Boeing employees did some safety-certification work on FAA’s behalf.
He also questioned whether the FAA should have done more after the first 737 Max accident, and why the FAA didn’t ground the plane as quickly as other regulators around the world.
Questions about the FAA’s handling of the issue extend beyond US borders and will pose an immediate challenge for Dickson if he is confirmed to lead the agency.
Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said this week that even if FAA certifies Boeing’s fix for the software on the 737 Max jet, “we will do our own certification.”

Donald Trump has tapped a former Delta Air Lines executive to lead the Federal Aviation Administration as the regulator deals with questions about its approval of a Boeing airliner.

The White House said Tuesday that Trump will nominate Stephen Dickson to head the FAA. The agency has been led by an acting administrator since January 2018.
Dickson was Delta’s senior vice president of flight operations until retiring on 1 October after 27 years with the airline, including time flying the 737 and other Boeing jets. Before that, he was an Air Force pilot. He emerged in recent weeks as the likely choice to lead FAA.
For the past 14 months, the agency has been under an acting administrator, Daniel Elwell, a former Air Force and American Airlines pilot.
A Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia last October, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed this month near Addis Ababa.
Investigators suspect that incorrect sensor readings feeding into a new automated flight-control system may have played a role in the Indonesian crash, and the Ethiopian plane had a similar, erratic flight path.
Boeing began working on an upgrade to software behind the flight-control system shortly after the Lion Air crash. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in recent days that the company is close to finishing the update and changes in pilot training to help crews respond to faulty sensor readings.
Elwell told House Transportation Committee members that Boeing expects the software update to be finished by Monday, according to a person familiar with the briefing who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the timing publicly. The FAA earlier required design changes to the flight-control system “no later than April.”
After Boeing finishes the software, the FAA still must approve it.
The Associated Press reported Monday that the Justice Department is probing the development of the Max, according to a person briefed on the matter. It is unclear when that inquiry began.
Critics have questioned the FAA’s practice of using employees of aircraft manufacturers to handle some safety inspections. FAA inspectors review the work of the manufacturers’ employees, who are on the company payroll and could face a conflict of interest.
A federal grand jury in Washington sent a subpoena to someone involved in the plane’s development seeking emails, messages and other communications, the person told The Associated Press.
The 29 October Lion Air crash killed 189 people, and 157 died in the 10 March accident involving an Ethiopian Airlines jet. Both accidents happened shortly after takeoff.
Other nations banned the Max 8 and a slightly larger model, the Max 9, in the days after the Ethiopian crash. The FAA and US airlines that use the planes stood by the plane’s safety until last week.
There are about 370 Max jets of various models at airlines around the world. American, Southwest and United have said the grounding of their Max jets have led to some cancelled flights.
The plane is an important part of Chicago-based Boeing’s future. The company has taken more than 5,000 orders and delivered more than 250 Max jets last year. Boeing still makes an older version of the popular 737, but it expected the Max to account for 90% of all 737 deliveries this year.

Police said the individuals are wanted for crimes that include violent moped-enabled crimes, street robberies, burglary and violation of release conditions.
Two vans will be driven around London to encourage people to come forward with information that could help locate the people in the photographs.

A public appeal will also feature on BBC’S Crimewatch Roadshow today and operational teams will be working to respond to any live intelligence received.
Chief Inspector Jim Corbett, from Operation Venice, said: “These offenders have callously robbed, stolen or burgled from communities, commuters and tourists within London, often using violence and weapons, for their own financial gain.
He also urged the people in the photographs to hand themselves into their local police station.
“Knocking on our door is infinitely better than us knocking on yours,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bai-rejects-compalints-eighth-amendment-debates-4554409-Mar2019/,"THE BROADCASTING REGULATOR has rejected three complaints that programmes broadcast on Virgin Media Television in the run up to last year’s referendum on the Eighth Amendment failed to be fair, objective and impartial.
Two of the complaints to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) were made against The Tonight Show, hosted by Matt Cooper and Ivan Yates, and the third was against The Pat Kenny Show Referendum Special.
The three complaints were all made by Brendan O’Regan and the programmes were broadcast last May when the channel was known as TV3.
The complaints against The Tonight Show focused on programmes that aired on 17 and 21 May ahead of the vote on 25 May.
Both of the shows involved panel discussions on the referendum with representatives from each side of the debate.
Each panelist set out their position at the beginning of each of the programmes and this was followed by an open discussion.
Fact-checking
Both programmes included fact-checking undertaken by a journalist fromTheJournal.ie.
O’Regan complained that the fact-checkers, Sinead O’Carroll and Susan Daly, did not remain impartial and, on occasion, provided their own viewpoints under the guise of providing facts.
He said that the panelists should have been given the opportunity to challenge the fact-checkers.
The complainant also expressed the view that the presenters put more challenging questions to the panelists advocating a ‘No’ vote. He claimed that the programmes were not fair, objective or impartial and were biased in favour of a ‘Yes’ vote.
In responding to the complaint, Virgin Media Television said that the presenters engaged the fact-checkers fromTheJournal.iewith a view to ensuring that the audience was provided with information which was “trustworthy, honest and credible”.

It said that on both nights the fact-checkers provided accurate information and answered questions without expressing their own views.
The broadcaster added that the presenters also challenged each side fairly and did not express their opinion.
In unanimously rejecting the complaint the BAI’s Compliance Committee found that the fact-checking element of the programme was fair, objective and impartial and it found no evidence that the panelists advocating a ‘No’ vote were treated unfairly.

The complainant made a similar complaint against The Pat Kenny Show Referendum Special, which was broadcast on 23 May.
He said Kenny was “rude” to the ‘No’ panelists and challenged them in a more robust manner than those representing the ‘Yes’ side.
O’Regan said this was most evident in Kenny’s treatment of, Iona Institute member, Maria Steen.
Virgin Media Television said in its response that the discussion was fair to all sides and gave each of the contributors ample time to make their case.
The broadcaster acknowledged that Kenny was “direct and strict” with the panelists and contributors on the programme but maintained that this approach was necessary given the nature of the debate.
In unanimously rejecting the complaint the Compliance Committee found that Kenny moderated the debate fairly and found no indication of bias.
It also found no evidence that Kenny’s treatment of any of the contributors infringed on the requirement to be fair, impartial and objective.
The authority also dismissed a complaint made by the Kerry based company Bio Atlantis against the RTÉ One documentary series A Wild Irish Year.
The rejected complaint stated that the show made false and unsubstantiated claims about seaweed harvesting.

Yesterday, gardaí from DMR Roads Policing Unit, based in Blanchardstown, carried out a speed checkpoint on the N2 Finglas Road.
They stopped a van travelling in excess of the speed limit.
While carrying out a search of a person and the van, gardaí discovered a quantity of cocaine and ecstacy tablets (subject to analysis) with an approximate value of €2,000.

Further searches of the van uncovered a quantity of cash in excess of €150,000 believed to be the proceeds of the sale and supply of controlled drugs.
Follow up searches later that day at addresses in Finglas and Lucan were carried out. Six mobile phones were recovered, including an encrypted phone.
A 40-year-old man was arrested and taken to Finglas Garda Station where he is currently detained under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Drug Trafficking Act 1996 at Ballymun Garda Station.
Gardaí have since charged the man. He is due to appear before the Criminal Courts of Justice at 4.30pm this afternoon.

https://www.the42.ie/chris-henry-feature-interview-4531944-Mar2019/,"Former Ireland and Ulster flanker Chris Henry.Sam Barnes / SPORTSFILESam Barnes / SPORTSFILE / SPORTSFILE
TWO DAYS INTO retirement, Chris Henry stood in the middle of Tesco. Suddenly it hit him. The finality of his decision, the dawning realisation that the very thing he identified himself as since leaving school was no longer what he could identify himself as.
No longer a rugby player, no longer Ulster’s number seven.
He stared into space, numbed. In the bread section, he recalls. Why there? Who knows, but this was it. Bereft, lost, scared. No longer the beginning of the end, buttheend. 184 appearances for Ulster, 24 Ireland caps. The end of one chapter in Henry’s life and the start of the next. He needed that moment in Tesco.
“It had all happened very quickly,” Henry tellsThe42. “I think 48 hours had passed since the announcement and I was sent out to the shops to pick up a loaf of bread. I just remember standing there. Staring.
“I was overwhelmed. I left school and was straight into Ulster, it was something that consumed me for so long. It’s part of my identity and, just in that moment standing in the supermarket as a normal, everyday person doing an everyday task, all those feelings came down at me at once.
“I just stood there and thought ‘Oh my goodness, this is it.’ I knew the moment I sent that message into the group — ‘Guys, all the best for the rest of the season, keep in touch’ — that it was it. You exit the group and when you’re out, you’re out.
“Luckily, I composed myself, got what I needed to get in Tesco and got out of there quickly.”
Retirement hits players in different ways. At different times, and in different forms. Although those early days were difficult — ‘it hit me like a ton of bricks’ — Henry found coping mechanisms. He was at peace with his decision because, truthfully, he had no other option.
His 184th and final appearance for his native Ulster was on the opening weekend of this season, as he came off the bench during the second half of the province’s Pro14 victory over Scarlets at Kingspan Stadium. He wasn’t to know at the time but a calf strain sustained at some point during that afternoon would force him into retirement just two months later.
Having come off a strong pre-season, Henry, at 34, remained determined to get back to full fitness. In a bid to regain his match sharpness, the flanker captained Ulster ‘A’ in their Celtic Cup opener against Leinster ‘A’ last September and then featured for his club, Malone RFC. He just needed minutes on the pitch.
“I was trying everything,” Henry remembers. “I played an ‘A’ game and the organisers, there were complaints about Ulster playing a 34-year-old in that competition. I agreed with them but I needed game time to actually get back to a bit of form. I tried every avenue.”

Henry got through 80 minutes unscathed for Malone but woke up the following morning in severe pain, unable to lift his arm.
“I think that was the realisation,” he says. “I was in so much pain and I just couldn’t keep doing it, putting my body through it. Rugby had taken its toll on my body and I guess the writing was on the wall for me.”
The exact diagnosis was a rotator cuff tear and when a doctor initially recommended surgery, Henry knew enough was enough. He was out of contract in the summer, and there are only so many times a player can keep coming back, keep putting their body through the mill.
“Ulster were making changes and bringing youth through. Of course, you want to be there forever, but I knew what Ulster were trying to do and I knew I wasn’t producing the standards I was used to. I just felt it was the right time to do it.
“Truthfully, I wasn’t willing to move clubs to extend my career. I didn’t want to play for someone else. The scan actually showed I didn’t need surgery in the end but if I did, it wasn’t an option.
“The most important thing was my wife was due three weeks later, and the thought of not being able to drive her to the hospital or hold my child, I just thought about the bigger picture.

“It was just the right time to walk away before I hurt myself and I didn’t want to finish feeling bitter. I wanted to walk away with happy memories and thankfully I was able to take control of the situation.”
The formal announcement was made on 5 November 2018, Henry forced to call time on his career midway through what was his testimonial season at Ulster. Not how he would have wanted to go out, but the Belfast native’s perspective on rugby, and life, had changed irrevocably throughout a career defined by how he dealt with setbacks.
Just as he remembers those minutes standing in the bread section of his local Tesco and how he can now laugh and reflect on it as an important moment in transitioning from the old to the new, the morning of 8 November 2014 is forever etched in Henry’s mind.
“Yeah,” he smiles.
Named to start in Ireland’s Autumn Test against South Africa at the Aviva Stadium, Henry had earned his opportunity alongside Peter O’Mahony and Jamie Heaslip in Joe Schmidt’s back row.
“I felt amazing, it was a stage of my career when I felt I belonged. Sometimes when you’re not a guaranteed starter, you pull on that jersey and wonder ‘am I going to get caught out here?’ But at that stage, I felt I belonged. I deserved it, and then that happened.”
On the morning of the Test match, Henry — at 30 and in the prime of his rugby career — had a mini-stroke in his hotel room. He remembers going into the bathroom to splash water on his face, and then both his left arm and the left side of his face dropped and he lost all of his speech. It lasted four minutes.

His room-mate, Rhys Ruddock, scrambled for the assistance of the team doctor and although Henry’s strength returned after those four terrifying minutes, he was immediately taken to hospital, where he would spend the next four days.
Tests showed he had a hole in his heart, meaning the clot went into his heart instead of being cleared out through the lungs, before making its way up into the brain and resulting in a stroke.
Incidentally, Ruddock was promoted off the bench into Henry’s number seven jersey for that game, the Leinster man producing a monumental performance in the circumstances, as Schmidt’s side recorded a memorable victory over the Springboks. But, sitting in hospital, rugby was secondary for Henry.
“Yeah, it wasn’t what I was thinking about,” he admits. “I remember watching the game in hospital and Rhys had a brilliant game that day but I was in such shock. It was a scary time. Would I speak properly again? Would I be able to drive again? Rugby really didn’t matter in those terrifying moments.
“But I was lucky it happened under IRFU care, who have the best doctors and help. It was a massive blessing and somehow I was back playing rugby for Ulster four months later. I was very lucky.”
He made his return against Cardiff in March 2015.
“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t completely terrified. Deep down, you know the doctor said you are fine, but until you go out there and put your head where it shouldn’t be, you don’t really know.
Through adversity, Henry found strength. It was a feature of his career, shaping him as a player and a person. Four weeks before his Ireland debut on the summer tour of Australia in 2010, his father, William, passed away after a short illness. That occasion was tinged with sadness and raw emotion.
The tragic passing of Ulster team-mate Nevin Spence in 2012 also had a profound effect on Henry, those experiences changing his outlook and perception. He appreciated rugby for what it was, and gave it his all, but never lost sight of what was truly important.
Even faced with the most difficult decision of his life, Henry knew he needed to be in a position to be there for his wife, Jade, as they prepared for the birth of their first child, a baby daughter who duly arrived last December. Little Willa Maria Henry. All of that was more important than trying to prolong his career.
“Becoming a father does put everything in perspective,” he says. “It’s a game-changer. We got married and I knew I always wanted to have a family. It was good timing, I suppose.
“It’s a totally new chapter for me, it has been challenging but I’d like to think what I learned on a rugby pitch…my career wasn’t always plain sailing and I’ll use those learnings for this next chapter with my family.”
Between the birth of his daughter, a testimonial dinner to organise and continued charity work with Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke, Henry has barely had time to reflect on a career which started way back when in Malone RFC. From Wallace High School, to Queen’s University, to Ulster, to Ireland.

“I felt so lucky to play for my country,” Henry continues.
Celebrating Ireland's 2014 Six Nations with Rory Best in Paris.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
“Playing in the 2015 World Cup just six months after my health scare will always stay with me. I managed to sneak on the plane and that meant a lot because I was also on standby for the previous World Cup, in 2011, in New Zealand.”
Henry was one of the mainstays of the early years of Schmidt’s tenure and, before the mini-stroke on the eve of the Springboks Test, had firmly established himself as Ireland’s openside, starting all five games of the 2014 Six Nations success.
“My best moment in green, without a doubt,” Henry states. “Playing away in France that night, winning in Paris. Just the best feeling in the world.”
Henry’s last appearance for Ireland was the infamous World Cup quarter-final defeat to Argentina in Cardiff, but his resilience meant he enjoyed three more years at the top with Ulster.
A hard-working, brave and terrifically diligent pro with a strong ball-carrying ability and reputation for being a nuisance at the breakdown, Henry’s progression from the Malone minis to the international stage was not without its setbacks, but all of it — the highs, the lows, the good times, the bad times — meant he took absolutely nothing for granted and savoured every minute.
“I’ve worn the number seven jersey for Ulster for a long, long time and it will take more time to get past it, but I feel pretty content at the moment.
Henry’s hands are pretty full at home but he has ambitions of progressing his coaching career having helped Malone gain promotion to Division 1B of the Ulster Bank League last season. With a geography degree, there is also the option to go into teaching and it is something he is certainly not closing the door on yet.
“I’d love to get into coaching and take a few years and see where it gets me, but I don’t want to rush into something either.
“I’ve a Whatsapp group with Andrew Trimble, Tommy Bowe and Paul Marshall called ‘gym’ but we don’t go to the gym together. The first thing I’d like to do is get back into a routine and we can go from there. It’s going to take time and I’m happy to take that.
Life is now very different for Chris Henry, but that’s okay. It sits well with him.
“I had the best days of my life playing rugby,” he adds.
“I look back with such fondness. No regret, no bitterness. I wish I could play forever, and, yes, we have had plenty of challenges along the way. You think back to losing Nevin Spence, it hasn’t been smooth. But the highs have definitely outweighed the lows and, for me, I move on with such happy memories.”

Jason Hayes, (44), with an address at Upper Henry Street, Limerick city, was arrested yesterday in connection with a garda probe into a video posted on Facebook, which appeared to show two males making racially abusive comments about members of the public going about their business on Parnell Street, Limerick.
Hayes is accused of engaging in actions likely stir up hatred, contrary to Section 2 of the Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act, 1989.
The charge relates to an unknown date between 1 September 2017 and 1 September 2018, gardai told Limerick District Court.

Sergeant Adrian Whelan, Roxboro Road garda station, gave evidence of arresting Hayes and charging him under caution.
He said Hayes “made no reply” to the charge, which Sergeant Whelan said related to “a video clip on Facebook”.
Hayes was granted bail, by consent, on a number of strict conditions.
These include that, he stay away from Parnell Street, save for attending a specific premises on the street on one occasion every month; that he sign on three times a week at Henry Street garda station; that he stay sober in public; and that he continue to reside at his current home address.
Judge O’Leary remanded Hayes on bail to appear before Limerick District Court again in June for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nespresso-honesty-box-theft-4556234-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ WERE CALLED in to investigate the theft of €3,000 from a major government department after its ‘honesty box’ funds for Nespresso coffee pods disappeared from a filing cabinet.
However investigators were unable to uncover who was behind the theft at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and no staff were disciplined or sacked over the incident.
The theft also forced an overhaul of the department’s honesty-box procedures to prevent a repeat occurrence.
An internal audit report said the money was first noticed missing from the ground floor of the department’s then offices for support staff on Mespil Rd in Dublin at the end of 2017.
The funds were periodically pooled from €1 payments staff made for Nespresso coffee pods provided by the department. The pods were paid for out of the department’s budget on the condition that staff chipped in for personal use of coffee machines.
While the honesty-box cash was supposed to be regularly transferred into the department’s bank account, no payments had been made between early May and when the theft was reported – more than seven months later.
Department officials said it was impossible to work out exactly how much money had been stolen as there had been no regular counting of the funds, however it was estimated that €3,000 in cash had disappeared.

Poor security
The internal report noted that no one in the department appeared to have been given formal responsibility for looking after the cash, a fact that “the high turnover of staff … in 2016/17 may have contributed to”.  The funds were also regularly dipped into by staff looking for change.
Security arrangements were “not sufficient”, it added, as the key to the filing cabinet was kept in a staff member’s desk and everyone in the departmental unit knew where it was located.
The cabinet also contained “official files and consequently (was) accessed regularly”, the report said. The department had around 240 staff across its entire operations at the time.
Although the amount added to the honesty box was counted weekly, there were no running tallies of the total sum – which meant it was impossible to tell whether one or a series of thefts had occurred over an extended period of time.
“Security was so weak that the theft may be by … members of staff or anybody with access to (the office). It may have occurred early or late in the evening or by an opportunist during the day,” the report said.
Departmental staff had tried lodging cash at the bank in mid-August, but this attempt failed as the local branch had changed its opening hours and was closed when they arrived.
No subsequent attempts were made to deposit the money, and the slip for the attempted lodgement also went missing with the funds.
A spokesman for the Department said gardaí had investigated the theft and advised that “in the absence of relevant new information the investigation cannot be progressed any further at this time”.
He added that no staff had been disciplined or dismissed as a result of the incident, however tightened internal controls for cash management meant that the chance of a repeat occurrence was “considered negligible”.
These included the pooled money being kept in a locked cash box that was stored in a safe, with the funds overseen by a senior staff member.

https://www.thejournal.ie/smuggled-medicines-abortion-pills-4524905-Mar2019/,"THERE WAS A significant drop in the number of illegal medicines seized by Ireland’s medicine watchdog last year compared to the year previously.
The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has said today that last year it seized 619,213 dosage units (including tablets, capsules and vials) of falsified and other illegal medicines in 2018, compared to 948,915 in 2017.
Among the tablets seized were740 abortion pills(711 contained misoprostol and 29 contained mifepristone).
This compared with487 abortion pillsin 2017, of which 449 contained misoprostol and 38 contained mifepristone.
A combination of those two substances can induce a miscarriage: not much can be inferred from the increase in seizures, as the number of seizures has fluctuated for the past 10 years.

This could be due to more illegal medicines evading authorities some years, and more being caught the next year (you can see more detail on this in this previous report byTheJournal.ie).
The HPRA has reiterating its warning to the public of the dangers of sourcing prescription medicines online or from other illicit sources.
Other medicines seized during 2018 included sedatives (36%), erectile dysfunction medicines (18%) and anabolic steroids (16%).
The HPRA confirms that the supply of these products into and within Ireland was illegal and stresses that, while falsified medicines can be presented as legitimate, there are no guarantees around the safety, quality or effectiveness of prescription medicines bought outside of the regulated pharmacy setting or purchased via the internet.
Commenting on the enforcement figures for 2018, John Lynch, Director of Compliance at the HPRA, cautioned against the suggestion that the year on year decrease represented a significant shift in consumer behaviour.
“Analysis of the figures shows that there is a continuing and worrying trend of consumers in Ireland seeking to source illegal prescription medicines… over the past five year period more than 4.1 million units of illegal prescription medicines have been detained by the HPRA.
The HPRA works in partnership with Revenue’s Customs Service and An Garda Síochána at a national level and with other regulatory and law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat the illegal manufacture, importation and distribution of medicines, medical devices, and cosmetics.
To inform members of the public about the dangers associated with buying prescription medicines online, the HPRA has publishedthis advice leaflet.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jopath-third-time-referrals-4527202-Mar2019/,"SOME JOBSEEKERS HAVE been referred to JobPath for a third time – having already completed the scheme.
JobPath is an employment activation service for people who have been on the live register for more than 12 months and are trying to secure and sustain full-time paid employment or self-employment.
The latest department figures show that 25 people have been referred to the scheme for a third time. The updated numbers show that 21,846 have been referred to JobPath for a second time.
The total number of people who have been referred to JobPath is 209,538.
The two private companies employed by the State, Turas Nua and Seetec, to operate the scheme have received €75.7 million and €73.3 million respectively to carry out its work.
The two contractors are paid to work with both the jobseekers and employers to identify employment opportunities. They receive payments when someone who has taken part in the scheme gains proven employment.
It was revealed last month that only 11,334 out of 206,000 who have taken part in JobPath sustained employment for over 12 months.
However, despite the figures, Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty states the scheme is working. TDs have raised numerous reports about people being unhappy with their treatment on the programme.

‘Ridiculous’
Sinn Féin’s John Brady said JobPath does not enjoy the support of the majority in the Dáil, with themajority of TDs votingfor referrals to the programme to end.
“It has wasted millions in taxpayers’ money and we now have the ridiculous situation where people are being referred to JobPath for a third time.
“This means a third initial referral fee of €311 paid in respect of the same person three times. That is a total of €933 in referral fees for the same person. This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers’ money and it must end,” he said.
He added:
Sustainment payments are made to the companies over the course of a year for each person who gets employed after the JobPath process.
TheJournal.ierevealed last year that the private companies contracted by the State to run the scheme are entitled to €3,718 for every jobseeker that gains sustained employment for one year through JobPath.
People who refuse to engage with the scheme can have their social welfare reduced or cut off. In the last number of months, criticism has been levelled at the private companies operating the scheme.
Selection process for repeats
Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said her department selects clients for the JobPath service by means of a random selection process.

She said protocols for selection currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks with the JobPath service within the previous four months.
“If, however, at the end of this period the jobseeker has not engaged in other activation supports and services they then become eligible for selection for a subsequent period of activation on the JobPath programme,” she said.
She said jobseekers referred for a subsequent referral will start working with a personal advisor, who will review their development during their previous engagements with the service.
“Together they will prepare a new personal progression plan to build on that progress. The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagements, with particular focus on the identified barriers, which are preventing the person moving into full-time suitable employment,” added the minister.
TheJournal.iepreviously reported that of the 200,000 people who have been through JobPath,only 11,000 have held down jobsfor over a year.
The latest figures show that number has risen to 12,137 jobs being held down for 52 weeks.
Of the 77,252 currently engaged in the scheme, 47,482 have commenced employment. However, a further breakdown of those numbers show that only 28,582 jobs were sustained for 13 weeks, while 21,363 jobs have been sustained for 26 weeks to date.
A total of 16,152 jobs were sustained for 39 weeks to date.

Last year Temple Bar was on lock-down with manned barriers on all routes in and our of the area. Private security guards also helped gardaí to keep the peace.
The council has toldTheJournal.iethat arrangements in place this year are similar to last year’s plan.
“The plan has worked well for the last few years and as such there will be no material changes to 2018 plan.”
In a public notice issued this week Dublin City Council and An Garda Síochána said a number of additional public safety measures for the Temple Bar area will be implemented on 17 March.

“Drinking alcohol in public areas of the city is not permitted. Vehicular access will be restricted, with priority given to pedestrians. It is anticipated that the experience for visitors, residents and businesses alike will be improved as a result,” it stated.
Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the Licensed Vintner’s Association (LVA), which represents publicans in Dublin, said there will be additional security in bars across the city centre too.
“For many a visit to a Dublin pub is an essential part of the St Patrick’s Day experience. Obviously that extra activity does mean there will be more people working in Dublin pubs across the weekend, there will be more staff and more security in place,” he said.
The Temple Bar Residents’ Association has said people living in the area have been happy with the plans the council put in place over the last couple of years.
Secretary of the association Declan O’Brien toldTheJournal.ie: “Maybe four or five years ago it was horrific. It was an accident waiting to happen. It was actually so overcrowded people couldn’t get back to their apartments.”
He said the council had consulted with residents after this and tried to improve security and general safety in Temple Bar on the day.
“They’ve definitely made steps to improve it, so it will still be busy – especially because it’s falling on a weekend – but we’re not expecting it to be anything like is used to be.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-bog-butter-study-4541342-Mar2019/,"
LONG BEFORE MODERN refrigeration Irish people discovered that storing butter in the bog keeps it fresher for longer. Much longer. A new study has now revealed that the ingenious practice dates back nearly 4,000 years, 1,500 years longer than previously thought.
The bog’s preservative powers are so strong that butter can still be edible after centuries in the ground. This is thanks to the cool, low oxygen and high-acid environment.
When the food finally deteriorates it takes on a hard, yellowish-white, wax-like texture and a cheesy smell. Chunks of these ancient foodstuffs are still often unearthed by turf cutters.
The new study has found that people were storing butter in Irish bogs in the Early Bronze age and there may have been a booming dairy industry at the time.
The practice lasted a staggering 3,500 years, from 1700 BC to, as recently as, the 17th century.

“The widespread occurrence of these enigmatic butter deposits fits with our increasing knowledge of the central importance of dairying in prehistoric northern Europe,” Professor Richard Evershed from the University of Bristol explained.
Four of the five Bronze Age bog butters studied by the researchers came from Offaly, they were found at Ballindown, Drinagh, Esker More and Knockdrin. The fifth was recovered from Clonava in Westmeath.
The earliest dated sample, from Knockdrin, dates from between 1745–1635 BC. It was found associated with bark, which was possibly a wrapping or container.
“Clearly, it is unlikely there was a single reason for the deposition of bog butter over four millennia,” Dr Jessica Smyth from the UCD School of Archaeology said.
“In certain periods they may have been votive deposits, while at other points in time it may have been more about storage and even protection of valuable resources.”
The National Museum of Ireland works with Bord Na Móna to record and retrieve bog butters that are found by chance.
The archaeology branch of the museum, which is on Dublin’s Kildare Street, has a collection of the butters on display to the public.
The findings of the new study are published in the journalScientific Reportstoday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hospital-waiting-lists-plans-4536838-Mar2019/,"PATIENTS WAITING MORE than six months for some high volume procedures, including cataracts, joint replacements, tonsils and angiograms will be offered treatment this year, the Department of Health has said.
Minister for Health Simon Harris has published a new plan – the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 – aimed at reducing waiting times for patients.
The plan aims to improve access for patients waiting for hospital operations or procedures, as well as patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment.
In 2019, the HSE will deliver 1.155 million elective hospital procedures and over one million new outpatient appointments, according to the Department of Health.
It added that the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will deliver 25,000 inpatient day case treatments, 5,000 gastrointestinal scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments.

Under the plans, a particular focus will be put on 10 high volume procedures including cataracts, joint replacements, varicose veins, tonsillectomies, cystoscopies, angiograms, lesions, laparoscopic cholecystectomies, septoplasties, and dental/maxillofacial surgery.
The Department said that all clinically suitable patients waiting more than six months will be offered treatment in 2019.
The number of people waiting for a hospital procedure was reduced to 70,200 by the end of 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.
At the end of December 2018, the number of patients waiting longer than three months had dropped to 40,200 from just under 58,000 in July 2017, a decrease of 31%.
“However, it must be acknowledged that due to a number of factors, planned activity for January and February this year is behind target and waiting lists are higher than projected in the plan,” Minister Harris said.
“The challenge now will be to catch up on lost activity and meet the targets set out in the plan. The HSE and the NTPF are fully committed to meeting these targets and I look forward to progress in this regard. Irish patients want and deserve timely access to hospital procedures and appointments.”

THE ISLAMIC STATE group has been defeated in Syria, American-backed forces declared today.
Kurdish-led forces announced the end of Islamic State’s nearly five-year-old “caliphate” after forcing “diehard” jihadists from their last stronghold in Eastern Syria.
“Syrian Democratic Forces declare total elimination of [the] so-called caliphate and 100% territorial defeat of ISIS,” spokesman Mustefa Bali said in a statement.

Bali said the SDF had taken full control of Baghouz, a small village on the Euphrates where diehard jihadists made a last stand.
At its height, the Islamic State group ruled a third of both Syria and Iraq, holding millions of people hostage to violent interpretations of Islamic law.
The group carried out large-scale massacres. During a rampage through Iraq’s Sinjar region in 2014, it captured thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority and forced them into sexual slavery. Many remain missing today.
The group also used its caliphate as a launchpad for attacks around the globe – including the 2015 assaults in Paris that killed more than 130 people.

https://www.thejournal.ie/kim-jong-nam-murder-4540946-Mar2019/,"
A VIETNAMESE WOMAN suspected of assassinating the North Korean leader’s half-brother lost her bid for immediate release today as Malaysian authorities refused to drop a murder charge, days after her Indonesian co-accused was freed.
Doan Thi Huong broke down in tears as a prosecutor announced the attorney-general had rejected a request to free her and her trial would continue. She has been on trial for a year and a half over the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur airport.
On Monday, a murder charge was unexpectedly withdrawn against the Indonesian woman accused alongside her, sparking calls from Vietnam for Huong to be freed and prompting her lawyers to apply for her release.
The Vietnamese defendant, who had to be helped out of court by two police officers following the shock announcement, tearfully told reporters: “I am depressed. I am innocent… I want my family to pray for me.”
Huong’s lawyer said he would make a second bid to get the charge against her dropped, and criticised the failure to free her following the release of the Indonesian, Siti Aisyah.
“Both the accused have said they were made scapegoats by North Korea, both of them said they were doing video pranks – very obviously there is discrimination,” said Hisyam Teh Poh Teik.
The pair had always denied murder, saying they were tricked by North Korean spies into carrying out the Cold War-style hit that shocked the world using a highly toxic nerve agent, and believed it was a prank for a reality TV show.
Their lawyers presented them as scapegoats and said the real killers were four North Koreans, who were suspected of being the masterminds behind the plot but fled Malaysia shortly after the assassination.
Facing the death penalty
The prosecutor did not give any reason why charges were not being dropped for Huong, 30, who is now the sole defendant on trial for Kim’s murder and could face death by hanging if convicted.
Indonesia had mounted a sustained diplomatic offensive to free 27-year-old Aisyah, while Vietnam had only stepped up pressure since the Indonesian woman’s release this week.
During the trial, the court saw airport CCTV footage showing Huong approaching Kim, placing her hands on his face and then running away. Aisyah was only seen as a blurred figure fleeing the scene of the crime.

The trial began in October 2017 but there had been no hearings since August last year when the prosecution finished presenting its case.
Proceedings were scheduled to resume Monday with Huong testifying — but the unexpected release of Aisyah led to the trial being adjourned so the Vietnamese suspect could also seek her freedom.
But today, lead prosecutor Muhammad Iskandar Ahmad told the High Court in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur, that the attorney-general had ordered the case against Huong to proceed.
As Huong broke down in the dock, the judge said she was in not fit state to testify and ordered that the trial be adjourned until 1 April.
A murder conviction carries a mandatory penalty of death by hanging in Malaysia. The government vowed last year to scrap capital punishment but has indicated this week it would backtrack.
‘Clearly unfair’
Vietnam had increased pressure on Malaysia to release Huong since Aisyah was freed, with the foreign minister this week pressing his Malaysian counterpart on the issue and the justice minister writing to the attorney-general.
In Huong’s home village her father Doan Van Thanh, who had washed bed sheets in anticipation of her homecoming, was left heartbroken: “I am very sad. The government gave us the best support but the other side could not solve it, what can we do.”
Abdul Rashid Ismail, a leading Malaysian criminal lawyer who was not involved in the case, said the decision to prosecute Huong but not Aisyah was “clearly unfair”.
“This is the very reason why the death penalty should be abolished — the imposition of the death penalty may not be applied equally,” he told AFP.
Prosecutors said the women had been specially trained to murder the estranged relative of Kim Jong Un, once seen as heir apparent to the North’s leadership, but their lawyers insist they were innocent pawns.
South Korea has accused the North of ordering the hit, which Pyongyang denies.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has criticised John McCain, saying he wasn’t “thanked” for giving the late Republican Senator a state funeral.
Trump was speaking at a rally in Ohio yesterday evening when he made his comments about the late Senator, with whom he’d frequently feuded.
“I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve” Trump told reporters in Ohio. “I don’t care about this. I didn’t get (a) thank you but that’s OK.”
In his speech, Trump claimed – without citing evidence – that McCain had pushed for a war in Iraq and that he had failed America’s veterans.
He later said; “We sent him on the way but I wasn’t a fan of John McCain.”
The late Republican Senator, who died of a brain tumor aged 81 last August, was held in high regard by many Americans.

Following Trump’s comments, McCain’s biographer hit out at the President and called on US politicians to criticise Trump.
“I hope (Trump’s) indecency to John’s memory and to the McCain family will convince more officeholders that they can’t ignore the damage Trump is doing to politics and to the country’s well-being or remain silent despite their concerns,” said Mark Salter. “They must speak up.”
John McCain served as a Senator for 30 years and ran for President against Barack Obama in 2008.PA ImagesPA Images
Trump has said for years that he does not think McCain is a hero because the senator was captured in Vietnam. McCain was tortured and held prisoner by the Viet Cong for over five years.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended McCain’s legacy, saying he was “a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate.”
“His memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes.”
Senator Lindsey Graham, who cried on the Senate floor following McCain’s death last August but who has allied himself with Trump, said, “I think the president’s comments about [McCain] hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain.”
“A lot of people are coming to John’s defense now. I don’t like it when he says things about my friend John McCain.”

NEW ZEALAND PRIME Minister Jacinda Ardern has promised that the man responsible for last week’s deadly mosque massacres would face “the full force of the law”, as she vowed never to utter his name.
“He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety — that is why you will never hear me mention his name,” Ardern said in an emotional address to a special meeting of parliament, which she opened with the Arabic greeting “as salaam aleikum” — “peace be upon you”.
“I implore you: Speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them,” she told the gathering in Wellington, four days after the massacre in the southern city of Christchurch.
“He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless,” she said.

Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, was captured by police and has been charged with one count of murder, but Ardern assured parliament other charges would follow.
“He will face the full force of the law in New Zealand,” she said.
Ardern has promised reforms to New Zealand gun laws which allowed Tarrant to legally purchase the weapons he used in the attack, including semi-automatic rifles.
And she announced a full review of how the Australian – an avowed white supremacist – was able to plan and carry out the attacks in New Zealand under the radar of security services.
“The person who committed these acts was not from here. He was not raised here. He did not find his ideology here. But that is not to say that those very same views do not live here,” she said.

The result was 242 in favour and 391 against.
MPs will now vote tomorrow on whether there’s support to leave the EU without a deal, with a further possible vote on Thursday on extending Article 50.
This evening’s votecame in the wakeof last-minute measures announced last night by May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
However,advice from attorney generalGeoffrey Cox published this morning put the likelihood of the deal making it through the House tonight in jeopardy.
Earlier, the DUP said its MPs would not back it, Tory Brexiteer group the ERG indicated it wouldn’t either and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said leaving without a deal was now the safest route out of the EU.
As the vote was taking place, it became clear that May was heading for a second major defeat on the withdrawal agreement. Earlier projections by Sky News had put the scale of the defeat at around 100 votes. In the end, that tally was short by several dozen.

So what happens now?
Speaking immediately after the vote, May told MPs that the government would now hold a debate and vote tomorrow on whether the UK should leave without a deal.
A free vote will be allowed in the Conservative Party.
She said she believed there was still a majority in the House that wished to leave with a deal, and that she would return to the Commons to begin the debate tomorrow.
Information would be published on essential policies that would need to be in place for the UK to leave without a deal, including measures for the border, she said.
Following tomorrow’s vote, it’s possible a motion will be put forward on Thursday offering MPs an option on whether they want an extension to Article 50. That will only happen in the event that tomorrow’s vote shows support for a deal.
May said in her statement that if the House votes to leave without a deal on 29 March, “it will be the policy of the Government to implement that decision”.
“If the House declines to approve leaving without a deal on 29 March, the Government will, following that vote, bring forward a motion on Thursday on whether Parliament wants to seek an extension to Article 50.
“If the House votes for an extension, the Government will seek to agree that extension with the EU and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.
“But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declared the Brexit deal “dead”, and called on the government to adopt his proposals for a softer Brexit.
“Their deal, their proposal, the one the prime minister’s put is clearly dead,” Corbyn said.

The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the#UK. Our “no-deal” preparations are now more important than ever before.
The EU, meanwhile, is standing firm on its position that negotiations on this deal are at an end.
“The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the UK. Our ‘no-deal’ preparations are now more important than ever before,” the union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Twitter.
A spokesperson for President of the European Council Donald Tusk said that should the UK make a “reasoned request” for an extension, the remaining EU 27 would consider it and decide by unanimity.
“EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth functioning of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”
“With only 17 days left to 29 March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” the spokesman said.

If MPs vote against a no-deal exit tomorrow, and vote to postpone Brexit on Thursday, the other 27 EU nations would need to agree.
Their leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit on 21-22 March.
But any postponement may have to be short-lived. Juncker on Monday said Brexit “should be complete before the European elections” at the end of May.
The new EU parliament begins on the 1 July, meaning the latest possible date that they could extend Article 50 by, would be three months.
Speaking to Sky News tonight, Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said he “doesn’t know what’s next”, adding that “a series of negative majorities does not produce a positive majority”.
The EU can’t “suppress” the Good Friday Agreement, he said, adding that the idea of the EU agreeing to leave its border with Northern Ireland open, negatively impacting the valuable Single Market is “ludicrous”.
When asked whether the EU would grant the UK an extension, Lamberts said:
“Only if there’s a serious game plan – but without a plan, why should we grant you an extension? It makes no sense.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-jackson-finding-neverland-sam-smyth-4529933-Mar2019/,"JOURNALIST SAM SMYTH has described how he had concerns for a child who had a “deeply suspicious” relationship with Michael Jackson in a hotel in 1988.
Writing in the Irish Mail on Sunday last week, Smyth recalled covering the singer’s visit to Cork as part of the ‘Bad’ tour.
He revealed how James Safechuck, one of the men who as accused Jackson of abusing him in the documentary Leaving Neverland, accompanied the singer to Cork.
And speaking onThe Ray D’Arcy Showon RTÉ Radio 1 yesterday, Smyth said that he was staying at Jackson’s hotel, where Safechuck was also staying, and that he felt something wasn’t right about their relationship.
“I remember thinking at the time… it’s very odd for a man in his 30th year to have his very best friend as this boy called Little Jimmy Safechuck who was 10,” he said.
“The whole thing was odd, and deeply suspicious. Certainly not anything that I would ever want for anyone belonging to me.”

He describes how Safechuck had his own room at Jury’s Hotel, but that it constantly had a ‘do not disturb’ sign on the door and sheeting on the windows to block out views.
While those facts themselves didn’t arouse too much suspicion, Smyth said “the whole thing was adding to something very bizarre”.
After learning that Safechuck was not attending Jackson’s concert in Pairc Uí Chaoimh and was staying in his bedroom all night, Smyth, along with Eamon Dunphy, decided to write the boy a letter in an attempt to ensure everything was okay.
Using hotel stationery and a notepad, he describes that they wrote: “Dear Little Jimmy Safechuck, we are in the residents’ lounge… and if you are being held against your will or if you need rescuing contact us’.”
He said the pair gave the note to the porter, along with a “handsome tip”, to put it under Safechuck’s door, but added that they never heard from the child.
Despite this, Smyth says he believes the allegations made in the Leaving Neverland documentary.
“I’m quite convinced that they are telling the truth,” he said. “I think most people would be… I think the film is very credible and very skillfully made.”

Murray Kinsella reports from the Aviva Stadium
JOHNNY SEXTON DISHING out high fives, Garry Ringrose’s dancing feet taking him around defenders, CJ Stander’s relentless carrying driving him through Frenchmen, Keith Earls scorching home off a Joe Schmidt special strike play.
Happier times are back and, after a bonus-point win here, Schmidt’s team now face into a visit to Wales next weekend, when they can spoil Warren Gatland’s side’s Grand Slam party, with momentum harnessed again.
The championship is not yet completely dead for Ireland, although they would need Scotland to record a shock win over England next weekend – as well as beating Wales themselves – to claim the trophy.

Even the late withdrawal of fullback Rob Kearney – ruled out after his calf tightened up yesterday – couldn’t put Ireland off the task here, as Jordan Larmour started and delivered one of his most impressive performances in green yet.
Larmour’s introduction meant Schmidt’s team showed eight changes in total from the stuttering win over Italy and the likes of returning captain Rory Best, CJ Stander, Iain Henderson, man of the match James Ryan and Cian Healy added major ballast up front.
Sexton and his halfback partner Conor Murray had their best games of the championship so far, while the class of Ringrose back in the 13 shirt was as influential and riveting to watch as ever.
The travelling French support was vocal at times but their team gave them little to cheer about until a pair of late consolation scores.
A staggering 90% share of the territory in the first half helped Schmidt’s men towards three tries from Best, out-half Sexton and replacement back row Jack Conan – on for the injured Josh van der Flier – and there was more fun after the break.
Earls scored his 30th international try off a delightfully clever strike from a lineout, allowing Schmidt to call the likes of Sexton and Murray ashore with the final quarter still left to play, subs Jack Carty and John Cooney getting valuable exposure at Test level.
Jacques Brunel’s visitors were rudderless and impotent for long spells, but the late tries scored by Yoann Huget and Camille Chat will leave Schmidt with some frustrations at how his side saw out their win.

Before that late flurry, Ireland’s control of the encounter was suffocating and they now face into their six-day turnaround before the visit to Cardiff with their much-discussed confidence boosted.

Larmour had a wonderful start, finding grass deep behind the French after a clever early Ringrose kick manipulated their backfield,les Bleusright wing Damien Penaud forced to put the ball into touch after Larmour’s accurate right-footed touch.
France infringed on the first close-range maul effort but Ireland went back into the left corner and captain Best snuck down the touchline off the second attempt, James Ryan helping him over for a settling early score, smartly converted by Sexton.
And so ensued the incredibly territorial dominance for Ireland as their attacking game showed up impressively, benefiting from superb carrying by the likes of Stander and Healy, as well as the tip-on passes from Peter O’Mahony and others.
Healy nearly had a 17th-minute try, showing his smarts to reach out as the ball rolled from the back of a French ruck onto their own tryline, but the Ireland loosehead knocked-on rather than dotted it down and the visitors breathed a sigh of relief.
Van der Flier departed injured in the third quarter but Ireland continued to apply pressure and ignore chances to kick at goal, opting instead to go into that left corner.

With another penalty advantage playing in the 30th minute, they crossed for a second as Sexton ran a loop around Ringrose – Larmour picking a great line outside Ringrose to sit down the French defence - and the returning outside centre showed his deft handling skills to send Sexton over untouched for a converted try.
Ringrose nearly had one himself four minutes later as he beat French fullback Thomas Ramos in the air under a Sexton garryowen, but was unfortunate to lose the ball forward in a last-ditch tackle as he looked to ground it under the posts.
Ireland had their third score before the break, however, as the imposing Henderson stripped the ball out of French possession down in the visitors’ besieged 22.
Bundee Aki carried powerfully before replacement Conan hammered through French captain Guilhem Guirado’s tackle wide on the right to finish.
An utterly dominant first-half for Ireland ended with Sexton and Aki pulling off a choke tackle turnover asles Bleustried in vain to get a foothold in the Irish half.

Leading 19-0 as the second-half kicked-off, Ireland were treated to a rendition of The Fields of Athenry as the rain fell again, Ringrose’s sharp tackle on Dupont forcing a knock-on as the French had an early chance to attack.
France’s next attack saw O’Mahony earn a questionable-looking turnover attack, the slippery ball making it difficult for Brunel’s side.
When Ireland got their first chance of the half to create, Earls put a beautiful kick deep behind the French and Ringrose followed up to hammer Dupont in the tackle, providing Ireland a five-metre scrum.
Ireland initially missed out on the bonus-point score as they put the ball down twice in quick succession, a Sexton loop play failing and then O’Mahony spilling.
But they produced a brilliant Schmidt special after France had exited, Earls joining the a right-hand-side lineout 35 metres out, from where Ireland set up a dummy maul and sent Stander splintering off infield to deliver an inside pass to the hidden Earls.
The Munster wing scorched through the beautifully-created gap to finish and Sexton converted for 26-0 before Schmidt sent on Carty in his place and began to empty the bench.

Carty showed his class with two delightful tactical kicks soon after coming on, the second of which led to a crooked lineout throw from Guirado, meaning another five-metre scrum for Schmidt’s men.
This passage of pressure saw the French scrum wholly incapable of staying up and replacement tighthead Dorian Aldegheri was sin-binned by referee Ben O’Keeffe, although Ireland butchered the scrum immediately after.
Frustratingly, it was the French who finished with the final scoring acts, Huget breaking away under the posts, before replacement hooker Camille Chat dotted down at the back of a maul.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-bus-announce-new-route-from-ballymun-to-bray-4529203-Mar2019/,"A NEW BUS route from Ballymun to Bray will begin operating on Sunday 24 March, Dublin Bus announced today.
Route 155 will operate seven days a week between furniture superstore IKEA in Ballymun on Dublin’s northside all the way to Bray Rail Station in Co Wicklow.
The new bus route, which will operate every 20 minutes, will service Dublin City University, Phibsborough, the city centre, Donnybrook, University College Dublin, Stillorgan, Cabinteely and Bray.
The first 155 will depart at 6am Monday to Saturday with an 8am start on Sundays.

Ballymun councillor Independent Noeleen Reilly has said that the new 155 bus route will “not only provide additional support for the number 4 and the 13 bus routes but Bray is a very popular location and to have a direct bus route there is very welcome”.
“I can see especially in the summer time that this new destination will become very popular with people in Ballymun”.
“Residents are extremely pleased as currently you need to get a number of buses, or a bus and a train out there”.
Local TD Noel Rock has said the new route “makes a lot of sense for people on the northside and effectively increases capacity from IKEA to the City Centre to 8 buses an hour each way”.
“Many IKEA workers had contacted me looking for this route as the current services weren’t starting early enough,” Rock has said. “This new route remedies that”.
“There will also be a big improvement in Ballymun’s 13 service starting the same day – with one bus running every ten minutes at peak time”.

THE NAMES OF the 23 people killed in the deadliest US tornado in nearly six years were released by the coroner today, revealing that one extended family lost seven members.
Among the victims were four children, including 6-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr, who was torn from his father’s arms; and 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who was visiting a friend’s home when the twister struck.
Jimmy Lee Jones, 89, perished along with his wife of six decades, Mary Louise, and one of their sons.
“Just keep those families in your prayers,” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster.
Meanwhile, the search for victims in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continues; seven or eight people are still missing.
“We’ve got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure,” said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather Jr. “We don’t think we’ll find nobody there, but we don’t want to leave any stone unturned.”

AJ had taken shelter in a closet with his father and older brother when the tornado hit, said Jack Crisp, the boy’s uncle. The punishing winds tore the family’s home apart, Crisp said, and pulled both boys from their father’s arms.
“He had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them,” Crisp said. “It just demolished the house and took them.”
The boy’s father and brother both survived.

Jackie Jones said she and her siblings rushed to her parents’ house after the storm passed and nobody answered the phone. “They usually answer on the first ring,” she said.
The siblings found the home reduced to its foundation. One of their two brothers who lived at the house survived and was taken to a hospital. But Jimmy Lee and Mary Louise Jones, married for more than 60 years, had died along with their 53-year-old son Emmanuel.
The body of David Wayne Dean, aged 53, was found by his son in a neighbour’s yard after the twister demolished his mobile home.
“He was gone before we got to him,” said his sobbing widow, Carol Dean, who was at work at Walmart when the storm hit.
About the tornado

It was the deadliest tornado to hit the US since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
The tornado brought winds estimated at 170 mph and carved a path nine-tenths of a mile wide in Alabama, scraping up the earth in a phenomenon known as “ground rowing,” the National Weather Service said.
It traveled a remarkable 70 miles or so through Alabama and Georgia, where it caused more damage. Ninety people were injured in the Beauregard area, authorities said.
President Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday to see the damage. “It’s been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done,” he said at the White House.
Many of the people living in the area are senior citizens who moved to the country after retiring from textile mills or an old magnetic-tape manufacturing plant that closed years ago, it was reported.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed that at least 20 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irishmen-australia-scam-4541200-Mar2019/,"AN IRISH MAN has been extradited from Melbourne to Sydney, facing charges related to an alleged roof scamming operation, New South Wales Police have said.
The 20-year-old is one of three Irish nationals charged as part of an investigation into a series of alleged frauds targeting elderly homeowners.
Another of the men – also 20 – was arrested at Sydney Airport on 7 March just before he was due to board a flight to the UK. Police allegedly discovered large amounts of cash and jewellery in his luggage.
He was charged with aggravated break and enter, and denied bail.
Detectives established that an alleged scam was in operation and would continue the next day at a home in Bexley, a suburb in the south of Sydney.

Police are said to have contacted and warned the 72-year-old man who owned the home.
Following further inquiries, police arrested a 22-year-old Irish national on the morning of Saturday 9 March as he tried to board a flight to Qatar.
He is also alleged to have a large amount of cash and jewellery in his luggage. He was charged with fraud and deal in proceeds of crime.
The last man was arrested in Melbourne, as he attempted to board a flight to Shanghai. He was due to appear at Sutherland Local Court today.
All three men have been denied bail, and the hunt for a potential fourth offender is continuing.
Police are continuing to investigate whether this case is related to similar alleged fraud offences involving elderly victims.

https://www.thejournal.ie/first-time-buyers-scheme-eoghan-murphy-4526555-Mar2019/,"A FIRST-TIME-BUYERS loan scheme has not closed and applications can continue, Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy has said, following concerns that funding has run out.
TheJournal.iereported on Mondaythat concerns had been raised that funds for the government’s Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme have run out.
However, Murphy today said that “the scheme is not closed” and that “funding has not run out”.
Under the scheme, a first-time-buyer can apply for a home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property, or to build their own home.
First-time-buyers can borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property, with maximum market values set at €320,000 in the counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and €250,000 in the rest of the country.
Labour Housing Spokesperson Jan O’Sullivan on Monday raised concerns about a directive being issued to local authorities telling them to stop considering applications for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme due to funds for the scheme running out.
Murphy appeared before an Oireachtas Housing Committee this morning to answer questions on the progress of the government’s Rebuilding Ireland Housing Action Plan, launched in July 2016.
However, members of the committee took the opportunity to quiz the minister on reports in recent days over the loan scheme.
Solidarity-People Before Profit TD Mick Barry asked Murphy why the scheme had been “frozen”.
“I say that it’s madness in the middle of the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State that a scheme such as this would be frozen for any length of time,” Barry said.
RTÉreported yesterdaythat a Department of Housing internal document revealed the scheme had been put on hold because it had run out of funding.
Senator Victor Boyhan said that “yesterday people woke up to Morning Ireland to listen to what would appear to be a crisis in terms of funding for this initiative”.

“These are people who are just barely over the threshold. These are people that get up very early in the morning, who work all day, who want to provide housing for themselves,” Boyhan said.
Echoing Boyhan’s comments, Fianna Fáil TD Darragh O’Brien said “there are hundreds of really concerned people out there right now”.
“Their concerns need to be addressed and they need to be addressed very clearly,” he said.
Addressing the committee, Murphy said he is “genuinely surprised how this was being reported yesterday”.
More funding required
Murphy confirmed that the scheme is at about 50% drawdown, but said “if we look at the amount that have been approved, we’re almost at potentially a drawdown limit if that continues through into the rest of the year”.
“The reality is the scheme will require more funding to be made available and that’s what I’m discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,” Murphy said.
A spokesperson for the housing minister confirmed toTheJournal.ieon Monday that the Housing Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to an extension of the scheme in this regard.
“When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately €200 million over three years.
“From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation,” they added.
Murphy said today that the Department has been “engaging” with local authorities who have reached their limit for the scheme and that some were given additional funding last year.
“Any loan approval that has been given will be honoured, of course it will be. Applications are still being received,” he said.

A BAND FORMED from residents of the Kinsale Road Direct Provision centre in Cork has been awarded a €5,000 grant by the Cork Arts Office.
One of the band’s leaders, Roos Demol, has acclaimed the move as a wonderful gesture of support from the city.
The project had very humble beginnings. Demol and her fellow founder Norbert Nkengurutse simply wanted to collect musical instruments and organise music lessons for the people in the centre .
After successfully gathering guitars and keyboards Demol, who has worked in world music for years, quickly saw the potential in the diverse range of voices and the band started to take shape.
Before long it boasted nine musicians from nine different countries with each performing music from their own country of origin.
“You could be listening to a Ukrainian singer accompanied by a Burundian and an Indian playing guitar,” Demol said.
Surprisingly communication hasn’t been an issue for a group with such a diverse range of backgrounds.

Demol explains that when language barriers pop up they quickly sort things out with gestures and singing and communicating through the music.
Cork City CouncilCork City Council
“The energy that comes out of this group is amazing,” she said.
“We practice in the Direct Provision centre and the other residents come along and watch. When they first appear they sit at the back of the room but the next time they move a bit closer and then in a couple of weeks they’re at the table with us playing along with a precussion instrument.”
Dubbed Citadel, in a nod to where people find sanctuary in times of war, the group played its first live event outside the centre at Bull McCabe’s bar on the Kinsale Road last year.
The buzz generated from that show saw them pick up gigs at Cork Culture night, the International Guitar Festival in Clonakilty, refugee week in UCC and many other events.
With the help of the grant they now plan to tour Ireland playing for residents in Direct Provision centres around the country and will hold workshops withNiwel Tsumbu, a guitarist from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has lived in Ireland for over a decade.
They are also working with a Saleem Nze, of Selector Slim Productions, who will film the progress of the band to make a documentary.
Demol believes it’s the first time a local council has given financial support to a band composed of asylum seekers.
“It’s an amazing feeling to be supported by your local city,” she said. “To have that backing is fantastic and it shows that Cork is serious about being a city of sanctuary”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rte-boycott-eurovision-protest-israel-palestine-4530741-Mar2019/,"THE IRELAND-PALESTINE Solidarity Campaign has held a protest outside RTÉ calling on the national broadcaster to boycott this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Israel.
The protest follows this morning’s announcement thatSarah McTernanwill represent Ireland with her song ’22′ in Tel Aviv on 16 May.
The group says that while it congratulates McTernan on her achievement, it sincerely hopes that she will “take this opportunity to stand on the right side of history by listening to the Palestinian and international calls for a boycott”.
Chairperson of the IPSC, Fatin Al Tamimi, toldTheJournal.ieshe hopes McTernan will pull out because that is the call of Palestinian civil society.
“Furthermore, despite a supposed commitment to allow Eurovision fans to enter the state ‘regardless of political opinions’, Palestinian fans – whether from the occupied Palestinian territories or the refugee diaspora – are highly unlikely to be allowed entry to attend the contest, reflecting Israel discriminatory apartheid system imposed upon for Palestinians,” IPSC said.

RTÉ has said it will not boycott the contest, stating that the winner and host country of the Eurovision is determined by the rules of the competition, not RTÉ.
“RTÉ is a registered participant in the 2019 ESC, which promotes values of diversity and inclusion and is broadcast to around 200 million viewers worldwide,” the national broadcaster said.
“The Eurovision Song Contest’s values are of universality and inclusivity and a shared tradition of celebrating diversity through music,” RTÉ said, adding that 41 members of European Broadcasting Union have confirmed they will take part in the 2019 Contest in Israel.

In a statement toTheJournal.ie,The Israeli Embassy said that Israel is looking forward to “welcoming all participants of the Eurovision song contest including of course from Ireland”.
The statement went on to criticise people seeking to boycott the contest in Israel saying they “exhibit the very antithesis of these values”.
‘Shame on Ireland’
Palestinian campaigner, Asad Abushark, said he was shocked that Ireland’s national broadcaster would participate and go to Israel, “which is oppressing Palestinian people”.
“Shame on Ireland to do that. The Irish should side with the oppressed people because they themselves have a history of occupation.”
Abushark toldTheJournal.iethat he came to Ireland six months ago but that his family still live in a refugee camp in Gaza.
“The Irish people are great, supporting a Palestinian cause, most of the people here today are Irish. They have always supported the Palestinian people.
“This is why I found it strange that RTÉ is participating because most Irish people support Palestine. I think RTÉ should be supportive like the Irish people.”

Speaking on RTÉ radio this afternoon, Irish Delegation Head producer Michael Kealy said that no other member of the European Broadcasting Union was boycotting this year’s competition which was set up to bring countries together “through a shared love of music”.
Kealy pointed out that Ireland has participated in Israel the two previous times the county hosted Eurovision and that there was never anyinternal RTÉ discussionsabout boycotting the 2019 competition.
“We’re not going to make any political points,” Kealy said. “We’re not an organisation that does make political statements”.

https://www.the42.ie/schmidt-selection-cardiff-wales-six-nations-4534150-Mar2019/,"A SIX-DAY TURNAROUND to this Saturday’s clash with Wales means Ireland will have what Joe Schmidt termed “a very truncated week.”
Speaking after yesterday’s 26-14 victory over France in Dublin, the Ireland boss said he was unsure whether his squad would take to the training pitch on Tuesday or Wednesday as the face into their bid to prevent Warren Gatland’s Welsh side from securing a Grand Slam.
Schmidt has a shortened week of preparation.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
The narrow recovery timeframe may also prompt a handful of changes from Schmidt on the selection front, even if Ireland delivered their most cohesive performance of the championship againstles Bleus, sullied only by conceding two late tries.
Rob Kearney was a late withdrawal from the game due to calf tightness but Schmidt said the fullback has “a really good chance” of being fit to feature against the Welsh, although Josh van der Flier is a greater concern after suffering a leg injury versus the French.
If van der Flier is ruled out, the make-up of the starting back row in Cardiff will be of major interest. The trio of Jack Conan, Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander performed strongly yesterday after the starting number seven had been replaced by Conan, with Stander moving to the openside.

Schmidt name-checked Sean O’Brien and Dan Leavy as possible options at openside against Wales, while he also hinted that hooker Sean Cronin could be set for a return to the squad after being omitted for round four.
“There’s a couple of guys who have been in and around the squad,” said Schmidt yesterday. “Obviously Dan Leavy was up in Belfast, Rob Kearney should be right to train on Tuesday.
“Sean O’Brien, Sean Cronin, Rob Herring – there’s a number of guys who we’ll get back this evening and go through and have a look at how they all shape up.
“There’s obviously a few guys in the backs as well but the midfield combination worked well today with Bundee [Aki] and Garry Ringrose, those guys have played together a fair bit.
Dan Leavy hasn't featured for Ireland in this Six Nations.James Crombie / INPHOJames Crombie / INPHO / INPHO
“The back three, certainly the wingers, have been one of the more consistent fixtures so far in the Six Nations.
“Andrew Conway came in late, but whether we have a look at freshening that up. And front-row wise, Andrew Porter was with us in the warm-up.
“Tadhg Beirne, we’ll see how he is on Tuesday but there’s those sorts of options that we’ll just have a look at.”

With a relatively condensed timeframe to prepare, Schmidt said Ireland won’t be wasting much of their week considering the prospect of denying the Welsh their Grand Slam in Cardiff.
“It’s funny, people might talk about that but for us, we want to finish as well as we can in the Six Nations,” said Schmidt. “It’s less about where Wales are positioned.
“We know that if we could get a win we would go past them in the championship on the ladder at the end of the day, but at the same time, it is just another game.
“And as boring as it is, in terms of a six-day turnaround you can’t really think too much about championships or anything else.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/bercow-brexit-vote-4548946-Mar2019/,"THE SPEAKER OF the House of Commons has said Prime Minister Theresa May cannot have another meaningful vote on the Brexit deal without changes.
John Bercow said MPs from both sides of the house had expressed concern to him about the house being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.
He said the parliament’s rules state that a motion or amendment that is the same in substance as one that has already been decided by the House can not be brought forward again in that same session.
Bercow told the House of Commons that he is of the opinion that the second meaningful vote on the deal, which took place on 12 March, was not in breach of this rule.

He said it could be “credibly argued” that it was a different proposition as it contained a number of legal changes that the government considered to be binding and that were agreed with the European Union.
However he added that the government can not now submit “the same proposition or substantially the same proposition” as was rejected on 12 March by 149 votes.
He said it must be “fundamentally different”.
Theresa May had been expected to call a third meaningful vote this week but this is now unlikely to happen.
Bercow said this was not his final word on the matter. He said it was designed to signal to the government what will be required.

https://www.thejournal.ie/australia-turkey-attack-4551524-Mar2019/,"
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER Scott Morrison condemned the “reckless” and “highly offensive” comments made by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the wake of the Christchurch massacre.
Morrison has warned that he would consider “all options” in reviewing ties between the two countries.
On the campaign trail, the Turkish leader has used video footage of the terror attack that killed 50 people and painted it as part of an assault on Turkey and Islam.
He has also warned anti-Muslim Australians – like the suspected gunman – would be “sent back in coffins” like their grandfathers at Gallipoli, which was the scene of a blood-drenched WWI battle.
More than 8,000 Australians died fighting Turkish forces around the seaside town, a landmark moment in Australian history.
“Remarks have been made by the Turkish President Erdogan that I consider highly offensive to Australians and highly reckless in this very sensitive environment,” Morrison said after summoning the Turkish ambassador and dismissing the “excuses” offered.
“I am expecting, and I have asked, for these comments to be clarified, to be withdrawn,” said Morrison, who also faces an election challenge in the coming weeks.
He described claims about Australia and New Zealand’s response to the white supremacist attack as “vile”.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern refused to be drawn on Erdogan’s comments, but said her deputy would be going to Turkey to “set the record straight”.
Morrison said Australians travelling to Turkey should exercise common sense and cautioned that travel advice for Turkey was under review.
“I will wait to see what the response is from the Turkish government before taking further action, but I can tell you that all options are on the table,” Morrison said.
In fiery remarks, Morrison accused Erdogan of betraying the promise of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk – the father of the modern state and a revered figure in Turkey – to forge peace between the two countries.

A memorial at the battlefield carries Ataturk’s words:
“Ataturk sought to transform his country into a modern nation and, an embracing nation, and I think these comments are at odds with that spirit,” Morrison said.
‘Totally unfair’
Erdogan had already been sharply rebuked by New Zealand for his comments and for using gruesome video shot by the Christchurch mosque gunman as an election campaign prop.
New Zealand’s Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters protested on Monday that such politicisation of the massacre “imperils the future and safety of the New Zealand people and our people abroad, and it’s totally unfair”.
Peters announced yesterday that he would be travelling to Turkey this week at Istanbul’s request to attend a special meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Three Turkish nationals were wounded in the rampage that killed 50 worshippers at two mosques in the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch last Friday.
The accused gunman, a self-avowed white supremacist from Australia, live-streamed much of the attack and spread a manifesto on social media claiming it was a strike against Muslim “invaders”.
The manifesto references Turkey and the minarets of Istanbul’s famed Hagia Sophia, now a museum, that was once a church before becoming a mosque during the Ottoman empire.
“This is not an isolated event, it is something more organised,” Erdogan said during a campaign event on Monday in Canakkale in western Turkey.
Erdogan did not project the video at the Monday event.
Peters said he had complained directly to visiting Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.

‘It’s a shock the first year’
Yesterday, the sister of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick toldRTÉ Radio One’s Ray D’Arcy Showhow her family has been coping since her death.
Niamh Fitzpatrick described how Dara’s son Fionn, a baby at the time of his mother’s death, has become a little boy Dara would be “so proud of”.
Fitzpatrick said the family has found the days leading up to the anniversary of the crash very difficult. She described how the initial aftermath Dara’s death was like a blur and now they’re feeling her loss without the shock – something Niamh said she finds more painful.

She added: “It’s a tough couple of days. It gets different over time – maybe putting my psychologist hat on. That first year, we were probably anesthetised. This year, we are dealing with the grief without anything to numb the pain, so there’s a reality about it.
“It’s shock the first year, with the trauma, as well as grief and it’s almost like you have to deal with that first before you deal with the grief.”
The search for the crew lasted 42 days. Fitzpatrick said she owes the people of Blacksod an eternal debt of gratitude for their warmth and support throughout the weeks.
“I don’t think we will ever be able to thank them but even to say the words, that I’m grateful for that.”

NEARLY ONE HUNDRED asylum seekers have been relocated from a hotel in Co Monaghan to make rooms available ahead of Ireland’s tourist season.
As pressure on the asylum system continues, the use of emergency accommodation has been necessary since last year, the Department of Justice and Equality has said.
Campaigners, however, have criticised the instability of locating people in hotels and B&Bs in remote areas.
A contract issued by the department last September to Treacy’s Hotel in Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan to provide beds on an emergency basis ends later this month. Residents have now been moved to Co Meath to another emergency set-up as a result.
People living in the hotel started leaving their rooms last Thursday. The majority have now been relocated to a hotel in Co Meath. Others have been dispersed to B&Bs in Co Monaghan, the contracts for which end later this month.
It is understood that several people have also been relocated to a hotel in Co Louth which has recently started accommodating asylum seekers.
With Ireland’s 38 Direct Provision centres currently at capacity, the department’s Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) will continue to source these emergency beds in commercial businesses around Ireland until more permanent centres are opened.

Direct Provision centres are generally re-purposed or purpose-built facilities to accommodate asylum seekers in Ireland. Some centres are state-run but most are tendered out to various private contractors.
Despite saying in early January that asylum seekers are placed in emergency accommodation “for a short period before they are moved into the mainstream accommodation system”, a number of people have been residing in Cavan-Monaghan emergency accommodation for six months,TheJournal.iehas learned.
As of late December, six hotels and B&Bs were contracted to the Department to provide emergency accommodation to asylum seekers. These contracts end in late March.
In January, a further three hotels in Co Dublin were contracted to provide emergency beds as well as one hotel in Co Louth and a hotel in Co Waterford.
‘Severe pressure’
Lucky Khambule of the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) has said that his organisation “is concerned and opposed to people’s lives being made unstable by moving them around for the convenience of the hotel’s needs.”
“To us it shows that our people do not matter at all as long as those tasked to protect them actually put them in risk by moving them around”.
Due to the rise in the number of applicants for international protection in Ireland, however, “severe pressure” is being placed on RIA, according to a spokesperson.
To comply with the EU Reception Conditions directive, use of emergency accommodation has been necessary since September, they said.
“It is not possible to predict how many people may arrive in any given year seeking international protection,” a department spokesperson has said.
Related ReadsPrivate company paid €1.6 million in 4 months to find emergency accommodation for asylum seekers
In late January, the department tendered for more emergency accommodation to provide beds and food for those seeking international protection in Ireland.
The call-out notice for the contract states that RIA is “not seeking exclusive use of any premises” and that any rooms not being used in the hotel or guesthouse by the agency can continue to be made commercially available.
‘A stable home’
Concerns have been raised about the level of service provision for those living in RIA-sourced emergency accommodation, however.
Immigrant support centre Nasc has called on RIA to ensure adequate service provision for residents following a number of reports in recent months.
A department spokesperson has said that, although RIA aims to place people in Direct Provision centres, it has not been possible to do so following two recent fires at hotels inMoville, Co Donegal andRooskyon the Roscommon-Leitrim border.
The department has confirmed that it still aims to open both hotels as Direct Provision centres.
It is unclear for how long exactly those who have been relocated from Carrickmacross to emergency accommodation in Co Meath will be there for.
Khambule of MASI has said that “everyone needs a stable home and to live freely wherever they are. That is no different for a person living in Direct Provision”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jean-mcconville-tv-mini-series-4533409-Mar2019/,"THE SON OF Jean McConville has said that her family are “upset and disgusted” to learn that a US company intends to make a TV mini series based on their mother’s murder.
It comes after the production company Color Force, which is behind the American Crime Story series (‘The People v OJ Simpson’ and ‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace’), toldThe Hollywood Reporterthat it intends to adapt the book ‘Say Nothing’ in a similar way.
Widow Jean McConville was aged 38 when she was abducted, murdered and buried by the IRA in 1972. The remains of the mother of ten was not found until 2003, when a storm washed away a part of a beach embankment in Co Louth, and exposing her body.
The IRA admitted to its involvement in the killing after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.
Jean McConville’s son Michael has said today that her family are upset by the idea that their mother’s murder may be turned into a mini TV series.

Michael McConville said today: “Using what happened to our mother for entertainment is sickening.”
He added: “To make money out of her murder and the pain that has been in our lives ever since is cruel and obscene.
He said that he believes the early deaths of his two siblings were related to the grief and stress of losing their mother in the way they did, saying that it “ripped our family apart”.
The production company is looking for a writer to adapt the book ‘Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland’, by New Yorker writer Patrick Radden Keefe, which was published in the UK last year.
The Hollywood Reporter states that Keefe, along with Color Force’s Brad Simpson and Nina Jacobson will serve as executive producers of the series. The latter two toldTHR:
The book is described as offering “not just a forensic account of a brutal crime but a vivid portrait of the world in which it happened”.
Michael McConville said that he doubts “they even think of us as real people”.

Breaking: at least two of the#Londonexplosive devices were posted with Irish stamps. Gardaí confirm they are assisting the@metpoliceukwith enquiriespic.twitter.com/YdtnbcI667
THE MET POLICE has launched a terrorism investigation after three small explosive devices were reported at three public transport locations in London this afternoon.
The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags – have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices. These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened.
Gardaí confirmed toTheJournal.iethis evening that they are helping the Met Police with their investigations.
Pictures obtained by Sky News show two of the packages which were sent. They had An Post stamps on the front and the return address can be seen as Dublin.
The stamps which can be seen were issued at Valentine’s Day last year.
At around 9:55am police received a report of a suspicious package at The Compass Centre, Nelson Road, Hounslow, which is a building near Heathrow Airport.
The package was opened by staff at the building, causing the device to initiate. This resulted in part of the package burning. No one was injured.

The building was evacuated as a precaution. Specialist officers attended and made the device safe. The building remains closed as enquiries continue.
Police and Heathrow Airportclarified thatflights were not impacted by the incident.
At around 11.40am the British Transport Police were called to reports of a suspicious package in the post room at Waterloo Station. The package was not opened. Specialist officers attended and made the device safe. No one was injured.
The station was not evacuated, but cordons are in place at a small area outside the station on Cab Road. Train services are continuing to operate as normal.
At 12.10pm the Met Police were called to a report of a suspicious package at offices at London City Aviation House in Newham.
The package was not opened and no one was injured, but the building was evacuated as a precaution. The building has since been reopened.
DLR services to London City Airport were also suspended as a precaution but are now fully operational. Flights to and from the airport have not been affected.
The Met Police has issued advice to transport hubs across London to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.
The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command has launched an investigation; no arrests have yet been made.

THE BBC’S BREXIT coverage has been “distinctly lacking in curiosity and depth” about Ireland, former Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer has said.
Writing in Propsect Magazine today,Damazer has saidthat BBC interest in Ireland waned after 1998 and that the broadcaster “missed the Irish dimension” of the Brexit campaign.
“The BBC Ireland correspondent’s job was once a big deal—on air almost every day. Sometime after the Good Friday Agreement, interest waned,” writes Damazer.
“That may be why the BBC missed the Irish dimension of Brexit in the campaign and for a long time afterwards”.
Once Prime Minister Theresa May had her outline deal drawn up with the EU in late 2017…”it was greeted as a Westminster triumph with only minor genuflections towards the Irish conundrum that it left nakedly unresolved,” Damazer has said.
As a result, “Dublin-based journalism got barely a look in. Overall the coverage has been distinctly lacking in curiosity and depth about both the Irish economy and Irish politics”.
Advertisement
‘A decision easily reached’
Similarly, Damazer writes that coverage of Germany has “never been a big deal” for the BBC except for the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and that tensions between the UK and Germany have been “left up in the air”.
Damazer was BBC Radio 4 controller between 2004 and 2010. Five year later, he joined the BBC Trust – the broadcaster’s governing body – which had oversight of the BBC’s editorial performance during the Brexit referendum.
In today’s essay, ‘How Brexit broke the BBC’, he also critcises the Trust’s decision to “give broadly equal time” to the Remain and Leave campaigns.
“It was a decision easily reached, and yet it sowed the seeds of some of today’s difficulties”.
“Because many senior Remainers, in particular, were unprepared for the sheer volume of Brexit voices that the half-and-half policy would introduce to the airwaves”.
Britain is set to leave the European Union on 29 March.
EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested, however, that European leaders would be open to a short “technical” delay in Britain’s departure from the EU to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final withdrawal deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/carlos-ghosn-nissan-bail-4524075-Mar2019/,"
FORMER AUTO INDUSTRY titan Carlos Ghosn has been granted bail at one billion yen (€7,893,849) after more than three months in a detention cell.
Ghosn was arrested on 19 November over suspicions of financial misconduct.
Prosecutors appealed the decision of bail and could even file additional allegations against the 64-year-old to keep him from leaving detention.
Under his bail terms, Ghosn is banned from leaving Japan and must adhere to conditions aimed at preventing him from fleeing or destroying evidence.
The former head of Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and Renault faces three charges – two involving alleged under-reporting of his salary and a third over a complex scheme in which Ghosn allegedly sought to transfer his losses to Nissan’s books.
Further claims of financial misconduct have been levelled against him and prosecutors may yet slap him with additional allegations to keep him in detention.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors can hold a suspect for up to 22 days while they investigate an allegation, and then can apply for repeated one-month stretches of pre-trial detention for each charge eventually levelled.
That means prosecutors could effectively prevent Ghosn from leaving detention despite today’s bail decision if they level new allegations against him, starting the 22-day detention clock.
Ghosn has denied all the allegations against him.
Advertisement
‘The razor’
The decision for bail came a day after Ghosn’s new lead defence lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters he had filed a “convincing” application for bail that contained fresh elements.
Hironaka, who has a reputation for securing acquittals for high-profile clients in a country where almost all court cases end in conviction, offered greater surveillance of Ghosn and a limit on his electronic communications.
The court has previously said Ghosn’s continued detention was justified because he posed a flight risk and could seek to tamper with evidence. It had already rejected two official bail bids and other attempts to win freedom.
In a shake-up of his legal team last month, Ghosn replaced a former prosecutor known as “the breaker” with Hironaka, who has earned the nickname “the acquitter” for his court record and the “razor” for his mental sharpness.
Speaking to reporters yesterday, Hironaka vowed a “completely new legal strategy” to obtain his client’s release.
Nissan declined to comment on the bail decision, saying it was a matter for courts and prosecutors.
However, it said that an internal probe had “uncovered substantial evidence of blatantly unethical conduct” and that “further discoveries related to Ghosn’s misconduct continue to emerge”.
“The company’s focus is firmly on addressing weaknesses in governance that failed to prevent this misconduct,” it added in a statement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/couples-filmed-having-sex-south-korea-4553229-Mar2019/,"
MORE THAN 800 South Korean couples were livestreamed having sex in love motels, Seoul police said today.
The scandal is one of the largest-scale and most intrusive examples yet of the country’s spycam epidemic.
South Korea has been battling the increasingly widespread proliferation of so-called “molka”, or spycam videos, which largely involve men secretly filming women in schools and toilets, among other places.
The latest case is unusual for involving couples and the livestreaming element.
According to police, four men installed tiny cameras — all of them with a lens just 1mm wide — in 42 rooms in 30 motels, hidden inside hairdryer holders, wall sockets and digital TV boxes.
They then livestreamed the footage 24 hours a day to a subscription website with some 4,000 members, hosted on a server overseas.
Some viewers also paid a 50,000 won (about €40) monthly supplement for access to “exclusive” content — edited highlights available on repeat.

Men and women
More than 800 couples were shown on the site over three months, mostly having sex, police said. “About 50% of the 1,600 victims are male,” an official from the National Police Agency told AFP.
The gang earned seven million won (about €5,400) from the scheme, he said, adding that two suspects had been arrested and two more are being investigated.
More than 5,400 people were arrested for spycam-related crimes in South Korea in 2017, but fewer than 2% were jailed.
Last year, thousands of women protested a number of times in Seoul against spycam videos as part of the country’s #MeToo movement.
In South Korea, motels are a relatively affordable option for many travellers from home and overseas, and a popular destination for couples seeking privacy away from parents or other family members.
But they have also long been associated with illicit sex business and crime.

https://www.the42.ie/alan-mccormack-interview-march-2019-4538518-Mar2019/,"BEFORE A TRAINING session during his time as captain of Paolo Di Canio’s Swindon Town, Alan McCormack visited a doctor in search of a cure for a throat infection.
“I was really struggling,” he recalls. “My throat was on fire. I had sent a message to the physio at the club to let him know that I wasn’t well. He replied and said: ‘Paolo’s here and he thinks you’re skipping training because you thought he wasn’t in. You need to come to the training ground straight away.’

“Towards the end of his time at Swindon, there were a few days when Paolo wasn’t at training. Anyway, after waiting to be seen for about an hour, the doctor sent me off to bed but I had to get straight down to the training ground.
“I was about 10 minutes late in the end. As soon as I arrived, Paolo summoned me out to the pitch, stopped the session and said: ‘He thinks he can skip training when Paolo’s not here? Well, he’s no longer the captain.’
“To be fair to Paolo, there was a lot of stuff happening off the pitch with him at that stage. I think he was arguing with the club about funds to get players in. He’s a very passionate man and there was probably a bit of anger from that. I bore the brunt of it that day.”
Forty-eight hours later, Di Canio resigned from his position. Caretaker managers Tommy Miller and Darren Ward returned the armband to McCormack, who has never harboured animosity towards the enigmatic Italian over the incident. Were it not for his intervention, the career of a player who’s thriving at 35 may have been over by the age of 27.

At the end of the 2016-17 campaign, Alan McCormack parted company with Brentford. After four enjoyable years in West London, there was no longer a place for the Dubliner at the Championship club. For a 33-year-old whose season had been punctuated by injury setbacks, it may have seemed like the beginning of the end.
Nevertheless, the veteran midfielder is now verging on a return to the division he was pushed out of less than two years ago. McCormack has made a substantial contribution to a record-breaking undefeated run of 24 games, which has put Luton Town on top of League One.
Involvement in consecutive promotions with a club that was in League Two last season would undoubtedly be a highlight for McCormack, who has already had plenty to savour during a career in English football that began 15 years ago this month.

The combative midfielder has been promoted with three different clubs. He has played at Wembley, the Millennium Stadium, Hampden Park, Stamford Bridge and White Hart Lane. He won Player of the Year awards at both Swindon Town and Brentford. However, he’s reluctant to devote much time to reflection while the show is still on the road.
“I suppose I can’t really complain with how the last few years have gone for me,” says the former Republic of Ireland U19 international. “Most of the success has probably come in the last five or six years. But the thing about success is that when you have some, you want more.
“It’s certainly been a career that I’ll look back on with fond memories. But I don’t tend to do that while I’m still playing. There’s too much still to come to be focusing on what’s in the past. I’ll be a long time retired so there’ll be plenty of time then to sit down and look back on it.”
McCormack is now closing in on his 500th professional game, the first of which came as a substitute for Preston North End in a 1-1 draw with Burnley in March 2004. He was handed a full debut four days later against a Sunderland side managed by Mick McCarthy, a game that ended 3-3. It was a relatively rapid ascent for a novice who had been playing for Stella Maris in Dublin just 15 months earlier.
There were short loan spells at Leyton Orient and Southend United, before McCormack spent the 2005-06 season at Scottish Premiership side Motherwell. He provided an assist for a Jim Hamilton goal as he debuted in a 4-4 draw with Celtic.
The teams also met that season in the semi-finals of Scottish League Cup, when McCormack briefly shared the pitch with his childhood hero. Roy Keane was introduced as an 89th minute substitute for Celtic, who were 2-1 winners at Hampden Park thanks to Shaun Maloney’s late free-kick.
McCormack was back for a second spell at Southend in November 2006. Perhaps his only regret about returning to Roots Hall was that he didn’t accelerate the process. A few days before the transfer was completed, Southend had booked their place in the quarter-finals of the League Cup by recording a 1-0 win over a Manchester United side that included Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney.

“I think I joined on the Saturday, and on the previous Tuesday they beat United,” he explains. “The move had been in the works so I maybe could have pushed for it a bit earlier. Obviously it would have been incredible to be involved in that. By the time I arrived, everyone at the club was absolutely bouncing. The stories were still being told for a few months after that.”
A few weeks after returning to Southend, he scored his first Championship goal in a 2-1 win against a Southampton side containing Gareth Bale. He also went on to play in the next round of the League Cup against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, where the Premier League club needed a 115th-minute Jermain Defoe goal to advance to a semi-final meeting with Arsenal, after the game was still goalless at the end of normal time.

Another significant outing came in the FA Cup third round in January 2009. As McCormack tussled with the likes of Frank Lampard and John Obi Mikel in midfield at Stamford Bridge, Southend earned a 1-1 draw after Peter Clarke’s stoppage-time header cancelled out Salomon Kalou’s opener for Chelsea. A suspension due to an accumulation of yellow cards ruled McCormack out for the replay, which Chelsea won 4-1 despite falling behind.
Having been unable to prevent Southend from dropping out of League One, McCormack moved to Charlton Athletic in 2010. However, a two-year contract was discarded at the end of his first season. A difficult campaign, during which a comment on Twitter irreparably damaged his relationship with the club’s supporters, almost pushed him out of football entirely.
“Things were going fairly well at Charlton at first,” he says. “But then we started struggling for a few results, I struggled with performances and my confidence dropped. It got to a point where I wasn’t enjoying football at all. You put on a brave face and go out and give it everything you have, but I had no confidence in myself at all.
“Charlton is a really big club, so I started to see a different side of social media then. It starts with one comment on Twitter, and that then multiplies into five, 10, 20 and so on.
“I went out one evening for an anniversary dinner with Lauren [his wife] after we lost that day to Swindon. I had tweeted a reply to one of the boys about needing a glass of red wine after it. I got abuse over that like you would not believe. There were people putting my address up, saying they knew where I lived and they were going to come up.

“It was probably naive of me to tweet that because it might have seemed like I didn’t care about the club or the results, that I was going out and celebrating a defeat. Even though that’s not at all what I was doing, I could see how it came across that way to very passionate fans. I ended up leaving Twitter over it. I didn’t want to be caught up in stuff like that instead of focusing on playing.”
He adds: “Towards the end of the season, Charlton said I was free to leave and find another club in the summer. I remember telling Lauren that I might just pack it in altogether. I just thought I couldn’t be dealing with football anymore. I wouldn’t say I started to hate the game, but I was completely lost and not enjoying it at all. I wasn’t myself any longer.
“I was quite serious about calling it a day in the sense that I wasn’t actively looking for a new club. Chris Powell [Charlton manager] rang me and offered me a few clubs, but they just weren’t for me. I was already speaking to Lauren and a few friends about what type of jobs I could get into. At that stage it really wouldn’t have bothered me if I hadn’t gotten a new club.”
On the eve of the 2011-12 season, a phone call from McCormack’s agent led to a complete change in his outlook. There was a new man in charge at Swindon Town and he wanted McCormack to assist in their bid to return to League One.
“My agent rang and said Paolo Di Canio wants you at Swindon. It sounded interesting enough to explore at least,” says McCormack. “Then as soon as I met Paolo I wanted to be involved. He knew more about me than I knew about myself. He put a bit of confidence back in me, which was exactly what I needed. It all went from there.”
Di Canio had an instant impact at a club that had just been relegated to League Two. In the third round of the FA Cup, they eliminated Premier League side Wigan Athletic, who went on to win the competition the following season.
Swindon also made it to Wembley for the Football League Trophy final, but came up short against a Chesterfield side from the level above. It was McCormack’s second defeat in the competition’s decider. In 2005 he was a member of a Southend team that was beaten by Wrexham at the Millennium Stadium.

Most significantly for Swindon during Di Canio’s first season at the helm, they succeeded in their attempt to achieve an immediate return to League One. For McCormack, a league winners’ medal was accompanied by the Player of the Year award.
Di Canio didn’t see out the following season, which ended with Swindon reaching the League One play-offs. McCormack — who by then had been appointed skipper — continues to speak highly of the former AC Milan and Celtic striker, in spite of the training-ground spat which saw him stripped of the captaincy for a brief period.
“Playing under Paolo was amazing,” he says. “But don’t get me wrong — he was very, very tough. You’d be lucky if he gave you a Sunday off. The whole English mentality — as he liked to call it — of afternoons off to go out and play golf, or go down the bookies, as players must have done in his day, he used to hate that.
“He made sure that we were on the grass for a minimum of two hours every day from Monday to Friday. It was tough, but we were very fit because of it. We were educated in the game and our roles were drilled into us.
“It was great to learn the game his way, but you could never cross him. If you did, you were gone. He stripped me of the captaincy but I don’t hold any grudges. If I bumped into him on the street now, I’d love to go up and speak to him and give him a hug. He was tremendous. That incident didn’t change the fact that I loved playing for him.”
* * *
By a sizeable margin, Alan McCormack is the elder statesman in the current Luton Town squad. He’s the only player in the dressing room who can recall — albeit vaguely — when the Hatters were a top-flight club, playing their home games on an infamous ‘plastic’ pitch.
“I think the next oldest fella is three years behind me,” McCormack says, ruefully. “I’m way out in front as the oldest. But the lads here make me feel younger anyway. If I’m being honest, I don’t feel 35 at all.”

Promotion to the Championship would be a significant feat for a club that was still playing non-league football in 2014.

Leading goalscorer James Collins has hogged the Irish interest in the Luton story this season, having been included in Mick McCarthy’s squad for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Georgia.
McCormack’s role may have flown under the radar by comparison, but his leadership and tenacity in the middle of the park have made him a vital cog in a wheel that’s rolling smoothly in the direction of a division Luton have been absent from for 12 years. Yesterday, he was announced as the club’s Player of the Month for February.
“My time here has been incredible,” he says. “The club has a vision of where it wants to go. To be part of something like that is really enjoyable. You want to play as much of a part in it as you can. Since I came here from Brentford, I’ve loved every second of it.”
After leaving Swindon Town in 2013, McCormack helped Brentford to promotion to the Championship in his first season, as well as adding another Player of the Year award to the mantlepiece. Having operated at right-back, he was also selected in the League One Team of the Season, which included current England international Harry Maguire, who was then at Sheffield United.
McCormack had to drop down a couple of levels to continue his career when the Bees released him after a four-year spell at Griffin Park. Nevertheless, as things stand, he could be back at Brentford next season as part of the opposition.
He says: “I still felt good about myself when I left Brentford. I was waiting to have an operation on my groin which I kept putting off. I knew once I got that sorted that I could get fit and stay fit. I still wanted to be pushed. I had no intention of packing it in.

“There was no problem with going down to League Two. With the squad at Luton, I was confident that we could get promoted. But did I think I’d play in the Championship again? Probably not. I probably thought I’d be a coach the next time I saw the Championship.
“Knowing that I’ve already been there and I have the chance to get back there, that has kind of driven me on. I’ve actually never thought about it much, but being honest now, I didn’t think I’d be back there two years later and maybe facing the club that I left. In saying that, there’s still a bit to go before that can happen.”
With nine games remaining, a five-point buffer separates Luton from second-placed Barnsley, while Sunderland are four points further back. They’ll expect to strengthen their grip on top spot today when relegation-threatened Gillingham visit Kennilworth Road, where McCormack’s run of 14 consecutive starts could be halted by a hamstring injury he sustained in Tuesday night’s win at Bradford City.
Luton have defied the departure of manager Nathan Jones to keep their promotion bid on track. Jones left in January to take the Stoke City job, but caretaker boss Mick Harford has maintained the continuity established by his predecessor.
Harford will remain in place until a permanent successor is appointed in the summer. The new man in charge will have his own ideas on how to bring the club forward. In the unlikely event that McCormack doesn’t feature in them, it won’t change his own plans. Whether he’s at Luton next season or not, retirement isn’t being considered. For starters, four-year-old son Ronnie won’t allow it.
“My little boy is at a stage now where he’s absolutely obsessed with football. He loves coming to games,” says McCormack, who also has a six-year-old daughter, Olivia. “It gives me such a buzz, knowing my little boy is in the crowd watching. He goes into school and he’s really proud telling his friends that his daddy plays football.
“People keep asking me how long I have left and if this will be my last year, but there’s not a chance of that. I’m enjoying it too much. I want to play for as long as I can and not just accept age as a reason to finish. As long as my body is good, I have no intention of quitting the game. I may have lost a yard of pace, but what you lose in your feet you gain in your head.”

Tales of unfulfilled potential, of what might have been, are regrettably common among young footballers who have crossed the Irish Sea in the hope of being a part of the tiny minority to crack the professional game in England.
When Alan McCormack eventually decides to call it a day, he’ll do so with peace of mind from the knowledge that he left nothing behind. Senior international caps and a chance to play in the Premier League were ultimately out of reach, but in such a callously competitive industry, his story is one of indisputable success. And it’s not over yet.
“Even now, at the end of every conversation, my dad still always says, ‘no matter what happens, make sure you’re giving 100%’, and that has stuck with me from the moment I first came to England,” says McCormack, who was a week into an electrician’s apprenticeship in Dublin when Preston offered him a contract at the age of 18.
“I’ve grafted every step of the way. I had a bit of luck at the start to get into the Preston team so early because of injuries. If I hadn’t had that luck, I’d probably be working as an electrician or in the guards back home in Ireland now.
“You have to take your chance, but you need that slice of luck as well. I probably made the most of mine when it came.”

Kelvin took a voluntary leave of absence from his role in December 2018 after the allegations were made against him.
Since that date, an internal independent committee has been investigating the claims.
Kelvin has denied all allegations of misconduct.
He has, however, today agreed to resign with immediate effect from his position as CEO and director of Ted Baker.

The investigation will continue, with the primary focus of the remainder of it being on the company’s policies, procedures and handling of complaints.
It is expected that Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, the law firm commissioned to conduct the investigation, will conclude its inquiry at the end of Q1 or early Q2 2019.
Acting CEO Lindsay Page has agreed to continue in the role.
The board has asked David Bernstein to act as executive chairman to provide additional support to Page. Bernstein has indicated that he will continue in the position until no later than 30 November 2020.
“Ray Kelvin founded the business 32 years ago and has, together with the fantastic team around him, been the driving force behind it becoming the global brand it is today. As founder and CEO, we are grateful for his tireless energy and vision,” Bernstein said in a statement.
“As a board of directors, we are committed to ensuring that all employees feel respected and valued,” Bernstein said.
“We are determined to learn lessons from what has happened and from what our employees have told us and to ensure that, while the many positive and unique aspects of Ted’s culture are maintained, appropriate changes are made.”

https://www.the42.ie/ballyhale-all-ireland-hurling-club-st-thomas-4547602-Mar2019/,"Fintan O’Toole reports from Croke Park
THE KINGS OF club hurling reigned again this afternoon, Ballyhale Shamrocks sweeping to their latest All-Ireland title with a powerful display that blew them past the challenge of Galway’s St Thomas.
With their most celebrated name Henry Shefflin now directing operations on the sideline, the Kilkenny champions once more reached the peak with 17 points to spare at the final whistle.
Man-of-the-match Colin Fennelly bagged 2-4 from play with TJ Reid’s haul of 0-9 and Adrian Mullen’s contribution of 0-5 also helping Ballyhale blitz the 2013 winners.
The first half was characterised most by the interventions of Fennelly. By the interval he had two goals to his name, tipping a shot to the net in the 5th minute after his initial attempt was thwarted by goalkeeper Gerald Murray and then a lovely flick to meet a long Adrian Mullen delivery in the 22nd minute saw the sliotar nestle in the far corner in front of Hill 16.
He could have raised a third green flag, his 20th minute one-handed swipe dropped just over the crossbar. But Fennelly was the perfect focal point for the Ballyhale attack and helped shape a 2-10 to 1-8 interval advantage.
St Thomas were left reeling by a whirlwind Ballyhale start that left them adrift 1-4 to 0-1 by the 5th minute but steadied themselves to recover in the first quarter with Conor Cooney firing home a penalty.
Immediately after the break, Darragh Burke struck a sublime score to leave St Thomas trailing by four but that was as close as they got. Ballyhale went through the gears and accelerated clear on the scoreboard. Between the 34th and 45th minute, they reeled off six points without reply and had sailed clear by ten at the three-quarter mark to essentially kill off the game as a contest.
St Thomas lost Fintan Burke through injury but they kept battling and did grab a second goal late on courtesy of David Burke. However Ballyhale were on fire in attack in the closing stages with 0-12 to their credit in the last quarter to bring their second-half tally to 0-18 as they ran out emphatic victors.

EVERY CHILD SHOULD be taught the words of the Irish national anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann, in primary school, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
After taking part in the St Patrick’s Day parade in Chicago, the Taoiseach toldTheJournal.iethat he wouldn’t follow how the American tradition, where school children recite the pledge of allegiance at the start and end of each day.

“I think it would be a good idea for the national anthem to be taught in schools it was actually taught to me when I was in primary school, whether it was mandatory or not I don’t know, that’s where I learnt the anthem.
“So, I think that would be good. I don’t think I would go down the American route, you know the pledge of allegiance at the start of the day, I’m not sure that would really fit in with the Irish culture. But the words of the national anthem – I think that is something every kid should learn in primary school,” he said.

Senator Rónán Mullen raised the issue of the national anthem in the Seanad last week, and said that the teaching of Amhrán na bhFiann should form part of the curriculum at primary school level.

Kevin O’Brien reports from Croke Park
WHEN BALLYHALE SHAMROCKS took to the field in Croke Park yesterday, they were playing for more than just a trophy.
Sure, a record seventh All-Ireland title was at stake, but as the club tragically learned earlier this season, some things in life just supersede sport.
Eoin Doyle’s old jersey was proudly hanging up in the Ballyhale dressing rooms under the Cusack Stand. The memory of their former team-mate was never from the players’ minds.
Panellist Doyle sadly lost his life last April in a motorbike accident. His former jersey has been a constant presence in the Ballyhale dressing rooms on matchdays since.
County and provincial titles have followed, before their convincing All-Ireland success over St Thomas delivered the big one and confirmed their status as hurling’s greatest club.
Captain Michael Fennelly dedicated the victory to Doyle in his acceptance speech.
“Back in February 2018, we started this journey with this team,” he said.
“We’re finishing now on St Patrick’s Day but we’ve one less player and that’s Eoin Doyle. We brought Eoin’s memory with us the whole year along, with a jersey in the dressing room, and this cup is in dedication to him and what we’ve done.”

“There’s been some amazing days, there’s been some very sad days – burying Eoin Doyle, the passing of Eoin Doyle, one of our panel members. It’s like life, sport is full of ups and downs.”
He added that Doyle’s jersey in the dressing room was “definitely” a driving force for their run to the Tommy Moore Cup.

“I think so because he was a panel member. We lost two other young chaps; Sean Malone and Martin Duggan as well (in 2011), fellas that would be very friendly with Conor Walsh and Richie Reid.
“That’s real life. Today is about sport, about enjoyment, about expressing ourselves. That’s what I said to the lads, ‘Whatever you do, enjoy it’.
“If you’re enjoying your hurling I think you hurl with more freedom. I think you saw that with Colin (Fennelly)’s movement, his striking. That’s what you want, that’s what we asked them for, ‘Go out and be yourselves’.
“We just asked them to perform as best they can and I think they did that.
“I think Eoin Doyle was watching down over us.”

Whatever the future holds for Shefflin the manager, leading his club to All-Ireland glory in his debut campaign on the sideline will be hard to beat. Managing Kilkenny will surely follow at some point down the line whenever Brian Cody decides he’s had enough.
“It feels strange to be honest,” the 11-time All-Star admitted. “Little did I think when I took on this job that I was going to end up here. It’s just been an amazing journey.
“I must say that from the get-go the lads have applied themselves very well. I’m delighted, it was always a hope of ours that they’d come up here and compete in Croke Park and I’m delighted they did, especially in the second-half, I think they showcased all their skills.
“I must say the players have performed very, very well too, they’ve worked very hard, they’ve got the basics of the game very right and then their skill will take over and their point shooting today was excellent.”
Man-of-the-match Colin Fennelly shot the lights out with 2-4, while TJ Reid’s nine points and Adrian Mullen’s haul of 0-5 guided the Kilkenny champions to victory.
Fennelly’s second green flag was a thing of beauty: a deft flick to the far corner from a tight angle after Mullen’s delivery inside.
“It was a brilliant goal,” said Shefflin. “That’s his confidence, just never took his eye off the ball. I think once you get the ball into him he’s very, very dangerous. That gave us a great grounding, great confidence.
“We spoke at half-time here today, we were five points up, and it was just something I thought of in the lead up to the match.

“18 months ago when I was in that dressing-room, we were six points ahead in the county semi-final and we ended up losing the second-half by 16 points. Anyone walking out of Nowlan Park that day would have said, ‘Jesus, I don’t know about these lads’.
TJ Reid made his senior debut with Ballyhale as a 17-year-old goalkeeper, but he’s since become one of the most potent finishers the game has seen.
At the age of 31, Reid has now won seven Kilkenny championships, five Leinsters and four All-Irelands with his club.
“I’m delighted, that’s four All-Ireland clubs I have with the Ballyhale Shamrocks team,” the centre-forward said afterwards.
He hailed Shefflin’s impact as a manager in his first season over the team.
“We had the previous management for four years I think. It was just the whole new freshness. He’s a modern player, he’s only after retiring in the last year. He’s modern in terms of how the game is changing.
“So we needed to change our style of play. You saw today how we went long and at times held possession around the middle of the field. And we used our coolness on the ball, picking our five and 10-yard passes to players that were free.
“Overall his hurling brain and his leadership and his motivation is great. If players aren’t putting in the effort, he’s on their backs straight away.”
The three-time All-Star also gave a little insight into his mindset while revealing that the black and amber jersey is never far from his mind.
“Look, we’re here in Croke Park in March now, hopefully we’ll see Croke Park again later on in the year.
“But that’s another story. I’m delighted, over the moon.”

FUNDRAISING FOR DUBLIN’S City Library at Parnell Square hasn’t progressed since July last year.
Real estate firm Kennedy Wilson is leading the philanthropic drive to fund the new cultural quarter on the city’s northside, first announced by Dublin City Council back in 2013.
Independent councillor Vincent Jackson, who heads up the council’s Arts Committee, has said that concern has been growing around the council’s ambitious plan and the lack of fundraising progress.
“It’s a huge concern,” says Jackson. “We’re obviously very anxious to go with this project. That’s a key component of the project, the financial viability.”
The estimated cost of the project rose from €60 million to €100 million since it was launched in September 2016. Yet construction inflation could push up those costs even more, Jackson has said.
Meanwhile, Independent councillor Mannix Flynn has said that as the project slowly progresses, a large portion of real estate sits idle.
“You have an enormously important building up there. You’ve got people on our streets, a demand for housing and accommodation.

A total of eight Georgian Houses will be refurbished as part of the City Library plan; Georgian houses numbers 20 and 21 will be redeveloped, along with houses 23 to 28, which were where the former Irish school Coláiste Mhuire was situated.
A music centre, design space, business library, conference space, education centre, café and exhibition area all form part of the library complex.
In total, the space will be 11,000 sqm and, if approved and funded, should be complete by 2023.
Dublin City CouncilDublin City Council
Kennedy Wilson initially donated €2.5 million and agreed to help raise the rest. A planning application is currently with An Bord Pleanála with a decision expected in May.
The council has said that its agreement with Kennedy Wilson means that the firm has to raise a minimum of 51% of the project costs. To raise the remainder, the council plans take a loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Kennedy Wilson will continue to fundraise beyond the €51 million in an effort to finance loan charges, the council said. “No works will commence until a minimum of 51% of the required funding has been raised in philanthropy,” a council spokesperson has said.
So far, €5 million has been committed to the project, they said. “Based on previous experience of similar projects internationally we are confident that the required minimum 55% in philanthropic funding will be achieved”.
“I think this project has huge potential for urban regeneration,” says Jackson. “The whole area will be transformed.”
However, he has said that the project is now likely to cost over €100 million given inflation and construction costs. “Without fear or hesitation,” says Jackson. “If this doesn’t start and if the fundraising process doesn’t start, I’d be worried about the overall cost in the long-term.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/cocaine-drugs-wastewater-study-4542007-Mar2019/,"A STUDY THAT examinesdrug residue in the wastewaterof 70 European cities has found that the highest amounts of cocaine residue were in Bristol, Amsterdam and Zurich.
Cocaine use remains highest in western and southern European cities, in particular in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Ireland did not partake in the study.
The study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants over a one-week period.
Wastewater from approximately 46 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA (or ecstasy) and methamphetamine.
The below graph shows the top 10 cities for high cocaine traces found, measured per person on a daily basis.

In the large majority of countries with multiple study locations, cocaine and MDMA loads were higher in large cities compared to smaller locations. No such differences could be detected for amphetamine and methamphetamine.
“MDMA loads were consistently found in the wastewater of cities in Belgium and the Netherlands,” the study states.
It also notes that “wastewater MDMA loads” were higher in 2018 than in 2011 in some cities, “with sharp increases” in some cities, including Antwerp and Amsterdam.
One part of the study notes:
“Similarly, studies based on self-reported drug use and those using wastewater data both point towards the same weekly variations in use, with stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine being primarily used at weekend music events and in celebratory contexts.”
Wastewater-based studies is a new scientific development that has a potential for close to real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use. Limitations to this methodology include limited “information on prevalence and frequency of use, main classes of users and purity of the drugs”.
Fourteen countries took part in the study: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia andSlovenia.

https://www.thejournal.ie/warner-bros-chief-kevin-tsujihara-steps-down-4549165-Mar2019/,"WARNER BROS CHIEF Kevin Tsujihara has stepped down from the studio following claims that he promised roles to an actress with whom he was having an affair.
WarnerMedia chief executive John Stankey announced Tsujihara’s exit as chairman and chief executive of Warner Bros, saying his departure was in the studio’s “best interest”.
“Kevin has contributed greatly to the studio’s success over the past 25 years and for that we thank him,” Stankey said.
“Kevin acknowledges that his mistakes are inconsistent with the company’s leadership expectations and could impact the company’s ability to execute going forward.”
Earlier this month, WarnerMedia, the studio’s parent company, launched an investigation after a Hollywood Reporter story, published on 6 March, detailed text messages between Tsujihara (54) and British actress Charlotte Kirk going back to 2013.
The messages suggested a quid pro quo sexual relationship between the aspiring actress and Tsujihara in which he made promises that he’d introduce her to influential executives and she’d be considered for roles in movies and television.
In a memo to Warner Bros staff today, Tsujihara said he was departing “after lengthy introspection, and discussions with John Stankey over the past week”.
He said:
Tsujihara’s lawyer earlier stated that Tsujihara “had no direct role in the hiring of this actress”. He declined further comment today.
Tsujihara, who has headed the Burbank, California, studio since 2013, earlier pledged to fully cooperate with the studio’s investigation.

He apologised to Warner Bros staff for “mistakes in my personal life that have caused pain and embarrassment to the people I love the most”.
Internal investigation
Actress Charlotte Kirk appeared in Warner Bros’ How to Be Single in 2016 and Ocean’s 8 in 2018.
She has denied any inappropriate behaviour on the part of Tsujihara or two other executives, Brett Ratner and James Packer, who she communicated with.
“Mr Tsujihara never promised me anything,” Kirk said in an earlier statement.
WarnerMedia said today that its internal investigation into the situation will continue. The investigation is being carried out by a third-party law firm.
Tsujihara’s exit comes after other high-profile executive departures in the post-Harvey Weinstein #MeToo era.
CBS Chairman Leslie Moonves was pushed out after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment.
Walt Disney Animation chief John Lasseter was also ousted after he acknowledged missteps in his behaviour with employees.
The studio will now begin a search for a new chief as it also prepares to launch a streaming service designed to compete with Netflix.

https://www.thejournal.ie/merchants-quay-dinner-service-appeal-4528099-Mar2019/,"A NATIONAL HOMELESS and addiction charity has launched an urgent appeal to raise funds for its Sunday dinner service.
Merchants Quay Ireland (MQI) provides homeless outreach and drug rehabilitation services at every level of addiction.
Its day centre on Merchants Quay in Dublin’s south inner city provides food, medical and counselling support for at-risk and homeless people.
Every Sunday, up to 300 people come to MQI for dinner. This is the only place in Dublin for people who are homeless to get a free hot meal on a Sunday.
The service, which costs over €200,000 a year to run, also provides an opportunity for MQI staff to engage with individuals and support them with crisis help and referrals.

People who attend the Sunday service can avail of a hot shower, dry clothes, and social connection and companionship.
However, the charity has now claimed that the service receives insufficient State funding and that the demand for the service keeps growing.
It has also raised concerns that staff are now seeing people who have accommodation but cannot afford to cook in their own homes.
“Merchants Quay Ireland has been providing hot meals to Dublin’s homeless for decades. Meeting these basic needs is at the core of what we do. But the demand for our Sunday services is now unprecedented,” MQI CEO Paula Byrne said, launching the appeal.

“I come here on Sundays for a hot meal and to have a shower with hot water. I can fill my flask with hot water as well to take home with me,” she said.
Mark, another Sunday service client, added: “The days are so long when you’re homeless, you need to get out of the cold. It’s a real Sunday atmosphere here, a proper Sunday dinner. This place is a lifeline for a lot of us.”
MQI also runs a Night Café, which provides yoga mats for up to 65 people to sleep on each night who have not been able to source a place to stay. In 2017, MQI’s Night Café provided emergency shelter for 1,913 individuals.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-fines-google-over-advertising-practices-4552226-Mar2019/,"
THE EU’S POWERFUL anti-trust regulator has fined Google €1.49 billion for advertising violations.
In its third major decision against the search engine giant, Brussels sanctioned Google’s once popular AdSense advertising service, saying it illegally restricted client websites from displaying ads from ad service rivals.
Google and the EU have been at loggerheads about the monopoly of Google over internet searches in Europe since 2009 and the AdSense case was the only complaint still open.
The original complainant in the decade-long case was Microsoft, but the US software giant later pulled out of the case in a truce with its US arch-rival.
“Today the commission has fined Google €1.49 billion for illegal misuse of its dominant position in the market for the brokering of online search adverts,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
“The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate – and consumers the benefits of competition.”
The third@Googlecase:@Googleis fined €1,49bn for illegal practices in search advertising brokering to cement its dominant market position. They shouldn’t do that - it denied consumers choice, innovative products and fair prices.— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager)March 20, 2019Margrethe Vestager/ Twitter
The third@Googlecase:@Googleis fined €1,49bn for illegal practices in search advertising brokering to cement its dominant market position. They shouldn’t do that - it denied consumers choice, innovative products and fair prices.
The fine brings Google’s total tab with the EU to €8.2 billion in less than two years, which amounts to far less than the maximum fine of 10% of Google’s annual turnover, Vestager said.
In July 2018, the US giant was ordered to pay a record €4.34 billion for abusing the dominant position of Android, its smartphone operating system, to help assure the supremacy of its search engine.
A year earlier the EU slapped Google with a fine of €2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position by favouring its ‘Google Shopping’ price comparison service in search results.

Google has appealed both decisions to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Responding to this latest ruling, Google public affairs chief Kent Walker said the company had “already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission’s concerns”.
“Over the next few months, we’ll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe,” he said.
Changes
Hoping to end the decade-long dispute, Google yesterday unveiled a series of tweaks to its European search engine results that would allow certain rivals a more prominent position on results pages.
The change would apply to shopping aggregators, as well as tourist and travel advice sites such as TripAdvisor and Yelp.
The cases against Google, as well as a landmark €14.3 billion euro tax decision against Apple, thrust the former Danish minister into the spotlight as a champion of fighting US dominance.
Commissioner Vestager landed her latest verdict on the eve of her announcement to be part of a team of candidates that will lead the European elections campaign for the liberal ALDE movement.
She is the most prominent member of the team that will be appointed tomorrow by the heads of state and government linked to ALDE.
“I will be active in the coming months to see if I can enable more voters to go and vote,” Vestager told a press briefing.

This follows the residents, Donal Greene and Clare Smith along with Suzanne Galwey and Jeremy Butcher, lodging a joint appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the decision by Meath County Council to give the project the go-ahead last month.
The appeal now threatens the Tayto Park timeline to have the rollercoaster constructed and open to visitors by 2021 and puts a question mark over the project.
The planned ‘Coaster 2021’ will involve two separate coasters and a 189-page Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) lodged with the planning application outlined the stark need for ‘Coaster 2021’ for the future of Tayto Park.
The document states that if the Tayto Park operators do not add a major attraction at this time “the longer term viability of the park would be brought into question”.
The planning documents state that ‘Coaster 2021’ will help projected visitor numbers to Tayto Park - owned by businessmen, Ray Coyle - increase by 15% from 630,000 in 2019 to 725,000 in 2023.
However, in their objection against the plan, Ms Galwey and Mr Butcher -who live 200m from the Tayto Park entrance – have stated that they feel that “this development is entirely inappropriate from the perspectives of traffic, noise and overall disruption”.

They stated that they support the presence of Tayto Park in their community, but state that the development is of inappropriate scale for the rural area.
The two state that they currently experience noticeable noise pollution from the park from the existing Cú Chulainn rollercoaster from ratcheting sounds, riders’ screams and the roaring of the cars and the train whenever the park is open.
They state: “We have tolerated this erosion of our quiet enjoyment of our traditional rural domestic environment in a spirit of supporting local enterprise.”
In their own objection, Clare Smith and Donal Greene state that they live 700 metres from the entrance.
They state that they have lived in the area since 2013 and “our family has been based in this area since the 1970s”.
The objectors said that the new rollercoaster “will present a further escalation in the impact to our lives. We chose to live in this area with the expectation of a quiet environment to raise our small children”.
They also stated that new roller-coaster “would be directly visible from our back garden and the bedrooms at the rear of our home”.
Tayto Park declined to comment on the appeal and a decision is due on the appeal in early July.","8.40pm, 8 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/gabriel-scally-cervicalcheck-4555323-Mar2019/,"A REVIEW BY Dr Gabriel Scally into HSE practices following the CervicalCheck controversy has found that the “deeply flawed” open disclosure policy that existed prior to the scandal remains in place.
Dr Scally’s latest review into the Department of Health’s implementation of his recommendations following the CervicalCheck scandal was published this morning.
The doctor’sreview into CervicalCheck last yearidentified 221 women subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer who were not told that slides from an earlier screening could have been interpreted differently.
These issues came to light when women diagnosed with cervical cancer, such as Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhathúna came forward to tell their story.
Dr Scally subsequently proposed an overhaul of the screening programme.
In his latest report on the progress being made, he said the HSE resources given to implementing his recommendations is a “proportionate response to the scale of the issues and challenges”.
“I am satisfied that this work is being taken forward very seriously and that an effective project management process is in place,” he said.
While he was encouraged by progress to date in a number of areas where he had recommended changes, there remains some cause for concern.

On the issue of open disclosure – policies on providing patients and families with clear information when something goes wrong – he said in thereport: “This work [from the HSE] appears to be a reasonable response to the recommendations in the Scoping Inquiry report of September 2018. However, it is notable that the previous policy, which has been judged to be deeply flawed, remains in place.”
Furthermore, Dr Scally also raised concerns at the HSE’s approach implementation of his recommendations and said it could be trying to do them too quickly.
He said: “Whilst it is creditworthy that the HSE wishes to make swift progress and to conclude much of the work within a relatively short timescale, I would be concerned that the implementation plan appears to be over-ambitious, with too many activities concentrated within a single time period, and that future progress reviews may find that some of this activity has been subject to delay or has been unable to be concluded as speedily as desired.”
He said that it may be beneficial for the HSE to review its deadlines to ensure that all the recommendations are acted on fully.
Dr Scally also noted that of his recommendations in his original report last September, 71% of these are the responsibility of the HSE.
Others apply to patient advocates and, on this, he also raised concerns.
“One outstanding issue that has still to be resolved is the inequity that results from patient advocates engaging in crucial regular and demanding work on implementation but having to do so on a voluntary, unpaid basis,” he said.
A number of measures proposed by Scally are contained within the proposed Patient Safety Bill, which – when enacted – will set out only a very limited number of instances where the option remains not to disclose an error to a patient.
Minister for Health Simon Harris said today that the government fully accepted Dr Scally’s recommendations and work is underway at his department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry to act on them to “ensure full implementation so that women can have absolute confidence in our cervical screening service”.
The next review from Dr Scally is due in May.

https://www.thejournal.ie/man-luggage-search-loses-defamation-case-dublin-airport-4523105-Mar2019/,"A DUBLIN SECURITY officer, who turned out his pockets and had his carry-on luggage searched by police on a plane following “an alleged theft” at Dublin airport, has lost his €75,000 claim for defamation of character.
Judge Sinead Ni Chualachain told barrister Shane English, who defended the case on behalf of Dublin Airport Authority, that airport police as agents of the DAA had at all material times behaved responsibly in their investigation into the theft of a Giorgio Armani watch.
An Alan Collins claimed he had been sitting with his partner on a Ryanair plane about to take off for Alicante when he was one of a number of men, who apparently bore a resemblance to each other, spoken to by airport police officers Aisling Sutcliffe and Jessica O’Brien.
He claimed they said to him:
But English told Collins it was impossible for these words to have been spoken to him on the aircraft since there had not been a theft from Duty-Free on that day, 22 April 2017.
English, who appeared with David Martin of Gore & Grimes solicitors, told Alan Collins in the Circuit Civil Court that the DAA was not only categorically stating Collins was not the thief who snatched the watch from a woman’s check-in basket at security in the airport or from Duty Free, but were also categorically stating he had never been a thief.
Counsel told Collins, of Fortlawn Drive, Blanchardstown, Dublin, that he was wrong in claiming he had been accused of stealing the watch in Duty-Free as there had been no such theft.
Advertisement
The theft, as shown on CCTV, had taken place from a basket that had passed through a security check.
Counsel said Collins had been invited to step off the plane for the sake of privacy but had refused. He had voluntarily turned out his pockets and had allowed his carry-on bag to be searched at the service area on the plane.
Collins said that when police officers considered he fitted the description they had been given of the thief he had been asked to stand up and show his identification.
He had refused to step off the plane as there was no way he was going to miss his flight. He told them he had done no wrong and that they could search him and his bag on the aircraft.
Police Officers Sutcliffe and O’Brien told the court they had not accused him of stealing a watch from Duty-Free and had not spoken the words they were accused of saying.  They were investigating the theft of a watch stolen from the security line.
In a full defence to the claim, English said Collins had not been requested to be searched on the aircraft in front of other passengers.  He had refused several offers to disembark the aircraft and have the matter discussed in private.
English said the airport police officers concerned were entitled to fully investigate the report of the stolen watch and enjoyed the protection of qualified privilege in doing so.
Judge Ni Chualachain said the defence of qualified privilege had been made out by the defendant.
Dismissing Collins’ €75,000 claim, the judge said she did not accept the police officers had spoken the words complained of.  She made no order regarding costs.

Officials say that a number of children had been attending an “illegal school” inside the residential building when the structure collapsed on Wednesday.
Earlier reports suggested that dozens of children were among those trapped inside the building, which collapsed mid-morning in an area near Itafaji market on Lagos Island.
Parents, local residents and onlookers rushed to the area as police, firemen and medics staged a massive rescue operation.
“Thirty-seven people were rescued alive and eight were recovered dead,” Ibrahim Farinloye of the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.
A young man helping rescue efforts told AFP that “at least 10 children” were trapped inside but “thought to be alive”.

An AFP reporter at the scene said at least eight people were pulled from the wreckage, including a small boy with blood on his face.
School bags, toys and clothes could also be seen among the piles of rubble as a bulldozer tried to clear a path through some of the wreckage to help the rescue efforts.
Hundreds of local residents attempted to help, passing water and helmets through to rescuers working to sift through the rubble.
Many locals told AFP that the building, which was in an advanced state of disrepair, had been “earmarked” for demolition by authorities in Lagos state.
“It is a residential building that was actually accommodating an illegal school,” said the state governor, confirming that most buildings in the area had been marked for demolition.
“We get resistance from landlords but we must continue to save lives,” he said, pledging to step up measures against all structures that failed to meet the correct standards, saying they would be “quickly evacuated” and demolished.

The two stations will be closed today which means Darts and trains will be suspended between Connolly Station and Grand Canal Dock.

Its replacement has therefore been identified by Irish Rail as a “crucial safety project”.

Works to replace the roof, which will aim to retain the appearance and character of the original structure, will take place across 13 weekends over a period of 23 months.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ethiopian-airlines-crash-boeing-737-max-4548066-Mar2019/,"DATA FROM A black box recovered from an Ethiopian Airlines jet which crashed last week shows “clear similarities” to the crash of an Indonesian Lion Air plane last year.
The link between the two crashes will be “subject of further study during the investigation”Ethiopia’s transport minister Dagmawit Moges said today.
She also said that a preliminary report into last Sunday’s crash would be released in 30 days.
Last week’s Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 157 people – including Irishman Michael Ryan – after the plane plummeted into farmland southeast of Addis Ababa minutes into its flight to Nairobi.

The crash led to thegrounding of around 350 Boeing 737 Max jets worldwideearlier this week, when it was suspected there was a problem with the plane because of the similarities between last week’s accident and October’s Lion Air tragedy.
Even before the black box data had been recovered, countries and airlines seized on the similarities between the Ethiopian and Indonesian crashes to order the Boeing model out of service worldwide.
Both planes reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents as well as fluctuating airspeeds before crashing shortly after takeoff.
Questions have focused on an automated anti-stalling system introduced on the 737 Max 8, which is designed to automatically point the nose of the plane downward if it is in danger of stalling.
The black boxes from the Ethiopian Airlines flight have been handed to France’s BEA air safety agency, which is working with US and Ethiopian investigators to determine what brought it down.

https://www.thejournal.ie/robert-watt-national-childrens-hospital-4528550-Mar2019/,"LARGE-SCALE STATE projects will include a significant budget for risks so that cost estimates are realistic and don’t overrun, according to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Robert Watt.
In future, Watt said projects will only be signed off on when there is certainty about the final figure.
Earlier in the day, the secretary general caused quite a stir when he referred to the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as a “mob” while waiting outside the committee room. He later apologised, though he said he didn’t recall what he had said 45 minutes earlier.
He told the Oireachtas Finance Committee this afternoon that it is now “pretty clear” what went wrong with the build of the National Children’s Hospital (NCH) overspend.
The NCH is now expected to cost €1.7 billion. The controversy over the cost resulted in a motion of no confidence in Health Minister Simon Harris, which was defeated.
Delivery of the hospital with a two-phase plan was thought to be the best way forward at the time, he said, where the final design of the hospital was not yet finalised. He told the finance committee today that it was believed early on in the project, during phase one, that there “was certainty about the bill of quantities”.
“That didn’t turn out to be the case,” he said.
He said the amount has clearly risen significantly.
“We thought we knew the final cost, but that wasn’t true,” Watt added.

Comparisons
However, the secretary general said comparisons being drawn that architect Dermot Bannon’s designs “wouldn’t be done this way” has nothing to do with the debate on the children’s hospital.
He stated that the sheer scale of the NCH project means the two aren’t comparable.
Some committee members today made comparisons about the straight-forward project management and budgeting of building houses compared to that of the dysfunctional delivery of the NCH.
In the future, Watt said the State will no longer “commit to projects until the design and price are clear” adding that projects should not be announced based on “guesstimates” of what they will cost.
“People are putting out numbers about the cost of a project without having set out the detailed design, or tested the market.
“It is a guesstimate, it is not certain,” he said, adding that reforms of how public contracts are awarded is needed,” he said.
In his opening statement to PAC, Watt said the government will no longer pre-commit to major bespoke projects until there is 100% clarity on tendered costs.
“The government will approve major projects to be evaluated and designed, but there will be no final commitment until after the tendering process is complete.
“It is not possible to know the price of a capital project with a high level of certainty until there is a full design spec, planning if necessary has been achieved, and the project has been competitively tendered.
Delays in projects
“Government will not commit to projects until the design and price are clear. This could delay projects, but will ensure greater cost certainty.”
“Don’t go to tender unless you have a detailed design – that is tender 101,” Fianna Fáil’s Marc McSharry told Watt earlier today.

Both committees questioned whether it was credible that Watt was only informed about the massive overspend in November.  Harris has said he was first flagged about the potential overspend in August, though he said he did not know by how much.
There were tetchy responses from Watt to Labour’s Alan Kelly’s questioning, when he was quizzed over details on when exactly he knew of the costs.
“I really find this absolutely pointless,” he said, for which Kelly said he had a right to ask such questions.
Watt said he was informed of the issue in a report on 19 November, however, he later said that he was told in person about issues around the overruns by the Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe on 9 November.
Questions about the estimates prior to the Budget were also raised with Watt today. Kelly and Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath questioned how the Dáil was not informed about the escalating costs during the revised estimates debate on 19 December.
Watt said the estimates “were accurate” adding that it is always the case that estimates are published when the government might know of additional costs that might arise.
The issue of PwC doing the review of what went wrong with the project, which is costing €450,000, was also raised.
The Controller and Auditor General was asked if the government asked him to conduct such a review, would he be able to carry one out.
The C&AG said he would be able to do so, but would not speculate as to whether he could do it for less than PwC.

https://www.thejournal.ie/far-right-extremist-attacks-4544215-Mar2019/,"THE IDEA THAT white people are being intentionally replaced by people of colour is a core talking point of the extreme right-wing terrorists in online forums, and provides the basis for attacks on Jews, Muslims and other groups, including mass shooting incidents.
That’s according to Professor Maura Conway of the School of Law and Government in DCU, who is involved in the research project VOX-Pol, which looks at violent online political extremism.
In the wake of the New Zealand attack in which 49 people were killed at mosques during Friday prayers, we spoke to academics who have studied areas like alt-right online communities, violent political extremism and the influence the media has when covering these incidents.
A manifesto was shared to the social media accounts ofthe man suspected of carrying outthe New Zealand attacks, which declares a hatred for Muslim immigrants in Europe and expresses admiration for extremist movements in the US.
So what result in people carrying out such violent attacks, and how can they be stopped from happening in the future?
Professor Maura Conway toldTheJournal.iethat “a core talking point of the online extreme right”, is the racist “white-genocide theory”:
“[It's] the idea that white people are being intentionally replaced, removed, or even eliminated by people of colour through ‘mass’ immigration and a variety of other methods. Often, in an anti-Semitic twist, responsibility for this is attributed to Jews,” she says.
Professor Conway says that this narrative is “very widely shared” across social media platforms, online forums, and gaming apps, so it’s “unsurprising” that most of the extreme right-wing terrorist attacks have had “significant online components”.
In the case of far-right mass killings, it comes down to “the fear that people who are different pose a threat to white culture and resources,” says Dr Debbie Ging, an Associate Professor in the School of Communications at DCU.
Her current research addresses issues such as cyberbullying and online misogyny. Dealing with the “loner” tag used frequently in these cases, she toldTheJournal.ie:
“It might look like these people are acting alone, but they are in fact supported by vast numbers of like-minded people, both online and offline.

Dr Ging said that these extremely violent reactions based on Islamophobia is “borne of a perceived threat to white power and entitlement, and their response is counter-attack”.
Professor Conway agrees that the extreme right “portray all Muslims as somehow associated with IS, and attacks against them as therefore ‘legitimate’”.
What are the conditions that make terrorism appealing?
Although there’s still an academic debate on this issue, Dr Ging says some research indicates that those who commit mass shootings, or so-called ‘lone wolf’ terrorist attacks, “tend not to have any sort of unique or identifiable psychological traits”.
Dr Ging adds, however, that a number of mass-killing cases feature the same ideologies, citing the man behind the 2011 Norway attack in which 77 people were killed, Anders Breivik.
There are a number of cases, she says, featuring ”white men who have written extensive manifestos, and these manifestos have a common thread, namely an articulation of outrage that something to which they feel entitled – white male superiority – has been taken away from them.”
The media and terrorist attacks
There’s been much debate around how the media covers mass shootings in the Western world, with some media criticised for emphasising a perpetrator’s religion or mental health history in headlines and in framing stories.
Social media companies have also been criticised for allowing extremist images and videos, as well as hateful messages, to be spread. In the case of the New Zealand mosque attacks, the killer live-streamed the incident to Facebook; the video was later removed.
The New Zealand police asked that the video of the attacker’s live stream not be shared,” Professor Conway said, “but it has been widely replayed on television stations globally, besides also being still available on major social media platforms hours after the attacks.”
Dr Ging says that there is little research to support the theory that those who carry out so-called ‘lone wolf’ attacks are suffering from a syndrome, as is “commonly perpetuated by the mainstream media”.
“Terrorist killers are depicted as individuals who are (born) mentally unstable, psychotic or deranged, which not only avoids examining socio-political contexts but also unhelpfully links mental illness with violence,” she says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-bloody-sunday-4522707-Mar2019/,"BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP Boris Johnson has been criticised after suggesting that soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday could be charged with murder for political reasons.
The former foreign secretary was responding to reports in Saturday’s Daily Telegraph thatup to four ex-British soldiers could be charged with the deathsof 14 unarmed marchers in Derry in 1972.
Writing in today’s edition of the newspaper, Johnson claimed that there would be “a storm of utter fury” if the four men were charged later this month while the government let former members of the IRA “get away with” their actions throughout the Troubles.

“They did not get up in the morning with the intention of killing and maiming innocent civilians,”he wrote.
Although Johnson added that nobody should be exempt from justice, he claimed it was now impossible to know the truth about what happened on Bloody Sunday, suggesting that the marchers’ deaths could have been the result of “confusion and panic”.
“The reason this whole thing stinks to high heaven – and the reason it should be denounced – is that there is absolutely nothing new for any trial to discover,” he said.
“The whole thing has been chewed and chewed again, supermasticated to oblivion.”
In a subsequent tweet, the former mayor of London also said that if the case went ahead, it would mean justice would be trumped by politics.
Twitter / @BorisJohnsonTwitter / @BorisJohnson/ @BorisJohnson
However, Johnson’s comments were criticised by a number of politicians in Northern Ireland, some of whom questioned the Conservative MP’s definition of justice.
Alliance MLA Stephen Farry agreed that politics should not be allowed to trump justice, as Johnson tweeted, but said that the Conservative MP was suggesting the opposite.
“My understanding of justice system is that we let police investigate, PPS make decisions on prosecutions and courts decide based on evidence,”he said. “That is the rule of law.”
Farry’s party colleague Sorcha Eastwood also responded to Johnson’s tweet by arguing that the trial would show that “the rule of law applies to everyone”.
Meanwhile, Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard added that a trial would uphold international law by ensuring that armed forces were not able to act with impunity.
Saturday’s report said that the four former paratroopers could be told on 14 March that they will face murder charges.
It was previously reported that Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service (PPS) wasconsidering prosecutions on up to 18 soldierswho were involved in the events.
In 2010, the UK government-led Saville inquiry exonerated the 14 people who were killed and acknowledged that none of them was posing a threat.
Then-prime minister David Cameron called the shootings “both unjustified and unjustifiable” in the wake of the inquiry’s report and offered an apology in the House of Commons.

https://www.thejournal.ie/disney-closes-71-billion-deal-for-21st-century-fox-4551353-Mar2019/,"
DISNEY HAS CLOSED a $71 billion (€62 billion) deal for Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.
The major deal paves the way for Disney to launch its streaming service Disney Plus, which is due out later this year.
The deal will likely lead to thousands of lay-offs due to the to duplication in Fox and Disney film-production staff.
By buying the studios behind The Simpsons and X-Men, Disney aims to compete with technology companies such as Amazon and Netflix for viewers’ attention and money.

The deal helps Disney further control TV shows and movies from start to finish – from creating the programs to distributing them though television channels, movie theaters and streaming services.
Disney would get valuable data on customers and their entertainment-viewing habits, which it can then use to sell advertising.
Disney CEO Bob Iger said in February that Disney Plus and other direct-to-consumer businesses are Disney’s “No. 1 priority.”
Cable and telecom companies have been buying companies that make TV shows and movies to compete in a shifting media landscape. Although internet providers like AT&T and Comcast directly control their customers’ access to the internet in a way that Amazon, YouTube and Netflix don’t these companies still face threats as streaming services gain in popularity.
Pricing for Disney Plus has yet to be disclosed. The streaming service will feature five categories of material: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic.

A MAN HAS been seriously injured in a shooting in west Dublin this afternoon.
The incident occurred shortly after 5pm at Briarswood in Mulhuddart. A man in his 20s was shot multiple times.
He was taken to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown where he is being treated for gunshot wounds, gardaí have said.
Dublin Fire Brigade and gardaí attended the scene of the incident. Both areas have been sealed off pending the arrival of crime scene examiners.
A silver BMW 3 Series car was later discovered on fire at Saddlers Grove, Mulhuddart. Gardaí believe that this car was involved in the shooting.

Both areas have now been sealed off and a technical examination is being carried out by Garda Crime Scene Examiners.
Gardaí are appealing for anyone who was in the Blakestown Road or the Saddlers Grove area between 4.30pm and 5.30pm to contact them.
Gardaí are also appealing for anyone who was driving in the area and may have dash-cam footage to contact Blanchardstown Garda Station on 01 666 7000.
Local Sinn Féin councillor Paul Donnelly has said he is “saddened and shocked” by today’s shooting and called for more gardaí resources to tackle crime.
“Our community is very worried about community safety and we need assurances that extra resources are assigned to Dublin 15,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-does-the-irish-american-community-still-wield-political-influence-in-washington-4544275-Mar2019/,"IT’S NOT SURPRISING given my background, that around this time of year, my thoughts turn to the strong ties between Ireland, the country of my ancestry and now my home, and the United States, where I was born and formed.
Irish politicians rightly avail of the extraordinary access and consequent opportunities in the corridors of power on Capitol Hill and far beyond engendered by 17 March.
In 2019, the overseas trips of government ministers have been overshadowed and curtailed by Brexit and the deadline for either resolution or extension looming in roughly two weeks.
Because this country’s crucial connections with its closest neighbour are likely to be forever altered, no matter how Brexit ultimately shakes out, travelling wherever powerful doors are open may be more important than ever.
Shenanigans
No doubt timed to coincide with St Patrick’s Day, a new book, entitledShenanigans: The US-Ireland Relationship in Uncertain Times, by Trina Vargo, founder and president of the US-Ireland Alliance, was published recently.
Excerpts from the book have garnered headlines on both sides of the Atlantic.
Vargo claims that Bill Clintonvoiced displeasureat the decision by the US-Ireland Alliance, not to short-list his daughter’s boyfriend for the Mitchell Scholarship programme which the US- Ireland Alliance administers.
Vargo is a trenchant critic of what she sees as an Irish American relationship that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose.
In her book, she endeavours to fully explain and expose those failings as she sees them – as well as to settle a few scores.
While some of her criticisms are meritorious and her alliance has done good work in four areas – business, education, culture and entertainment – one is struck by the negativity that pervades the 239 pages of the book.
The first sentence of the first chapter references the “nonexistent Irish American vote and [its] diminishing political influence.”
Later,  Vargo describes a proposal for a mutually beneficial agreement that would allow American citizens to live and work in Ireland as “nonsense” and attests that she has “never heard of any Americans, illegally in Ireland, fighting to stay.”
Her conclusion claims that the “vast majority of Irish Americans aren’t that interested in Ireland and even fewer are involved.”
Irish America
It is, of course, a fact that Irish America is a heterogeneous and amorphous political entity.
Although traditionally Democrats, many have now drifted toward the Republican Party because they are appalled by the former grouping’s lurch to the cultural left or having achieved financial success, they are drawn by the GOP’s low tax policies.
As Catholics and oftentimes centrists, they remain key swing voters in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Vargo might also be surprised to learn that in some places including where I grew up just south of Boston, Irish surnames dominate among local officeholders and casting ballots according to this ethnic identity persists.
If Irish America were politically impotent, it is improbable that elected officials in America’s capital city and around the country would press a collective pause button in mid-March to extol their Irishness and welcome Irish visitors eager to develop new and myriad mutually beneficial associations.
Advertisement
Other countries would kill for what Ireland has in Washington, DC this week. It should not be eyed dismissively.
Moreover, the potentially impactful intervention of Irish American congressmen (including Democrats Richard Neal and Brendan Boyle and their Republican colleague Peter King) regarding Brexit and the Northern Ireland backstop -  signals that there are still ‘Irish issues’ that unites the community.
Vargo’s other claims are equally misguided. She doesn’t seem very well-acquainted with Irish America.
This leads her to grossly underestimate the number of people there who would dearly love either to live and work or to retire in Ireland. I hear from them frequently, typically with a “you are so lucky” lament.
I personally know hundreds of Irish Americans who have relocated to Ireland. Some have managed to stay while others have had to return with heavy hearts.
The highly publicised case of Megan Crowley is one example of one American who is fighting hard to stay in Ireland.
Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of that interest is the huge numbers of Irish Americans who chose to visit and holiday in Ireland. The number of trips from the US to Ireland grew considerably last year as Aer Lingus expanded its routes and other carriers also entered the lucrative market.
There is also growing interest in the GAA and other Irish cultural organisations in the US, even in unexpected locales. Irish festivals attract enormous crowds from Alaska to Florida too. The internet makes it easy for Irish Americans to monitor closely what’s happening back home in current affairs and sport and to reach out to their cousins.
One can only wonder how many of this large and ever-expanding cohort of individuals and groups Vargo actually knows. Did she seek them out before forecasting their imminent demise?
Immigration
Vargo is at her most controversial on the issue of immigration.
Vargo observes that young Irish men and women have not immigrated to the US in big numbers for many years. She opines that the flow of people from here to there cannot be the basis of our future relationship. That may be partly true, yet this is precisely what created the relationship.
She is at pains in the book to defend a puzzling 2007 piece she wrote in The Irish Times arguing against a “special deal” for illegal Irish migrants.
These Irish people,according to Vargo, did not need to emigrate because jobs were plentiful at home.  Those of us who knew those young men and women who emigrated were astonished and disgusted that the head of an organisation called the US-Ireland Alliance would oppose any effort to help them.
Many of them hailed from rural or inner-city communities that never heard the Celtic Tiger roar, while others had left home long before the boom.
Unlike our ancestors who came before them, they are forced to live in the shadows and are denied chances.
Nonetheless, when thinking broadly about the two countries I am lucky to call home, the transatlantic flow is remarkable on virtually every other front conceivable.
While eternally dedicating ourselves to the pursuit of policies that will facilitate better human flow – to allow more Irish men and women to chase the American dream and Irish Americans to return – and being equally vigilant and forward thinking with respect to various challenges on the horizon, I still believe that there is greater cause for optimism than pessimism.
Evidence for positivity is omnipresent this week and one prominent naysayer can’t undermine that.
Whether you are in Ireland, the US or anywhere else around the world, happy St Patrick’s Day to you all!

https://www.thejournal.ie/supreme-court-2-4522740-Mar2019/,"THE WAITING TIMES for an appeal to be heard in Ireland’s Supreme Court have been cut from almost five years to one and the court’s backlog has been effectively cleared.
The country’s highest court launched its first annual report today in Galway, where it will hear a number of cases in NUIG this week.
The report shows there was a 10% increase in applications for leave to appeal filed in 2018 compared to the previous year. The court determined 157 applications for leave to appeal, disposed of 128 appeals and delivered 91 reserved judgments.
The court has also now effectively disposed of its backlog of legacy cases which had accumulated as a result of an almost universal right of appeal to the Supreme Court prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal. Only a small number of these cases remain where certain procedural issues have not allowed for them to be dealt with in full yet.
Tomorrow the court will deliver judgement in Denis O’Brien’s appeal against the decision in his case over statements made about him in the Dáil in 2015. This will be broadcast live by RTÉ on News Now.

And on Wednesday it will hear an appeal in relation to the approval by An Bord Pleanála of the first phase of Apple’s planned €850 million data centre in Athenry.
This is the first time the court has sat outside a courthouse since the reconstruction of the Four Courts in 1932 and it is only its third time to sit outside Dublin.
Chief Justice Mr Justice Frank Clarke said he hopes the work of the Supreme Court can be highlighted and that the general public can gain a greater understanding of what it actually does.
“It is important to stress that the work of the Supreme Court has evolved significantly in recent years. The establishment of the Court of Appeal in 2014 has changed the structure of the caseload of the Court.
“Each member of the Court is also engaged in extra-judicial work, outside of hearing appeals and delivering judgments. The Supreme Court of Ireland is a member of no less than ten European and International networks and participation in each of these networks requires extensive judicial resources”.

One in five cases involved polydrug use – meaning the person was being treated for problem use of more than one drug.
The figures were released by the Health Research Board (HRB) today.
Thekey findingsin the report include:
The number of cases involving polydrug use remained relatively stable during the period in question – 20% in 2017 and 19% in 2011.
Cannabis was the most common additional drug used. The number of such cases reported declined steadily from 68% in 2011 to 58% in 2016, but increased slightly to 61% in 2017.
Cocaine was the second most common additional drug recorded. This has increased from 29% in 2011 to 42% in 2017. In 2017, cocaine as an additional drug was more common among males (44%) than females (34%).
Benzodiazepines were the third most common additional drug reported (23%). The proportion reporting benzodiazepines as an additional problem increased from 22% in 2011 to 29% in 2016, and then decreased to 23% in 2017.
In 2017, opiates as an additional drug are more common among females (21%) than males (12%).
Responding to the figures, Dr Darrin Morrissey, Chief Executive at the HRB, said alcohol “remains the main problem drug that people enter treatment for in Ireland”.

He noted that recovery is harder for people trying to give up more than one drug, stating: “That, in conjunction with the very high percentages of cases that are alcohol dependent, point to the chronic nature of addiction.”
Age and gender breakdown
In 2017, the median age at which cases first started drinking was 16 years, similar to previous years. Almost three-quarters (72%) of all cases were alcohol dependent.
The proportion of previously treated cases who were alcohol dependent increased from 68% in 2011 to 79% in 2017. In 2017, 74% of males treated were alcohol dependent, compared to 68% of females.
Dr Suzi Lyons, Senior Researcher at the HRB, said there has been an increasing trend in the percentage of new cases who are already dependent on alcohol when they present to treatment for the first time, up from 50% in 2011 to 68% in 2017.
Lyons added that the annual reduction in cases being treated in 2017 could be the result of a number of factors such as a decrease in the number of submissions to the reporting system and availability of services, or a real decrease in numbers seeking treatment.
The median age of people treated in 2017 was 41 years and almost two-thirds of cases were male (65%). Members of the Irish Travelling community represented 1.6% of all cases.
Over half (52%) of cases involved unemployed people. The proportion of cases that were homeless increased from 6% in 2011 to 8% in 2017.
In 2017, a higher proportion of males (10%) were homeless than females (5%). Almost one-third (32%) of females were aged 50 and over, compared to one-quarter (25%) of males.
The median age of treated cases was higher for females (43 years) than males (40 years). This is reflected in the median age for new cases entering treatment – 38 for males and 43 for females.
The HRB compiles this annual report by analysing data from multiple treatment services across Ireland and the National Drug Treatment Reporting System.
Each case relates to a treatment episode, not a person. This means the same person could be counted more than once in the same calendar year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/homelessness-leaving-certificate-students-4537511-Mar2019/,"CURRENTLY, THERE ARE almost 4,000 children and young people in Ireland who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation.
However, as confirmed toTheJournal.ie, neither the Department of Education nor the State Examination Commission will know how many children who are homeless are undertaking state exams this summer.
That’s because “candidates for State examinations are in the main entered for the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations by the school and the SEC has no information as to the residential status of examination candidates”, according to the Department of Education.
Now, it must be noted that even if the State did record such information, at any given time throughout the year it may not be able to accurately know the true number of homeless students who will be sitting exams in the summer.
For example, a student who is homeless now may not be homeless in June, when the exams take place, or visa versa.
That being said, Tanya Ward from the CRA was critical of the lack of data.
“The key problem is that no one is formally tracking these children and there is no specialised policy on their education needs in school,” Ward said.
Services laid out to support students who may find themselves in such circumstances are often provided by individual schools or housing charities.
Current figures
The homeless emergency accommodationfigures for Januaryshow that there are now a combined total of 9,987 people homeless and living in emergency accommodation in Ireland, a significant rise of 234 people from December.
The numbers taken over the course of one week in January show that there were 6,363 adults and 3,624 homeless children living in emergency accommodation in the state.
The overwhelming majority of homeless families and children are in the Dublin region. Most of these are either living in family hubs, or rooms in commercial hotels and B&Bs.
Families – often with very young children – have had to share beds in single hotel rooms for months at a time.
In many cases these hotels would have no cooking or cleaning facilities or suitable areas to study in.
Drug use, abusive staff, bed bugs and rat droppings are just some of the issues that have been raised about this sort of accommodation.
Bed bugs, used needles and rat droppings – life inside homeless accommodation
Being homeless during exam time
Studying for State examinations can be a stressful time for any teenager, but that stress deepens with a lack a stable homelife.
There are two main issues facing homeless students in Ireland, according to Focus Ireland’s director of advocacy Mike Allen.
The first being transportation, he said.
It cannot always be guaranteed that emergency accommodation will be in the same area as the student’s school, which means that these students could end up spending ample amounts of their day travelling to and from school – time which could be spent focusing on homework or study.
Focus Ireland’s family homeless action team project leader Niamh Lambe spoke toTheJournal.iethis week and provided examples of students they worked with who were homeless and in exam years.
In one case, a teenag girl who was in her Junior Certificate year was living in a hotel room with her two parents and two siblings. Lambe said:
The Department of Housing funds an initiative to provide homeless families residing in hotel accommodation and family hubs in the Dublin Regions with access to free public transport for essential school journeys.
Focus Ireland director of advocacy Mike AllenSasko LazarovSasko Lazarov
Echoing the words of Lambe, Children’s Rights Alliance (CRA) chief executive Tanya Ward noted that having to travel long distances to and from school can have an impact on school attendance.
“Imagine having to wake your child as early as 5.30am to make the long journey across the city to school? Many are exhausted and some sleep on the bus journey to and from school. This can impact school attendance,” Ward said.
Secondly, the lack of suitable accommodation poses issues, too, according to Allen.
As evident above, most homeless students are left without a suitable place to study once they leave their school in the afternoon.
“Some of the hubs have study rooms or places which are suitable for that, but not all of them do and none of the commercial hotels, which is where most people are, have anything like that,” Allen said.
Allen said that students who are homeless might face ending up with “significantly lower exam results” than usual as a result of their accommodation situation.
Ward added: “Imaging trying to study for your Junior or Leaving Cert in the hotel room that you share with your entire family? This is the reality for children living in homelessness.”

Over the past few years, children’s rights groups, non-governmental organisations and independent overseers have time and time again warned that long-term homelessness can have adevastating effect on children.
It’s not just the practical elements that are disrupted in a child’s life when they become homeless. It can have a serious emotional impact on a child or young person, too.
Arecent surveycarried out by the Irish Primary Principals’ Network (IPPN) stated that the top three challenges for children who are either homeless or living in direct provision are anxiety, family issues and neglect.
The network said that the daily reality of families living in homeless accommodation and direct provision can often result in poor physical and mental wellbeing, low self-esteem, exhaustion and feelings of isolation. This would no doubt be a similar scenario for post-primary students, too.
Mike Allen noted that these students face issues ranging from a lack of confidence, bullying, being singled out and losing friends as a result of their circumstances. These issues, it should be noted again, would coincide with the stress students are under when it comes to exam preparations.
In terms of their health and wellbeing, aFocus Ireland reportin 2017 outlined that children living in emergency accommodation are living off frozen food and takeaways due to a lack of cooking and storage facilities.

Homeless families reported supplementing their diets with noodles, instant pasta, chicken, chips and pizza.
The research found that all families interviewed shared a bedroom, and just one of the 10 families surveyed were provided with breakfast and dinner in their emergency accommodation.
Michelle Share, one of the authors of the report, outlined some of the living conditions homeless families face:
On a practical level, emergency accommodation can impact other important parts of children’s lives such as free play and completing homework, according to Share.

State data
The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) has pointed to the reasons behind the lack of information on homeless students on behalf of the State.
“It is important to note that in Ireland, the Junior and Leaving Cert examinations system provides anonymity to students so that they can be assured of objective and fair assessment procedures. This should remain the case for all students, including students who experience homelessness during an exam year,” ASTI education and research officer Moira Leydon said.
She said the best way to help these students “during this difficult period in their lives is to equip schools to support them”.
Likewise, Barnardos CEO Suzanne Connolly thinks it is understandable for the Department of Education not to keep such data.
“Young people really value their privacy and they don’t necessarily want that type of data gathered on them,” Connolly toldTheJournal.ie,adding that students who are homeless still need support from their schools.
So, with all those issues in mind, what provisions are in place to support homeless students who are undertaking exams?
The Department of Education has said in a statement that a range of resources are available to “support schools in dealing with identified additional educational needs, including needs which may arise for children who are experiencing homelessness”.
“This includes the National Educational Psychological Service who work through a problem solving and solution-oriented consultative approach to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils,” it said.
DEIS also provides additional supports to schools from disadvantaged communities.
“Schools use these additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort, including the additional needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness,” the Department said.
It added: “Schools designated as DEIS can also avail of Home School Community Liaison and School Completion supports provided by Tusla’s Educational Welfare Service to assist with school attendance, retention and progression, which can be areas of particular challenge to pupils experiencing homelessness.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Education Joe McHughLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
Despite the provisions the Department of Education says it has in place, many teachers still feel under pressure and “ill-equipped” to support homeless students.
Speaking at the launch of aCRA report last year, Maeve McCafferty of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation said that teachers are “very acutely aware and concerned about the escalating homelessness crisis”.
“They see it every day in from of them in their classrooms as it manifests itself in many ways in people’s punctuality, attendance, academic achievement, interactions, engagement, the list just goes on,” McCafferty said.
“Despite advocating on behalf of families in writing letters and that, they do feel very frustrated that it has little impact.”
Solutions
Aside from providing teachers with better resources and wrap around support to assist homeless students, it seems a vital aspect of helping those who are undertaking exams is providing them with suitable study spaces and accommodation.
Over the past two years, the government has begun to move away from hotel accommodation towards the family hub model. However, after being introduced, these hubs quickly came in forstrong criticism. And, as noted by Allen, not all hubs may be suitable for studying.
Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has previously indicated the placement of families in hubs is a priority, previously referring to the move as “the preferred first response” for those who enter emergency accommodation.
However,others have complainedthat the hubs ‘normalise’ homelessness, comparing to the direct provision system for asylum seekers.
Minister for Housing Eoghan MurphyLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, the Department of Housing said that “agreements and contracts require that families accessing the hubs are supported to exit to an independent tenancy within a six-month period”.
However, it noted that “it is accepted that in some cases, due to the accommodation requirements or preferences of some families, it may not be possible to facilitate their exit from the hub within a six-month period”.
And turning back to the education system itself, Focus Ireland’s Mike Allen, similar to the ASTI, thinks the Department doesn’t need to “keep a database” on homeless students.
He did, however, say: “If a teacher has a pupil that is doing exams who is in homeless accommodation, there should be a toolkit or a pack or people who they can speak to and say this is what such and such school did that worked and another school did something that didn’t really work so don’t try that one.”
The ASTI’s Moira Leydon said that schools must be able to “draw on additional financial supports to provide for the tangible needs of students experiencing homelessness, such as school books, uniforms, transport to school”.
“Schools must be able to provide meals, homework clubs, supervised study, for these students,” she said.
The Department of Housing aid that additional supports for families in emergency accommodation are available through the Department of Children and Tusla.
It said that schools with home school community liaison coordinators are “engaging with the parents from homeless families” and that “children in homeless accommodation are being prioritised within the school completion programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs”.
Suzanne Connolly said that a school’s ethos and approach to dealing with homeless students is “really important”.
“All schools need to do is think of the young person. It’s not rocket science. It’s about very sensitively talking to the young person and saying how can we support you?” Connolly said.
“When it comes to homelessness, I actually think how [teachers can] support a young person is talking to them. It’s making allowances, so if they’re late that you recognise they might have spent two hours trying to get there by bus,” she said.
“If a young person is arriving in late, if they’re tired, if suddenly … the way they are has changed, check out if homelessness might be an issue. Just be sensitive to that possibility.”

SINCE ASYLUM SEEKERS in Ireland were given the right to work last year 15% of people living in Direct Provision have taken up employment.
Last year, the government put into effect theEU Reception Conditions directivewhich gives asylum seekers the right to work while their claim is processed.
A blanket ban which prevented asylum seekers from working was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 2017.
So far, a total of 805 applicants have commenced employment or self-employment, according to the Department of Justice & Equality, based on returned declarations of employment forms – less than half of the overall number of permissions granted.
Of the 4,070 adults currently living in Direct Provision, 1,594 people have been granted permission to work.
According to the department, 579 people are confirmed to be in employment – 15% of the adult population of Direct Provision.
When a person takes up work it is required that a declaration form stating that they are working is returned to the department.
The department issue labour market access permissions which grant temporary access to the labour market and includes access to both employment and self-employment.

In areportpublished yesterday, Ombudsman Peter Tyndall noted that the introduction of work has had a positive effect on those living in direct provision centres.
However, while 2,143 international protection applicants now have permission to work in Ireland, campaigners and migrant groups have said that significant barriers remain for people living in Direct Provision.
‘Excluded’
“Employment is a crucial gateway to integration. It fosters autonomy, independence and the dignity of people seeking international protection,” Nick Henderson of the Irish Refugee Council has said.
The most recent figures indicate that, as well as the 579 adults living in Direct Provision now working, an additional 226 people not living in Direct Provision are also working.
“That is a fantastic achievement for those people to be working less than a year since the introduction of the right to work scheme,” Henderson has said.
“However, the figures also indicate that around 63% of people seeking asylum who have permission to work, have not been able to find work. This reflects the considerable challenges and barriers people face in finding work”.
Joyce, who is originally from Malawi, has been living in Mosney Direct Provision Centre, Co Meath for over two years.
To travel to her job in Dublin, she must walk 40 minutes to the main road and make a 45-minute bus journey. “Transport is a big challenge,” she says. “I found three jobs that said I needed a drivers’ license”.
The Mosney Road, Co MeathGoogleMapsGoogleMaps
Those living in Direct Provision are not permitted to obtain a drivers’ license, however. Work permits must also be renewed every six months. Joyce has said that the Department of Transport should issue temporary drivers’ licenses in line with work permits.

A friend living in Knockalisheen Direct Provision Centre in Co Clare successfully applied for their work permit, says Joyce. Due to the remote location of the centre could not access transport to seek employment, however. “People there are stuck with their work permits,” says Joyce.
Joyce, who currently works one day a week while taking a college course, has said that when she did eventually receive her work permit she also encountered difficulty opening a bank account. “They didn’t accept me. I didn’t have a passport, I didn’t have a drivers’ license. It was so frustrating”.
‘Considerable work’
Permission to work in Ireland only applies to those making their first application for refugee status.
Commenting on the most recent figures, Henderson of the Refugee Council has said that “it is also worth remembering that only those who have been waiting nine months or more for a decision on their asylum claim can apply for permission to work”.
In addition to barriers like the remoteness of Direct Provision centres, inability to obtain drivers’ licenses and opening bank accounts, some employers do not seem to be aware that people seeking asylum can work, Henderson has said.
“Those that are aware, can be put off by the temporary – six months – nature of the permission”.
“Considerable work needs to be undertaken across various Government departments, other public agencies and employment bodies to remove these barriers”.
“The gender breakdown of who is working should also be investigated and considered”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-affordable-home-scheme-4525049-Mar2019/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS said the government will have to consult with the Central Bank before continuing to provide loans under a scheme for first-time buyers.
It emerged yesterday that a directivehad been issued to local authoritiestelling them to stop considering applications for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme because all of the €200 million fund had been allocated.
Under this scheme a first-time-buyer could apply for a home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property, or to build their own home. First-time-buyers could borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property at a reduced interest rate.
Leo Varadkar was questioned about the scheme by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin today who said the government had always indicated that a second fund would be created “very quickly” after this had run out.
He asked why the Department of Housing did not make a public announcement about halting the scheme.

“People are still applying,” he said.
Martin said this was an example of “low income people being let down again”.
In response, the Taoiseach said some 575 people had been helped by the scheme and a further 1,000 had been approved but have yet to draw down the funding.
He told Martin that the government will now consider increasing the €200 million cap, but he said the money “has to be found”.
Varadkar also said there will have to be consultation with the Central Bank before any expansion of the scheme.
He pointed out that these are loans are being offered to “people who were turned down by banks and building societies” and that they are being given at a reduced interest rate.
The Taoiseach said the government will have to ask the Central bank whether it is “comfortable with us offering more of these loans”.

EVERTON AND ENGLAND defender Michael Keane has spoken out about his reasons for representing Ireland at underage level.
In the wake of the Declan Rice saga, nationality and dual allegiances has become a much-discussed topic, with Harry Kane another England international whorecently discussed his Irish roots.
The 26-year-old centre-back represented the Boys in Green on a handful of occasions at underage level, before opting to switch to England.
“You’ve got to go with where you feel like you belong,” Keane said inan interview with the BBC.

“I always thought I belonged with England and that’s why I have always dreamed of playing for England.
“When I was at Ireland, I wasn’t good enough to play for England at that time. I was only young and small and still developing. I had in the back of my head that hopefully one day I could play for England.
“I can’t really give [youngsters] too much advice. I think you have just got to go on your gut feeling. Obviously you have to see how you’re performing week in week out and where you think you could end up in your career.”
Keane also backed Rice’s decision, after the West Ham midfielder recently declared for England despite earning three senior non-competitive caps for Ireland.
“I’ve got some sympathy for him. It’s not an easy decision and it wasn’t for me at the time. I can only imagine it’s harder for him,” he said
“You’ve got to go with your instincts and where you feel like you belong. You have to go with where you think you could end up in your career. Declan has made his decision now and we are happy that he is here. Hopefully people now let him display his talents on the football pitch.”
Meanwhile, Keane’s twin brother Will, a striker with Ipswich, recentlydeclared his intention to represent Ireland, having played for England at underage level.

MARY LOWRY’S COMPUTER was used to search for Bobby Ryan’s name the day before his body was recovered from a tank on her land, the Central Criminal Court has heard.
Lowry gave her computer to gardaí investigating Bobby Ryan’s death and Detective Garda Paul Fitzpatrick of the Garda Cyber Crime Bureau received it in May 2015.
He told Patrick Quirke’s defence counsel Bernard Condon that when he searched Lowry’s computer for key words he found a search for “trace Ireland Bobby Ryan” was carried out at 9.45pm on 29 April 2013.
Ryan’s body was discovered the following day by the accused man.
Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Bobby Ryan, a part-time DJ who called ‘Mr Moonlight’. Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am.
His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary in April 2013. The prosecution claims Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Lowry, aged 52.
Condon also asked the witness about a forensic analysis carried out on a computer seized during a search of Quirke’s home following the discovery of the body.
The jury heard yesterday that the computer was used in December 2012 to search for “human body decomposition timeline” and “rate of human decomposition”.
The witness agreed with Condon that this computer did not have a password and he could not say who was using it at any given time.
He further agreed that Google suggests search words when a person starts typing in the search bar and he couldn’t say which search terms were input by the user.

Quirke, Lowry and Tusla
The Central Criminal Court also heard today that Quirke had told a social worker that Lowry was leaving her three children unsupervised for long periods at weekends and had “lost the run of herself” after becoming fixated on a new relationship.
Deirdre Caverley, giving evidence by video link from Boston, told prosecution counsel Michael Bowman SC that she worked for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in 2011. On 4 February that year she received a call from Patrick Quirke expressing concern about Lowry’s three children.
His concerns, the witness said, were regarding their “well-being and safety”. Quirke told her they were being left unsupervised for long periods of time mostly at weekends.
He said she would leave them from 4pm until the early hours of the morning and added that this had been going on for about three months.
The wider paternal family, he told her, were concerned but afraid to address their concerns for fear of “repercussions”. The children’s grandmother, he said, was “especially” concerned.
He also told her that Lowry had recently entered a new relationship and it was this new boyfriend that she was spending time with at the weekends when the children were left alone in the house.
He further explained that Lowry had been widowed about three-and-a-half years earlier.
The witness said she took a note at the time that Quirke told her: “She had lost the run of herself and become fixated on the relationship.” She also noted that he told her Lowry was “failing to take into account the needs of her three children” due to this new relationship.
Caverley said she suggested to Quirke that Lowry might be using childcare while she was away and asked whether their grandmother, who lived in a section of the house adjoining Lowry’s property, could be looking after them. Quirke, she said, told her that the grandmother was not asked to look after the children.
Caverley advised Quirke to call Gardaí if there were immediate concerns at the weekend so they could look into it. She also told him that she would open up a report and look into the matter.
She called to Lowry’s home unannounced on 10 February but there was nobody home and no car in the drive. She saw a man there who did not identify himself. She spoke to him but he did not tell her when Lowry would return. She said a colleague made a second home visit to Lowry.
Under cross-examination the witness agreed with Bernard Condon SC for the defence that Quirke told her that Lowry was “entitled to be in a new relationship”.
The trial continues this afternoon in front of Justice Eileen Creedon and a jury of six men and six women.","2.45pm, 22 Mar 2019",22 Mar 2019

The incident took place at the Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown and emergency services were called to attend at around 9.30pm last night.
The hotel was playing host to a party with a number of young people in attendance, with the PSNI issuing an appeal for parents to contact their children and collect them immediately.
Assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton said last night: “I can confirm there are two fatalities at this stage and a small number of other casualties. Parents are asked to collect children from Family and Friends reception at Glenavon Hotel.

However, another teenager died from their injuries this morning.
Police confirmed that a 17-year-old boy, a 17-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy have died.
In a further statement this morning, Hamilton said: “Our investigation is at an early stage, and while the exact cause of the incident is still unknown, there are reports of a crush at the scene and initial enquiries indicate that a large group of young people were waiting to enter a disco. We also have reports of some fighting after the incident commenced and at least one person has reported that they were assaulted.”
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, local SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone – who attended the scene last night – described the situation as “every parent’s worst nightmare”.
“Their kids have gone to a teenage disco, and some are not returning home,” he said. “All you can do is express your sympathies to the parents.”
He added that the reports he’s heard from police is that there was a “crush” after a “surge forward” but said that was subjective at this stage and police are investigating.
Local DUP MLA Keith Buchanan said in a statement his thoughts are with the families “receiving such devastating news” today.
“Cookstown is a tightly knit community and the loss of life will be felt right across the entire area,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/e3-visas-irish-workers-4543283-Mar2019/,"NEW EFFORTS ARE underway to secure thousands of potential new US working visas for Irish people.
A bill that sought to allow Irish citizens avail of surplus E-3 visas that are specifically for Australians was brought forward in the US earlier this year. It was thought that if passed it could mean up to5,000 US visas a year could be specifically set aside for Irish citizens.
The bill was passed in the US House of Representatives, without the need for a vote, early in December but then hit a serious roadblock in the Senate.
It needed unanimous support in the 100-seat Senate because it was being fast-tracked but a “hold” was put on the bill by a single US senator, believed to be Senator Tom Cotton.

It is now understood that US President Donald Trump has personally spoken to Cotton about his opposition to the bill.
The Taoiseach and TD John Deasy, who was appointed a government envoy to US Congress to work with the undocumented Irish living in the US, were informed by Congressman Richie Neal that he will be reintroducing the bill in a bid to get it over the line.
The news emerged as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar finished up his St Patrick’s Day celebrations at the White House, where he pushed for progress on the E3 visa situation in the Oval Office meeting with the US president, as well as at the Speakers lunch on Capitol Hill and the Shamrock ceremony.
He thanked the US congress for its support of proposals to allow Irish people to avail of a new E3 visa programme, highlighting that the laws allowing Irish people to avail of the visasnarrowly missed being passed throughthe US Senate last year.
Chicago-based Senator Billy Lawless of Seanad Éireann previously toldTheJournal.iethat it felt like the bill had been “caught in the middle” of the “mayhem and crisis” in Washington.
Lawless said Cotton was being lobbied heavily by Irish diplomats and advocates but that at the time they were unaware what his objection was.

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-of-commons-brexit-4530788-Mar2019/,"PRIME MINISTER THERESA May’s much-maligned withdrawal agreement, delaying Brexit or crashing out without a deal?
Yet again, this week will see the spotlight squarely on Westminster with MPs set to determine the course of the UK’s future with a series of crucial votes on Brexit.
There’s less than three weeks to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, so the stakes couldn’t be higher.
There are a number of different ways it could go, so here’s the possible paths with the Brexit endgame set to get under way.
So here we go again.
After lengthy, prolonged negotiations Theresa May’s government secured a withdrawal agreement with the EU. This deal contains the provisions for the Irish backstop – the measure that would avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
May’s withdrawal agreement has proven unpalatable for the DUP, hardline Conservatives and the opposition parties.
She delayed a vote on this deal in December when it became clear she wouldn’t have the votes to pass it in the House of Commons. Nothing in the agreement changed, and it was roundly defeated in a vote in January.
Despite numerous talks with the EU since then, little has changed in the withdrawal agreement with the Irish government and Brussels refusing to back down on the backstop.
Nevertheless, MPs will vote again on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement on Tuesday 12 March.
Her deal was crushed in the January vote by a majority of 230.
Here are the scenarios for the meaningful vote.
Somehow, someway she manages to get the vote through parliament despite the previous thumping defeat. If this happens, then the UK will have finally ratified the withdrawal agreement with the EU.
Short of the UK holding a second referendum and opting to stay in the EU, it’s the best result for Ireland as it prevents a hard border with Northern Ireland and the economy take the hit that is feared would happen if there was a no-deal Brexit.
If May somehow wins, the subsequent votes that are outlined belowwill not take place.
As expected, May loses the vote.
If it’s by a small margin, it could convince the Conservative leader to try to entice opposition Labour MPs with further concessions to try twist the numbers back on her side.
If the vote is lost by a significant margin, then that is the death knell for the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement.
And, if it’s lost by a sizeable margin, MPs will be voting again the next day.
If May loses the meaningful vote, then MPs will get the chance to vote on whether or not they’d like to leave the EU without an agreement on Wednesday 13 March.
A no deal would be the worst case scenario for Ireland, paving the way for the return of a hard border andhitting the Irish economy hard and fast.

It is the favoured option of the likes of the European Research Group headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg which believes a no deal wouldn’t be bad for the UK.
However, the appetite for a no-deal Brexit is limited to only a small number of MPs. Indications so far are that this vote will certainly not pass.
Here are the scenarios for the vote on a no-deal Brexit.
This is unlikely to happen. But if it does, it provides a mandate from the House of Commons for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.
It’s likely further attempts could be made to prevent this from happening following the vote, but how that would work remains to be seen.
By now we’re running out of options. If this option is chosen – as expected – then MPs will have rejected the deal on the table, and also leaving without a deal.
Given these choices, they will be asked to vote again the following the day on the last remaining option at this time.
Article 50 was the mechanism through which the UK triggered its withdrawal from the EU. It set a time limit of 29 March to negotiate all the necessary arrangements with the EU before it left.
If we reach this vote on Thursday 14 March, it will mean that these arrangements have not been agreed upon.
By then, it will be just over two weeks until the UK is due to leave the EU.
Theresa May has said that MPs will be given the chance to vote on extending Article 50 by a number of months in a bid for more time to break the impasse.
Brexiteers will oppose any delay but if it makes it this far, it will have become apparent that there no one can agree on any deal passing.
This one is difficult to predict, although it appears likely that there would be enough numbers in the Commons to pass this one.
Here are the scenarios in this one.
This would be truly farcical. It would mean that, in the space of three days, parliament voted a) against the only deal on the table, b) not to leave without a deal on 29 March and c) against extending this 29 March deadline.
At the very least, this would buy May and the UK some time. What she does with that time, however, is unclear. After lengthy talks, the EU and the Irish government has refused to back down.
Extending Article 50 is unlikely to change that but it could allow May more time to make concessions to sway either the Brexiteers in her own party and the DUP, or those on the opposition benches.
If it gets to this point, then it will be a case of the UK kicking the can down the road yet again.
May will be left with a more few options in this scenario – she could call a general election, she could step down as leader and prime minister. If she does step down it could also be a case of jumping before she’s pushed, as the Brexiteers furious at any delays to Brexit may try to oust her.
If Article 50 is extended, then it will create more uncertainty as the UK will remain in the EU for a further period without a way forward in sight.
Whatever happens, we’re set for another week of high drama in Westminster.
It may not be possible to accurately predict exactly what will happen, but we are sure to get a lot ofthis:

https://www.the42.ie/glenn-whelan-retired-4528598-Mar2019/,"YOU MAY BE tempted to call it one of the shortest retirements in Irish football, spanning as it did a single game – against Denmark, naturally enough – but as it turns out, it wasn’t a retirement at all.
“I rang him and asked him if he had retired, and he said ‘No I haven’t'” said Mick McCarthy of his decision to include Glenn Whelan in his 38-man provisional squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Georgia.
“So whether he was retired as opposed to retiring himself, I don’t know.”
It was the former.
Rather than Whelan making the call himself, it was Martin O’Neill’s, then plotting for a future in which he ultimately played no part.
Thus he was given a send-off at the November friendly against Northern Ireland, but it is he, rather than O’Neill, who may be in line for a return to the Aviva at the end of the month.
Whelan was persuaded to break an eight-year habit and speak to the media ahead of that putative final game, and said that “I’ve spoken to the manager, he knows if anything ever happens down the line, I will be available.”
Advertisement
Now he’s spoken to the new manager and is in line for an 86th international cap. Whelan has been playing at Championship level with Aston Villa, and has started six of his side’s last eight games having been a bit-part player under Steve Bruce at the start of the season.
“He’s playing very well,” says McCarthy. “He is playing with Conor Hourihane as well so there’s a partnership there, so at least there is some understanding between them there.
“I wonder about our squad of midfield players, about whether there is someone who can do a specific job as a sitter, and he certainly can.
Whether he ends up in the final squad remains to be seen, but I’ve been impressed with him.”
If Whelan has been recalled, surely McCarthy won’t cut him from the squad when it comes to narrowing it to a 23-man selection?
There are some more returning faces. Aiden McGeady, who last played for Ireland in the 5-1 battering against Denmark in 2017, is back following a fine run of form with Sunderland in League One, for whom he has 10 goals and five assists in 27 games this season.

James McCarthy is back too, having missed all of 2018 with a broken leg. Although he has returned to fitness, the midfielder is yet to make a senior appearance for Everton this season, which is of concern to the Irish manager.
“I’ve spoken to him a couple of times. I hoped he would go on loan at Christmas, but they didn’t let him go for whatever reason. He’s not started a game for a long time.

“He is one of our best midfielders, but if the best midfielders don’t play, they’re not the best midfielders. They are the ones who play games, and are battle-hardened.”
Striker David McGoldrick returns having been frozen out toward the end of O’Neill’s reign, as is goalkeeper Keiren Westwood and defender Stephen Ward.
One man who has not returned is Daryl Murphy. The striker retired from Irish duty at the end of 2017, and despite McCarthy’s hopes that he would reverse the decision, he has yet to do so.
“He told me he’s retired. He’s at an age at which he likes having that time off when the international breaks come as it will benefit his club career, but I did say that ‘If I need you, and if I call you’, and the final answer was ‘I’ll see’.
“So it wasn’t a no.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/international-bar-john-smith-4541045-Mar2019/,"JOHN FRANCIS SMITH was finishing up his shift in the International Bar like he had so many times since he started working in the Dublin city pub back in February 1979.
Alongside him was his colleague of 33 years Alan Martin and younger bar staff as they were doing the necessary bits before shutting up shop and going home.
It was to be the last day in work for one of Dublin’s longest-serving barmen – who was called John F by many patrons and friends – as he would later die suddenly on Friday 8 March.
John Francis Smith stood behind the bar in Dublin's International Bar since 1979
“I was dumbfounded,” his workmate Alan toldTheJournal.ie. “He was a healthy guy. He swam three or four times week. He’d often walk to and from work.”
John F stood behind the bar of the International for so many years, but never slowed down as poured pints across the three floors of the popular Dublin hotspot.
“He was a fresh 60 years of age. He’d just turned 60 in December” his colleague said. “John was always running. He was quite fast for a barman of his age.”
The barman also bore witness to the changing landscape of Ireland over the past four decades.
Alan said: “There was one story he told last year when Pope Francis came over. He remembered starting work here back in 1979, and it was a few months afterwards that Pope John Paul II. He was only 21 at the time.
Over the course of his time working in the busy International Bar on Dublin’s Wicklow Street, the Cavan native came into contact with so many recognisable faces from the world of music, comedy and journalism.

Phil Lynott would often come in at the start of the 1980s. U2 frequented the pub in the early days too. It was a regular haunt for Hot Press journalists during that time such as Declan Lynch, Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews, Alan said.
And, over the past few decades, the International has played host to the Comedy Cellar which gave numerous comedians who’d go on to gain wider fame their start as well as featuring the best of Irish comedy still today.
“We had the Apres Match lads, we had Ardal O’Hanlon, Des Bishop, all of them,” Alan said. “It was nice to see a good few of that old crowd at the funeral earlier this week.”
When John F passed away two Fridays ago, Alan Martin spent the weekend going through old phone numbers and old address books, ringing around various people to inform them of the news.
“We really got a great crowd then on Wednesday at the Pro Cathedral,” he said. “The speeches were lovely, and the eulogy was too.
According to his long-time workmate, John F would treat customers the same whether they were the office staff finishing up work on a Friday evening orworld-famous musicians.
His colleague said: “John hadn’t a bad bone in his body… he always had a smile on his face even after all this time. I’d often say to him ‘how do you go on like that?’.”
John F survived by his wife Susan. They’d been together 20 years but only got married late last year.
Alan said that John “lived for his holidays”, and made sure he got away every year.
“When he was turning 60 in December, Susan text me to say she was bringing him on a surprise holiday to Milan, but she wanted me to make him think he’s going to Brighton because he’s been there and hates it,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/anna-soubry-not-safe-brexit-4554893-Mar2019/,"BRITISH MP ANNA Soubry says that she can’t go home to her constituency this weekend because of the seriousness of Brexit related death threats that she has received.
The Independent Group member revealed that the police told her husband that they are “frightened” for her safety.
Soubry, who quit the Conservative Party last month, made the remarks a day after UK Prime Minister Theresa May criticised MPs for failing to implement the result of the Brexit referendum in a scathing TV statement.
The politician took issue with May’s comments revealing that she was facing “very, very serious death threats, especially when people know your home address”.
“When a senior police officer tells your partner that if it was his wife in the situation that I am in he would say ‘I am frightened for her safety’ I think that tells you everything.”

Soubry, who supports remaining in the EU, added that many other MPs have also received threats including her TIG colleague Chuka Umunna.
Several other MPs raised safety concerns following May’s comments. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told Sky News that he was confronted on a street in his constituency.
“When I said he was an MP he then started to get rather irate, called me a traitor, saying that I was one of the ones trying to stop the will of the people,” he said.
In the days before the referendum in June 2016 Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by Thomas Mair, a white supremacist.
Speaking in Brussels tonight Theresa May declined to apologise for her comments but she did take a softer approach with MPs.
“There are passionately held views on all sides of this argument. And yes, as I said, last night I expressed frustration but I know MPs are frustrated too,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/new-zealand-gun-laws-4549040-Mar2019/,"NEW ZEALAND’S GUN laws are under intense scrutiny in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacre in which 50 people lost their lives.
Australian man Brenton Tarrant, an avowed white supremacist, legally purchased the semi-automatic weapons he used to shoot dead 50 Muslims, including a three-year-old boy.
“We can’t ignore the galling fact he came to New Zealand to buy firearms he couldn’t get in Australia,” Police Association president Chris Cahill said.
The country’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern earlier said her cabinet has decided to tighten gun laws, with details to be announced next week. She said the measures could include a ban on some semi-automatic rifles and a weapons buy-back scheme.
Currently anyone over the age of 16 and considered to be “fit and proper to possess firearms” can get a general A-category licence in New Zealand. This allows them to buy firearms including the AR-15 which was reportedly used by the Chiristchurch gunman. This gun is also frequently the weapon of choice in mass killings in the United States.
According to New Zealand police data from 2017, the year Tarrant obtained his licence, there were 43,509 applications for a firearms licence with a 99.6 percent approval rate. Around 250,000 people possess firearms licences in the country of under five million.

Chris Cahill has called for a ban on easily-modified semi-automatic weapons and the creation of a national gun registry.
“As it stands now, we have no idea who’s buying weapons and where they’re keeping them or how many they have in New Zealand,” he said.
‘An ordinary sale’
David Tipple, whose Gun City company legally sold four weapons to Tarrant said he did not feel any sense of responsibility for the tragedy.
Vincent Yu / PAVincent Yu / PA / PA
He said Tarrant was “a brand new purchaser with a brand new licence”.
“It was an ordinary sale,” he told reporters, adding that he could continue to sell weapons to anyone with the correct credentials.
Andrew Taylor, owner of Shooters Supplies on the western outskirts of Christchurch, closed his store for the weekend after the shootings. He has also removed large-capacity magazines as well as AR-15s and similar weapons from the shelves.

The semi-automatic weapons he sold were usually bought by “helicopter guys shooting pests, deer and out of control goats from choppers”, he said.
Gun laws were previously tightened in New Zealand in the wake of another mass shooting in 1990, but attempts to push through further reforms have been unsuccessful. The country’s prime minister was flanked by her coalition partner and deputy prime minister Winston Peters when she told reporters that measures had been agreed to change gun control laws.
Peters’ party has previously opposed changes, but he said he now backs the prime minister fully.
“The reality is that after 1pm on Friday our world changed forever and so will our laws,” he said.
Comments are off as a person has been charged in relation to this incident.

RIOT POLICE BLOCKED protesters as thousands of people took to the streets with tensions rising between opposition leader Juan Guaido and President Nicolas Maduro after crisis-wracked Venezuela emerged from the chaos of an electricity blackout.
Both Guaido and Maduro, who are locked in a bitter power struggle for the right to lead the oil-rich South American nation, had asked their supporters to fill the streets of Caracas and other cities in rival demonstrations.
“We want to march! Yes we can!” shouted opposition protesters as riot police prevented them from accessing the street in east Caracas where their demonstration was due to take place.
Overnight, security services had stopped the opposition from setting up a stage in an avenue where their protest was due to take place.
“They think they can scare us but they will get a surprise form the people in the street,” Guaido tweeted.

“They think they can wear us down, but there’s no way they can contain a population that has decided to end the usurpation,” added the leader of the opposition-controlled legislature, who is recognised as Venezuela’s interim president by more than 50 countries.
Guaido is trying to force out Maduro – whose May re-election he deems illegitimate – in order to set up new elections. Ireland and other EU nations backed Guaido’s succession if it meant that fresh elections are called.
Opposition lawmakers denounced the overnight arrest of three people who were setting up a stage at the opposition rally site. Maduro has asked his backers to march against “imperialism.”
“We’re continuing the battle and victory over the permanent and brutal aggression against our people,” Maduro wrote on Twitter.
‘Forceful response’
The mounting political pressure comes as services slowly returned to normal in Caracas and the states of Miranda and Vargas, home to the country’s international airport and main port.

“The US empire once again underestimates the conscience and determination of Venezuela’s people,” tweeted Maduro, who has not been seen in public since the blackout began late Thursday afternoon.
Who’s to blame?
The western regions of Barinas, Tachira and Zulia remained without electricity while in other states the supply was proving unstable.
It was one of the worst and longest blackouts in recent memory in Venezuela and paralyzed most of the country. Its cause is still unknown.
Hospitals had reported terrible problems and those with generators were using them only in emergencies.
Flights were canceled, leaving hundreds of travelers stranded at airports.
The Caracas subway, which transports two million people a day, remained suspended early this morning and shops were closed, but internet and telecommunications services were returning to normal.
“The problem is food, I’d bought meat and it’s going bad. I’m going to the march because we need change. We’re fed up,” Luis Alvarez, a 51-year-old truck driver, told AFP.
Maduro had blamed the blackout on US sabotage and shut down offices and schools yesterday.
Venezuela has suffered more than four years of recession that has seen poverty soar as citizens struggle with food and medicine shortages.
Critics blame the government for failing to invest in maintaining the electrical grid, although the government often points the finger at external factors when the lights go out.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro was wrong to blame the US or any other country for Venezuela’s woes.
“Power shortages and starvation are the result of the Maduro regime’s incompetence,” he tweeted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-brexit-4535852-Mar2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave a late press conference in Strasbourg tonight.
It followed what was being described as a last ditch attempt by May to secure Brexit concessions from the EU ahead of a planned House of Commons vote on the deal tomorrow.
Reading from prepared statements, the pair said they had agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop.
The announcement came as ministers here prepared to reconvene a Cabinet meeting – their second of the day, called in response to the Brexit developments in Strasbourg.
Earlier, British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told MPs in the House of Commons tonight that the government had secured “legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration”.
He said the government had signed-off on a new document providing confirmation that the EU could not try and trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, and that doing so would be in breach of legally-binding commitments.
“If – contrary to all expectations – the EU were to act with that intention, the UK could use this acceptance of what could constitute an explicit breach as the basis for a formal dispute, through independent arbitration, that such a breach had occurred – ultimately suspending the protocol if the EU continued to breach its obligations,” Lidington said.
Juncker began his comments tonight by highlighting that any deal agreed must preserve peace on the island of Ireland.
He said the backstop was an insurance policy and that if it was ever used it would not be used as a trap.
The mechanism being announced tonight complemented the withdrawal agreement agreed last November without reopening it, he said – noting that this was a “second chance” and that there would be no third chance.
Juncker implied that Varadkar had signed off on the strengthened guarantees offered to London.

“I have spoken to the Taoiseach this evening who would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal,” Juncker told reporters.
Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications & legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement &#backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or#Brexitmay not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.https://t.co/lfy9eehEZipic.twitter.com/XCqcLwZV7V— Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU)March 11, 2019Jean-Claude Juncker/ Twitter

Reading her prepared statement, May said the backstop could not be a template for a future relationship and that so far that hadn’t been clear enough to MPs.
The EU, under the new proposals, will not be able to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, May said. If it makes any move to do so, that can be tackled through arbitration.
“MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes.” May said.
“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.”
She said it was the UK’s position that it believed it could withdraw, unilaterally, from the backstop if negotiations on the future relationship broke down.
The Taoiseach delayed his planned US St Patrick’s trip as ministers met here to stay on top of developments.

A spokesperson for the DUP said the party would take time to analyse tonight’s announcements.

ITALY’S GOVERNMENT HAS reinstated a law banning children from attending creches and nursery schools if they had not received a series of jabs.
The law, adopted last year by the government that was booted out of power in March, made it compulsory for children in pre-school education to be vaccinated against 10 diseases, including measles, tetanus and polio.
The new administration — combining the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the nationalist League — had led the charge against the law.

In early August, the upper house Senate approved an amendment pushing back enforcement of compulsory vaccination for pre-schoolers to the 2019-20 school year, pending a complete revision of the law after the summer recess.
Earlier this week, M5S announced a new amendment in the lower house effectively reversing the earlier amendment.
Vittoria Baldino, the party lawmaker handling the legislation, however, added in a statement that a new law on vaccinations was needed to deal with the “dysfunction and chaos” created by the current requirements.

PASSENGERS EXPERIENCED LONG delays and flight cancellations at Dublin Airport yesterday, with some sleeping on the floor last night after their take-offs were postponed for hours.
A snow and ice warning was in effect for the country yesterday and snowfall on the east coast led to de-icing issues at the airport.
Ryanair in particular came in for criticism for its communication on last night’s issues after it experienced problems responding to the ice and snow, leading to hours-long delays.
Passenger Katie Monnelly said she was stuck on a stationary Ryanair flight to London and spent three hours on the tarmac before passengers were told to disembark at 7pm. The plane eventually took off at 9.45pm last night.
Monnelly toldTheJournal.iethat while the pilot and staff handled the situation well, a raft of Ryanair flights experienced long delays.
The airline came in for criticism from passengers for its lack of communication after its Twitter account went dark for a period of three hours last night, only returning before 11pm with a brief update about “a small number of Dublin cancellations”, before operators went offline until early this morning.
Dublin Airport also came in for criticism from Monnelly and others affected by the delays for their communication on problems yesterday evening. The official Twitter account informed passengers that it was “open and operational” but that some airlines were experiencing delays.
Some passengers took issue with the messages, maintaining the updates should be changed to warn of more severe delays.
De-icing problems
An airport spokesperson said this morning that all runways, taxiways and parking stands were clear of snow and ice throughout yesterday “and were operational at all times”.
“Unfortunately, some airlines had an issue with de-icing their aircraft yesterday evening and that resulted in delays to some departures.
“This had a knock-on impact on the availability of aircraft parking stands for some arriving aircraft, as because the departing aircraft had been delayed due to de-icing issues they were still occupying the parking stands in question.
“We sincerely regret the impact that airline de-icing issues had on passengers’ travel plans.
“Dublin Airport was communicating with passenger queries via social media throughout last night and into early this morning. In an evolving situation such as this, the airport is dependent on its airline customers for the latest flight information.”
Ryanair has not responded to a request for a statement on last night’s delays but said in last night’s tweet that “all those affected were advised of their rebook/refund options”.

A number of passengers were left with no information on their delayed flights leading to many sleeping in the airport overnight.
Passenger Sarah Talbot has been waiting in Dublin Airport since 4.30pm yesterday after her flight to Manchester was cancelled and remains at the airport this morning.
She toldTheJournal.iethat she queued for three hours to speak to a Ryanair representative to get some information about her flight but said the desk closed before they saw everyone in the queue.
She added that staff at the departure gate “were almost running away from anyone who had a question”.

Sarah hopes to get out of Dublin Airport on a flight later this afternoon.
Plenty of passengers in a similar situation to Sarah took to Twitter to vent their frustration.

Passenger Laura Joyce toldTheJournal.iethat she sat grounded on her Ryanair flight yesterday for four hours before she was told it had been cancelled and everyone had to disembark.
“No one kept us updated whilst we waited on the plane, we then didn’t speak to or see a single member of staff on the ground,” Joyce said.
After disembarking the plane she was told to join the queue, pictured above, which she says was the only time she saw a Ryanair representative.
Joyce said she booked a hotel and flight last night out of her own pocket and now has “the pain of reclaiming it all”.
She added that she had to book a flight with a different airline because there were no Ryanair flights to Gatwick until Tuesday.
Anyone travelling from Dublin Airport today has been asked to check with their airline for flight updates.
Breaking de-ice
Aviation expert, Kevin Byrne, toldTheJournal.iethat each airline – if they don’t have their own equipment – have a contractor in each airport which de-ices aircraft in the conditions in which they have ice.
“You’re not allowed to take off an aircraft if it’s contaminated on any of its air-dynamic surfaces with ice or snow.
“They do that by spraying on this liquid called de-icer and they use a machine like a rig.”
Byrne said the trouble with these machines is that they are extremely expensive to buy and airlines usually only have two or three maybe.
It might take as long as 15 minutes to de-ice each aircraft properly and it should be airborne once it within 40 minutes of the last of the spray going on the aircraft.

“From what I’ve seen at the airport there is a limited resource in terms of the equipment because they can cost as much as €150,000 each and in Ireland, you wouldn’t always need them,” he said.
“When you fill up the tanks and you spray three aircrafts you have to refill it again. If there are ten aircraft, it’s going to take a while to fill them up,” he said adding that the queuing system for the runway would also have had a knock-on effect with delays.

https://www.the42.ie/epcr-heineken-cup-leinster-ulster-munster-4541185-Mar2019/,"EPCR HAS CONFIRMED the venues for the Heineken Champions Cup semi-finals on the weekend on 20 and 21 April, with Dublin’s Aviva Stadium among the possibilities.
The format for the semi-finals recognises the pool performances of the clubs, meaning the Irish provinces could face difficult away ties if they reach the final four of the competition.
Possible Heineken Champions Cup semi-finals – 20/21 April
Semi-final 1:if Saracens v Edinburgh Rugby – Ricoh Arena (Coventry)Semi-final 1:if Saracens v Munster Rugby – Ricoh Arena (Coventry)Semi-final 1:if Edinburgh Rugby v Glasgow Warriors – BT Murrayfield (Edinburgh)Semi-final 1:if Munster Rugby v Glasgow Warriors – Aviva Stadium (Dublin)

Munster and Leinster could host games at the Aviva.InphoInpho
If top seeds Saracens beat Glasgow Warriors in their quarter-final at the end of this month and Munster overcome Edinburgh in Glasgow, then Johann van Graan’s men will travel to take on Saracens at Coventry’s 32,609-capacity Ricoh Arena in the semi-finals.
If Leinster beat Ulster in the quarter-finals and Racing 92 overcome Toulouse, then Leo Cullen’s side will take on Racing at the French club’s home stadium, the 32,000-seater Paris La Défense Arena, in the semi-finals.
If Ulster pull off an upset against Leinster in Dublin this month, they would also travel to Paris to face Racing in the semi-finals – again, if the Parisians beat Toulouse.
The fact that Racing could host a semi-final in their home stadium is a change to the previous status quo in the Champions Cup, whereby the home side only had home country advantage but could not use their own stadium.
“As a number of clubs now own or control premium venues which befit the status of a Heineken Champions Cup semi-final, EPCR will also consider the possibility of staging a semi-final at a home stadium of a qualified club,” said an EPCRstatement last month.
There is the possibility that the Irish provinces could get home draws for the semi-finals, of course, all of which would take place at the Aviva Stadium.

If Munster beat Edinburgh and Glasgow shock Saracens, then the southern province would welcome Glasgow to the Aviva in April.
If Leinster beat Ulster and Toulouse overcome Racing in the quarter-finals, then Leinster would host Toulouse at the Aviva in the semi-finals.
If Ulster were to beat Leinster and Toulouse win against Racing, then it would be Ulster hosting Toulouse at the Aviva Stadium.
The Heineken Cup quarter-finals take place in three weekends’ time, on 30 and 31 March.

Sophie Gradon (32), who had taken part in the series in 2016, was found dead last June. Both died by suicide.
Their deaths sparked a conversation about mental health and how going from relative obscurity to being very well know, and often publicly criticised, can impact a person’s wellbeing.
In a statement, ITV said it was “shocked and absolutely devastated” by Thalassitis’ death.
“It is not for us to speculate on the reasons behind this tragedy and what is so heartbreaking is that we simply cannot know,” the statement notes.

It adds that Love Island “put Mike in the spotlight with all the ups and downs that brings”, and noted that he went on to feature in other TV series.
The statement responded to some of the criticism levelled at the show in recent days, insisting it does provide support to contestants.
ITV said it has previously offered help to any contestant who asked for it but, following a review of its practices, will now offer therapy to every contestant and “proactively check in with them on a regular basis”.
Medical team
The broadcaster said it hired mental health expert Dr Paul Litchfield to independently review Love Island’s “medical processes” six months ago.
“This review has led us to extend our support processes to offer therapy to all Islanders and not only those that reach out to us. And we will be delivering bespoke training to all future Islanders to include social media and financial management.”
The statement also outlines the support the programme has offered contestants to date pre-filming, during filming and afterwards.
“As TV producers, we rely on medical experts to assess both mental and physical health to ensure that each candidate is suitable for inclusion.”

AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES Boeing 737 crashed this morning en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi in Kenya with 149 passengers and eight crew believed to be on board, Ethiopian Airlines said.
One of the passengers was an Irish person, the airline confirmedat a press conference this afternoon.
A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson toldTheJournal.ie: “The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the incident and providing consular assistance.”
Ethiopia’s state broadcaster has said that there are no survivors from the 157 who were on board.
“We hereby confirm that our scheduled flight ET 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi was involved in accident today,” the airline said in a statement.
“It is believed that there were 149 passengers and eight crew on board the flight but we are currently confirming the details of the passenger manifest for the flight.”
The plane took off at 8.38 am (6.38am Irish time) from Bole International Airport and “lost contact” six minutes later.
The weather in the capital, according to an AFP reporter, was clear when the brand-new Boeing, delivered to Ethiopia last year, took off.
The plane came down near the village of Tulu Fara outside Bishoftu.
An AFP reporter said there was a massive crater at the crash site, with belongings and airplane parts scattered widely.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-a-million-people-have-no-health-cover-as-a-growing-cohort-of-low-paid-families-are-being-excluded-from-access-to-the-medical-card-4515206-Mar2019/,"MORE THAN A million people in Ireland now have no health cover – that is they don’t qualify for the medical card but they don’t have private health insurance either.
And the number of households who are left out in the cold by our two-tier health system has shot up since 2012 when it was 640,000. That is a 66% increase in the number of people with no cover.
While the population is growing, there also appears to be a deliberate policy of removing medical cards from low-paid households.
The methodology employed is pretty clever too, the government didn’t have to lower the income limit for the medical card at any stage – it just hasn’t raised it since 2006. Every year they fail to raise the limit, fewer workers qualify for the card.
Back in 2006, the income limit for access to the medical card was set at 18% above social welfare rates, meaning that very low-paid families had access to free healthcare.
People who get all their income from social welfare have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, but for workers the income limit is now set below the level of the Job Seekers Allowance for all households, whether they are individuals or families.
For those people the impact of this can be devastating, if they experience illness and need hospital treatment they will have to pay, if they can’t afford to, they get into debt increasing the stress of having an illness.
Just before Christmas, theIrish Cancer Society called on the HSEto stop using debt collection agencies to pursue cancer patients for monies owed.
Those who are dependent on social welfare get the medical card, the higher income group get tax rebates linked to their private health insurance but low-paid workers and their families are forgotten about.
Excluded
The Republic of Ireland has a population of approximately 4.8m. There are approximately1.6m households with medical cards,2.2m with private health coverand that leaves around 1 million people with no health cover.
Since health care is so essential, we have to assume that most of those people who don’t have any are low-paid and can’t afford private health insurance.
During the period from 1998 to 2006, the Medical Card income limit was regularly adjusted and remained above the level of Job Seekers Allowance.
Advertisement
In 2006 the Medical Card income limit was set at 18% above Job Seekers Allowance rates but that income limit has not changed over the last 12 years, so now it has fallen below social welfare rates, which have increased by 35% in that time.
Any person whose entire income is from social welfare automatically gets the card.
Some low-paid workers have access to the card because certain forms of income such as Family Income Supplement aren’t counted as income for medical card assessment purposes. Also, some expenses, such as childcare and other costs of going to work are deducted to arrive at the net income for assessment.
Because of these factors, it is hard to define precisely who does and doesn’t get the card but what is clear is that every year the government fails to increase in the income limit, more low-paid workers are being excluded.
Safety net
Some low-paid workers, who don’t qualify for a medical card have been issued with GP cards but that is not the same thing at all. It only covers GP visits and doesn’t provide access to the range of health services people might need.
The medical card provides for outpatient, inpatient and A&E services in public hospitals, some free dental work, vision and hearing treatment, reduced prescription charges and priority access to community care services.
It is also linked to other essential services which are exclusively offered to medical card holders, this system was developed when many low paid workers had the card. Those services include free school transport, free entry to state exams, cheaper childcare and a maternity grant.
Excluding low-income workers from access to the medical card is likely to be a significant disincentive for some people to return to work.
As such the system needs to be radically overhauled to bring low paid workers back under the safety net of free healthcare, to which they previously had access.
When the Irish Cancer Society called on the HSE to stop using debt collection agencies to pursue cancer patients, the HSE responded by saying that they act “in a socially responsible, ethical, efficient and cost-effective way”.
But their actions are not ethical at all. They have silently removed access to the medical card from many of Ireland’s working poor.
It is time for the Minister of Health to intervene and increase the medical card income levels by 35% in order to restore public health care access to those who cannot afford to pay for it.

https://www.the42.ie/mark-travers-interview-4542644-Mar2019/,"WHEN MICK MCCARTHY named the first final squad of his second spell as Ireland manager on Thursday, perhaps the biggest surprise was the inclusion of a little-known teenage goalkeeper from Maynooth.
Some critics might have expected Kieran O’Hara, the Man United goalkeeper on loan at Macclesfield Town, or Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher, both of whom had featured in previous squads, to get the nod.
In the end, however, it was Mark Travers who was called up alongside the more experienced Darren Randolph and Keiren Westwood.
“I thought it was better off taking a younger one [as the third goalkeeper], so I took Mark Travers and Stephen [Kenny] wanted Caoimhin Kelleher and that was his choice,” McCarthy explained at the squad announcement.
And unsurprisingly, Travers sounds enthused about the prospect of linking up with the national side for the next 10 days.
“I’m looking forward to working with the likes of Darren Randolph and Keiren Westwood, which should be great for me and just take as much onboard as possible and learn from the whole experience,” he tellsThe42.
“I found out [about the call-up] earlier in the week. I got a phone call from the FAI just to let me know.
“I rang the family straight away. Everyone was buzzing — a really proud moment.
This week’s news comes less than three years after a 17-year-old Travers made the life-altering decision to move to England and link up with Bournemouth.
Advertisement
Despite hailing from Kildare, he spent a number of years as a youngster at Dublin side Lucan United. Short stints at Cherry Orchard and Shamrock Rovers U17s followed, helping the former win an All-Ireland title, before the Premier League club came calling.
Leaving behind family and friends was not easy, nonetheless Travers persevered.
“Going the year later at 17 was maybe a bit easier, I was more experienced after being at Shamrock Rovers,” he explains. “Everyone’s in the same boat really, leaving family and friends, but football’s the number one priority, you’ve got to focus on that. Everyone’s only a phone call away, so it’s not too bad and they come over semi-regularly. It’s always tough at the start, but it’s my third year now, so it just keeps getting easier. Football’s the main focus, so that keeps you busy at all times.
“My parents were a big influence. I took the decision to stay in Ireland for the U17 year, that was a big decision, so I could grow and work with a top club in Ireland, Shamrock Rovers.
“There was a few [offers] after the Cherry Orchard year. I just felt personally that maybe I wasn’t ready to take the step yet. I decided to go to Shamrock Rovers for a year. It turned out to be a really good decision for me. It gave me that experience to get ready and prepare myself to come to England.”
Moving to Bournemouth in the summer of 2016 after impressing on trial meant not sitting his Leaving Cert, a decision that Travers acknowledges was a “risk,” but one he hopes to justify ultimately.
“Sometimes, you just have to take the opportunity in football. I finished fifth year in Maynooth Post Primary School. It was a difficult decision — to come to Bournemouth, I couldn’t turn it down. It was a tough one for me and my family, but we decided it was a risk we had to take to come over to England and finish school a bit earlier and go over without a Leaving Cert.
“When I came over here, I did a B Test in the end, so I have some qualifications anyway if it comes to it, which hopefully it won’t.”
Weymouth Football Club/ YouTube
The early signs are certainly promising. Travers hit the headlines as far back as 2017. Making his debut on loan at seventh tier English outfit Weymouth, with the match against Bishop’s Stortford finely balanced at 2-2, the youngster scored a spectacular winner, lobbing the opposition goalkeeper from well inside his own half.
“I just had a go from distance and luckily it went in,” he recalls.

“That was my first senior appearance. To win the game was great but to even score was a different feeling altogether, a great memory.”
And since then, Travers has continued to make encouraging progress.
Last summer, Bournemouth rewarded the Ireland underage international witha new long-term contract.
“You have to work really hard to catch up with the players here and get up to the speed of things,” he says. “But to sign the second contract was massive. It gives you that bit of security to try to do your best. It helps on the field when you know, off the pitch, you’re a bit more secure.”
Currently third-choice goalkeeper at the club behind Asmir Begović and Artur Boruc, while he has yet to appear for the Cherries’ senior side, Travers has trained and travelled to games with the first team and is in regular contact with boss Eddie Howe. A loan move next season is a possibility as the 19-year-old bids to increase his experience of first-team football, though for the moment, he is focused on his commitments for Bournemouth at underage level.
And while barring an injury crisis, Travers won’t play in the upcoming Ireland matches against Georgia and Gibraltar, he is determined to relish an experience he would have scarcely imagined himself in three years ago when he was going to school in Maynooth and trying to balance football with his studies. This week, he will share a dressing room Premier League stars like Seamus Coleman and Shane Duffy and legends of Irish football such as Robbie Keane and McCarthy, who was more than three years into his first stint as Ireland manager in May 1999 – the month Travers was born.
“You’ve got to work really hard to get to this position,” he concludes. “Just don’t let bad situations beat you up. Keep focused on football. Stay dedicated off the pitch as well. When you go back to digs, you have a lot of time on your hands, so doing the right things on and off the pitch is probably the main thing. And just stick to it — sometimes, you’re going to go through bad periods with family as well, being away is not easy, but just keeping the head and staying focused on the football is the main thing.
“There are going to be loads of lows in football and I’m probably going to experience a lot more, but this week is definitely the high point so far.”

Doctors say that due to the way the stats are calculated, this figure could be far greater while opposition TDs have said the HSE and Department of Health need to roll out effective outreach and after care services for homeless people upon leaving hospitals.
No fixed abode
In a parliamentary question, Minister Simon Harris was asked the number of patient discharges from hospitals in which they were discharged to no fixed address, i.e. homeless.
The query was referred to the HSE, which provided details on the numbers of patients discharged for each year from 2011 to 2017 who provided “no fixed abode” as their area of residence. Data for 2018 is not yet confirmed.
The numbers do not definitively indicate the exact number of homeless people who were discharged from hospital, as the numbers could indicate repeat cases.
The numbers rise over time before plateauing and falling again.
Overall, this adds up to 2,266 patient discharges over this seven-year period where the patient listed their address as no fixed abode when leaving hospital.
The figures were released to Sinn Féin’s health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly. She toldTheJournal.iethat health is a significant factor for those who are homeless.
“Health needs have to be addressed in tandem with housing,” she said. “You cannot treat someone’s health needs only to discharge them onto the street, inevitably their problems will recur and escalate because they do not have a roof over their head.”

Pilot scheme
The HSE has already sought to identify the particular challenges facing homeless people when leaving hospital, providing the funding for a pilot project to develop an approach and finalise a protocol that would address the specific needs of such patients.
Dr Clíona Ní Cheallaigh is an infectious diseases and internal medicine physician at St James’s Hospital. This pilot project is being initially rolled out at St James’s and the Mater Hospital in Dublin.
She toldTheJournal.iethat official stats in this area do not paint a full picture.
“It’s much higher than that,” Dr Ní Cheallaigh said. “We’d often have cases where someone who is homeless will give an old address. Or you’ll have people giving the hostel they’re in as an address.”
She said that the HSE funding would go some way to create a coordinated method of providing healthcare tailored towards those who are homeless.
The physician said: “People who are homeless can often be really sick, and being homeless can make their illness worse.
Dr Ní Cheallaigh said the pilot scheme was about ensuring that homeless people requiring healthcare are given it in a dignified manner, and offered the right supports when they exit the healthcare system.
“We’ve a multi-disciplinary team,” she said. “We aim to find the right place to discharge them. We meet with those who run the hostels in Merchants’ Quay, and the doctors and nurses they interact with. It’s about everybody talking to each other to try to get the best results we can.”
The physician said such a coordinated response is needed due to the complex and complicated needs that this portion of the population has.
When a person presents in an emergency department who is homeless, the scheme will see them referred to this team where they can put the correct supports in place.
They also provide items such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, shaving cream and razors so that people have the chance to bathe.
“It’s all about treating people they way they should be,” Ní Cheallaigh added. “People may feel ashamed that they are homeless. They may feel ashamed over an addiction, or over abuse they’ve previously suffered.

https://www.thejournal.ie/free-contraception-ireland-2-4522530-Mar2019/,"A WORKING GROUP is to be established to examine removing cost barriers to accessing contraception, Minister for Health Simon Harris has announced.
The group will examine the extent to which cost is a barrier to accessing reliable methods of contraception in Ireland.
It will also look at whether there are other factors influencing ease of access to contraception which could be addressed.
Some of the areas the group will look at include financial barriers, legislative barriers, regulatory issues, and contractual issues.
It will make recommendations to the Minister.
The access to free contraceptionwas a recommendationmade by the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, and something that Simon Harris said he was hoping to introduce this year.
Initial work within the department found that rolling out free contraception would involve changes to legislation.
Harris toldTheJournal.ielast September that he was aiming to give all women access to free contraception in 2019.

In a statement announcing the working group, Harris said: “One of the key recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on the Eighth Amendment was to improve access to contraception. We have taken a number of steps in increasing access to condoms this year.
“Now, I want to ensure that we complete the next big body of work in this area. This work will take a number of months to complete, but it will deliver a clear pathway forward.
“The benefits are clear. This will help reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and promotes good sexual health. I look forward to the outcome of this work later this year.”
Current situation
Currently, women who have a medical card can access contraception for free. However, those that do not often have to pay for an initial doctor’s consultation as well as a repeat appointment every six months or so in order to get their prescription renewed.
Women also have to pay for the pill every month or for their chosen contraceptive device, such as the implant or the coil.
TheJournal.ierevealed in Januarythat the minister has been lobbied by a pharmaceutical company and the pharmacy union in recent months, as plans for the promised rollout of free contraception for all women moves closer.
The Minister will update his Cabinet colleagues on this work later in the week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-washington-dc-4540633-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reports from Washington DC
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that in the “uncertain” time of Brexit, support from the United States is needed “more so than ever”.
All eyes were on Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett, as they attended the Irish Funds dinner in Washington DC last night.
With Brexit tensions at their height, some of the key players were all in the same room – Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and the DUP leader Arlene Foster, both seated on separate tables, but noteworthy that Foster switched seats later in the evening to sit next to the Taoiseach.
Yesterday the House of Commons voted against a no-deal Brexit with 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time.
After a chaotic evening in Westminster, 278 voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
Tomorrow, a vote on extending Article 50 and pushing Brexit out a few months will take place.

Speaking to the crowd of Irish-Americans last night, Varadkar said Brexit is sixteen days away, “we need our friends here in the US more so than ever”.
Earlier in the day, he said the appointment by the US of  a Northern Ireland special envoy would be welcomed, stating that it has proved beneficial in the past.
At the dinner, he said that while some had made the decision to leave the EU, Ireland was steadfast in its belief that it can be the centre of Europe, stating that the Irish government is determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement and “everything the flows from it”.
Applause
There was a round of applause from the audience, when he said Ireland will remain a committed member of the EU and guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.
The second applause came when Varadkar mentioned planned legislation which will require companies to disclose gender pay gaps.

The theme of the dinner this year was honouring visionary women.
Earlier in the day, Varadkar warned that the possibility of UK crashing out of EU is “growing”.
Supports
Speaking ahead of his meeting with US Donald Trump today, Varadkar had one message for the Irish public and Irish businesses – “the Irish government has your back”.
Varadkar said he understands that a lot of people in “Ireland must be very worried and must be very concerned today, but what I want to say to our exporters and our business people today, our farmers, out fishermen, the government has your back and we have put in place a package of measures to support incomes, to support and assist business, to restructure and reorientate to new markets”.
The package of support measures will go before Cabinet next week, he stated.
“We are well placed to deal with any shock that might arise from no deal. The fact we have a budget surplus means we can borrow if we need to support our economy, the NTMA has cash on hand should there be any disturbance in the markets, the banks are well capitalised,” said Varadkar.
There will be damage limitation, he added, stating that the government “will protect incomes, we will protect jobs and we will support businesses to overcome whatever happens in the next couple of weeks”.
US-EU trade deal
Speaking about trade with the US, the Taoiseach said he would like to see renewed engagement around a US-EU trade deal, before the US strikes one with the UK.
He said this could prove difficult due to the sensitivities surrounding agriculture, but he said it would be beneficial for both sides to talk.
To the broader public, the Taoiseach gave reassurances yesterday that “the Common Travel Area and all that comes with it, free movement between Britain and Ireland, north south will continue, that has already been agreed, and also the country is well prepared for a no-deal”.
Unlike other countries, Ireland has a budget surplus, he explained, stating that the country can borrow “if we have to”.
Addressing a room full of American and Irish business people today, Varadkar said the US investment to Ireland “really transformed” the country, adding that it would not be as prosperous as it is today without that investment.
He urged businesses to continue to invest in Ireland, and in the light of Brexit, added that it is Ireland’s position that it will always be at the “heart of Europe”. Varadkar told the businesspeople today that maintaining peace on the island of Ireland is the key priority.

A Dublin City Council month meeting last nightwas informedof over 270 hectares within the M50 which are potential “new growth areas”. These lands are currently zoned for industrial use.
These lands are located in the following areas:
City planner John O’Hara said the plans were the start of a process that could provide 17,000 to 20,000 homes in 10 to 20 years time,RTÉ reported.
The report delivered at the meeting last night noted that there will be implications to the rezoning of this land and that further planning will need to occur.

“These lands are significant in scale, and a change to their use cannot be piecemeal. For these sites, the scale of the lands involved means that any change would need to be addressed within a more detailed planning framework,” the report said.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie,Sinn Féin councillor Daithí Doolan, chairman of the council’s Housing Strategic Policy Committee, said these plans have been in the pipeline since 2004 and that they are “long overdue” but that he doesn’t think progress will happen “overnight”.
“It’s long overdue, it’s very, very welcome. It should be positive if we do it the right way,” Doolan said.
He said that “we don’t want to give a blank check to private developers” to develop areas “that don’t meet the needs of local communities”.
Doolan said that the council needs to make sure the lands provide sustainable and affordable housing. He also said that community and recreational facilities need to be made available in the areas.
Similar to Doolan’s comments, the report noted: “Changes for such large sites need to be framed around the development plan policies of place-making, creating/expanding amenities, examination of community needs, including schools provision; movement and connectivity and providing a good range of local services and ensuring quality employment locations proximate to where people live.”","10.28am, 5 Mar 2019",

AID WORKERS ARE racing to help survivors and meet spiralling humanitarian needs in three southern African countries battered by the region’s worst storm in years.
Since tropical cyclone Idai cut a swathe through Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last week, the confirmed death toll stood at more than 300 and hundreds of thousands of lives were at risk, officials said.
Mozambique, where the monster storm made landfall early last Friday, is reeling.
“We’ve thousands of people… in roofs and trees waiting for rescue,” Caroline Haga, spokeswoman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said.
“We are running out of time. People have been waiting for rescue for more than three days now,” she told AFP in the storm-ravaged coastal city of Beira.
She added: “Unfortunately, we can’t pick up all the people, so our priority are children, pregnant women, injured people.”
Survivor Aunicia Jose, 24, speaking in the district of Buzi near Beira, said, “The situation is very bad, we haven’t eaten since Thursday, until today.
“We are sleeping outside, everything is destroyed, our houses are destroyed, everything is gone, we have recovered nothing.”
World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Deborah Nguyen told AFP in Beira that “the priority today is to rush to rescue people trapped in the flooded areas” as much as organising temporary shelter for those rescued.
“The situation has not really improved. In Buzi, the villages are still under water but the good news is that there are many rescue teams working all day long.
“Relief operations are progressing, but there is still a lot of work.”
The UN said it was “one of the worst natural disasters in southern Africa”, and launched an international appeal for relief funds, having earlier said it was aiming to help some 600,000 people in coming weeks.

“We do not yet know enough about the level of destruction to give an accurate estimate of the amount of this call for funds, but it will be important,” spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said on Tuesday that 202 people had died, according to the latest toll, and nearly 350,000 people were at risk.
In Zimbabwe, the death toll stood at 100 yesterday  but was expected to surge to 300, while up to 15,000 people are estimated to have been hit by the storm.

In Malawi, nearly a million people have been affected and more than 80,000 forced from their homes, according to the UN.
Flood shock
Aid agencies said they were prepared for the cyclone which made landfall early last Friday, but not for the massive floods that followed.
Mozambique bore the brunt from rivers that flow downstream from its neighbours.
Beira airport which was partially damaged by the storm and temporarily shut, had re-opened to become the relief operations hub but is proving not large enough.
Air force personnel from Mozambique and South Africa have been drafted in to fly rescue missions and distribute aid which can only be airlifted as roads out of Beira have been destroyed.

A government worker who asked not be identified spoke from a roadside after he was rescued by boat in Nhamatanda, some 60 kilometres northwest of Beira, saying “this is the first time our generation has seen something like this”.
Climate expert John Mutter, a professor at the Earth Institute at New York’s Columbia University, said the heavy toll was partly explained by the infrequency of such weather events in southern Africa.
“Mozambique and Zimbabwe are essentially unprepared. They both have weak governance that, honestly, focuses on many more pressing things (as they would see it). And because cyclones are so rare in this part of the world, so preparedness is minimal,” Mutter told AFP.
‘Entire village washed away’
In Zimbabwe, at least 217 people are listed as missing in Chimanimani in Manicaland, an eastern province which borders Mozambique.
The district remains cut off after roads were swallowed by massive sinkholes and bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods – a landscape that Defence Minister Perrance Shiri said “resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war”.
Families were using hoes to dig through mounds of soil in search of their missing relatives, an AFP correspondent saw.
After visiting some of the victims in Chimanimani, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said “a tragedy has visited us”.
“The last place we visited, where three main rivers merge, an entire village was washed away. I think those are the bodies which are now being found in Mozambique,” he said.
The three countries are some of the poorest in the region and depend heavily on foreign aid.

https://www.thejournal.ie/student-freak-accident-limerick-4525911-Mar2019/,"A YOUNG GALWAY woman died in a “freak” fall from a stairs while attending a house party two years ago, her inquest heard.
Sophie Coll, 19, from Barna, a second-year student attending at University of Limerick, was ascending the stairwell with three friends when one of them slipped, resulting in the group falling backwards like “dominos”.
Sophie was the only one who was injured, and suffered a fatal skull fracture when her head hit impacted on a tiled floor, Limerick Coroner’s Court heard.
The accident occurred at a house at Stanford Close, located near the University of Limerick on 25 September 2017.
Sophie and her friends, Zoe Patterson and Keely McGrath, had earlier attended a birthday party in another house.
Patterson and McGrath, who attended the inquest with Sophie’s father Rory Coll, stated in their depositions they had consumed a few cans of beer on the night but they were not inebriated.
Sophie had also consumed some beer and had also possibly consumed some vodka on the night, it was heard.
At the house party the three girls met another friend Darragh Hannify, a fellow business student from Clarenbridge, Co Galway.
The inquest heard Hannify was leading the four friends up the stairs when he suddenly lost his footing and fell backwards.
Hannify, who was not present at the inquest, told Gardaí he consumed “about two cans” and some vodka on the night.
“I was halfway up the stairs, I grabbed the bannister, I bumped into it. I kind of slipped back, I know I bumped into someone, I think it was Zoe,” he stated in his deposition.
Hannify said a crowd then gathered around Sophie and that someone called for an ambulance.
Zoe Patterson, from Glanmire, Co Cork, told gardaí that Hannify “appeared to lose his balance” before stumbling on the stairs.
She said they all fell back “like dominos” but that she managed to stabilise herself by grabbing hold of the bannister.
“In a split second Sophie flew past me backwards before hitting tiles on the hallway floor,” she stated in her deposition.

Keely McGrath, from Glenbrook, Lyne, Aherlow, Co Tipperary, stated that Hannify “kind of wobbled back and pushed back on us like dominos” as the group went upstairs.
“I heard a smack on the ground and I knew Sophie had fallen… When Darragh stumbled it was completely accidental,” she added.
An ambulance, which was dispatched from Nenagh, Co Tipperary, reached the house within forty minutes after receiving the emergency call.
Pathologist Dr Gabor Laskai said in his opinion, that due to Sophie’s “very severe” injuries, nothing could have been done to save her.
Advanced paramedic Dan New, stated in his deposition that he and a colleague spent 20 minutes administering emergency first aid to Sophie after they arrived at the house.
A neck collar was also applied and her body was supported in a “vacuum mattress”.
He stated that Sophie was “completely unresponsive” when she was transferred by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick, where she was pronounced dead the following evening.
Sophie’s parents had been traveling in France at the time of their daughter’s fatal fall.
Her injuries were “not compatible with life” despite further attempts by doctors to resuscitate her and her family agreed to donate her organs to help give life to others, it was heard.
A post-mortem found that Sophie had suffered “extensive brain damage”.
Limerick Coroner, Dr John McNamara described the evidence as “extremely harrowing”.
Dr McNamara said the four friends had fallen into one another like a “domino effect”.
“It’s very tragic. Sophie was a young lady with her whole life ahead of her,” he added.
Returning a verdict of accidental death, due to a severe skull fracture, he expressed his sympathies to Sophie’s loved ones and friends.
Rory Coll thanked paramedics, hospital staff and the Gardaí.
Speaking afterwards Mr Coll said his family had organised Sophie’s Ball, a fundraising ball set up in memory of Sophie, with proceeds going to the Anam Cara, a support group for parents following bereavement; the Organ Donor Garden, Salthill; and Coláiste Iognaid (The Jes), Sea Road, Galway, where his Sophie had attended.

https://www.the42.ie/ireland-team-france-six-nations-talking-points-4530027-Mar2019/,"JOE SCHMIDT HAS this afternoon named his Ireland team for the penultimate round of Six Nations action, as France visit the Aviva Stadium this Sunday [KO3pm, Virgin Media 1].
Schmidt’s selection is availablehere, while below we take a closer look at some of the main talking points from today’s team announcement.
Big guns recalled to boost Ireland
James Ryan is back in Schmidt's starting XV.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
As expected, Schmidt has restored a host of his first-choice starters for the round four rendezvous with France in Dublin, the Ireland head coach making seven changes in all from the victory over Italy last time out.
Six of those alterations come in the pack as the likes of captain Rory Best, Cian Healy and James Ryan all return to action after being rotated out in round three, while the return to fitness of Iain Henderson and CJ Stander is a major fillip.
Ireland’s lineout malfunctioned in Rome — Sean Cronin appears to have paid the price for that under-performance — and the renewal of Henderson and Ryan’s second row partnership for the first time since the win over Argentina last Autumn should provide a firmer set-piece platform against the French.
Stander is back ahead of schedule after showing his remarkable powers of recovery again in shaking off a fractured cheekbone and eye socket to start at the back of the scrum, taking the place of Leinster’s Jack Conan.
There’s a settled look to the backline but the presence of Ringrose in midfield alongside the ever-present Bundee Aki is a boost, given the Leinster man’s playmaking ability, magical dancing feet and excellent game-management, which will all add to Ireland’s attack.
Advertisement
The 24-year-old, who will win his 19th international cap, also brings huge defensive nous to the Ireland backline, and in the continuing absence of Robbie Henshaw, Ringrose’s return after missing the wins over Scotland and Italy is most welcome.
After rotation in Rome, this is very much Schmidt’s strongest hand, his selection no doubt made with the acute need for a much-improved performance and a strong finish to this championship firmly at the front of his mind.
In JVDF Joe trusts
JVDF starts ahead of Sean O'Brien.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
It’s hard to remember the last time a fully fit Sean O’Brien was completely omitted from an Ireland matchday 23, but the Leinster flanker — who will move to London Irish after the World Cup — has fallen out of Schmidt’s plans this week.
Not only has his Leinster team-mate Josh van der Flier been handed the seven jersey, but there is no place for O’Brien among the replacements, with Schmidt opting for Conan as the back row cover.
O’Brien was not in Belfast last Friday for Ireland’s open session at Queen’s University and Schmidt revealed afterwards that he had returned to his province as part of an overall decision to manage his workload. Easy to say in hindsight, but the writing was on the wall then.
The 32-year-old came off the bench against England on the opening weekend and then made starting appearances against Scotland and Italy, but was not at his best in either game, his place going to van der Flier this time around.
Regardless, it is a big call from Schmidt, particularly when leaving O’Brien out of the 23 completely given the Tullow man’s versatility and leadership off the bench, not to mention the power and ballast he can add to the contest later in the piece.
For van der Flier, it’s another huge show of trust in his capacity for the big games, having starred in the victory over the All Blacks, while starting against England on the opening weekend. The Leinster openside wins his 17th cap alongside Peter O’Mahony and Stander.

Bench options

There were a number of interesting calls on the bench, but Schmidt has largely rewarded those who have impressed in previous rounds, notably Dave Kilcoyne, Ultan Dillane and, to an extent, John Cooney.
Kilcoyne again holds off Jack McGrath to provide cover for Healy, John Ryan is seemingly ahead of Andrew Porter in the tighthead pecking order under Tadhg Furlong and with Cronin out of the picture, Niall Scannell is the reserve hooker.
Although Tadhg Beirne was back in the mix after making a strong injury comeback for Munster, Dillane is retained in the matchday squad, a selection the Connacht second row is more than deserving of given his tireless shift at the Stadio Olimpico. Quinn Roux drops out.
Conan, as mentioned, is selected ahead of O’Brien and Jordi Murphy while John Cooney holds off the challenge of the fit-again Kieran Marmion to be named as the replacement scrum-half, the Ulster nine set to win his eighth cap.
With Joey Carbery ruled out again with a hamstring injury, Jack Carty could win his second cap off the bench, with Jordan Larmour shaking off a finger injury to return to the number 23 jersey ahead of Andrew Conway.

https://www.thejournal.ie/homeless-families-emergency-accommodation-4531265-Mar2019/,"NEW FIGURES SHOW that 144 families had been living in temporary emergency accommodation for over two years as of the end of 2018.
A total of 1,233 families were residing in emergency accommodation facilities on 31 December 2018. Of these, almost one quarter had been living in emergency accommodation for at least a year and a half.
The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) carried out the research by doing a count of families staying in temporary emergency accommodation on 31 December and asked the families how long they had been there.
Emergency accommodation options for those facing homelessness include hostels, B&Bs, hotels, shelters and family hubs.
Family hubs, which have cooking and laundry facilities and play areas for children, are specifically designed with the goal of families not staying in them for longer than six months.
They are subject to service level agreements between local authorities and service providers, and the Department of Housing toldTheJournal.iethat these contracts “require that families accessing the hubs are supported to exit to an independent tenancy within a six month period”.
Commenting on the scale of the problem, Focus Ireland director of advocacy Mike Allen said that “over 500 of the families in commercial hotels do not even have a designated case manager to assist them to deal with the problems they face and support them to move out”.
“So it is not surprising that many of them get stuck,” said Allen.
Independent Dublin City councillor John Lyons, who requested the figures from Dublin City Council, said that the numbers are “pretty frightening”.
He said more and more people are being “squeezed out” of the private rental sector due to increases in rent.
“A whole generation has been locked out of ever entering affordable, high-quality accommodation,” he said. “So, I would say that the State has to use the public land in its ownership to build both public and affordable housing.”
“The State policy with regard to housing is wholly dependent on the private sector, and that’s just not feasible.”
Family hubs
Lyons had also requested information on the length of stay of families living specifically in family hub homeless accommodation from the Dublin City Council Chief Executive. This information was not provided.
There are currently more than 368 families living in family hub homeless accommodation, Chief Executive Owen Keegan told Lyons. Keegan did not elaborate on the length of stay of the families as this “would require a record by record search”.

“Some of us raised this when the family hub came up as a proposed solution – how were families going to progress out of this accommodation?” said Lyons. “Where was the exit strategy? Unfortunately, the only exit strategy that they offered then and they’ve entrenched now is the HAP (Housing Assistance Payment) scheme.”
Lyons said this is why families are stuck for so long in this accommodation – “because they’ve nowhere to go”.
AMaynooth University reportpublished in 2017 showed that family hubs “restrict the capacity to live normal lives and have devastating impacts on family, adult and child wellbeing”.
“The primary response to growing homelessness in Ireland has been to build more and more emergency shelters and family hubs,” said Mike Allen.
“Evidence from throughout the world shows that a shelter based approach to homelessness results in people being trapped in emergency accommodation for longer and longer periods, with all the consequent damage which long-stays in institutional accommodation is known to cause.”
Lyons is concerned that emergency accommodation facilities such as family hubs are being the new normal. “Of course, any accommodation that’s either newly built or recently refurbished is better than a B&B,” said Lyons. “But you’re talking about a pretty desperate place.”
Family
Reasons why families “get stuck” in emergency accommodation are complex, said Allen.
“Larger families, Traveller families and families with very young parents appear to be at higher risk of being stuck in homelessness.”
The DRHE count found that 220 families had been in emergency accommodation for between a year and 18 months and 290 families had been living in the facilities between six and 12 months.
483 families had been there for less than six months.
Separately, there were a total of 1,736 individual adults living in emergency accommodation on 31 December. 187 of these people had spent over two years in emergency accommodation. 627 had spent less than six months in the accommodation facilities.
Allen said that many families are too far down the list for social housing and are further discriminated against by private landlords when seeking HAP tenancies.
“Both routes out are blocked.”
He said Dublin City Council has resisted “effective” strategies such as ensuring a stream of social housing allocations for families who would otherwise be trapped. Allen said the council would fear families deliberately making themselves homeless in order to access the help.
He said there is “no evidence that well designed programmes to help the most vulnerable generate significant levels of such behaviour”.

JUST IN: North Korea may be preparing to launch a missile or space rocket, based on satellite images shared exclusively with NPR.https://t.co/OllSw7ZYHf
NORTH KOREA MAY be preparing for a missile or space launch, US news outlet NPR has reported, based on satellite image analysis of a key facility near Pyongyang.
NPR said the images of Sanumdong, one of the facilities Pyongyang has used to produce inter-continental ballistic missiles and space rockets, were taken days before US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met in Hanoi for their high-stakes summit, which ended in failure.
The photos by the firm DigitalGlobe show the presence of cars and trucks at the site on 22 February, said NPR – which hasexclusive access to the imagery.
It added that rail cars and cranes can also be seen at a yard.
“When you put all that together, that’s really what it looks like when the North Koreans are in the process of building a rocket,” Jeffrey Lewis, a researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, was quoted as saying by NPR yesterday.

The Sanumdong analysis comes days after the specialised website 38 North and the Center for Strategic and International Studies said Pyongyang may have resumed operations at its long-range rocket launch site at Sohae, based on their study of satellite imagery from 6 March.
The development is likely to further compound Washington’s frustration over the lack of progress in its bid to get the North to give up its atomic arsenal, especially after the 27-28 February summit between Trump and Kim collapsed without so much as a joint statement – let alone an agreement on nuclear disarmament.
According to senior US officials, in the week leading up to the Hanoi summit, the North Koreans had demanded the lifting of effectively all UN Security Council economic sanctions imposed on Pyongyang since March 2016.
In return, Pyongyang offered only to close part of the Yongbyon complex, a sprawling site covering multiple facilities. The North is also believed to have other uranium enrichment plants.
But North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho disputed the US account, saying Pyongyang offered to dismantle all “nuclear production facilities in the Yongbyon area” in exchange for partial sanctions relief.
Trump said yesterday that his relationship with Kim “remains good”, despite the setback in Hanoi.
US officials have said Washington believes the “final, fully verified denuclearisation” of North Korea is still possible by the end of Trump’s first term.
Kim released his first public message since the Hanoi summit today earlier this week, instructing propaganda officials to conduct “positive information” activities to spur scientific and technological development, according to a morning report by North Korean state media outlet KCNA.

The incident happened on the N72 at Ballymaquirke Cross – around five kilometres south of Kanturk.
Gardai and emergency services are at the scene and road is currently closed. The condition of the men is unknown however eye witnesses reported that both men were talking when help reached them.
AA Roadwatch said: “The N72 is closed south of Kanturk between Mallow and Killarney at Ballmaquirke Cross following a serious collision. Gardai and emergency services are at the scene. Take an alternative route.”
Local TD Sean Sherlock has repeatedly called for upgrades to the road and said last year that it is “a tragedy waiting to happen”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passport-applications-2-4546305-Mar2019/,"MORE THAN 230,000 applications for Irish passports have been made to date in 2019.
This marks a 30% increase compared to the same period last year.
There were more than 860,000 Irish passports issued in 2018 – the highest number ever issued in one year.
The Passport Office said there are a number of reasons for this increase in demand, including a tendency towards early renewal and an increase in the number of Irish people travelling.
Over 70% of all passport applications last year came from the island of Ireland.

Brexit is also playing a role, as British citizens are unsure of how leaving the EU may impact future travel plans.
One in five(22%) of all passport application in 2018 were made by people from Northern Ireland and the UK.
To meet the increased demand, the online passport renewal service was expanded in late 2018 to allow both children and adults to renew online. Seven in 10 applications are now made online.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney urged people to check that their passports are in date in advance of planning a holiday.
Coveney said “significant extra resources” have been given to the Passport Office to meet the increased demand, including hundreds of extra employees for processing and customer service.
During St Patrick’s weekend in 2018, over 2,500 people applied using the online service. This figure is expected to be double that number this year.

THE PENTAGON TODAY announced a new policy that will bar enlistment of new recruits who have undergone a gender transition or intend to do so, and require most individuals to serve in their birth sex.
Under President Donald Trump’s new rules, set to go into effect on 12 April after the Supreme Court allowed them to go forward, only transgender troops serving in their birth gender will be able to stay in the military after that date, and they will be barred from taking hormones or getting transition surgery.
The move was a reversal from a policy enacted under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, who allowed military recruits to serve in their preferred sex rather than just the one they were assigned at birth.
The latest action was swiftly condemned by Democrats and civil rights advocates.
“The Trump administration is determined to bring back ‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’ a policy that forced service members to choose between serving their country and telling the truth about who they were,” said Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Centre, an independent research institute.
Trump had announced the new ban by tweet in July 2017, pointing to the “tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail”.

After a flurry of legal battles, the Pentagon’s policy is not a complete ban. Transgender troops have until next month’s deadline to receive hormonal treatment or surgery, and service members who have already joined the military in their preferred gender will be able to continue to serve in that gender.
After 12 April, however, no one who has transitioned to another gender or been diagnosed with “gender dysphoria” will be able to enlist — and currently enlisted troops will thereafter have to serve in their birth gender and renounce transition treatment.
Around 9,000 people who self-identify as transgender individuals currently serve in the armed forces, out of 1.3 million in the active duty troops population, a Pentagon official said on condition of anonymity.
Around 1,000 say they have transitioned to another gender or would like to do so.
“Persons with a history of gender dysphoria — a serious medical condition — and who have undergone certain medical treatment for gender dysphoria, such as cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery, or are unwilling or unable to meet the standards associated with their biological sex, could adversely impact unit readiness and combat effectiveness,” a Pentagon statement read.
“For this reason, such persons are presumptively disqualified for service without a waiver.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-we-are-the-new-face-of-homelessness-in-our-50s-and-working-4539758-Mar2019/,"MENTION HOMELESSNESS AND most people in Irish society will picture those people who are tragically affected by drug misuse.
But homelessness in Ireland has many faces now and come this June I could be one of them.
I am 57 years old, born and reared in Dublin. I started working when I was 15.  In the late 1990s, I was proud when I started my own little business.
But a cancer diagnosis and intensive chemotherapy put an end to that.
I subsequently had a second cancer diagnosis but thankfully I was one of the lucky ones and I recovered to full health mentally and physically.
I had bought a home back in the early 1990s with my then partner. Sadly eighteen years on we parted ways and sold the house.
Unfortunately for us, the timing was wrong and we both found ourselves struggling to get back into the market.
I had a deposit and I tried to get a mortgage but as a single woman, I could only get approved for up to €100,000. Obviously, that wasn’t enough to buy any property in the Dublin area.
It was so frustrating and unfair because I was paying €1000 a month rent and had never once missed a payment. Most of my friends who were in couples had lower monthly mortgage repayments than my rent payment – and they had two incomes.
I was frustrated but with no other option, I just put my head down, worked hard and continued to rent.
As landlords sell-up,  I move on but each time the rent increases.
I am blessed that for the past four years I have stayed put and that my landlord was decent and left the rent at €1400. I also met my partner who can now share some of the financial burdens.
For the past ten years, I worked as a senior manager in a job I loved-until I was assaulted in my workplace. It was a sexual assault that resulted in a court conviction.
The stress of that incident along with being overstretched in work took its toll. I became totally burnt out and had to leave my job.
Now our landlord is selling the place we are living in and has issued us with a notice of termination.
We have been blessed to have stayed this long but the timing for us is a nightmare.
I am currently working on setting up my new business venture in staff training while my partner has moved here from Scotland and is also developing his own business.
I still have some small savings but I have realised they are actually a burden on me as they exclude me from claiming social housing supports.
Advertisement
If I didn’t have savings it would be better. If I hadn’t had cancer, it would be better. If we were ten years younger, it would be better. If I hadn’t been attacked at work. If I hadn’t bought and sold a house previously. IF, IF, IF.
Because we are not in full-time employment we also don’t look good to landlords.
Every place we look for help one or more of these issues excludes us from getting it.
In desperation, we even considered spending the last of our savings on a log cabin to put in my elderly folks’ back garden.
Exploring this gave us some flicker of hope.  Living in 6 x 8 metre, one-bedroom unit didn’t faze us at all.
We were excited at the prospect of being rent-free for a few years, the possibilities to save a few bob and be relieved of the constant worry of receiving another notice of termination and once again having to leave our home.
But would we get planning permission for such a structure?
Unfortunately, last week  Dublin City councillorsrejected a proposalthat they should relax regulations on log cabins as habitation, in light of the housing crisis.
Regulations could ensure that they are fire treated, that a family member is in residence and that the home is kept in good condition and built with consideration to neighbours.
The decision by councillors has been a major set back for those of us who are desperately trying to avoid becoming the new face of homelessness.
There are lots of victims of the housing crisis who don’t show up in the homeless figures.
Adults living with their parents, renters who struggle to afford the shameful high rents landlords demand.
Then there are those who are forced to emigrate to find another city where they can afford to both rent and save for a home.
Many of my own relatives have had to leave to make lives elsewhere, even with both partners in a couple working, they couldn’t afford to live and pay rent in Dublin.
I feel ashamed and embarrassed by my situation as I feel that I am a burden on my family and friends.
My doctor says that  I need to “eliminate stress from my life”. Wouldn’t it be heaven if she could write a prescription for a house?
It would definitely have an impact on my high blood pressure and ease my stress levels.
But for the moment it seems all I can do is dream and pray for my forever home.

A 172-YEAR-OLD Dublin chemist which featured in James Joyce’s novel Ulysses has begun fundraising to help pay for its rent after it was significantly increased.
Sweny’s Pharmacy, located at 1 Lincoln Place in Dublin 2, first opened in 1847. Its interior has been unchanged since.
Since 2009, Sweny’s has been entirely maintained by volunteers who give their time for free, dedicated to preserving the soul of the shop as it was in Joyce’s time.
Every day, the volunteers host open readings from Joyce’s work in the building.
They also inform visitors about the history of the shop and of Dublin, and sell the same lemon soap which Leopold Bloom buys in Ulysses.

Up until last year, the chemist was able to pay the rent out of soap sales and visitors’ donations.
However, Sweny’s has said the rent was doubled last July, meaning that it increased by approximately €1,500 per month.
In order to be able to keep up with the increased rent, the pharmacy has set up aPatreonaccount to raise money.

“We made many friendships in the past 10 years.”
PJ added that the shop gets a lot of international media attention, which helps attract visitors. He said that just before his chat withTheJournal.ie, two young German students who had seen Sweny’s Pharmacy in German media had visited store.

Although the House of Commons hasn’t voted for anything specific, they have decided that the UK needs more time to ask how it wants to exit the bloc.
The decision gives May yet another reason to hold a vote on her Brexit withdrawal deal, with 413 parliamentarians voting in favour of delaying Brexit, with 202 voting against.
It was the first victory of the week for the embattled Prime Minister, and showed she has a small grasp on the increasingly rebellious Conservative Party.
Among those who opposed the Prime Minister’s extension were Cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (who, bizarrely, had argued in favour of the motion in the debate earlier today).
The government’s chief whip Julian Smith abstained from the vote.

Former ministers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab (an ex-Brexit Secretary) also voted against the extension, but the original Brexit secretary, David Davis, voted to back May’s motion and delay Brexit.
It’s now up to the EU to agree to grant an extension, and it needs the agreement of all EU Council members – ie the leaders of remaining 27 EU countries – to sign off

THE TOP POLICE chief in Paris has been fired following another weekend of rioting in the capital during “yellow vest” protests.
About 5,000 police were deployed in the capital on Saturday, far outnumbering the several hundred rioters who caused havoc for more than seven hours on the famed Champs-Elysees.
This led to French President Emmanuel Macron cutting short his skiing holiday to meet top ministers to discuss the 18th consecutive Saturday of “yellow vest” demonstrations.
“The events of last Saturday, in particular on the Champs-Elysees, were unacceptable and the president asked the government to provide a response that was up to the needs of the situation,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement.
He criticised “inappropriate” instructions on the use of rubber bullets given to security forces.

Philippe also announced that the head of Paris police, Michel Delpuech (66), had been fired and that he would be replaced on Wednesday.
He added that French authorities would ban demonstrations on the Champs-Elysees and other areas of the country if hooligans were detected there.He also said fines would be increased from €38 to €135 for people attending unauthorised protests.
More than 100 businesses were damaged at the weekend in Paris, including dozens of luxury shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees.

Reacting to Saturday’s events, Macron tweeted: “There are people today who try by all means… to damage the Republic by breaking, by destroying things at the risk of killing someone.”
He said that “all those who were there were complicit in” the havoc spread across the Champs-Elysees.

Numbers down
Since the end of December, the number of “yellow vest” protesters has fallen.
However, every Saturday thousands would still take to the streets, including far-right and far-left groups as well as anarchists who are responsible for much of the violence.
Some have called for French police to be far more active in tackling the protestors.
“You have to take responsibility and engage, with the possibility that people will get hurt,” a member of the Alliance police union said.

Although some protesters have been injured by the rubber bullets, so far nobody has been killed in clashes with police. Officials, however, say the risk would increase if officers charged the hostile crowds.
‘Less reactive’
Critics have said that after more than three months of weekly protests, the government now needed to drastically rethink its approach for stamping out the rioting.
Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez admitted on RTL radio today that police “were less aggressive, less reactive than usual” over the weekend, promising a review of the instructions given to officers and their deployment.
While seen as too lax on Saturday, French authorities have been accused on other weekends of being too heavy-handed, highlighting the difficulty of managing the crisis for the government.

The UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet called for a “full investigation” into the possible use of excessive force by French police during the protests in an address earlier this month.
Since the demonstrations began on 17 November, some 1,900 people have been hurt, including dozens who have suffered serious injuries from stun grenades or rubber bullets fired by police.

Last year’s cost
The government spent more than €260,000 to send Ministers abroad on trade missions for St Patrick’s Day last year, figures seen byTheJournal.ierevealed on Saturday.
A breakdown of these figures can be read here:
The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show that at least €267,000 was spent on trips abroad as part of the ‘Promote Ireland’ programme last year.
Last year,there was an increase in travel due to the government’s strategy to highlight its preparedness for Brexit.
Members of the Cabinet and almost 50 civil servants visited more than 40 countries in an effort to promote Ireland’s political and economic interests abroad.
Those who travelled included the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers and Ministers of State, as well as the Chief Whip, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and the Attorney General.
More than €190,000 was spent on flights, with tens of thousands also spent on hotel accommodation and thousands more on gifts for dignitaries – including €350 on a customary bowl of shamrock for the US President.

https://www.thejournal.ie/men-found-liable-for-omagh-bombing-adjudicated-bankrupt-4534871-Mar2019/,"THE HIGH COURT has adjudicated three men found liable for the Omagh bombing bankrupt.
Justice Teresa Pilkington said she was satisfied to make bankruptcy orders in respect of Michael McKevitt, who the court heard is terminally ill, Colm Michael Murphy and Liam Campbell.
The bankruptcy applications were brought by lawyers acting for relatives of those killed in the bombing, carried out by the Real IRA.
In 2009, the Belfast High Court ruled that McKevitt, Campbell, Michael Colm Murphy and another man Seamus Daly were all liable for the bombing, and ordered them to pay £1.6m damages to 12 relatives of the bombing.
That decision was upheld on appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.
The 1998 attack was the single biggest atrocity of the Troubles, claiming 29 lives, including nine children and a woman pregnant with twins. All of the defendants denied having any involvement in the bombing.
Arising out of the failure to pay the damages the relatives, represented by John O’Donnell SC, Andrew Robinson Bl instructed by solicitor Gary Daly brought proceedings before the High Court in Dublin seeking to have the three adjudicated bankrupt.The court heard that demands had been made on each of the three men to each pay some €439,000, which they had failed to do.
When the matter returned before the High Court today, Campbell of Upper Faughart, Dundalk and Murphy of Lower Faughart, Dundalk, Co Louth and McKevitt from Blackrock in Co Louth did not appear in court.
A barrister told the court that he appeared for McKevitt, who he said it was difficult to get instructions from because his client has terminal cancer.

The lawyer also said he acted for Murphy, but did not have firm instructions in regards to the bankruptcy application.
O’Donnell told the court that all three should be adjudicated as bankrupts.
The application, counsel said, had been going on for some time, and all three individuals had been served with documents in the case.
Counsel said there had been correspondence last month from Liam Campbell, where he was seeking to obtain legal aid in regards the bankruptcy application.
Counsel said that no adjournment should be granted in Liam Campbell’s case.
Counsel added that Michael McKevitt had written to his client in October 2015.
In that correspondence McKevitt, who repeated his denial of having anything to do with the bombing, said he had no assets, was suffering from terminal cancer, and the only source of income is the State pension.
Counsel said that again there was no good reason advanced as to why McKevitt or any of the others respondents should not be adjudicated as bankrupts.
In her ruling, Justice Pilkington said she was satisfied to adjudicate all three as bankrupts.
The Judge said all the required criteria contained relevant sections of the 1988  Bankruptcy Act had been complied with.
The judge said she was satisfied that all three had been served with the relevant documentation and it would not be appropriate to grant any further adjournments of the matter.","1.56pm, 11 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/minimum-wage-ireland-esri-4527570-Mar2019/,"A NEW STUDY has found that 2016′s 50 cent increase in the minimum wage reduced wage inequality between high and low earners by up to 8%.
The minimum wage rose from €8.65 to €9.15 per hour in January 2016. Had the change not been implemented 10% of workers would have earned €9.15 or less for an hour’s work.
A new study from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has found that, thanks to the hike, this figure dropped to around 6%.
Advertisement
However the researchers found that the pay rise had no strong impact on household income.
“By boosting the hourly wage of low earners, the 2016 minimum wage increase led to a reduction in hourly wage inequality. However, household incomes were not strongly impacted,”  Dr Paul Redmond, an author of the report, said.
The Chairman of the Low Pay Commission, Dr Donal De Buitléir, welcomed the findings. “This report provides valuable data on the impact of the National Minimum Wage on the distribution of income in Ireland,” he said.
The minimum wage now sits at €9.80 per hour following another rise on 1 January. However anEU reportfrom last year recommended €11.90 per hour as an appropriate living wage for Ireland.
A living wage is a wage which makes it possible to maintain a basic but socially acceptable standard of living.

Brenton Tarrant has appeared in court charged with one murder after 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, NZ.For more on this story, head here:https://t.co/FWmUbUSE9Rpic.twitter.com/T85IykCb8a
A RIGHT-WING extremist who filmed himself on a shooting rampage that left 49 mosque-goers dead made a white power gesture as he appeared in a New Zealand court today charged with murder.
Australian-born Brenton Tarrant (28) stood in the dock wearing handcuffs and a white prison smock, as the judge read a single murder charge against him. A raft of further charges are expected.
The former fitness instructor and self-professed fascist occasionally turned to look at media present in court during the brief hearing that the public were excluded from for security reasons.
Flanked by armed police he made an upside-down “okay” signal, a symbol used by white power groups across the globe. He did not request bail and was taken into custody until his next court appearance which is scheduled for 5 April.
The judge has ordered that Tarrant’s face be blurred in footage of the appearance.
About 40 people are still being treated in hospital for injuries. The wounded include a two-year-old boy and a four-year-old girl, who is in a critical condition.
Doctors at Christchurch Hospital said they worked through the night in 12 operating theatres to treat the survivors.
The attack on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques has beenlabelled terrorismby Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and is thought to be the deadliest attack directed against Muslims in the West in modern times.
Outside the court, the son of 71-year-old Afghan Daoud Nabi, the first victim to be named, demanded justice for his late father, who believed New Zealand to be a “slice of paradise”.
“It’s outrageous” he said. “It’s beyond imagination.”
Graves
Excavators have been called in to remove the vast amount of earth needed to bury the dead, although police have not yet released the bodies to families.
The attack has prompted an outpouring of grief and deep shock in a usually peaceful country, which prides itself on welcoming refugees fleeing violence or persecution.
People have laid flowers at a makeshift memorial just beyond the police cordon around the Al Noor mosque, where most of the victims died.
Many offerings were accompanied by handwritten letters laden with sadness and disbelief, from residents of what one local driver called the “city of sorrow”.

“I am so sorry that you were not safe here. Our hearts are breaking for your loss,” one of the notes read.

When the police tape was lifted today, bystanders spontaneously joined police in moving the stack of bouquets closer to the mosque.
An imam who was leading prayers at the Linwood mosque at the time of the attack said the Muslim community would not be shaken by the massacre.
“It was a very bad day, not just all of us, all of New Zealand,” said Ibrahim AbdulHalim. But, he added: “We still love this country.”
Across New Zealand, people have responded with interfaith solidarity — crowdfunding millions of dollars, donating halal food and even offering to accompany local Muslims now scared to walk the streets.
Muslims make up about 1% of New Zealand’s 4.8 million population.
‘I am with you’
Ardern said the victims came from across the Muslim world, with Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia among the countries rendering consular assistance.
One Saudi citizen and two Jordanians were among the dead, while five Pakistani citizens were missing.
Ardern, wearing a black headscarf, met with survivors and victims’ families Saturday at a college which has become an information centre for those affected by the tragedy.
Sahra Ahmed, a New Zealander of Somali origin, said she was touched by the PM’s gesture.
“It means a lot. It is a signal to say — I am with you,” she told AFP.
Gun laws
The last comparable mass shooting in New Zealand was almost three decades ago, and the annual murder rate is usually around 50 people for the entire country.
Ardern said the shooter was “in possession of a gun licence” obtained in November 2017, and he started legally purchasing the weapons the following month.
Two semi-automatic weapons, reportedly AR-15s, two shotguns and a lever-action gun were used in the attacks. Ardern said some of the guns had been modified to make them deadlier.
“I can tell you one thing right now — our gun laws will change,” she said.

The suspect documented his radicalisation and two years of preparations in a lengthy, meandering and conspiracy filled far-right “manifesto”.
He live-streamed footage of himself going room-to-room, victim to victim, shooting the wounded from close range as they struggled to crawl away in the main Christchurch mosque.
Thirty-six minutes after the police received the first call, Tarrant was in custody.
Commissioner Mike Bush hailed the “absolute bravery” of both police and members of the public “who put themselves in harm’s way” to apprehend the suspect.
Some of the officers involved in the operation were rural police officers who Ardern said “put New Zealand first”.
Two other people remain in custody, although their link to the attack is not clear. One man, 18-year-old Daniel Burrough, has been charged with incitement.
‘Horrible massacre’
Revulsion at the attack, and tributes to the victims, poured in from around the world, including from Pope Francis, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
US President Donald Trump condemned the “horrible massacre” in which “innocent people have so senselessly died”, but denied that the problem of right-wing extremism was widespread.
Australian police said they had visited Tarrant’s childhood home in the town of Grafton, north of Sydney, and spoken to family members as part of their investigation.
The attack has prompted searching questions about whether right-wing extremism has been treated with enough seriousness by Western governments.
Ali Soufan, a former high-ranking FBI counterterrorism agent, warned the West was “in the midst of a surge of right-wing terrorism that has been metastasising in plain sight while generating only a muted response from domestic counter-terrorism authorities”.
Ardern admitted “the individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community, nor the police, for extremism”.
“I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response.”
Ardern said these issues would be addressed at a cabinet meeting on Monday.

THE REPUTED HEAD of New York’s notorious Gambino crime family has been shot and killed in New York.
Frank Cali (53) was found with multiple gunshot wounds to his body at his home on Staten Island shortly after 9pm last night.
Cali was taken to a hospital where he later died from his injuries. There have been no arrests.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn had referred to Cali in court filings in recent years as the underboss of the Gambino organisation, related through marriage to the Inzerillo clan in the Sicilian Mafia.
Since 2015, US press has reported that Cali had ascended to the top spot in the gang, although he never faced a criminal charge saying he had.
Cali’s only mob-related criminal conviction was 10 years ago when he pleaded guilty in an extortion conspiracy involving a failed attempt to build a NASCAR track on Staten Island. He was sentenced to 16 months in federal prison and was released in 2009.
The last crime family boss to be shot in New York City was Paul Castellano. The Gambino crime boss was assassinated outside Sparks Steakhouse in Manhattan in 1985.
The Gambino Family was once among the most powerful criminal organisations in the US, but federal prosecutions in the 1980s and 1990s sent its top leaders to prison and diminished its reach.

https://www.thejournal.ie/north-korea-satellite-launch-site-4526016-Mar2019/,"
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN detected at a North Korean long-range rocket site, suggesting Pyongyang may be pursuing the “rapid rebuilding” of the facility after the collapse of the Hanoi summit, according to analysis of satellite imagery.
Last week’s meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump ended abruptly after the pair failed to reach an agreement on walking back Pyongyang’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The renewed activity was recorded two days after the summit and may “demonstrate resolve in the face of US rejection” of the North’s request for sanctions relief, said researchers at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Kim had agreed to shutter the Sohae missile-testing site at a summit with the South’s President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang, as part of confidence-building measures, and satellite pictures in August suggested workers were already dismantling an engine test stand at the facility.

Satellite photos show North Korea has begun a rapid rebuilding of a missile launch site that has been inactive since last summer.https://t.co/y5PT3GNbShpic.twitter.com/CRt15Zj6GU
CSIS said activity is “evident” at the vertical engine test stand and the launch pad’s rail-mounted rocket transfer structure at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station – the facility from which Pyongyang launched satellites in 2012 and 2016.
The satellite launches were condemned by the international community and widely viewed as disguised ballistic missile tests.

The CSIS analysis said the Sohae facility “has been used in the past for satellite launches,” which use “ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) technology banned under UN Security Council resolutions”.

Detected signs
In a briefing to parliamentarians this week, Seoul’s spy agency said it had detected signs of work at the site.
The director of the respected Washington-based 38 North project cautioned that the evidence was not necessarily “consistent with preparations for an ICBM test”.
“Aside from the fact that (North Korea) has never tested an ICBM from Sohae – it’s a space vehicle launch site – preparation for any launch would require a wide range of activities not observed in the imagery.”
North Korea conducted its first successful nuclear test in 2006 followed by a string of increasingly successful ICBM launches.
In 2017, it claimed it had become a nuclear state, capable of fitting a viable nuclear weapon on an ICBM that could reach as far as the United States’ eastern seaboard.
In the same year, the UN Security Council banned the North’s main exports – coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products — to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.","7.06am, 6 Mar 2019",

https://www.thejournal.ie/directly-elected-mayor-salary-poll-4554457-Mar2019/,"THIS WEEK, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced that the proposed directly-elected mayors for Cork, Limerick and Waterfordwill be paid €130,000.
The public will be asked to vote on whether they approve of the idea of directly-elected mayors in a plebiscite, due to happen on the same day as the local and European elections on 24 May.

Tánaiste Simon Coveney has defended the €130,000 salary, insisting that amount of money is required to attract the right candidates.
“The salary is at that rate because it needs to be. This will be a serious, full-time job that will require a lot of energy, a lot of drive, 14-hour days,” Coveney told The Irish Examiner yesterday.
We want to know what you think? Is it the right amount, or is it just too much money?

https://www.the42.ie/jack-grealish-punched-4533124-Mar2019/,"THIS AFTERNOON’S CHAMPIONSHIP derby encounter between Birmingham City and Aston Villa at St Andrew’s has been marred by a shocking incident in which a supporter invaded the pitch and assaulted Villa star Jack Grealish from behind.
The man in question was wrestled to the ground by a steward and several Villa players soon afterwards before being escorted to a policeman near the corner flag.

Grealish was blindsided and floored during the assault, which took place mere minutes into the first half, but was okay to resume playing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/biker-gangs-stand-guard-outside-new-zealand-mosques-4553261-Mar2019/,"BIKER GANGS IN New Zealand have vowed to stand guard outside mosques at the first Friday prayer service since the terror attack at two mosques in Christchurch last week.
Chapters of gangs such as the Mongrel Mob, King Cobra and the Black Power have said they will protect Muslims at various locations tomorrow.
Waikato Muslim Association president Dr Asad Mohsin said the group had been contacted by local Mongrel Mob president Sonny Fatu offering his organisation’s protection at Hamilton’s Jamia Masjid Mosque during Friday prayers, theNZ Herald reports.
Mohsin said members of the Mongrel Mob were visiting the mosque during the week and said they wanted to come on Friday to “show their support and solidarity”.

He added that the offer was appreciated during a time of such grief.
“We will support and assist our Muslim brothers and sisters for however long they need us,” Fatu toldNew Zealand website Stuff.
“The question was posed whether we could be a part of the safety net for them to allow them to pray in peace without fear. Of course we would do that, there was no question about that and we will be dressed appropriately,” Fatu said.
Gangs across New Zealand and Australia have stood guard outside mosques in recent days and plan to do so again tomorrow.
Ban on assault rifles
Fifty people were killed and dozens more injured in the mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch last Friday. Victims’ funerals have now begun.

https://www.the42.ie/ted-walsh-patrick-mullins-4535844-Mar2019/,"“I’VE LOADS OF blind spots,” says Ted Walsh from the comfort of his living room. “I get angry very easy. I say too much most times. Mouthy. My father was quiet as a mouse. Mother too. I would always be strong enough to voice my opinion.”
Patrick Mullins interrupts as if sensing the need to provide Walsh a measure of reassurance.
“I think that’s what makes Ted good on TV because I respect his opinion and he’s not afraid to say what he thinks,” the younger man offers. “A lot of time on TV and in writing, people say a lot without saying anything. You need someone who is not afraid to give their opinion and he has the experience to back it up.”
At first glance they might not seem like men given to much introspection. Theirs is a macho world in which brave men and women take hard falls and expect to return to the saddle sooner than nature would allow. But these are far from ordinary horsemen.
Among the general public, Walsh is probably best known for his television punditry. In the racing community his status has long been assured. As the pre-eminent amateur jockey of his era Walsh set the bar. That he went on to train a Grand National winner only cemented his standing in the game.
“Trainers don’t retire, they just die,” Walsh told Eamon Dunphy in an interview for his podcast, The Stand. Taken at face value those words fog the picture of his profession, suggesting something akin to addiction when really it is an astute and profound description of what it means to lead a vocational life. Regular hours and work time directives do not apply. It is only when trainers have no more living left that they finally stop. A life lived within racing cannot be lived without it.
Walsh has 68 years on the board and if not in the winter of his career is at least feeling the early evening chill. At 29, Patrick Mullins continues to blossom. Son of Willie, the greatest trainer of his, and perhaps every, generation, he has steadily grown in stature, no longer heir apparent and firmly established in his own right as one of the game’s leading lights. Regardless of what has been inherited, his cultivating a record number of winners as an amateur in the saddle puts him in elite company, seizing a mantle previously occupied by Walsh, the man now sitting beside him on the couch.
“It was a bonus for me to be as successful as I was,” says Walsh reflecting on an amateur career that was the best of his time, and all time, until Mullins arrived on the scene. “He [Patrick] had a lot more pressure. Like Willie was champion amateur and a successful trainer. No one expected Patrick to be as good as he is but at the same time if he was a fail, it would have been a bigger thing. It would be said: ‘He’s not a bit like his father.’ Instead he’s a superior rider to his dad, in every way. Willie was as good as it gets at that time but he’s [Patrick] brought it to another level. Patrick is as disciplined and as professional as you could get as an amateur.”
Such praise does not come lightly. Outspoken and often disliked for it but astute and quick-witted and so much loved for that, Walsh owns a bespoke collection of verdicts, assessments and views, and delivers them on time, every time. Walsh is clearcut and as fluent now with words as he was with Hilly Way over fences. That win in the Champion Chase of 1979 remains the most notable victory of his race-riding career but the man sitting beside him has scrubbed most of his records from the board. Mullins eclipsed Walsh in July, 2018 when notching the 546th winner of a career that may not yet have reached its peak.
“When I see so many of my friends struggling to get the dream that I’ve been lucky enough to get, it’s very easy to see the luck and opportunity,” says Mullins dismissing the notion of him as an uncommonly self-aware young man. “It’s not a weight on my shoulders but I want to win! I want to win as much as I can. To me anyone who competes wants to do that.”
Names of those less fortunate than him quickly come to mind. He shares a house with fellow riders Richie Deegan, Brian Hayes and Rachael Blackmore.
“Look at Rachael Blackmore,” he says insistently. “She didn’t suddenly become a good jockey overnight, She’s been working at it for so long. I was in a different position in that I got the opportunity much quicker.”

His own narrative is not quite as straightforward as it might seem. He has the racing bloodlines but did not spend every morning of his youth working with black type.
Secondary school took him away from home, to Clongowes Wood College and the company of bluebloods, sons of leaders from the business and political world. Rugby players dominate the list of sporting alumni – Gordon D’Arcy and Rob Kearney most notable – but Mullins is just as worthy. And like his rugby brethren, he has gone to great lengths to achieve success.
“I was in seven-day boarding school [Clongowes] until I was 18 and then I was in college [Maynooth University] five days a week so I was a proper amateur for a long time,” he says. “When I was 16, 17 and 18 I was only getting to ride out one weekend a month. I used to sneak over to Charlie O’Neill’s, four fields left of school, on a Wednesday and a Saturday. Alexander Banquet was in livery over there. Willie always told me I’d probably only get two or three years at this because I was tall. I never really thought that I would be at it for very long.”
Mullins has travelled far and wide to foster his racing education. For whatever reason, in this corner of the equine world competing stables welcome visiting rivals without compunction.
“Willie and Jackie [his mother] would always have encouraged me to go to other yards,” says Patrick. “I like to see other places as well from a training point of view for the future, to see different ways of doing it. We’re so busy at home it’s hard to go away for a long period of time. And we’re going through such a golden patch now it would be a pity to go away. I like to go away to some of the flat yards in England like Gosden’s and Hammond’s. I’ve gone to Joseph’s [O’Brien] here, John Kiely and Gordon’s [Elliot]. It’s a great sport like that. There are very few sports I’d say that could you do that.”
In soccer for instance, managers have been upbraided for espionage. In January, Leeds United manager Marcelo Biesla provoked a furious response from Derby County when the Rams uncovered a spy at their training ground.
“They like one another,” says Walsh explaining the culture of their game. “If Gordon’s back was against the wall tomorrow morning over something, there’s any one of five or six trainers he could ring and say: ‘Listen, I’ve a problem here. What do you think?’ Willie would be the same way.”
Says Patrick: “You cannot be secretive because staff come and go.”

“Fellas know what’s happening in a yard,” Walsh confirms. “If you’re doing something wrong in a yard, you cannot do it on your own.”
Warming to the theme, the pair fall into lively conversation.
Mullins: “You can have an advantage for a while and then everyone catches up. [Martin] Pipe changed the way he trained in England and now everyone does it. He went to interval training, short and sharp. They all used to gallop real long.”
Walsh: “They say Christy Ring did it in hurling. Instead of running around the pitch, they sprinted across it because that’s all you’ll ever be doing he [Ring] reckoned, sprinting to get the ball and hit it. You could jog off from here [Kill] to Johnstown or Naas but if you went flat out you wouldn’t get 100 yards.”
Mullins: “I remember training with a hurling team in college and when we were doing the laps I was grand at the top but when we were doing the sprints, I was in the middle of the pack.”
Walsh: “Paddy Mullins was a very successful trainer but Paddy Mullins had something about him that he could spot a real good horse. There were very few horses that Paddy Mullins had that were good that he didn’t get the best out of. I’d say the same thing applies to Willie. I’ll see Willie there, he’ll arrive at the Curragh with a bunch of horses to work and the plan would be that all horses are going to work but for some reason when one horse gets off the box, he might say: ‘That fella could go for a walk today.’ Don’t ask me what he’d see. That’s something you either have or you haven’t. He’s got that innate ability to spot things that other lads can’t spot.”
Mullins: “It’s experience too.”
Walsh: “Quevega now. He [Willie] minded her and produced her in six Cheltenhams to win. Sometimes gave her one run, sometimes gave her no run. Nothing textbook.”

Mullins: “Willie trains by eye. You see a lot of places, especially on the flat, there’s just a routine because they’re more prisoners of time. They have to run at two and three [years old]. Willie sees every horse every morning. He might say we’ll do less with him today. There is a routine and routine is very important but he’s not afraid to change it on what he sees. ‘He looks a bit light,’ or, ‘a bit cold in his coat,’ he [Willie] might say when you ask him. It doesn’t always add up. Sometimes he’ll say something and you’ll go: That’s one plus one and the answer is two. The next thing you’ll think you see the same thing and you think one plus one is two but it’ll end up being two plus one equals three. It’s a slightly different equation because maybe he’ll say: ‘That horse is always light,’ or, ‘That horse is heavy boned,’ or, ‘That’s how he looks,’ or, ‘We need to work him harder.’ And he’s not always right, same as everyone. But he’s right more often than not.”
Walsh: “If you’re afraid of getting beat you’ll never win because you’ll be cautious all the time. You have to be brave.”
Their discussion approaches the final straight but only because Patrick has an appointment elsewhere. They have been running a good gallop from the start like those great horses they have ridden to victory at Cheltenham. If Ted is always keen, Patrick prefers to settle, ordering his thoughts before making them a matter of public record. As soon as Ted delivers his latest piece of ornate commentary, Patrick fills a gap a lesser mind would not have spotted.
Mullins: “Willie would say that Ted might do something and six horses away from him, a gap would close and the other lads would be busy blaming themselves but Ted would have done it and no one would know. Willie would always be explaining this to me on how to race ride and how to ride tight, which I think is a very important part, particularly in bumpers, to be able to ride tight. It’s as much your job to make it hard for the other fellas. If you’re coming up the outside, you’re trying to keep everyone tight on the inside. The fella on the inside might be going the shortest way around, which is fine, but he’s going to have trouble in running. You’re trying to get a clear run and you’re trying to keep everyone else tight. When I started off Nina [Carberry] was a master at it.”
Walsh:“She’s [Carberry] basically trying to take him [Patrick] out of contention. She knows when she’s passing that he’s a danger and the lads coming down the inside are not aware of anything. They’re riding along nonchalantly because that’s what most of them do but she can mosey up, she tightens up so that the lads inside her, unawares, close the gap that Patrick was aiming at. That’s race riding. When you go by somebody in a race they should know you went by them. No point in giving everybody a chance. It’s no different than rugby or any other sport.”
Mullins: “One of the first things I learned from my father was to know everybody’s name because if you do need a bit of room and you just shout at a fella, chances are he won’t move. Whereas if I shout, ‘Ted, bit of room,’ you’re more likely to get it. Also then you have to remember you might call in a favour because you might have given a fella a bit of room at a previous meeting. It might be six months later. ‘Remember now Listowel there.’
Walsh: “The same way you’ll remember the fella who fucken didn’t give you the room!”
Mullins: “You always need to know who’s in front of you, who’s beside you, where the fancied ones are, if the lad in front of you might be a lad who’s going to get tired. Is the horse going to get tired? You need to be thinking always 100, 200 yards ahead and what’s going to change.”
Walsh: “It’s more about a racing brain than it is about anything else. Whether a fella is stylish or neat, that’s nice but it really doesn’t have any bearing on the result. The result is how you ride in the race. He [Patrick] is a great judge of pace too.”
Mullins: “I’ve been very lucky in that I’ve had coaches. My mother [Jackie] was champion lady amateur and she was second to Aidan O’Brien in that amateur championship. Willie obviously rode and Ruby [Walsh, Ted’s son] I’d be able to talk to so I’ve had coaches who have taught me this. They would come to me after a race and say: ‘You did this wrong.’ And I could ask them a question: ‘Should I have done that?’ It’s not coaching in a formal sense but I’ve been surrounded by people who know what they’re talking about.
Ruby Walsh and Benie Des Dieux.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
Walsh: “I didn’t learn as fast as you. I was very moderate for a long time. I learned through watching other fellas. You could give Ruby as big a bollocking as you ever gave a fella and he wouldn’t get upset. You’d say to him, ‘You gave that a stones of a ride.’ He’d never back answer or question it. he’d take it on board. Right up to the present day, I could ring Ruby and say: ‘You weren’t great there. Well?’ He might have a very good reason but you could still say it to him. I’m sure Willie would say the same to him [Patrick]. Even though he’s ridden five hundred winners I’m sure there’s days when he says: ‘You didn’t fucken shine on him.’”
Mullins: “Plenty of them.”

Walsh: “He’s [Patrick] got to take it on board. You could coach a fella all day but if a fella hasn’t got it in him…”
Mullins: “When you respect the person you’re getting it from, it’s easy take it on board. I’m always amazed looking at other sports. You see Federer or Nadal and they’re on about changing coach or golfers working on their swing. You’re never too big to learn and take advice.”
Walsh: “I think nowadays, if a fella is clever enough, there are a lot of videos that you can look at. When I look back on myself, I think it’s a pity we didn’t have more videos.”
Mullins: “Video is huge.”
Walsh: “If you stand in front of the mirror with a pink tie on you and a black shirt and you think you look well – you can’t coach him. If he thinks, ‘I look smart here.’ When he really looks like a clown. The same way with a fella who looks at a video and says to himself, ‘I gave that a good auld ride now.’ A fella should know. My father [Ruby] would go silent and I knew I was after making a bollocks of it then.”
Mullins: “Willie is generally the same.”
Walsh: “We’d leave Listowel and get into the car, I’d be driving. And when we get to Limerick, I’d say to my father, ‘Would you like a cup of tea?’ ‘No.’ Now you’re gone from Listowel to Limerick and this is the first few words we’ve had. Then we’d pull into the petrol station and I might say, ‘Would you like an ice-cream?’ ‘No.’ We’d drive all the way home, a long drive through all them towns, and eventually he might say to me: ‘Did you think that race was on today?’ If I had left one late or went a mile too soon. ‘Did someone move the winning post?’ I’d say, ‘No.’ And he’d come back: ‘You were in front plenty soon enough anyway.’
Mullins: “Willie is quiet. He wouldn’t say a lot but if he does, five minutes later it’s done, it’s gone. I remember I rode one in Galway and I got caught wide in the GPT and then I came too late in the bumper. I was driving his car home. It was silent and then down a dark road I hit a pothole bang on, like nailed the pothole. ‘Pull in! Pull in!’ I pulled in, in the pitch dark on this little, windy road. ‘You’re after losing the bumper and the GPT today, you’re not going to break my car. OUT! I’ll drive.’ I quickly learned to get my own car and drive racing myself.”
Before the conversation concludes, they pause for reflection.
“I’ve always been very competitive,” says Mullins. “First you want to ride your first winner then you want to ride out your claim. Then you’re thinking you’d like a Cheltenham winner, a grade one winner. And when I got to 21 it looked like I was going to be able to keep my weight and do it long term. You’re always aiming for the next thing. I obviously have huge opportunity being where I am and I want to make the most of that so that when I retire I can say I made the very most of it. That’s driving me.”
Walsh offers a typically frank assessment: “He’s not going to have regrets. He knows he has to deliver too. And he’s delivering. He’s in a good position but he knows that he has a big responsibility if Willie sticks him up on Douvan or Un de Sceaux. Patrick is aware of everything that’s going on right from the bottom of his toes up. He’s not floating through life anyway.”
And for all that both men have seen of life, they cannot imagine a better way.
“A lot of my friends from school they’re working in London or Paris or Berlin,” says Mullins. “I’d love the opportunity in a parallel life to see something different, live in a different city for six months. But I wouldn’t swap what I’m doing. I’m hugely lucky to do what I do. Sure we’re not working at all.”
“No,” says Walsh.
This, the shortest of his answers; by far, the most telling.

Every Sunday morning, Darach will be regaling (re-Gaeling?) us with insights on what the Irish language says about Ireland, our society, our past and our present. Enjoy.
IN 1266 IN Fontenay-aux-Roses in France, a pig was put on trial and condemned to death by hanging.
The widespread recording of this event was a harbinger of changing times, a moment when a widespread practice was finally noticed and remarked upon as being weird.
Criminal trials for animals (sparrows condemned to death for singing in church, horses charged with bestiality while their human paramours got off scot-free) were not uncommon during that phase of European history known as the Dark Ages.
It was during this time that Ireland acquired its reputation as ‘the island of saints and scholars’, its geographical isolation providing some measure of protection from the merciless plagues and violent turmoil sweeping across the continent that erased generations of learning there. This age of (relative) enlightenment was also the period of Brehon Law.
Although sometimes imagined as an era of druids and pagan rituals and Celtic warrior princesses, this would not be correct.
The surviving Brehon Law texts date from centuries after St Patrick and are clearly informed by canon law.
Similarly, claims that Brehon Law was extremely progressive need to be taken with a gráinne salainn – this opinion was more of a criticism of pre-divorce referendum 20th century Ireland than a sincere applauding of the medieval system.
Having said that, the Brehon system did give women access to divorce for a range of grounds, operated a child-centred system of family law and tended to avoid the death penalty. Here are some terms for legal concepts from the Brehon era.
Breitheamh:This is the Irish word for a judge and the origin of the word Brehon.
Duinetháide:Secret murder or literally ‘the theft of a person’.
Advertisement
This referred to murders where the killer either concealed the deceased and/or denied the crime – a far more serious offence than merely taking a life in open combat.
As with modern law, there were degrees of severity for the taking of human life but these tended to reflect the impact on the surviving family members rather than guessing the intent of the killer.
Bardamháil:Bishop O’Brien’s 18th-century dictionary includes an entry for this word, which means ‘addicted to satires or lampoons’.
Satire (Áer):This was taken as seriously as physical assault in old Ireland and a range of satirical offences were deemed to warrant compensation, including “coining a nickname that sticks”.
Imscarad:This is the word for divorce in the Brehon era (the modern term is colscaradh).
A wife was entitled to a divorce from her husband for a range of shortcomings – bad breath, getting too fat to make love, tricking her into marriage using sorcery, composing a satire about her and so on.
Bóaire:Literally a ‘cow chief’, this means a prosperous farmer, someone who’d find themselves in the middle rankings of Brehon society.
Men could be ranked from a mug (a slave) to a rí ruirech (supreme king) – this rank decided their honour price, which was used as a benchmark for calculating the severity of punishment due to someone who wronged them.
Aitheach Fortha:Being a king came with great privilege but could put you in a conundrum if you had been naughty: you were obliged to see that justice was served, but could not possibly condescend to be put on trial and sentenced as this would compromise your regal mystique and integrity.
That’s where an aitheach fortha could come in handy- this means a ‘substitute churl’ and means a useful idiot who is appointed to stand trial on the king’s behalf.
Ainces:This is an act which is not justifiable in itself but is committed in pursuit of a justifiable, necessary objective. For example, the property of another person destroyed in the pursuit of their well-deserved slaying could be deemed an ainces.
If you are interested in finding out more about Brehon Law, I cannot recommend A Guide To Early Irish Law by Fergus Kelly highly enough.

LEO VARADKAR’S PARTNER will join him for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations at US Vice President’s house tomorrow.
Last year, Mike Pence told the Taoiseach his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome in Pence’s home if he decides to attend this year.
Pence made the comments during a private conversation between the two, during which Varadkar raised LGBT rights and equality issues.
The US vice president describes himself as a “Christian, a conservative and a Republican” and has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT people.

“He’s going to be at the breakfast tomorrow,” Varadkar told reporters in Washington DC today. “He was able to get time off work and make the journey. He’ll be taking up the invitation from Mike and Karen Pence to attend tomorrow. Karen can’t be there because she’s in Abu Dhabi for the Special Olympics.”

The vice president was criticised last year forbreaking with the traditionand not allowing media access to the conversation. Members of the press were left on the lawn of the vice president’s home during the meeting.
At the time, the Taoiseach said it was the US administration’s decision to have the meeting in private.
Prior to it, Varadkar repeatedly said he would talk with Pence about social issues, including LGBT rights.
The media are permitted to attend the breakfast meeting this year.
Barrett will also attend the traditional shamrock ceremony in the White House but it is understood he will not take to the stage during the presentation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/court-of-appeal-new-judges-backlog-4553039-Mar2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS approved new legislation to increase the number of judges in the Court of Appeal to deal with the backlog of cases.
The number of judges in the court, which hears appeals in civil proceedings from the High Court, is set to be increased from nine to fifteen.
The new legislation will create three divisions of the Court of Appeal – civil cases, criminal cases, and backlog cases.
According to theCourts Services 2017annual report, when the court was established in 2014, a backlog of 1355 civil cases was transferred to the Court of Appeal.

At the end of 2017, of those 1355 cases, only 649 have been resolved.
Speaking today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it is all about bringing down wait times for cases to be heard.
There are now wait times of 20-24 months and “for some cases that is far too long,” said the Taoiseach.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court launchedits first annual reportin which it stated that the waiting time for an appeal to be heard in the country’s highest court had been cut from almost five years to one.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gsoc-taser-discharges-48-hours-4531197-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ FAILED TO report more than half of incidents where a taser was discharged within the required timeframe, figures seen byTheJournal.ieshow.
Records released by the Garda Ombudsman (GSOC) under Freedom of Information reveal that 37 out of a total of 77 such incidents between 2016 and 2018 were reported to its office within 48 hours.
The office must be notified by Gardaí within 48 hours any time a firearm, taser or incapacitant – such as pepper spray – is discharged.
The requirement was introduced in 2010 to ensure that GSOC can gather any evidence about potential wrongdoing while it was still fresh.
However, last year was the first in three years that GSOC was notified about taser discharges on time more often than not, with 19 out of 29 reports received within the required timeframe.
This figure was up from 13 out of 25 taser discharges in 2017, and from five out of 13 taser discharges in 2016.
In some instances, gardaí were not notified until weeks after a taser was discharged.

Last year, a discharge by the Special Detective Unit on 14 September was not reported to GSOC until 2 October.
In 2017, a taser discharged by gardaí in Waterford on 13 February was not reported to GSOC until 9 March, while another discharge by the Armed Support Unit in the east of the country on 17 April was not reported until 13 June – nearly two months later.
Figures released by GSOC also showed that the overwhelming majority of instances where pepper spray was discharged by a garda were not reported within 48 hours.
Between 2016 and 2018, 323 out of 1,607 – or roughly one in five – instances where pepper spray was discharged was reported within the required timeframe.
Although the figure rose significantly last year, just 243 out of 646 pepper spray discharges were reported in 2018.
In dozens of instances, it was months before GSOC was notified.
One discharge by gardaí in Cork’s Anglesea Street station on 2 February, 2017 was not reported until 22 August, while another instance on 10 September involving gardaí in Fethard, Tipperary was not reported to GSOC until 2 October, 2018 – over a year later.
A spokeswoman for GSOC said there was still “much to be done” to improve figures, but said figures had improved last year due to a closer working relationship between the ombudsman and gardaí.
She added that the ombudsman also provided regular training to all newly trained firearms officers, including specialist units such as the Emergency Reponse Unit, which had also helped to improve figures last year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rihards-lavickis-murder-jailed-life-4554914-Mar2019/,"A FATHER-OF-ONE has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering a fellow drug dealer, who’d threatened his family over a €100 debt.
He chased the 31-year-old across a busy street and stabbed him to death in broad daylight.
The trial heard that Rihards Lavickis (26) admitted that he went out with a knife on 1 November 2016 “to get” Akadiusz ‘Arik’ Czajkowski for threatening his family and breaking their windows.
The Latvian native with an address at Annaly court in Longford pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to the manslaughter of the Polish father-of-two outside Longford Shopping Centre at Rue Noyal Chatillon, Townspark in the town.
It was the second time he went on trial for the murder at the Central Criminal Court. A previous jury failed to reach a verdict.
Attack
The court heard that both men had become friendly while neighbours in Annaly Court. However, the deceased, who had a severe alcohol problem, had set a number of bins on fire, causing an electricity outage lasting several days in a number of apartments.
The deceased had moved elsewhere in the town by the time Lavickis bought €300 worth of drugs off him on tic. However, the money wasn’t paid on the day the deceased wanted. So, he went with an associate to the home Lavickis shared with his partner, her mother and sister and their three young children, and attacked him with a knuckle duster.
Although Lavickis reported the attack to the gardaí, he decided not to press charges, and the drug debt was reduced to €100 as a result.
However, the trouble continued between the two men, with Lavickis holding the deceased responsible for his family’s windows being broken on up to five different occasions. During one of these incidents, his sister-in-law’s friend was sleeping in the room under attack.
The night before the killing was Halloween and Lavickis was out and about with two friends. The jury saw CCTV footage of the three men standing behind a wall before a car pulled up and the deceased and two other men getting out. The footage then showed the first three men running away.
One of Lavickis’s friends, Michael Godla, told the court that the deceased had shouted at Lavickis: “Where is the money?” and that Lavickis had replied: “I give you nothing because you beat me with a knuckle duster.”
Godla testified that the deceased had warned that he would get out of the car and give Lavickis a beating.
“Then another guy get out of the back of the car so we run away all of us,” he said, explaining that they were afraid.
“They were big guys, like both bodybuilders. There were three people inside.”
He said they were hiding for 15 minutes as the men in the car drove up and down looking for them.
Godla said that he was awoken by glass breaking around 3am the following morning and saw that Lavickis’ window had been broken. He later told Lavickis what he had seen.
Gardaí testified that Lavickis called them to report the broken window that morning. They went to his home and he nominated the deceased as a suspect, telling the officers that he would “get him”. They had warned him not to, that they would deal with it.
However, he had gone out with a knife looking for the deceased. He later saw him walking down the street, hid in a gap in a wall and gave chase as he passed by.
Death
The jury saw CCTV footage of him chasing him with a knife raised, and heard that he’d stabbed him three times just seconds later. The stabbing wasn’t caught on camera.

A post-mortem examination found that the victim died of a single stab wound to the heart. The other two wounds were not fatal, with one to his finger classed as defensive.
The defence had argued that he did not have the intent necessary for murder when he stabbed the deceased. His barrister also said that, if the jury found he had the intent, it could then find that he had been provoked by the deceased. Both defences could reduce murder to manslaughter.
However, the prosecution argued that the natural and probable consequences of sticking a knife into someone’s chest was death or serious injury, either of which could lead to a conviction of murder.
The jury spent just over three hours deliberating and found him guilty of murder by unanimous verdict.
Justice Michael White thanked the eight men and four women and excused them from jury duty for 10 years.
Victim impact statement
Sergeant Aisling Flynn then read a victim impact statement prepared by the deceased man’s mother, Halina Czajkowska, who said her son had a big heart.
“He was a lovely, caring, thoughtful boy, who loved me unconditionally,” she said of her son as a child.
She said he had never given her any trouble, was very talented, played musical instruments and loved the guitar.
She said that they had both moved to Sweden years earlier, that he had learned the language in a few months and got a job in a factory there, helping her financially.
“He had a big heart,” she said.
She said he had heard how good Ireland was, and decided to move here, falling in love and having his two children in Northern Ireland.
“I do know that he had faults,” she admitted.
I don’t know how he got involved with alcohol and drugs to such an extent… He was my beautiful boy.
She said that his murder had done irreversible psychological damage to her.
I can’t believe that I will never see him again, hug him again or hear him say ‘I love you’ at the end of a phone call.
She said that she now suffered from depression and felt suicidal at times.
“Over the last phone calls, he did not seem himself… He was always looking for money,” she said. “He would never ask for money from me. It was usually Arik giving the money to help me.”
She said that she had been planning to bring him home to either Poland or Sweden.
“I will never forgive myself for not doing this,” she said.
She stated that while she received no support from the police in Poland, she received support from the people of Longford and the local gardaí, whom she described as quick and professional.
She also praised the victim support services at court, whom she described as angels, and her son’s undertaker in Longford.
“He got my boy’s remains back to Poland,” she said.
“My baby boy is gone forever,” she concluded.
I will never see him get married. His sister will never see him again. His children will never see him again… I don’t know how I will cope.
Justice White then imposed the mandatory life sentence on Lavickis, who waved at his own mother as he was led away.

Gardaí are at the scene of the demonstration.
Demonstrators are blocking all southbound traffic. Northbound traffic has been affected by onlookers.  The protesters are protesting against the wage gap and gender-based violence.
People were being asked to leave their workplaces or colleges at 3pm to join, or if they are in other parts of the country to join local demonstrations.
AA Roadwatch have advised commuters to find an alternative route.

Victims of domestic violence spoke at the rally. Jessica Bowes, who was attacked by her partner, called on the garda commissioner to roll out protective units across the country.
Organiser Rita Harrold of ROSA said it was good to see people attending the protest.
“We don’t really have public spaces in the city centre in the same way,” she says.
“I think people wanted to rock the bridge, make a bit of noise to really mark that this isn’t just a day for corporations to put out a pink lipstick and feel better about themselves, actually this is a day of protest.”
“I think Ireland has moved every far…but it’s the laws that are lagging behind,” she says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/monaghan-mechanic-ira-membership-special-criminal-court-4554796-Mar2019/,"A MONAGHAN MECHANIC has been found guilty of IRA membership by the non-jury Special Criminal Court.
James Joseph Cassidy, 55, of Tullycollive, Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, had denied membership of an unlawful organisation, styling itself the Irish Republican Army (IRA), otherwise Óglaigh na hÉireann, on 21 September, 2016.
In his opening address to the three-judge court at the end of January, prosecuting counsel Paul Greene SC said gardaí discovered a “water booster tube” during a search in and around Cassidy’s family home and sheds which he owned or had access to.
The prosecution said there would be evidence of this device’s similarity to one seized during another prosecution in Kilcurry, an area “not very far away from where we are talking about”.
He told the court that the Tullycollive area is “an unusually remote” part of Monaghan overlooking the border into Armagh and accessed by a minor road.
Counsel said gardaí found the gated property to have had a “high degree of security” with ten St Bernard dogs “who behaved rather aggressively”.
He said that gardaí also found three mobile phones and “items of Republican paraphernalia” that would be exhibited in the trial.
He said there would also be evidence of the accused’s association with a number of convicted IRA members and people of a group called the Republican Network Unity (RNU).
Chief Superintendent Christopher Mangan gave evidence during the trial of his belief that Cassidy was an IRA member on the date in question.
He claimed privilege on the sources of the confidential information on which his belief was based.
Detective Sergeant Oliver Flaherty, of the Special Detective Unit (SDU), told the trial that he was involved in the search of the accused’s premises and adjoining lands on 21 September, 2016.
The detective said that he found a black metal pipe, about 40cm in length, with drilled holes in a shed.
It was found on the floor in a small space between the rear of a vat or box and the wall.
It would not have been visible to anybody walking into the shed, he said.

Detective Inspector William Hanrahan, of the SDU, gave evidence that he had previously seen similar tubing in relation to “other IRA operations”, which was a booster tube.
Delivering judgment yesterday, Mr Justice Tony Hunt, presiding, sitting with Judge Patricia Ryan and Judge Ann Ryan, said that the court accepted the belief evidence of Chief Supt Mangan.
“He assured us on more than one occasion that his belief was not founded on the defendant’s arrest or detention and we accept these assurances,” the judge said.
The judge said belief evidence must be supported and corroborated by other evidence in the prosecution case.
The prosecution had relied on evidence seized during a search of Cassidy’s home and matters arising from his conduct prior to 21 September, he outlined.
The judge said that the length of the black metal pipe found in the accused’s shed was the first plank of supporting evidence relied on by the prosecution.
“The prosecution’s case is that this item is a booster tube which is an intricate part of an explosive type device,” explained Mr Justice Hunt, adding that the booster tube was similar to items seized at Kilcurry.
The judge said the defendant had denied any knowledge of the booster tube which was found in the shed and told gardaí that he did not own the shed and other people had access to it.
The evidence is that the accused was the only person using the shed at the time and the farm was in a “generally remote location”, which was not easily accessible to any third party, said the judge.
The judge said the court was satisfied that the likelihood of some person other than Cassidy placing the booster tube in the shed was “so remote and fanciful” that it could safely be dismissed.
“There is no evidence that anyone else had such access,” he said, adding that the presence of the booster tube in the shed was not an unfortunate coincidence.
Furthermore, the judge said the accused’s answers to gardaí concerning his knowledge of the booster tube were false and untruthful.
He said strands of evidence in relation to the booster pipe, a USB key and mobile phones were part of a “pattern of behaviour” that supported the belief evidence that the accused was a member of the IRA on the day in question.
Cassidy was remanded in custody until 29 April, when he will be sentenced.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donegal-couple-4541231-Mar2019/,"AN ELDERLY COUPLE found dead in their home in Convoy, Co Donegal, yesterday afternoon may both have fallen.
Patrick and Margaret Doherty were both found by a family member in their bedroom at about 1.30pm yesterday. The relative alerted gardaí who are now investigating the circumstances of their deaths.
The man’s nephew, Liam Doherty, who is a local Sinn Féin councillor, toldTheJournal.iethat from an initial assessment it looks like his uncle and aunt may both have fallen in their bedroom.

His sister had found the couple when she called in to check on them and he had been next on the scene. He said it appeared Margaret may have fallen and hit her head and her husband got out of the bed and also then took a fall.
Doherty said the couple were well known in the community and “kept themselves to themselves”.
He said Patrick was from the area but had lived and worked in England for a number of years. He and Margaret, who was from the west of Ireland, returned to Donegal about 15 years ago to retire closer to family.
Post-mortems are due to take place at Letterkenny University Hospital and gardaí have said the course of the investigation will be determined by the results.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rural-abortion-services-gps-michael-harty-4543780-Mar2019/,"CLARE TD DR Michael Harty, who is chair of the Oireachtas Health Committee, has said that the threat of anti-abortion protests could be putting GPs off from offering the service, and that the “ambitious” date of 1 January to introduce abortion services has led to “sporadic availability” across the country.
Harty, who has a practice in Kilmihil in Co Clare for over 3 decades, was elected in the last general election on a “No Doctor, No Village” campaign that aimed to increase GPs incomes after it was cut during years of austerity.
In an interview withTheJournal.ie, when asked whether GPs are signing up to provide abortion services, he agreed that concerns about protesters was a factor.
“In rural areas, if you’re the only person supplying a service in an area, you are open to protests. Certainly the GPs who are providing it just for their own patients, it could be an issue that they would be afraid that they would be targeted,” he said.
Minister for Health Simon Harris is currently working on legislation to provide for “exclusion zones” outside medical centres that provide abortions.
The law would prohibit communicating with a person within the safe access zone in a way that “causes distress”, and to “prohibit capturing and/or distributing images of any person in a safe access zone”.
Sam BoalSam Boal
Before the Eighth Amendment referendum last year, a group gatheredoutside the Rotunda maternity hospitalin Dublin holding graphic posters that were described by Harris as “despicable”. Protests were also held outside a GP’s practice in Co Galway andoutside Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Droghedashortly after the introduction of abortion services on 1 January.
Last month,a GP clinic in Co Longfordwas spray painted with anti-abortion graffiti overnight.
It is understoodthat the Attorney General is being consulted on the new laws, and new proposals to introduce safe access zones are to be introduced early in the year.
“To date there have been sporadic protests,” Harty says “but it would be a factor in a GP’s decision to making their practice known to be supplying services for a wider community other than their own patients”.
There is a register of GP practices that offer abortion services to the public, but this is not the complete list; other GP practices might also provide the service, but only to their existing patients.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, the HSE said that in consultation with GPs, it had decided to make participating GP details available by calling the MyOptions helpline, rather than publishing a list of GPs.
“Daily changes to the GP listing, and some GPs offering abortion services to their existing patients only, were factors in this decision,” it said.

Last month,35 pro-choice groupsaround the country signed an open letter that stated rural service provision for abortions was “sparse”. No GPs had signed up to services in some counties, it claimed, expressing disappointment at the service provision.
Although the HSE said that it couldn’t give a county-by-county breakdown of what GPs had signed up to offer abortion services due to privacy concerns, it said that it “is satisfied that there is a good geographic spread of GPs taking part, enough to meet the needs of people who may need to access the service”.
“There are a number of reasons why GPs are slow to sign up,” Harty says.
The Irish College of General Practitioners said that over 200 GPs have completed its training course on providing abortion services, while other GPs are still waiting to complete it.
“So I think over the next couple of months, the number of GPs signing up to provide abortion services will gradually increase,” Harty said.

When asked whether the date that Simon Harris set for the implementation of abortion services was unrealistic, Harty said that the 1 January date “was a political timeline rather than a clinical timeline”.
“Politically it was promised, so from that point of view it was imperative that the minister deliver it from 1 January,” he said.
He added that the 1 January was “very ambitious,” and has led to “a sporadic availability of abortion services” – not only the community general practices, but also through the maternity services.
Harty says his understanding is, of the 19 maternity hospitals in Ireland, just 10 were ready to offer abortion services on 1 January, “and some of them still aren’t ready to go”. He said that it wasn’t a straightforward “yes or no, we’ll supply the service” in hospitals:
He said that depending on how many staff conscientiously object, that “can and does present problems for maternity hospitals”.
CEO of the National Association of General Practitioners, Chris Goodey, said that the organisation was “of the position that abortion services were being rushed through”.
“That has certainly caused problems… There isn’t an equal spread of services,” he said.
He also said that not being able to get timely access to ultrasound or the support for blood tests “has caused problems” for GPs in making a decision to offer abortion services.
He said that it was important to rectify this “to provide a safe [abortion] service for the women of Ireland”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/banking-diversity-4523402-Mar2019/,"THE MINISTER FOR Finance has said the Central Bank may be forced to take action if there is no improvement in diversity in the senior posts at Irish banks.
Speaking in the Dáil, Paschal Donohoe said this diversity extends beyond gender to include diversity in “personality types, educational background, ethnicity, and diversity of thought”.
The minister added that improving diversity in financial institutions can: “mitigate the risk of groupthink, improve decision-making, increase the effectiveness of internal challenge and enhance firm culture.”
In responding to a question by Tommy Broughan TD, Donohoe referenced a 2018 report which pointed to a severe gender imbalance in the financial services sector.
TheCentral Bank’s diversity and inclusion assessmentlooked at applicants and appointments to financial institutions that require its approval
Advertisement
The report found that 80% of the senior appointments between 2012 and 2017 were men.
In the most senior roles the gap was even more stark, with women comprising just 12% of applicants to the boards of Irish financial institutions.
The report noted that there have been some improvements in recent years, with the percentage of senior appointments in 2017 increasing to 29%.
In the assessment, the authors noted a lack of diversity can lead to “the risk of over-confidence in decision-making” and a “reluctance to change”.
In his Dáil reply, Donohoe noted that senior officials in the Central Bank have continually addressed the topic directly with bank officials “through a comprehensive series of speaking engagements” but may have to do more.
“However, in the absence of improvements in diversity at senior levels in regulated firms, the (Central) Bank will consider whether it is necessary to introduce further requirements,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/edmund-honohon-vulture-funds-4553565-Mar2019/,"MASTER OF THE High Court, Edmund Honohan, has said a case on State aid rule breaches could be brought by the European Commission in relation to the special tax treatment given to the vulture funds in Ireland.
Honohan, by invitation of Luke Ming Flanagan MEP, made a presentation to politicians in the European Parliament this week, outlining that there are similarities to be drawn from the Apple case.
The EU Commission ruled in 2016 that Ireland gave multinational tech giant Apple illegal state aidworth up to €13 billion over a decade.
The European Commission said Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of just 0.005% on its European profits in 2014 — equivalent to just €50 for every million.
TheDepartment of Finance is appealing the decisionbecause it denies that there was any sweetheart deal in place.
Referring to the Apple decision, Honohon said the European Commission’s investigation “will throw up an awful lot of interesting material that is not available to any parliamentarian in Dublin”.
Honohon said there are many similarities between the Apple case and the possible case that could be taken on the special tax treatment given to the vulture funds in Ireland.
“I’m sure it is well worth investigating, it is certainly a prima facie case,” said Honohon.
History of calling out banks and vulture funds
In recent years, Honohan has become known for his strong views on the treatment by financial institutions of debtors in distress. He has been particularly vocal in relation to possession cases and often engages in heated exchanges with barristers representing lenders.As far back as 2011, he called for debt forgiveness and criticised banks for the aggressive pursuit of homeowners.
Last year, he warnedthat thousands of people coming through the courts may lose their homes if stronger legal supports are not put in place to help them when they face off against banks and vulture funds.
Healso said the governmentis not putting appropriate policy in place to prepare for the “wave of repossessions [of homes] that’s about to break”.

Honohan also wrote theAffordable Housing and Fair Mortgage Bill, which wasintroduced in the Dáil last year by Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness.
In a letter sent to Fianna Fáil leaderMicheál Martin at the end of December, the High Court Master said neither he nor the Taoiseach had come up with “any plan of action” to tackle the housing crisis at its root.
In January, the President of the High Court issued a direction to remove debt cases from Honohon.
The direction signed by Mr Justice Peter Kelly stated that motions for judgement in summary summons proceedings, the majority of which are debt cases, will no longer be set down for hearing before Honohan.
Instead, they now go directly to a judge of the High Court. The direction did not state the reason for this decision.
Section 110 loopholes
The focus of Honohon’s presentation was on the possible abuse in Ireland of Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) legislation, whereby companies are setting up and registering as charities.https://www.facebook.com/Lukemingflanagan/videos/655587204901787/
Such loopholes have been highlighted before. In 2016, the government vowed to shut down a controversial loophole that allowed vulture funds to cut their tax rates.
A clause in an act from 1997 allowed large businesses and vulture funds to set up a qualifying section 110 company that was generally structured in such a way so that it was effectively tax-neutral.
Many large funds, which have acquired distressed Irish assets worth hundreds of millions of euro, registered as charities to pay very small amounts of tax, as low as €250 in several cases.
Then in July 2016, it was confirmed that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissionerswould investigate vulture fundswho are using section 110 in Irish tax law to pay small amounts of tax here.
In September 2016, the then Finance Minister Michael Noonan put forward an amendment to section 110 of the Finance Act 1997, which took an immediate effect, which prevented vulture funds from being able to use Section 100 vehicles to avoid profits on sales of Irish assets.
However, since then, some politicians such as Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty has said loopholes and ways around the legislation have been found.
In December 2018, The Irish Times, based on data from Revenue, reported that special purpose vehicles only paid €128 million of tax in Ireland in 2017, equivalent to less than 0.02% of the value of their assets.
Related ReadsBill which aims to force banks to ask for permission before selling mortgages to vulture funds passes in the DáilVaradkar says he's reluctant to use the term 'vulture fund' to describe firms that have bought up Irish mortgages
In the same month, Permanent TSB Bank confirmed that the ‘special purpose vehicle’ that more than 6,000 of its mortgages have been transferred to will be exempt from tax.
Chief executive of PTSB, Jeremy Masding, appeared before the Oireachtas Finance Committee, along with other executives from his bank and from Pepper in Ireland (a company that acts as the middle man between the mortgage-holder and vulture fund).

Doherty attempted to confirm with the executives that they set-up the vehicle, also known as a Section 110 company, which would operate tax-free.
It took nine consecutive questions for bank executives to admit the €1.3 billion mortgage ‘vehicle’ won’t pay tax.
Varadkar vowed to close any loophole identified as being used in the case.
According to Honohan, who was an adviser to the former Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy when the securitisation tax break (Section 110) was introduced in the 1990s, it was never intended to be employed where the collateral consisted of Irish homes, farms or firms.
In his presentation, Honohan offered two possible solutions to tackle this anomaly, a “pincer movement” as he called it, whereby the Revenue Commissioners present the special vehicle companies with a tax assessment based on their entire profits.
He said this puts those companies on the defensive, where they would have to justify paying no tax.
If that fails, he said a case on the breach of State aid could be brought by the European Commission, simply asking how would the market look today if Section 110 did not apply to those companies availing of the loopholes.
Following his visit to the European Parliament this week, Honohon said he will now visit the European Commission.
Ming Flanagan said the issue of a case being taken against Ireland in relation to the State aid, Section 110 tax rules and vulture funds has already been raised with Max Lienemeyer, Head of Sector in the Task Force Tax Planning Practices in the European Commission, as well as the Directorate-General for Competition.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lisa-smith-will-have-right-to-return-to-ireland-4534537-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that Lisa Smith, who has reportedly been detained in Syria, will be allowed to return to Ireland as it is the “compassionate” thing to do.
On Friday night it emerged that Smith, originally from Dundalk, was being held in northern Syria on suspicion of Islamic State membership.
Speaking in Dublin today, Varadkar said more information is needed on Smith’s case and that a security assessment will be carried before she is allowed return to Ireland.
“As an Irish citizen, she will have the right to return to Ireland, as will her child who’s an Irish citizen.
“But it’s not just as simple as coming here, and everything proceeding as if nothing had happened,” he said.

Minister for Children, Katherine Zappone said the Government would attend to the best interest of Smith’s two-year-old child, adding “I think that’s the way the government has always operated”.
Yesterday, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said that the State will make every effort to bring Smith home.
Flanagan told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics today: “I understand there is an Irish citizen… She’s keen to come home. Every effort will be made by Irish authorities to ensure she gets home.”
He added it’s a very complex situation, and that the relevant facts must be ascertained before further steps are taken.
This sentiment was echoed by Varadkar who told reporters that “going to Syria, going to live in what was called the Islamic State is not in itself an offence or a crime,” adding that the Government will need to carry out an investigation.
“There may need to be a prosecution there and we need to make sure that if she does return to Ireland that she isn’t a threat to anybody,” Varadkar said.
Security sources have toldTheJournal.iethat the woman left the Defence Forces in 2011 and married a Muslim man. She had earlier converted to Islam. It is believed she left for Syria in 2015 after her initial marriage broke down.
It is understood she is currently being detained by the US armed forces based in northern Syria.

https://www.thejournal.ie/report-dochas-prison-women-4538338-Mar2019/,"A NEW REPORT published by the Department of Justice is reporting allegations of “inappropriate relationships” between some women prisoners at the Dóchas centre in Dublin “and a small number of male staff”.
The allegations are contained in the just published annual report by the Visiting Committee for 2017 for the country’s only dedicated women’s prison in the Mountjoy campus.
The authors state: “Allegations have come to our attention of inappropriate relationships between some women and a small number of male staff.”
On allegations against Dóchas staff, the authors state that “if it is found that the behaviour of any prison officer, male or female, towards these women does not measure up to the highest professional standards demanded there is a clear duty on management, the Prison Service or other appropriate agency to take the necessary action”.
Pointing out that the female inmates at Dóchas “are among the most vulnerable cohort in society”, the authors state that “if the appropriate action is not taken or is inadequate, something is radically wrong”.
The authors state that where an allegation of inappropriate conduct is made against prison staff “we believe that as a matter of course these investigations should be conducted by external investigators who are unconnected with the prison service”.
The publication of the report follows the Irish Prison Service launching a probe in November 2017 into suspicions that 34-year-old killer, ‘Scissor Sister’ murderer Charlotte Mulhall was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a male staff member after he was found in the en-suite bathroom of her accommodation in the Dóchas Centre women’s prison.

Elsewhere in the 2017 Visiting Committee report, the authors hit out at the continued over-crowding at the Dochas centre.
They state that “the numbers in Dóchas continue to rise and have reached well into the 130s during 2017. With a total capacity of 105, this is unacceptable over-crowding and a very serious strain on resources. It forces ‘doubling-up’, the use of bunk beds in small rooms and the use of recreation rooms as sleeping quarters often with four beds to a room”.
They state: “Management have tried to alleviate the worst consequences of this problem. It remains unresolved and leads to disruption, behavioural problems and serious discontent.”
The authors of the report also state that Dóchas requires urgent works to the building stating that the centre is in need of an urgent upgrade.
The authors also state that “it continues to be a matter of concern that despite constant monitoring, drugs remain a serious problem within Dóchas”.
They state: “We are aware that this is pervasive across the prison system. We fully understand that the problem of supply is difficult to monitor but we would urge that more resources are made available to curb this on-going and very serious issue.”
On the allegations of inappropriate relationships between women prisoners and a small number of male staff at Dochas, a spokesman for the Prison Officers Association (POA) said that it is POA policy not to make any comment on such matters where disciplinary processes may be ongoing.
The Irish Prison Service has been asked to comment on the contents of the Visiting Committee report, including the reported allegations of ‘inappropriate  relationships’ between women prisoners and the small number of male staff but has yet to reply.","9.16pm, 12 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/pubs-in-dublin-4549345-Mar2019/,"TWO OUT OF three pubs in Dublin expect to see their business grow in 2019 as the gin and craft beer trend continues.
Almost half of Dublin pubs (48%) are expecting growth in the region of 1–10%, 18% forecast growth of 11–24%, and 2% are anticipating an increase in business of 25% or more.
The figures are included in a report, The State of the Dublin Pub Trade 2019, published by the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) ahead of the group’s AGM tomorrow.
While the majority of Dublin pubs expect to see an increase in business, 21% believe things will stay the same this year, 10% are forecasting a 1–10% drop, and 1% think their business will decline by 11–24%.
Despite the positive outlook, many publicans are worried about the impact Brexit could have on tourism as well as the VAT rate in the hospitality sector increasing from 9% to 13.5% in January.
The LVA said the situation in Dublin pubs is “in contrast to the uncertainty experienced by hospitality and tourism businesses based outside the capital, with difficult trading conditions being widely reported”.
A spokesperson for the organisation added that the survey data highlights “a growing ‘two-tier’ outlook in the tourism and hospitality industries between Dublin and the rest of the country”.
Extra staff
The research also found that the average Dublin pub expects to hire an additional five staff members this year, two in full-time roles and three in part-time positions. This adds to the current 12 full-time staff members and 15 part-time members of staff employed on average in pubs across the capital.
Providing food has also become an increased area of focus within the Dublin trade and that trend looks set to continue in 2019, with 60% of pubs expecting to see their food business grow.

Four out of 10 Dublin pubs expect to be refurbished this year, with one in eight planning to spend more than €100,000.
Despite the positive outlook, the LVA said pubs are facing challenges such as Brexit, staffing issues, the cost of insurance, and competition.
Pubs in the capital faced an average insurance cost increase of 50% over the last three years. The average insurance premium for Dublin pubs is now €25,000 per year.
More than half of the pubs across Dublin also suspect they have been the victims of a fraudulent claim within the last five years, according to the survey.
Competition from other pubs, restaurants, hotels, cafés, trips abroad and other hospitality/tourism businesses were also highlighted as a concern.
Music, gin and craft beer
Six out of 10 Dublin pubs host live music in their establishments, while only one in 20 does not feature any kind of music, according to the report.
The growth of the gin trend is also reflected across the capital, with half of Dublin pubs now stocking more than 10 different types of gin. Craft beer is also becoming increasingly common in bars across Dublin, with 40% of pubs now serving six types or more.
The day of leaving a cash float behind the bar is also decreasing in the capital. One third of pubs in Dublin say that credit and debit cards now account for more than half of all their transactions.
Speaking about the survey, Donal O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said the survey’s findings “seem to confirm the growing discrepancy throughout the tourism and hospitality sector, with a two-tier system developing”.
O’Keeffe stated that the majority of publicans are “worried about Brexit and what impact that will have on the tourism trade”. “The decision to hike the hospitality VAT rate is deeply worrying in terms our tourism competitiveness,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pope-barbarin-resignation-rejected-4549873-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Mar 2019
POPE FRANCIS HAS rejected the resignation of a French cardinal convicted of a sex abuse cover-up.
Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, France’s highest-ranking Catholic official, received a six-month suspended jail sentence for failing to report sex abuse by a priest under his authority.
Barbarin, 68, is the most senior French cleric caught up in the global paedophilia scandal that has rocked the Catholic Church. He has been a cardinal since 2003.
He said after his 7 March conviction that he would travel to Rome to tender his resignation.
That meeting took place yesterday and it had been expected it could take several weeks for the Pope to decide whether to accept the resignation.
“Monday morning, I handed over my mission to the Holy Father. He spoke of the presumption of innocence and did not accept this resignation,” Barbarin, who has appealed his sentence, said in a statement.
If accepted, Barbarin would have become “bishop emeritus” of the southeastern French city of Lyon but remained cardinal.
Barbarin has said he would remain in Lyon pending his appeal. However, he added that he would step back from his job “for a little while”. This would allow, at the Pope’s “suggestion”, the local vicar general Yves Baumgarten to run day-to-day affairs.

‘Unheard of’
The Pope’s decision has triggered sharp surprise from the chairman of the Bishops’ Conference of France, who called the situation “unheard of”.
“I did not expect this scenario which falls between the two most expected,” Georges Pontier told AFP.
He added that this “unheard of” situation resulted from the difficulty of “respecting the judicial process” along with the need to “look after the Lyon diocese”.
On 7 March, a Lyon court ruled that Barbarin was guilty of failing to report allegations of abuse of boy scouts committed by a priest, Bernard Preynat, in the 1980s and 1990s.
The Pope had previously defended the cardinal, saying in 2016 that his resignation before a trial would be “an error, imprudent”.
Barbarin’s lawyer has announced plans to fight the guilty ruling, which was hailed by abuse victims as ushering in a new period of accountability in the French Church.
This case comes as the Pope has been seeing to restore faith in the Catholic Church following a slew of abuse scandals across the world, including in Australia, Chile and the United States.

https://www.thejournal.ie/raise-the-roof-rally-cork-4529752-Mar2019/,"Following Saturday’s housing and homeless rally in Dublin, activists, politicians and members of the public are expected to gather in Cork city tonight participate in a demonstration over Ireland’s housing crisis.
Crowds outside Leinster House in Dublin during a Raise the Roof protest in OctoberNiall CarsonNiall Carson
Since last summer, the country has seen an increase in activists raising awareness over housing issues, as the rental crisis in Ireland deepens and homelessness continues to increase.
Take Back The City (TBTC) over the summerheld numerous protestsin Dublin city centre, alongside a range of occupations of properties in the north inner city.
In October, thousands of people gathered outside the Dáil for Ireland’s first ‘Raise the Roof’ protest over the government’s handling of the housing crisis. Raise the Roof is made up of a group of trade unions, housing activists and campaign groups.
In December, thousands again turned out for a major rally held by the National Homeless and Housing Coalition (NHHC) in Dublin.Two days ago, the coalition held another rally, which saw people take to the streets again in anger.
Today, ONE Cork and a number of other groups are coming together at 5pm outside Cork City Hall to hold the county’s first Raise the Roof protest, in the build up to a national rally in May.
“It’s really a huge coming together of a multitude of different social groupings to try get the government to see sense and realise the reliance on the private sector is failing, has failed and will continue to fail,” Barry Murphy, housing spokesperson for One Cork and deputy general secretary of OPATSI said.
Crowds of housing protestors gathered outside government buildings on 30 OctoberBrian LawlessBrian Lawless
Murphy noted that the housing crisis isn’t just a Dublin-centric issue, and that it’s an issue in towns and villages around the country, too.
“This is a countrywide problem, it doesn’t only happen in the cities,” he said.

Murphy also hit out at the recent homelessemergency accommodation figures for January, which showed that there are now a combined total of 9,987 people homeless and living in emergency accommodation in Ireland, a significant rise of 234 people from December.
He raised the point that there is a large number of people who are homeless in Ireland who are not included in the monthly figures – meaning that the figure has, in reality, far surpassed 10,000.
The monthly number recorded by the Department of Housing records only those in Section 10 funded emergency accommodation. More on that can beread here.
“We have people who are homeless who are not even counted – people who are couchsurfing, we have overcrowded conditions with young families living with parents, we have people waiting eight to 10 years on the housing list,” Murphy said.
“I think it’s appalling.”

Tonight’s rally
The first Raise the Roof rally in October was held to coincide with a debate in the Dáil on a private members bill on housing drafted and signed by 47 TDs from Sinn Féin, People Before Profit, Solidarity, Social Democrats, Labour, the Green Party, Independents4Change and others.
Murphy said that tonight’s protest is being held to call on the government to act on the motion which was passed in the Dáil in October.
Similarly, speaking ahead of last Saturday, NHHC co-chairperson Tina MacVeigh toldTheJournal.iethat the Dublin rally was being held to highlight that motion which called for “practical measures to be put into place which would at least put a block or a stop to the spiralling out of control of the housing crisis”.
“The government have not listened and we need to be on the streets to say to the government the people spoke last year, not only on the streets but also through our elected representatives,” she said.
“Our voices manifested in that motion, the Dáil voted for it, you are ignoring it. We will not be ignored.”
Murphy added: “We’ve all come together from all walks of life, from all backgrounds, from all different cultures to say to the government that it failed, it’s continuing to fail and we’re not going away.

The Star Onlinereported that the victim has been identified as Brian Patrick O’Reilly (50), who working in George Town, Penang, which is a four-hour drive north of Kuala Lumpur.
The Department of Foreign Affairs toldTheJournal.iethat it is “aware and the case and providing consular assistance”.
The news outlet reported that a George Town police chief Che Zaimani Che Awang said they believe the victim was hit with a pot and frying pan, and received several stab wounds.
The Straits Timeshas reported that two people have been detained in relation to the investigation.
Discovery of body

The body was reportedly discovered by a property agent.
“The property agent had contacted the deceased on Saturday to get the keys from him in but to no avail,” the police chief said, according to theNew Straits Times.
When he failed to contact the victim, the property agent and a representative for the building management went to his apartment, the report said. When they knocked on the door, a “fair-skinned” man walked out, informing them the victim was “unwell and all appointments had to be cancelled”.
The agent tried to contact the victim again on Monday but he was unsuccessful. He then called O’Reilly’s company to ask for the keys and upon the company’s advice, took a locksmith to the property to break open the door, according to the report.
“As soon as he walked into the unit, he found the deceased’s body sprawled in the master bedroom,” the police chief said.
He said checks on the closed circuit television camera (CCTV) in the lobby of the building showed four men, including O’Reilly, entering a lift to his unit on Friday evening. Several minutes later, all four left the building.
The Star Online reported that he said police found a handwritten note near O’Reilly which read: ““I respected the police & still do but justice sometimes has to be gained. I hate you mafia [sic] kiling scamers, I love my girl”.
The New Straits Times reported that the case is being investigated as murder.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-influencers-wellness-products-guidelines-4527213-Mar2019/,"IRISH INFLUENCERS HAVE begun promoting ‘wellness’ products on their Instagram pages – but the advertising watchdog says that any claims must be backed up by evidence.
Some of the most popular products seen on Irish influencers pages include vitamin and gut-health supplements. Some are brand ambassadors for the products.
One Irish influencer posted on Instagram that a gut health product – for which they are a brand ambassador – led to “non-existent” irritable bowel syndrome, stopping stomach ulcers, and greater tolerance to food, as well as improved skin and arthritis. The influencer has over 35k followers.
Claims like the ones made on their post are likely to come under scrutiny by the ASAI.
Health claims
Regarding wellness products, the CEO of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI), Orla Twomey, toldTheJournal.ie: “The type of products [promoted by influencers] would be essentially functional food supplements. There are rules which we have reflected in our code in making health and nutritional claims about food.”
She said that the influencer must ensure that the effect claimed about the product must be registered and must appear on theEU register of nutrition and health claims.
“If you were to say calcium has an effect on bone health, you can say it supports bone health – you can’t say it’s going to transform [your bones] into the strongest ever,” she said.
The ASAIpoints out in its guidance that, for example, in the case of a product that calls itself a probiotic, there are no approved health claims.
There are also no approved health claims for prebiotics.
To date, there has not been a huge amount of complaints about influencers and health supplements. “But they certainly do come before our remit if the material the blogger is doing is a marketing communication,” said Twomey.
She said that it is the company engaging with the blogger or influencer which has the primary responsibility in making sure the influencer does not make unsubstantiated claims about a wellness product.
Twomey encourages bloggers who engage with companies over wellness products to ask where is the evidence for any claims.
“If the marketing communications make general claims, there needs to be evidence that the product has that effect,” she said. “We wouldn’t be asking the blogger to go and do robust scientific tests on themselves.”
She said that if the influencer makes specific claims about what the product does or has done for them, “there must be evidence that the product generally does have that effect”.
Advertisement
Testimonials, which tend to be used in traditional media, are not evidence of a claim, said Twomey. “If product claims are made in testimonials we would require [evidence] to back it up,” she said.
Twomey said that it is not surprising that influencer marketing is moving into different areas. But she said that influencers “have to be careful about what they say”.
“They can’t extrapolate [an] unsubstantiated claim that a company wouldn’t,” she said.
The ASAI has recently dealt with influencers and asked them to change or remove posts following complaints about the content in them.
Medical devices
Twomey said the wellness trend is one “that is going to continue because we do see that trends that start in the States [spread here], apart from medicines, which won’t happen”.
Indeed, Ireland has yet to follow the US, wheresome influencers have begun advertising medical devices.

Twomey explained that it is unlikely that Irish influencers will begin working with medical brands chiefly because of advertising standards in this country.
“In Europe you cannot advertise prescription medications to people,” she said. “You can in the US, and there’s lots of warnings that have to go on the ads. But here you can’t advertise prescription medications to the public, [and] I couldn’t see that as something that would be a trend that would take off here.”
She said that the Health Products Regulatory Authority would have a “strong role” in this area.
Complaints
The ASAI received 107 complaints in 2018 about influencer marketing. “Not every complaint we get turns out to be about a marketing communication,” said Twomey. “We are very careful that we don’t assume unless the context is very clear that it is a marketing communication.”
Consumers are engaging with the area of influencer marketing “quite extensively”, said Twomey. “We are very happy the awareness of what is required has increased substantially over the last few years.”  She said that it is an issue the ASAI will continue to focus on.
When content is an advertisement, it must comply with all relevant rules, including those around truthfulness and honesty. In addition, the rules for health and beauty products include rules relates to medical claims, insection 11 of the ASAI Code.
There are also rules in the food and non-alcoholic beveragessection of the ASAI Coderelating to health and nutritional claims for food products, which includes supplements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-jr-brexit-4551231-Mar2019/,"THE SON OF US President Donald Trump has said that UK Prime Minister “ignored advice” from his father and was now leaving the British people in limbo over Brexit.
Writing a piecein this morning’s Daily Telegraph, Donald Trump Jr said that Theresa May needs to “honour that promise” to British people that the nation would leave the EU on 29 March.
“With the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead,” he said.
Trump Jr’s comments come with less than 10 days now until the official date the UK is due to leave the EU.
However, after House of Commons Speaker John Bercowruled out holding a third meaningful vote on May’s much-maligned Brexit withdrawal agreement, the prime ministeris set to formally request that Brexit be postponed.

Other EU member states are expected to consider her request at a summit in Brussels tomorrow.
As well as claiming May had ignored the advice of President Trump, Trump Jr said May is ignoring the will of the British people too.
“Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost – exactly as the European elites were hoping,” he said. “Some pro-Brexit politicians even suggest that Mrs May herself is trying to sabotage Brexit, by insisting that Parliament agree to a deal that essentially keeps Britain bound to the EU indefinitely.”
Trump Jr said this situation is important to note for Americans because Brexit is an example of how “established elites will try to subvert the will of the people” when given the opportunity.
“In a way, you could say that Brexit and my father’s election are one and the same – the people of both the UK and the US voted to uproot the establishment for the sake of individual freedom and independence, only to see the establishment try to silence their voices and overturn their mandates,” he added.
He added that the people of the UK and US must reaffirm their decisions in previous elections and “stand up for themselves against the global elite”.
The end of the article lists Trump Jr as executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

THE FIRST IRISH rape victim to waive her anonymity after the man convicted of raping her received a suspended sentence has said that she was always made to feel that campaigning for the introduction of victim impact statements “was the wrong thing”.
After the man who violently assaulted her when she was 19 walked free, Lavinia Kerwick  waived her right to anonymity in an interview with Gerry Ryan on RTÉ 2FM in 1993.
Lavinia told last night’sLate Late Showthat she’s never listened back to the interview because she “remembers every word”.
Kerwick credited the late presenter Ryan for helping her to tell her story. Lavinia said last night that Gerry Ryan’s use of the word “rape” caught her attention:

“Pre-90/91, you would never hear the word ‘rape’ on radio, it was like a curse word,” she said.
She said that the moment was “hugely important” for her.
“It was like sitting beside him, I didn’t realise there were 100,000s of people listening. It was very personal, he was hugely compassionate. From start to finish, I did not hear him interrupt that conversation.”
During her campaign for the introduction of victim impact statements, and said that she was made to feel like she was “doing the wrong thing”. When applause of thanks broke out from presenter Ryan Tubridy and the studio audience for her work to introduce victim impact statements in Ireland, Lavinia said that she hadn’t received anything like it before.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Addressing the camera, she asked for others who had been raped to tell their family, friends, or the authorities.

https://www.thejournal.ie/stolen-car-sales-4525707-Mar2019/,"A FATHER OF eight who agreed to sell ten stolen cars for almost €90,000 on the Donedeal website is to be sentenced next May.
Nicholas Keane (41) later told gardaí in interview that the operation gave him the chance to make money because he was behind on his maintenance.
“I wanted to get money together to give my kids a good Christmas”, he said.
He apologised for the crimes and said he felt bad for those that lost money.
“I feel terrible, I feel guilty. If I won the lotto I would pay them all back”.
Keane of Chapel Street, Balbriggan, Dublin, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to ten counts of handling stolen vehicles and two charges of inducing another to purchase a stolen vehicle on dates between July and October 2016.
He has a number of previous convictions including theft, stealing cars, road traffic and drug offences.
Detective Garda William Saunderson told Pieter Le Vert BL, prosecuting, that he was satisfied that Keane’s role was to sell on the cars and that he was not responsible for stealing the vehicles. He was to get paid about €500 for each successful sale.
Keane, who went under the name of David O’Brien, would meet the purchaser at a pre-arranged rendezvous, hand over the registration details and the car and accept the payment for the vehicle in cash.
He took in a total of €88,795, which he told gardaí he then handed over to a man with “a foreign accent”.
Det Gda Saunderson said that many people reported the vehicles as stolen to the gardaí themselves when they noticed discrepancies on the tax discs on the car.

Keane met all of his potential customers in public areas around Dublin and, as he was not wearing a disguise, he was clearly captured on CCTV cameras.
A number of victims, stated in victim impact reports before the court, how the financial loss they suffered greatly impacted on their lives.
Most of the buyers had carried out vehicle checks on the cars before agreeing to buy them, with one man taking it to his local mechanic to be looked over.
Many people bought the car with funds raised from life savings, while others borrowed cash or traded in old vehicles to complete the sale.
One woman, who had borrowed money from her sister and credit union to buy a vehicle from Keane for €13,750, had to later borrow more money from the credit union to pay back her sister and buy a new car. The family was under extreme pressure as a result and she had to get another job to help back the debt.
Another man, who had paid €9,500 for a car from Keane, worried about having enough income to pay his mortgage and was under so much stress that his long-term relationship broke down.
This man and another victim, indicated that there was a need to have some sort of assistance in place to help compensate people who found themselves victims of such crimes.
John Byrne BL, defending, said that Keane had worked on building sites but ran into financial difficulties while out of work and was lured into offending by the promise of easy money.
Byrne said his client had no involvement with stealing the cars, but rather that he was “the front of house man”, the person “who dupes people into buying the cars”.
He said Keane accepted a high degree of moral culpability and said he had no financial means to repay the victims.
Judge Melanie Greally ordered a probation report and remanded Keane in custody. She adjourned the matter for finalisation on 28 May next.

https://www.thejournal.ie/warning-about-alcohol-st-patricks-day-4543486-Mar2019/,"THE HSE HAS warned that the bank holiday weekend will be very busy for emergency departments due to an increase in the number of people presenting with alcohol-related injuries.
The organisation said there is always an increase in such cases over a public holiday such as St Patrick’s’ Day, but particularly when it falls on a weekend.
Dr Gerry McCarthy, the HSE’s Emergency Medicine Programme Lead, said all patients who present to EDs will be seen and treated, and “as always, the sickest and most urgent patients will be prioritised”.
However, he added that patients presenting with non-urgent injuries “should be aware that they may face longer waiting times depending on the number of patients attending EDs and the severity of patient illnesses”.
“There are lots of sporting events and leisure activities on this weekend that tend to drive traffic towards the health services,” he stated.

McCarthy said alcohol is always one of the main reasons for the increase in numbers attending EDs over a long weekend.
“Our wish is for everyone to enjoy the weekend and we hope you won’t have to come and see us.
“Unfortunately, as in previous years, we expect to see a significant number of patients presenting due to alcohol-related injuries and illness.
St Patrick’s weekend is a very busy time for the National Ambulance Service too. Martin Dunne, Director of the NAS, also encouraged people not to drink excessively.
Dunne reminded people that just because they are brought to hospital in an ambulance, it does not mean they will be seen quicker at an ED.
“Whilst we fully appreciate that this is a very special celebratory weekend in our national calendar and we appreciate that everyone will want to enjoy their weekend to its fullest, however we would appeal to everyone to do so in a safe and enjoyable way,” he said.
The HSE also reminded people to never drink and drive, and for people on medication to consider the potential side effects of mixing it with alcohol.

https://www.the42.ie/brian-morrisroe-league-of-ireland-legends-st-patricks-athletic-brian-kerr-interview-4516289-Mar2019/,"IT WAS THE summer of 1995 when football really started to kick off for Brian Morrisroe. Boyzone were top of the charts, St Pat’s would soon be top of the league and everything was fitting into place perfectly.
“A year later I was a league champion,” he explains, “played in an FAI Cup final, was awarded Young Player of the Year, had been named man-of-the-match after scoring the winner against Southampton at Richmond Park and played against Slovan Bratislava in the Uefa Cup. A magical year.”
On top of that, he was picked alongside a squad of the League of Ireland’s top performers to travel to Atlanta. They would play against the South Carolina Shamrocks in a set of matches which helped prepare the USA’s 1996 Olympic soccer team for that summer’s Games. “Tony Sheridan, Stephen Geoghegan, Jonathan Prizeman, Trevor Croly. Jesus, we had a fantastic squad,” he smiles, remembering the trip Stateside.
But it all began with that pre-season prior to the 1995/96 Premier Division campaign, one that would see St Patrick’s Athletic crowned League of Ireland champions for the first time in six years upon their return to Richmond Park, having spent a number of years exiled at Harold’s Cross — where players would complain about the consistent presence of dog shit on the pitch during games. “You’d be afraid going up for a header at Harold’s Cross,” former Pat’s defender Paul ‘Soupy’ Campbell once said. “You wouldn’t know what was stuck to the ball.”
The Saints faced John Aldridge’s Tranmere Rovers, York City and Southampton in three friendly games in Inchicore that would propel Morrisroe from a young, inexperienced and shy winger plying his trade with St Pats’ reserves, to an instrumental part of Brian Kerr’s iconic title-winning side.
“When you think about it,” the 46-year-old, who now works as an administrator with the HSE, says delving into some happy nostalgia. “Eddie Gormley,Paul Osam, Liam Buckley, Soupy, Ricky O’Flaherty, John McDonnell, Dave Campbell. It was a phenomenal team.”

“1995 is where it all began for me,” Morrisroe says. “That summer we played Tranmere with Pat Nevin and John Aldridge, and Southampton with Lawrie McMenemy. I scored against Tranmere to give us the lead and they equalised late on, this was on the Monday, and we should have beaten them. Then on the Wednesday night we played Southampton. Matt Le Tissier was on that team, he was playing down the right side and I was playing on the left, so we were at loggerheads all game.
“But I’ll always remember what Lawrie McMenemy said to me. I got mobbed after the game with little kids looking for my autograph, and I was one of the last into our dressing room. Lawrie was standing at our door with Dave Beasant at Richmond Park and he said: ‘Listen kid, sensational fucking goal, fair play to you’ and he shook my hand. It was Roy of the Rovers stuff.
“I was shaking Lawrie’s hand, it was like a big shovel. Right there and then I knew I had a chance of breaking into the Pat’s first team on a more regular basis for that 1995/96 season.”

Morrisroe was born and raised in Perrystown, South Dublin, and lived a stone’s throw away from Niall Quinn, who he says was a local hero and an all-round athlete supremo during the 1970s before joining Arsenal and moving on to Manchester City.
“He lived probably 150 yards from my door. Up the avenue and around the corner, he lived just there. I used to call into Niall and his dad — God rest him — would answer the door and we’d ask ‘is Niall coming out to play a game of football?’ And he would always come out and play football with us as kids, even though he was about five years older than us. We all looked up to him because he was an all-round athlete. He played gaelic, football, hurling for Dublin, everything. He’s a lovely, lovely fella.”
Morrisroe began his own footballing career with Leinster Senior League side Manortown before Liam Buckley, then a 33-year-old player/assistant manager with St Patrick’s Athletic — having enjoyed a phenomenal career with teams like the Vancouver Whitecaps, KSV Waregem in Belgium and Racing de Santander in Spain’s La Liga — convinced Brian Kerr to take a chance on him.
Morrisroe plied his trade with Walsh’s reserves before earning his big break after those impressive pre-season displays against Tranmere and Southampton before the start of their 1995/96 title-winning campaign. A scary dressing room to come into, he says, with big characters like McDonnell, Gormley, Osam and Buckley to contend with for a reserved and inexperienced young lad, who had been playing Leinster Senior League football only a couple of years beforehand.
The winger joined St Pat's in 1993 from the Leinster Senior League.
“It was a bit daunting at the time, I have to say. You’re training with these guys and hearing stories about them winning leagues and cup finals. So I was a bit intimidated by it. I was a really young 22-year-old, if that makes sense. I was very immature and a bit shy. There were a lot of big characters in that dressing room like John McDonnell, John ‘Trapper’ Treacy, Paul Campbell, Dave Campbell, Paul Osam.
Morrisroe credits Kerr with creating a ruthless, winners’ environment for St Pat’s to thrive in during the 1990s. A football fanatic with an outrageous attention to detail, “a lunatic,” he says, Morrisroe recalls getting lifts home with Kerr, and that he would oftentimes be terrified of his manager.
“I called Brian ‘Columbo’, that was my nickname for him, because he had this mad trench-coat,” Morrisroe smiles. “A three-quarter length trench coat combined with the black hair and he was the spitting image of Columbo.
“Brian used to drop me home and I’d be real sheepish in the car with him. He had this old banger he used to drive back when he worked out in UCD. He worked as a lab technician in horticulture, so that’s where he got his other nickname‘the Greener’.

“My wife was a student at UCD at the time. He used to drop her to college and then ended up dropping me home from training too. Bizarre. I’d be sitting in the car with him, and this old banger would be full of match programmes and paper — real messy. I would be sitting there and there’d be hardly a word spoken between us. It was like going home with your fucking teacher, that’s what it felt like.
“I was a timid young fella and would be sitting there with Brian thinking ‘what do I say here?’ He did see something in me eventually, and it comes back to Liam Buckley because he told Brian Kerr to take a chance on me. They did and it worked out. For me, certainly.”
St Pat’s won the title in 1990 on a wet and horrible day up in Drogheda under Kerr but it would be another six years before the Saints would clinch the Premier Division again. With a squad filled with League of Ireland icons like Osam, captain McDonnell, Gormley patrolling midfield and Galway-born striker O’Flaherty, they pipped Bohemians after going 25 games unbeaten in the second half of the season.
Newly-appointed Ireland manager Mick McCarthy was in attendance at Richmond Park for a pivotal 3-0 victory against Galway United in April 1996. It was a result which meant St Pat’s could wrap up the title a few days later away to Dundalk up at Oriel Park.

“It was with my right foot and I was outside the box. George Hamilton did the commentary for RTÉ and he was picking me out and saying that Mick McCarthy was at the game. I scored one and made another that night against Galway, this was a week before we played Dundalk up at Oriel. Basically we only needed two points from our last two games to win the league, so we knew going up to Dundalk that if we won, we’d wrap up the title then and there.”

Ask any Saints supporter of a certain age about that 2-1 victory at Oriel Park and you will see their face light up as they grin from ear-to-ear. After going behind, a looping Ricky O’Flaherty header levelled proceedings, before Paul Campbell swung a sublime free-kick right into the Dundalk top corner in the 86th minute.
Cue a pitch invasion and Brian Kerr dancing like a giddy schoolkid on the sideline, punching the air and falling to his knees as his side were crowned champions for the fifth time in the club’s history, Kerr’s second title in six years.
“Richie Purdy was sent off very early for Dundalk,” remembers Morrisroe. “So they played the majority of the game with 10 men, and we still barely got past them. They got a scrawny goal to go ahead, it hit our goalkeeper’s hand, hit the bar and tiddled over the line. Ricky equalised with a magnificent header from a Peter Carpenter cross to make it 1-1, he must have headed it from 15 yards out into the far corner, incredible.
By that stage substituted off and watching on through helpless, nervous eyes, Morrisroe says that the final whistle and the subsequent pitch invasion was a moment of pure euphoria. The Saints had reached their promised land, he says.

“It was just absolute madness,” he says, re-watching a YouTube clip of the game’s final moments. “We were sitting on the bench and I remember I was absolutelysoakedfrom head to toe with the muck and the rain, because it was a shit night up there.
‘I remember the goal going in and all of us on the bench and Brian jumping up onto the sideline. Brian was down on his knees. There was a pitch invasion, the referee had to stop the game and get everyone off because there were still a few minutes of play left.
“The bus went down by Shelbourne’s ground Tolka Park and we sang a song outside. Next, we turned the bus around, went up to Phibsborough, went by Dalymount Park and sang another song there and sprayed beer everywhere.
“Eventually we got back to Inchicore and we were there until four o’clock in the morning in the Horse & Jockey and McDowell’s too — we were going from one pub to the other. Absolute carnage. It was the best night of my life.”

Morrisroe says that, with St Patrick’s Athletic having almost gone out of business, nearly into receivership during the early 1990s and forced to play their games exiled at Harold’s Cross, winning a league title upon their return to a newly-developed Richmond Park was a very special feeling.
Campbell, the goalscorer with that 86th-minute free-kick,said in an interview last year that he played the final few minutes of their 2-1 winin Dundalk with tears in his eyes. Campbell said that the entire squad knew just how much the title win meant to supporters, to Kerr and to Inchicore, an area exploited by drug dealers during the 1990s. It was a community that took so much pride in their football club.
“There were a lot of drug issues there and the area was quite run down at the time. The fans were fantastic though. You had so many young kids and teenagers at our games and I suppose in a small way, once every week or so it gave them somewhere to go on a Friday night.
“It was so sentimental winning the league that year for the Inchicore faithful,” Morrisroe adds. “Because that was the first league the club won back in its rightful home at Richmond Park after the years away at Harold’s Cross.”
From the best night of his life, the winger experienced significant heartbreak on the field when the Dubliners attempted to complete a historic league and cup double a week later against Shelbourne.
St Patrick's Athletic FC/ YouTube
The 1996 FAI Cup final ended in a 1-1 draw, Tony Sheridan’s incredible lob being most people’s abiding memory of the encounter at Lansdowne Road, with Shelbourne coming out on top 2-1 in the replay at Dalymount Park a week later.
“I have sleepless nights about that FAI Cup final replay. Fucking sleepless nights. With three or four minutes left to go I’m through one-on-one with the goalkeeper Alan Gough. I’m just about to shoot to win the game — win the FAI Cup and the double, end the Pat’s hoo-doo in the cup — and Greg Costello drags me down for a penalty, which Eddie Gormley missed.
“I can’t get that memory out of my head, I was just about to shoot to potentially win the cup final and Greg drags me down, absolutely cynical. But listen, it worked. Eddie Gormley misses the penalty, Alan Gough put it out for a corner, caught the corner and threw the ball out to Mark Rutherford,who ran down the left and they scored through Stephen Geoghegan and win 2-1.It was a sickner of sickners.
“I always think I could have been the one to have scored in the FAI Cup final that won us the double and ended the hoo-doo. Greg. Fucking. Costello,” Morrisroe laughs.
St Pat’s were denied a historic league and cup double, with Morrisroe staying just one more season at Richmond Park before spending time at Shamrock Rovers, Dundalk, Athlone Town under Liam Buckley, Dublin City and Sporting Fingal, before retiring in 2007, always trying to chase the high of that 1996 title win and replicate it elsewhere.

A combination of reasons led to his departure at the age of 25, with the winger admitting today that he regrets his decision to bid farewell. “I have one league winners’ medal, and I should probably have three,” Morrisroe sighs.
Kerr stepped down as manager of St Pat’s in December 1997 to take up a position overseeing Ireland’s underage teams with the FAI. The Drimnagh native enjoyed incredible success at the 1997 World Youth Championships, winning bronze, and winning both the Under 16 and Under 18 Uefa European Championships a year later in 1998, before taking the senior Ireland job.
Pat Dolan took over from Kerr at Richmond Park, with Morrisroe not entirely on board with a new regime which demanded significantly more commitment than was previously expected by a squad of players who worked full-time on top of their football with St Pat’s. Morrisroe worked as a porter with the HSE in Rathmines.

“In fairness to Pat, he had a positive outlook on things. He created all this ‘Super Saints… Saintsmania’ stuff promoting the club. Dolan was great as regards to promoting the league and generating interest in Pat’s and having professional standards. But back then, I just didn’t have that ‘professional’ upbringing. It was a big shock to the system.

“It felt like full-time professionalism, but I had my job as well as a porter. It just didn’t sit with me and a lot of us players were uneasy with this new regime. Pat was just expecting a lot more and looking back on it, he was probably right. The whole league did need to get a lot more professional and grow up if we wanted to compete on a European level and be getting lads over to England.”
He moved onto Shamrock Rovers, making over 50 appearances. It was a side filled with quality, Morrisroe says, but one which failed to live up to its potential and was ultimately pipped to the title by his old club St Pat’s in 1998 and again in 1999.
“We had Marc Kenny, Derek Tracey, Gino Brazil, Paul Whelan, Mark O’Neill, Tony O’Dowd in goal, Tommy Dunne, Jason Sherlock. Phenomenal squad. But in fairness to St Pat’s, their professionalism and fitness regimes under Pat Dolan paid off. We didn’t quite hit our potential at Rovers.
“When we played well, we were brilliant. I remember we beat Dundalk 5-1 one time and absolutely obliterated them. But the next week we might lose to Finn Harps. Consistency was our issue. That’s the way Rovers was at the time. We were playing at Tolka Park and it was a bit unsettled. The fans boycotted the ground.
“I didn’t really have a bond with the Rovers fans the same way I did with Pat’s. No-where near. The Rovers fans are a bit more fickle, they seem to think they have an entitlement to win things. They think they deserve to win a league, just because they’re Shamrock Rovers. That’s the sense I got when I was there.

“They used to be outside the ground after games. We might be going for a pint after matches at the bar in Tolka Park and the fans outside would be losing it, going crazy if you didn’t win on the night. They’d be abusing you saying ‘you were fucking shite tonight!’ And these were supposed to be our own supporters. That sort of stuff would play on your mind.
“It was so in-your-face and so intense. It just didn’t sit right with me.I loved playing for my manager Mick Byrneand I loved playing for my team-mates, but the fans were horrible sometimes. It’s terrible and it shouldn’t be like that, but that was just my experience of the fans.
Morrisroe would spend two years with Dundalk in the First Division, a season with Athlone and one with Dublin City, before walking away from League of Ireland football. He was brought back by his old friend Liam Buckley for one last season at the age of 37 with Sporting Fingal, where Morrisroe was named man-of-the-match on his debut in a 4-0 win against Monaghan United.
You always think you could have won more, he says. Sometimes it can be hard to focus on what you have when the sun seems to be shining more brightly somewhere else, dwelling on the regret of a missed opportunity or the wrong club. But not many players’ have won even one league title, he accepts.

Reflecting on the highs and lows of a League of Ireland career spent in what many would characterise as the domestic league’s heydays during the 1990s and early 2000s, it’s important to focus on the good times, because there were many.
Morrisroe still attends games at Richmond Park, and says that winning a league title having been plucked from obscurity in the Leinster Senior League with a club that possesses a strong character and family-feel like the one at Richmond Park makes those trips down memory lane even sweeter to recollect.
He constantly refers the management of Brian Kerr, citing his sheer relentless passion and attention to detail as hallmarks of St Pat’s success. Often referred to as “the team of the 1990s” in Ireland, the side would win league titles in 1990, 1996, 1998 and 1999.
“I remember playing with fear in the team at that time. I would have been in my early 20s and a lot of the lads were senior pros at that stage, guys with league winners’ medals. The likes of Johnny McDonnell, Ricky O’Flaherty,Eddie Gormley. They all played with no fear, but whereas I found it a bit more difficult.

“But Brian just demanded the best out of everyone and his demands were met, because hegotthe best out of everyone. He certainly got the best of of me. I was plucked from obscurity to suddenly being a league winner and being an important player in the team playing every week. To me it was a meteoric rise and it was down to Brian and Noel O’Reilly, who was a fantastic coach too.
“It was tough, they were there to get the best out of you whether you liked it or not and even though we were part-time, it felt like another job with the high standards that were expected. At times you did feel a bit on your own because if you weren’t playing well, people didn’t really give a fuck about you, that’s the way it was.
Now coaching with Cherry Orchard’s Under 12 side and having spent a number of years playing for the FAI’s Master’s team against players like Jan Kollar, Ivica Olić and Vladimir Smicer, that same passion for football in any capacity at any level, has never waned or diminished.

“Winning the league in 1996 has to be my proudest achievement,” Morrisroe concludes. “Way out there. I was very lucky to have had so many memories in my career in football. The whole experience was incredible, and it’s still going now with the coaching. I’m going off to play an over 35s match later on today. I won’t stop until I can’t walk anymore.
“Even to go back down there to Inchicore for a match now is brilliant. I’m going to the game against Shamrock Rovers next Friday at Richmond Park, without a shadow of a doubt. I’ll be there and will be praying for a Pat’s win.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-quietway-for-dublins-southside-revived-after-metrolink-route-scrapped-4515123-Mar2019/,"Proposed Quietway route.AECOMAECOM
PLANS FOR A Quietway in Dublin are being revived after reports that MetroLink’s Southside section are to bescrapped.
Developed in London in the UK, Portland, Oregon in the United States and in parts of the Netherlands, Quietways are designed to reduce traffic-flow and eliminate rat-running.
Instead of travelling on busy traffic corridors, pedestrians and cyclists would travel along segregated cycle tracks from Kimmage to Donnybrook, on residential streets, laneways and through cul-de-sacs.
Stretching from Herbert Park in Donnybrook to Corrib Road in Terenure, Fine Gael councillor Paddy Smyth’s proposal involves a Quietway running through residential streets across 6.5 kilometres of Dublin’s Southside.
Dublin City Council tendered for a feasibility study in 2016 for this urban Greenway, which was shelved in 2018 after concerns surrounding permeability, access and MetroLink were raised.
The major stumbling block to Dublin’s Quietway is the now-in-jeopardy MetroLink.

“The MetroLink completely torpedoed the plan,” says Smyth. ”That the National Transport Authority [NTA] decided to put a Metro down the middle of Ranelagh.”
MetroLink’s section through Ranelagh cut off pedestrian and cyclist access at Cowper on the Luas Green Line – the midpoint of Smyth’s Quietway.

With a reconfiguration of the area needed to facilitate MetroLink, councillors argued that Smtyh’s Quietway couldn’t proceed. At the time, certain local representatives argued that not enough public consultation took place, either.
Smyth disputes this, however. “I have been pilloried in public and in the chamber for a lack of public consultation on this project,” he says. “But when certain councillors had the opportunity to give the public their say on this, they voted it down.”
The Quietway project, which has estimated cost of close to €1.4 million, was shelved by councillors last May.
Smyth says that he now plans to bring the Quietway plan back to the council chamber in April where he’ll “be asking [council] engineers to start public consultation with all stakeholders”.
The Quietway designed in three sections: from Herbert Park to the Cowper Luas stop, from Cowper Luas stop to Terenure Road North and from Terenure Road North to Corrib Road, according to Smyth. “We can make a really safe route across the city for cyclists.”

https://www.the42.ie/simon-mason-ulster-4513105-Mar2019/,"IT WAS AN unusual sight.
David Humphreys entrusted with the kicking responsibility for his country when he was merely a backup for his province. But, despite having tasted a magnificent season with Ulster, Simon Mason just couldn’t seem to persuade Warren Gatland of his worth.
After his heroics throughout the team’s superb 1999 Heineken Cup campaign – in which he racked up a points record that stood for years – he was still shunned by the Ireland management.
When Ulster conjured a remarkable display to beat Stade Francais in the semi-finals, Humphreys described the full-back as ‘probably the best goal kicker in Europe’ – high praise considering Diego Dominguez and Neil Jenkins were both at their peak while a young fly-half called Jonny Wilkinson was already something special.
That day, Mason struck 18 points, including an outrageous drop goal early on, a piece of magic that seemed to perfectly set the scene for what proved a thrilling and compelling encounter. Still, 72 hours later, when the Irish training squad was announced for a get-together in Galway in advance of the 5 Nations opener against France, Mason was a shock omission.
He’d made his senior debut back in 1996, started three times, kicked 42 points and then disappeared from view.
“I regret not going on and playing more times for Ireland because that’s something I hold very dearly,” he admits.
“Playing at international level and winning my first cap at Lansdowne Road (in a win over Wales) and the second cap at Twickenham…those memories are still equal to the European success with Ulster.”
Mason made his Ireland debut in a 5 Nations clash with Wales in 1996.David JonesDavid Jones
After making his name at Orrell, his experience in the 5 Nations ensured a move to newly-minted Richmond but the Scouser – born and raised in the Wirral – quickly became a small fish in a rapidly-expanding pond. Surrounded by the likes of Agustin Pichot, Scott Quinnell, Ben Clarke and Richard West, he struggled for game time. And his woes at club level dovetailed neatly with his non-selection for Ireland.
“I’d had that early start at 21/22 in the Irish setup which was a bit of a whirlwind,” he says.
“I was in the Premiership with Orrell and had a few good games on Sky and suddenly you’re catapulted into it and, in a way, I probably went in a bit early. But I played a few good games – we beat Wales and did really well against England – so there were a lot of bucket list items being ticked off. And then I just bombed out of the scene completely. When the opportunity came up to go to Ulster, maybe a lot of people thought it was a strange one. But I’d kept in touch with a lot of guys who’d been part of the Irish squad with me, like Jonny Bell, Mark McCall and Humphreys. So it felt like a chance worth taking.
I was so determined to get back into the Irish team and I saw the opportunity. It was the best chance for me. I was good mates with Humphreys and he said, ‘I prefer it when you goal-kick because it takes the pressure off me. Come over, take the kicks and I can concentrate on playing 10′. I felt like I’d be welcomed there and I’d had a hard 12 months at Richmond when they went and signed the world. It was hard to keep a place there. So it was an opportunity to go to a place where people respected me and where I’d get a good run of games.”
Mason arrived in 1998 and quickly found his stride. He had been used to small, close-knit groups – communities who rallied behind their local side, players that were tight with each other. And having grown up in Liverpool to parents with proud Irish backgrounds, certain sensibilities appealed more to him than others. He was assigned a club team – Ballymena – and along with provincial responsibilities, he immersed himself in the AIL too. It was humbling but homely. And he got back to enjoying the game again.
“I’d broken into the senior Irish team while playing at Orrell, a small club – similar to Ulster – where a lot of the lads lived locally,” he says.

“Richmond was a big club in London with a collection of superstars and very much an assembled side. The Ulster setup seemed like a bunch of fellas who all wanted to play for the team. And there was a real push at the time to get players to go back to Ireland so it seemed a bit of a no-brainer if I wanted to get back into the Irish team.”

The European odyssey didn’t start well for Mason and his new employers. They drew a Pool C opener at Ravenhill against Edinburgh and then were thumped by a rampant Toulouse a week later.
“We’d always had a good game in us,” Mason says.
“We might beat Munster at home and Leinster away but then we’d go somewhere like Connacht and lose. So it was a bit up and down.”
But, something seemed to shift on a mid-October night when the French heavyweights came to Belfast for the return game.
“What got bums on seats and the crowd behind us was that win over Toulouse,” he continues.
Ulster sneaked past Toulouse by two points to set up a semi against Stade but nobody gave them a hope, even at Ravenhill. After all, the French side boasted a mouthwatering collection of talent, led by the mercurial Dominguez, and had demolished poor Pontypridd in the last-eight, putting over 70 points on the board.

But, that afternoon, Ulster produced a scintillating display and showed Irish rugby wasn’t only about grit and resolve. With Humphreys pulling the strings and Mason unerring with his kicks, it was a monstrous performance.
“To play for Ireland and be part of that was unbelievable but anyone that was around the Irish side in the 90s will tell you just how fragmented it was – there wasn’t really any consistency and players seemed to come in but come out just as quickly,” Mason says.
“But when you played with your province you were with each other all the time. Nowadays, international teams are in camps so often and train so much. But back then there was a feeling sometimes that you were effectively strangers until you came together for a few days. When you’re with your club and province and playing with the guys you see day in, day out, there’s a tightness and team spirit. That year with Ulster it really shone through. And it’s an old value of Irish rugby. The crowd, the feeling of backs against the wall – it always seemed to help. Now, Irish rugby is so professional and dedicated to certain values. But they still come to the fore, though – the 16th man and the warrior spirit.”
Mason’s early drop goal came from a poor Dominguez clearance. The angle ensured it was ill-advised to have a crack. But, he fancied it. He was in the zone. And he split the posts with a brilliant strike.
Later, Humphreys would slot one over at a crucial moment, though it barely creeped over the crossbar. Both instances informed Mason’s opinion: Ulster’s luck was in.
“People still laugh at me about taking on drop goals but I’d just keep the scoreboard ticking over,” he says.
Humphreys’ playmaking skills were masterful that day and his ingenuity in the second-half saw him combine with Sheldon Coulter before racing over 60 metres and touching down in the corner for an inspirational try.
“He was definitely the general,” Mason says.
Paul FaithPaul Faith
“But people tend to forget about Mark McCall too. He got injured and ultimately it led to him having to end his career which was incredibly sad. He went on to be an unbelievable coach, which shows how strong his mentality is. But when he was ruled out – which was a really big blow for us – Humphs stepped up to the captaincy. And he wasn’t a shouter but just a player you looked to. He was the conductor of the orchestra. He was a very calm and calculated guy and a really warm person. He led from the front and we figured that if we could just give him a platform, he’d always put us in the right areas. To be honest, the biggest compliment you can pay to Harry Williams is how many of his players have gone on to make decent coaches: McCall, Humphreys , Bell, Allan Clarke, Justin Fitzpatrick – it just shows the wider rugby intelligence of the squad.”
The 33-27 result ensured Ulster would take on Colomiers in a decider that was fixed for Lansdowne Road. But the manner of the victory over Stade – coming out on top in a barnstorming, electric affair – was hard to keep a lid on. It felt like the final had already been and gone. Was it difficult to re-focus again three weeks later?
“Everything about that year felt like we were riding the crest of a wave,” Mason says.

“Nowadays, you’d probably be straight-focused on the final but we enjoyed every minute of the semi victory. Nobody had expected us to beat Stade and I remember a few days before the game they were talking about how they’d be disappointed if they didn’t put 50 points on us because they felt that was the gulf in class. It was that cliched arrogance so they walked into their own storm, really. But our players were still a little bit like, ‘Let’s make sure we don’t get hammered here and make idiots of ourselves in front of everyone’. And there was all the fuss about the temporary stand and getting the attendance up to 20,000. So when we won, there was a huge element of euphoria. But I bring it back to rugby at that particular time because I was playing for Ballymena the following week in an AIL game. Some of the other guys were back to work. So no player was being wrapped in cotton wool. With the final, we got caught up in not letting ourselves down. We were focused on finishing the job. We were so close to it. And it was such a unique thing: becoming champions of Europe. It was strange for me. When you’re a goal kicker, you always have self doubt. But I went into that final thinking nothing could stop us. We had everything on our side. And we actually felt we were better players than Colomiers.”
The game was far from a classic and even Mason admits he’s never watched it back in its entirety. Effectively, his magnificent goal kicking proved the difference between the sides. He struck six penalties and Humphreys added a drop goal as the visitors struggled to ever really get going. Ulster were never in trouble and though they displayed some free-flowing, counter-attacking brilliance against Stade, they played the percentages against Colomiers.
“After we’d won it, I’d actually wished it had been a better game,” he says.
“Every time we got a penalty or we got into their half and got something, you felt it was another dagger in their hearts and I don’t think they had the quality or substance to come back from it. Once we went ahead, it was just about making sure we didn’t do anything stupid. It wasn’t the most exciting but, in any final, people will always say the important thing is to win.”
Paul FaithPaul Faith
Mason remained optimistic about an Ireland recall for a while but when he headed for Stade Francais the following year he knew it was unlikely he’d ever pull on a green shirt again.
His was an interesting case. English-born but an Ulster player and Irish capped. It’s inevitable that our conversation turns to issues of identity and Irishness. Equally inevitably, Mason provides an eloquent and illuminating perspective.
“I was at Ulster University and wrote a thesis on amateur to pro rugby and as part of it I did a section on identity,” he says.
“It’s always been a difficult one. I was born in England but even now, I feel like I have to justify myself to friends. They’ll say, ‘It’s England against Ireland and you’re supporting Ireland?’ But I spent a lot of time in Ireland growing up. My Mum and Dad always supported Ireland and the one thing, maybe, that I can use to justify my decision is that when I was at Orrell I got a call from Mike Slemen and they asked if I wanted to play England ‘A’ but I said no. I’d done well for the Irish 21s and I was patient and within two months I got the senior call-up. If I really wanted to jump into the English camp, I could’ve played for them at that stage. But growing up and feeling part of the Irish setup, you’re made to feel so welcome. And that was part of the reason I ended up going back to Ulster. It was being part of something and feeling that the lads around you were always rooting for you and had your back. My cousin always ribs me, ‘You went to Ulster and played for them so you were British’. But I never felt any of that when I played. And the same with Ireland. I could’ve just been this English guy playing for Ireland but I always felt everyone was welcoming and never saw any signs of disagreements. And maybe that’s why Irish rugby has always stayed so strong. People working together and playing together, which kept people going at times.”
Mason is back in Liverpool these days and teaches at St. Anselm’s College in Birkenhead. Coaching youngsters, he admits underage rugby has changed rapidly but, where he can, he still tries to impart the importance of instinct.
“Kicking is where art and science merges together in rugby,” he says.
“There are very scientific and specific ways of kicking and so many players – including myself to a point – worked on the mechanics. But there’s also a natural flair to kicking a ball. And when I work with younger kids, I get them to do a lot of drop goals because it’s very instinctive. In the early days there wasn’t much on the science side so you could be a bit different but the game has evolved so much in the last 20 years.”
Mason celebrates with his Ulster team-mates after their win over Colomiers.Mike EgertonMike Egerton
“There was a great documentary recently about over-coaching at academies now and individualism being eradicated. The standard is incredible but everyone seems to know exactly every pass they should play, every kick they should make. But when you’re confident, you’ll take certain stuff on. If you’ve missed five kicks out of five or you’re having a shocker of a game, you wouldn’t dream of taking on that drop goal. Sometimes, things like that are in the moment. The instinctive stuff comes down to confidence levels. And during that period with Ulster in 1999, it was the most confident I’ve ever felt.”

“It’s a dreadful deal... on many, many counts” but it is ""rescuable” former#BrexitSecretary David Davis tells#Marrhttps://t.co/8jqpWmsOz0pic.twitter.com/Yr3g6KvvgO— BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics)March 10, 2019BBC Politics/ Twitter
“It’s a dreadful deal... on many, many counts” but it is ""rescuable” former#BrexitSecretary David Davis tells#Marrhttps://t.co/8jqpWmsOz0pic.twitter.com/Yr3g6KvvgO
THE FORMER BREXIT secretary David Davis has said Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal is “dreadful” and, in a way, worse than the UK’s current EU membership.
“Frankly this deal is worse than current membership in one sense because we can’t get out of it,” he told theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
He said that it was “a dreadful deal on many many counts”, but added that if the UK could leave the backstop whenever it chooses, that it might be “rescuable”.

“I would love to be able to vote for it, if she gets the ability to pull out,” he said.
Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons by 230 votes in January this year – the largest defeat for a modern British government.
After this defeat, which MPs said was based on an opposition to the backstop, May pledged that she would return to the European Union and ask for the changes needed to get her deal passed. Among the suggestions requested by the British side was a time limit on the backstop, or the power to withdraw from the backstop without the EU’s approval.
The backstop locks the UK, including Northern Ireland, into a customs deal and other regulations in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It’s been a bone of contention in the Brexit debate.
Speaking on the Marr Show, Davis said that EU leaders were “shocked” after the deal was rejected, and “that the language changed”:
“The tenor of the language changed. Mr Varadkar’s language changed, Mr Juncker’s language changed, Mr Tusk’s… and then all of a sudden, three Cabinet ministers said ‘You’ve got to take no-deal off the table’, ‘You’ve got to have an extension’, and then it went back to being hard again.”
Davis also said that he’s not hoping for a no-deal Brexit, but that it needs to be kept as a viable option “because it’s what keeps bringing the European Union back”.

OISÍN Ó DOINN, who has contributed to Irish language learning on the Duolingo app, believes better integration of technology with language learning can help people learn Irish in a more productive way.

“There is technology out there,” he says, “but there is a gap I suppose if we’re talking about secondary school education, there’s not much use of technology in the school [when teaching Irish].”
He suggests teaching students about topics that can relate back to themselves could help with better engagement “and give people a real reason to communicate rather than have a discussion”.
“I think it would be more valuable and beneficial to the students if you taught them how to talk about their favourite app in Irish, or their favourite TV programme,” he says. “Rather than a 17th century love poem which bears no relevance on a teenager’s life today.”

A MAN HAS been arrested in connection with the theft of the of an 800-year-old mummy known as ‘The Crusader’, which was stolen from the crypts of St Michan’s Church last week.
The discovery of the theft at the crypt of the church on Church Street was made shortly before lunchtime on Monday 25 February when a guide was preparing to open the church for visitors.
The Church of Ireland said the crypt had been “badly damaged” and several of the mummies inside, including the 400-year-old remains of a nun, had been desecrated. The Crusader’s body was turned over and his head had been removed.
The head of the mummy was recoveredon Monday.
A man in his 20s has now been arrested in connection with the break-in and theft.
He is currently being detained at Bridewell Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.

The items were stolen over the weekend of the 23rd-25th February, gardaí said earlier this week. Gardaí also recovered another skull which was stolen during the theft.
Last week, the Archbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson said he was “shocked that someone would target this ancient burial place and desecrate the remains of those lying within it”.
The items were recovered as a result of information given to investigating gardaí.
The National Museum of Ireland is acting in an advisory capacity in the case.
Archbishop Jackson welcomed Monday’s recovery saying that “the emphasis will now be able to turn to consideration of future security and display of the remains in the crypt of St Michan’s”.
“Renewed thanks go to all who have shown interest and concern for the mummies. They are a priceless part of the heritage of the city of Dublin and its citizens”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tusk-commons-deal-4552508-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said it is a “matter of great personal regret” that the UK will not leave the EU on time with a deal, with a deal and that it is “high time” for MPs to make a decision.
May was speaking at Downing Street this evening after earlier writing to European Council President Donald Tusk seeking a brief delay to Brexit, tellingthe House of Commonsshe had asked him for an extension until 30 June.
“Two years on, MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, we will not leave on time with a deal on 29 March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me,” May said in her statement.
May said she is on the “side” of the public now which wants the parliament to get on with Brexit and stop the in-fighting. She said “it is now time for MPs to decide”.
“It is high time we made a decision. So far parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,” she said.
May said she will continue to work “night and day” to get MPs (including the DUP) to vote for her deal so the UK can leave the EU by 30 June.
“I am not prepared to delay Brexit later than the 30 June,” she said.

The Prime Minister also touched on the question of holding a second Brexit referendum, outlining that the UK government “asked you the question and you gave us the answer”.
Possible short extension
Responding to May’s earlier letter, Tusk said he believes that a short extension to Article 50 would be possible, but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the House of Commons.
“In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days, I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons,” Tusk told reporters this afternoon.
His comments come ahead of a summit of EU leaders getting under way in Brussels tomorrow.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meanwhile said it was time to cut the UK “some slack” on the extension time as there was now a real risk of a no-deal happening by accident.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Varadkar addressed the issue of the extension, stating that the Irish government has always been open to an extension, “if there is a purpose to it”.
“I don’t have a definitive view on how long an extension would be… [but we] would prefer to see this resolved sooner rather than later,” he added.
He told the media that it is his understanding that May is due to speak to address the British public tonight, adding that this will be an “opportunity for her to set out her plan and timeline as to how an extension would work”. Varadkar said it is important that “we hear from her”.
The European Commission, meanwhile, had advised EU leaders that a shorter delay until 23 May (the date of the European elections) or a much longer one until at least the end of 2019 would be preferable.
In his comments at 4pm, Tusk sounded more positive about the 30 June date saying it “has its merits” but creates “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”.
He said that he wouldn’t hesitate to call an emergency EU summit next week if the meaningful vote did not pass.

Ahead of his statement, Tusk said he had just come off a phonecall with the prime minister.
He was also speaking by phone to Leo Varadkar today, and in Dublin the Taoiseach told reporters at Government Buildings that the proposed length of the extension would be discussed in detail at tomorrow’s summit.
Leaders wanted to hear May’s plan, he said. “We understand it’s not as simple as just securing ratification of the withdrawal agreement by parliament, she’ll also have to put enabling legislation through the Commons and the Lords.”
Varadkar said the “only red line that I’ve ever set down is that Brexit should not lead to a return of a hard border”. The Taoiseach added that he still believes a no-deal Brexit is unlikely.
“There is a risk of no-deal happening by accident and that would be a real tragedy,” said the Taoiseach.
It had been expected May could hold a third vote on the twice-rejected deal this week ahead of tomorrow’s summit, but a series of events – not leastan unexpected interventionby the speaker of the House of Commons – scuppered that plan.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-dup-theresa-may-extension-4556139-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Mar 2019
DUP DEPUTY LEADER Nigel Dodds has criticised the UK government, and called the delay to the date by which the UK leaves the European Union “a humiliation”.
Last night, it was agreed that the date the UK would leave the EU would be delayed until the 22 May if British Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was passed; if the deal is rejected, the date would be delayed by two weeks until 12 April.
The DUP, whose 10 MPs are supporting May’s government, said today that she had missed an opportunity to put forward new proposals to change the Withdrawal Agreement.
In a statement released this afternoon, Dodds said that the fact that Theresa May didn’t do so “is all the more disappointing and inexcusable given the clear divisions and arguments which became evident amongst EU member states”.
He said that these divisions were made evident “when faced with outcomes they don’t like” – possibly referring to the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons.
There had been rumours that the DUP had been softening its stance towards May’s twice-rejected Withdrawal Agreement and could be preparing to vote for it next week for the third Meaningful Vote.

Speaking at the Fine Gael National Conference, which is taking place in Wexford over the next two days, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he had read the DUP statement today, though he warned not to pay too much heed to “emotive” language at this stage of play.
DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson will be addressing tomorrow’s Young Fine Gael session at the conference, titled: ‘North-South relations into the future’.
Coveney said he hopes to get some”quiet time” with Donaldson tomorrow to discuss the Brexit state-of-play, though when asked what he could say to twist the DUP’s arm, Coveney said they do not take too kindly to that.
He said they have tried to give “reassurances and clarifications” around the backstop, adding that this weekend, the British parliament, should be given the time and space it needs to get a majority over the line for another vote next week.
Last weekend, the DUP held talks with Theresa May and her Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond, to discuss what changes they wanted to make to in order that they would vote for it.
We have been very clear that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the U.K. and for the EU.But it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. 2/2pic.twitter.com/TVQopbbHnG— Nigel Dodds (@NigelDoddsDUP)March 22, 2019Nigel Dodds/ Twitter

Dodds said today, however that negotiations with the EU had been expected to go down to the wire and accused the government to be “far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had said earlier that the extension gave the UK some “breathing space” and opened up the possibility of indicative votes in the House of Commons.
In a statement ahead of the European Council summit, Theresa May had laid the blame for the current political impasse with MPs, for not voting her deal through. In response to this, Dodds said today:
“Lectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in Parliament.
“Nothing has changed as far as the Withdrawal Agreement is concerned,” Dodds added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-lynnch-murder-clondalkin-4531961-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ IN LUCAN have renewed their appeal for any information about the murder of David Lynch at Foxdene, Clondalkin last Friday.
Investigating officers are looking for information in relation to two vehicles.
The first is a White Peugeot Partner van, registration number 141 D 6118 for any information on the location of this vehicle between 18th December, 2018 and 1st March, 2019. On the day of the murder, a red ‘N’ plate was displayed on the front window and on the rear door of this vehicle.
The second vehicle is a Grey Toyota Avensis, registration number 12 KE 576 which was stolen from an address in Celbridge, on 14 February.

Gardaí are seeking information into the whereabouts of this vehicle or any person who may have seen this vehicle between 14th February, 2019 and 1st March, 2019.
Lynch was well-known to gardaí and was suspected of facilitating the local drugs trade. He was a known associate of a large drug supplier who is also based in the Clondalkin area.
While the major drug supplier is linked to serious players within the Kinahan cartel, this killing is not linked to the Kinahan/Hutch feud, gardaí believe.
The local feud has been ongoing since 2013 but has flared up in the last two years.
Darragh Nugent (36) was shot dead in September of 2017 as local dealers believed he was attempting to muscle in on the trade in the area.
One week later, Nugent’s friend and associate John Gibson (28) was shot in the head in a car park in Saggart.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-ryan-death-4534218-Mar2019/,"THE MOTHER OF an Irish aid worker who died in an air crash over the weekend has paid tribute to her son, saying he was an “amazing” person who lived to help others.
Christine Ryan paid tribute to her son Michael onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
Michael Ryan was Deputy Chief Engineer at the United Nations’ World Food Programme. Originally from Clare, he lived in Cork but had recently relocated to the programme’s Rome headquarters.
He was killed in an Ethiopian Airlines crash over the weekend.
Christine – a retired teacher – said that the family was in shock at Michael’s death. He leaves behind a wife and two young children.
“He was an amazing person we just can’t believe… we still can’t come to terms with this,” she said.
Christine described Michael as a man who had a “marvellous vision” for the world and always worked hard to achieve that.
“He was a very enthusiastic person, he had a great vision, he had ferocious work, he believed in engineering, putting people first and he was involved in an awful lot of different projects worldwide,” she said.
These projects ranged from flood reliefs and landslides to helping combat the spread of Ebola and assisting Rohingya Muslims. Michael’s work took him to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan among many other countries.
“He had a marvellous vision and he just got there and did it and he had great enthusiasm with regards to work,” Christine said.
She said her son wanted to save the world and an amazing vision.
“He wanted to really basically to save the world as far as he was concerned and he had a vision for that and he just seemed to put all his energies in and do that,” she said.
Family
Christine said that Michael’s family appreciated what he was doing and supported him, and whenever he was home it was “all hands on deck”.

“[He] brought his children off surfing or golfing in Lahinch or whatever. He just loved west Clare as well and he loved Lahinch and he loved life and living,” she said.
Christine said that she had heard of the air crash in the news, but didn’t realise that her son was onboard until she was contacted by his wife, Naoise.
“I knew he was going on a flight to Nairobi but I didn’t really realise he was on the flight that crashed until Naoise his wife contacted me and told me that he was definitely on that flight,” she said.
“And I had heard that the flight had gone down but I didn’t realise he was on it until Naoise contacted me.
The family were all due to travel to Rome next week to celebrate Michael’s 40th birthday on 28 March and for the christening of his young son.
Crash
The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 crashed yesterday morning en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi in Kenya with 149 passengers and eight crew believed to be onboard.
The plane crashed soon after take off, outside the Ethiopian capital.
Johnny Hegarty – of the Save Cork City campaign group – was a friend of Michael’s and spoke on Cork’s 96fm Opinion Line with PJ Coogan this morning.
“Mick was doing good around the world which was great. That’s what drove him really, I think in his life – to do good,” he said.
“He really thought about people as being the benefactors of everything that was done. And I suppose that’s what makes it very tragic because he was often at risk in his work for the UN.
Hegarty said that Michael used engineering to help people all across the world.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar paid tribute to Ryan last night.
“Our thoughts tonight are with families of all those lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, including Irish engineer Michael Ryan,” Varadkar said in a tweet.
President Michael D Higgins also expressed his sadness and sympathies over the lives lost in the crash.
“In particular I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Michael Ryan, whose work in humanitarian assistance for the World Food Programme brought him onto the flight,” Higgins said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/woman-jailed-for-stealing-money-from-former-gp-4549927-Mar2019/,"A WOMAN WHO stole the proceeds of the sale of a retired GP’s surgery when she was working as the victim’s carer has been jailed for two years.
Nermana Gojak (44) worked as both a carer and a housekeeper for a couple of days a week for the 90-year-old woman for 10 years.
Both the woman and her late husband had worked as GPs in Dublin and the victim had opened up a deposit account with the funds from the sale of her husband’s GP surgery when he passed away.
Gojak stole €41,380 over five years by making ATM withdrawals, using the woman’s laser card to purchase items and getting cash back at points of sale. She regularly transferred funds from this deposit account to the woman’s current account to allow her easy access to the money.
Gojak, of Pineview Avenue, Aylesbury, Tallaght, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to the theft from Ulster Bank in Dundrum on dates between 8 September 2012 and 8 August 2017. Gojak has no previous convictions and is unemployed.
Dara Hayes BL, prosecuting, read the woman’s victim impact statement into the record at the original sentence hearing last December, in which she stated: “I cried when I thought of how hard my husband had to work to get that money.”
She said the crime was deceitful, cruel and callous. She said she has not been able to secure a new carer since Gojak’s theft came to light and she has had to move into a nursing home.
The woman said she became fearful and worried about living in her home on her own and felt financially vulnerable.
“I embraced her like a daughter,” she said while outlining that she went to Gojak’s children’s plays, dancing competitions and “celebrated all their achievements”. She said she didn’t forget the children’s birthdays.
“It was such an upheaval at this stage of my life. It will stay with me to the end of my days,” the woman concluded her statement.
Advertisement
Judge Melanie Greally had previously remanded Gojak on continuing bail and adjourned sentencing having heard evidence last December.
‘Betrayal’
Today she noted from the victim impact report that the “most significant element” for the woman was “the immense sense of betrayal which she has experienced”.
“It is clear from the report that she regarded the accused as one of her family and embraced her as one of her family, introducing her to her wider family and celebrating family events with her,” Judge Greally said.
She said the victim had raised those funds from “a lifetime of hard work” and the sale of a GP practice and noted that “she was left in financial insecurity as a result of what was taken from her”.
Greally said the case “necessitated a custodial sentence” before she sentenced Gojak to three years in prison but suspended the final 12 months on strict conditions including that she engages with the Probation Service for 12 months.
She said she had taken into account Gojak’s lack of previous convictions, her guilty plea, cooperation, remorse, and the fact that she had €2,000 in court to offer as a token of that remorse.
Greally also acknowledged that Gojak had experienced difficulties in her past, noting that she had come to Ireland from war-torn Bosnia and accepted that some mental health issues were identified in a probation report before the court.
Gojak’s defence counsel, Marc Murphy BL, accepted it was an extremely serious offence that had a serious impact on the victim. He acknowledged that the money has not been repaid and said there was no reality to her ever paying it back in full.
Counsel suggested that if Gojak was given some time she may be able to gather together “a token amount as a symbol of her remorse”.
Murphy said Gojak played “a central role in her family life” and is a devoted mother to her three children aged between 12 and 17 years old. “She has an expectation of a custodial sentence”, counsel said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/an-post-rebranding-new-logo-3-4544038-Mar2019/,"
AGAINST A FRESHLY minted logo and emerald-green backdrop, An Post CEO David McRedmond announced Wednesday was a “momentous day” for the postal service provider.
As part of a pitch to appeal to a younger and online-savvy clientele, the company officially unveiled a new pared-back logo and teal-based colour scheme in the green glow of a GPO conference room.
It’s no secret that An Post has been undergoing significant change over the past two years, with regular announcements on its finance services and new delivery platforms.
The company had a bit of a rough ride in recent years, with the internet hijacking the humble letter and competitors mooching in on its delivery territory.
But with a shiny new image and healthier finances, An Post is eager to make itself more relevant to the coveted millennial market.
“We’ve got the economics of the business sorted out,” chief financial officer Peter Quinn said, in what turned out to be a series of ‘bold’ statements and moves announced during a 40 minute-long presentation.
On the back of a €12.4 million loss in 2016, the company clawed its way back to the black in 2017, declaring an €8.4 million profit. It is now looking at a €40 million operating profit for the end of 2018.
This is on the back of a major cost-cutting regime that has seen the company shutter post offices across the country and put its thinking cap on torepurpose a number of unused properties.
Over the coming months, the company will be investing in digitising more services, introducing automated parcel delivery – and rolling outParcel Motel-style delivery lockers.

Meet Ciara
As part of its reboot, An Post last year undertook market research “to better understand consumers”, especially those who don’t see its services as relevant, said Debbie Byrne, who is managing director of An Post’s retail offshoot.

“What the research told us is that we need to transform from a mails company doing parcels to being an expert in financial services and e-commerce.”
The renewed An Post is catering to a fictional character called Ciara, a smiling, red-haired colleen who embodies the decades-old company’s new target audience.
“Ciara lives her life online as you would expect. Interestingly, she’s socially conscious and this is a big trend among millennials. This cohort of customers is looking to align themselves with brands that share their values,” Byrne said.
“If we design our new products and services going forward for Ciara, we’ll meet the needs of other demographics as well.
With tech-savvy millennials in mind, An Post is hoping to “act for the common good”, and plans to be emission-free within the Dublin canals by the end of this year and the rest of the country by 2030.
Over the coming weeks, it will also announce a new initiative called ‘Address Point’ providing surrogate addresses for people who are homeless.
An Post's fictional 'Ciara'Zuzia WhelanZuzia Whelan
Byrne explained that the fictional character came before the rollout of the more modern logo:
“If we want to cater to Ciara, it needed to change.”
The main difference between the old logo and the new one – which will cost €5 million to deploy over three years – is the absence of An Post’s iconic “wavy lines”, which represented the old franking marks. This shows the company is “breaking with the past”, said Byrne.
“We’ve refreshed our green to make it more modern for the digital age and for a younger consumer,” she added, but noted that the company kept some ‘Celtic type’ to borrow from the past.
As part of its new outlook, the postal service provider also announced two new sub-brands: An Post Money, which brings together its various finance services like personal loans and credit cards, and An Post Commerce, a business-to-business brand providing e-commerce and mailing services.

https://www.thejournal.ie/drink-driving-arrests-2019-4542196-Mar2019/,"THERE HAS BEEN a 17% increase in the numbers of arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs in the first two months of 2019 compared to the same period last year.
From 1 January to 28 February of this year, 1,429 drivers were arrested, the figures from An Garda Síochána show.
The figures come as motorists are being warned that gardaí will be out in force targeting drivers under the influence of drink and drugs over the St Patrick’s Day weekend.
The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which analyses the blood and urine specimens of drivers arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence for the presence of alcohol and drugs, has also reported an increase in the number of specimens being sent for analysis to date this year.
“While the vast majority of drivers that we test are free from alcohol or drugs, we have detected more drivers this year that are not, which is why An Garda Síochána will have a visible enforcement presence across the country over the St Patrick’s Day bank holiday weekend,” Garda Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid said.

“This will include a targeted focus on driving under the influence of an intoxicant, whether that is alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. Members of roads policing units across the country will be targeting the times that are linked to alcohol related crashes,” he said.
To date this year, 34 people have been killed on Irish roads.
Last year, a total of 154 people were arrested for drink driving over the St Patrick’s Day weekend.
Garda Reid reminded motorists that “drivers are required to carry their driving licence on their person”.
“If stopped and breathalysed and you don’t have your licence, you will be tested at the lower level. If you fail, you will be arrested and taken to a garda station for further testing,” he said.
The drink driving limit in Ireland is 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
For learner drivers, novice drivers, and professional and commercial drivers, a lower limit of 20mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood applies.

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-personal-experiences-4504554-Mar2019/,"File photoShutterstock / superokeShutterstock / superoke / superoke
RESIDENTS AT DIRECT Provision centres often have to live in a confined space, sharing a room with people they do not know or get on with.
Some people living in the centres have experienced intimidation, harassment and threats from other residents.
Asylum seekers living in Clondalkin Towers, which isdue to close in June, recently spoke toTheJournal.ieabout their experiences living in the centre.
Hicham felt unsafe in his own country, Morocco, where being gay is a criminal offence. He moved to South Africa, but also experienced homophobia there.
Hicham said some people in Johannesburg, where he managed a B&B, accepted him but others did not. “Some people accepted you, some people didn’t accept you – it depended on the area. When you’re at work they call you names like queer, something like that.”
The 34-year-old hoped to settle in South Africa but, over time, he knew this would not happen. He decided to move after being threatened and robbed at gunpoint twice within weeks. Hicham believes the attackers knew him as they were aware he was gay.
Hicham said he moved to Ireland “for safety”. He has lived at the DP centre in Clondalkin since 2017 and is waiting for a decision about his asylum status.
He didn’t foresee having to hide his sexual orientation here but, when he is at the centre, he said he does.

He said certain residents are openly homophobic, some of whom become aggressive when they drink alcohol – something that isn’t permitted at the centre.
“It’s a big change, especially when you’re put with two people from very different cultures. You could be sharing a room with people from very different cultures. You can’t choose who you’re sharing with.
“It is very difficult. I have to pretend to be somebody else. Most of the time I don’t stay in the room, I do a lot of activities.”

Converting religion
Aisha*, another resident at the centre in Clondalkin, is also waiting to hear about her status. Originally from Pakistan, she arrived in Ireland nearly four years ago.
She is an only child and when her mother died as a result of complications from Motor Neurone Disease she said her uncle forced her to sign over her mother’s property. She has no relationship with her father.
Aisha has been in Ireland since 2015. She said she chose here as she knew a friend who lived in the country.
She was raised as a Muslim but converted to Christianity while in Ireland – something that has caused tension with some other residents at the centre, including a former roommate of hers.
Aisha said, for many people, Islam is “more than a religion, it’s a lifestyle, it’s an identity”. She started to attend a local church about two years ago, after doing some research on Christianity. She decided to convert but initially wanted to keep the process private.
Her former roommate was a Muslim and when Aisha stopped praying with her, she began to ask questions. Eventually she had to tell her the truth during Ramadan, as she was not fasting.
“When I told my roommate she said she was very upset with me, that I had disappointed her and really hurt her. She said to me, ‘Your parents brought you up a certain way, would they be happy about this?’
The canteen area in the Clondalkin DP centre.
“People in the centre came up and asked if I was still a Muslim, they knew something was different.
Aisha said people’s religious beliefs should be respected and they should be free to practice whatever religion they identify with.
‘He always tried to touch me’
Aisha said she has been harassed and propositioned by other residents on numerous occasions. She said another of her former roommates used to invite people back to their room late at night.
“My roommate would hardly say anything, I was just forced to leave the room every time. It was very upsetting.”
Aisha said she eventually told the centre’s management about the situation and they facilitated a room change for her.
Aisha said there have been a number of other instances where she has been harassed.
“There was this guy in particular, who hated me for some reason. He would stare at me and start cursing whenever he would see me. It got worse, he was verbally abusive and called me names all the time. He would also comment on how I dressed.”
Aisha said she “couldn’t take it” and made a formal complaint to management, noting “then things got better”. She said the man in question eventually left the centre.
House rules on harassment and violence
When asked about the intimidation and harassment experienced by some people in DP centres, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) said it “does not tolerate any instances of harassment or intimidation against our residents”.
The spokesperson noted that centres implement “house rules” which include the procedures to be followed where a resident wishes to make a complaint about another resident, adding:
They said requests from residents to move rooms within the centre are “dealt with locally by the centre manager”, noting: “Such requests can be facilitated having regard to the need to make full use of the bed spaces they have available to accommodate protection applicants.”

The spokesperson stated that RIA has a policy around incidences of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and harassment within its centres, which was developed in conjunction with a number of non-governmental organisations including the Irish Refugee Council, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service.
The policy established the role of a Reporting Officer in centres and the steps they must follow in the event of an incident of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence or harassment against a resident.
The spokesperson said these rules ensure the resident “can access the services they require, which may include access to medical care, access to An Garda Síochána and information on availing of professional help”.
RIA operates one women-only centre in Killarney, Co Kerry, and said “women who feel particularly vulnerable and wish not to be accommodated with males can request a transfer to this centre”. Forty-three women currently live there.
The spokesperson said the department does not have statistics on the numbers of requests by residents to move room or centre, and whether or not they were granted.
Where a resident requests a transfer to another centre and the move is being facilitated, they said the timing of the transfer is arranged between the resident, the centre manager and the RIA.
The spokesperson said transfers can take place immediately “in exceptional circumstances following serious incidents of breaches of the Accommodation Centre House Rules which may endanger the safety of other residents and staff”.
Mentalhealth
Aisha is studying for a master’s degree in UCD, which is aUniversity of Sanctuary. It is one of a number of such universities in Ireland, where refugees and asylum seekers can apply for scholarships.
She said she loves her course but most of her classmates assume she is an international student and do not know she lives in a DP centre. Aisha spends most of her time on campus or in the library as she finds it difficult to study at the centre.
As there are set eating times at the centre, she often misses meals and has to skip breakfast (which is served from 8-10am) to make it to morning lectures on time as she needs to get two buses.
She spends most of her €21.60 weekly allowance on food, but said the students’ union helps her buy meals and puts credit on her Leap card so she can travel to and from college.

Aisha said it’s “very important” for asylum seekers and refugees to be able to pursue an education in Ireland so they can integrate and get jobs.
She said being in university has helped her emotionally, after a difficult period.
“You do the same thing every day – wake up and go downstairs to collect your food then back up to your room, there is nowhere else to go … I know I’m normally not like that, I’m a very positive person. I got myself busy with activities, I put my energy into other situations.”
Hicham has also struggled with mental health issues while living at the centre but is doing better now – something that was partly helped by his involvement in sport.
He plays with the Dublin Devils (a gay-inclusive football team), is a member of Sanctuary Runners (which aims tohelp asylum seekers integratewith the wider community) and does volunteer work. He said getting involved in sport is “the best way to integrate into society”.
“Firstly it helps you mentally, then physically, it helps you to integrate quickly, make new friends, learn a new culture – that’s the only way.”
‘You are a number, not a human being’
Both Hicham and Aisha, as well as others residents we spoke to, said feelings of isolation and loneliness are common among people living in DP – some of whom may have mental health issues and have experienced traumatic events in their lives.
“A lot of people shouldn’t be in the hostel because have mental health issues, but they put them there because they don’t care about us,” Hicham said.
“I like to keep myself busy because it can be very difficult, very difficult,” he said.
Hicham’s mother died in Morocco last year and he didn’t attend her funeral because he would not be able to re-enter Ireland if he left.
“My mother passed away last year, I couldn’t go to her funeral. She had breast cancer. The last time I saw her was when I was in South Africa five years ago. It was very difficult [to not go to the funeral].”
Impact on mental health
Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre, has consistently highlighted the negative impact living in DP can have on a person’s wellbeing.
A spokesperson said a “significant factor” is “the length of time people wait for asylum applications to be decided, without knowing how long they will be waiting”. They said “living years on end in this limbo” can have “an overwhelming impact on people’s mental health”.
The spokesperson said specific instances of intimation experienced by residents highlight “the inherent unsuitability of an institutionalised system for accommodating asylum seekers, especially when it take so long to process asylum applications”.
“How issues are handled varies very much from centre to centre, and RIA’s role is not a policing one.
Nasc is among the organisations to call on the government to implement a vulnerability assessment “that will help determine people’s needs in terms of their accommodation and the other services they will need to be able to access to ensure they are getting the supports they need”.
“If people who would be deemed to be vulnerable – for example people experiencing trauma as a result of torture or sexual violence; people who are LGBT; people who are trafficked – are not being supported appropriately in Direct Provision, that is because they are not being assessed for those vulnerabilities and assigned accommodation that suits those identified vulnerabilities,” the spokesperson said.
A vulnerability assessment is a statutory obligation of opting into the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive, which was transposed into Irish legislation last June. However, it is yet to be introduced here.
A hallway in the Clondalkin DP centre.
The Nasc spokesperson said the specific needs of vulnerable adults and children who may be experiencing trauma or mental health issues are “not necessarily getting the supports they need to overcome these issues that would be specific to the asylum/refugee experience”.
They said a “very significant problem” is the continued lack of a vulnerability assessment for people in the asylum process which can help identify these issues as soon as possible, to ensure people receive appropriate supports.
The spokesperson noted that specialised supports are concentrated in urban places and main cities and “it may not be logistically possible for people in remote Direct Provision centres to reach them”.
A spokesperson for the Irish Refugee Council said the organisation has “spoken with several people who feel unsafe in centres for a variety of reasons including their gender or sexual orientation, or due to traumatic past experiences”.
“Direct Provision is a form of institutionalised living and what these issues highlight is the fact that accommodating people in their hundreds for protracted periods of time in this manner results in interpersonal issues and conflicts arising.
“This form of accommodation is very stressful and can exacerbate existing traumas. Significant delays in processing applications also mean that people are living in these circumstances with no way of knowing how long it will continue or when they will be able to move on with their lives,” they added.
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice and Equality said any health issues of DP residents are addressed by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health.
They said the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which falls under the department’s remit, liaises closely with colleagues in the HSE and other departments and agencies “to address the health needs of residents”.
“Any residents with complex medical conditions are assessed in Balseskin Reception Centre so that their needs can be addressed. Protection applicants have access to all emergency medical services immediately on arrival in the country,” the spokesperson said.
They added that GPs or medical personnel in hospital can refer asylum seekers who have suffered torture or trauma for specialist medical services in Dublin or other centres.
The department did not respond to a request for comment on why a vulnerability assessment has not been introduced to date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-st-patricks-day-is-an-irish-american-holiday-4537664-Mar2019/,"“IT’S BEEN ST Patrick’s Day for hours and I’m still not drunk yet,” complains Homer standing outside Moe’s bar.
The Simpsons episode set on Paddy’s day first aired on March 16, 1997.
Bart jibes Lisa for the green dress she’s wearing and he is the only person not dressed in green.
The Simpsons dedicated four minutes to stinging observations of the Irish American St Patrick’s Day celebrations.

It ends with Homer holding forth on a bar stool with a barrel over his head proclaiming. “Look at me, I’m the Prime Minister of Ireland.”
Initially, I considered the Simpsons fascination with Ireland to be an isolated commentary, funny but clichéd. But a deeper analysis of the roots of celebrating St Patrick’s Day revealed a more complex relationship.
There are cultural transfers both ways across the Atlantic since March 17th, the supposed anniversary of Patrick’s birth or death (or both according to some sources) became a feast day in the early 17th century.
Often forgotten is that St Patrick is the patron saint of not just Catholic Ireland, but also of the Anglican Church of Ireland.
A host of other US sitcoms used St Patrick’s Day as a backdrop for episodes. How I Met Your Mother, the US Office, 30 Rock and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia have all had Patrick’s day episodes.
US chat shows like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon have also chimed in on Paddy’s Day.
In many ways, St. Patricks Day is an Irish American festival.
The rise of a festival
The first record of St Patrick’s celebrations in the US was in Boston on 17 March 1737, when the Charitable Irish Society was formed by a group of Presbyterians to: “cultivate a spirit of unity and harmony among all resident Irish … and to advocate socially and morally the interests of the Irish people and their cultural heritage”.
This year they will host their 282ndannual St. Patrick’s Day dinner!
Back then the day was popular with the Protestant community in Ireland too.
When the famed writer Jonathan Swift was  Dean of the Church of Ireland at St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin- he twice wrote in his diaries (in 1713 and 1729) complaining that the Cathedral bells had been ‘deafening’ in that year’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations.
The first ever St. Patrick’s parade was recorded in New York in 1766.
It was not until 1903 that a parade of the sort we expect today was held in Ireland, with Waterford holding the honour. In was only in that year that the day became a holiday in Britain and Ireland.
That’s not to say that there were no St Patrick’s Day celebrations in Ireland before 1903, but they took a different form.
The Freemans Journal gives notice in March 1785 of the postponement of a St Patricks Day ‘fancy ball’ at Dublin Castle because many of the ‘nobility and gentry would be absent from town’.
The Belfast Newsletter on March 20th 1797 reported that a series of Irish Volunteers displays of cavalry and infantry were held that year in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.
The Derry Journal on March 20th 1848 report how that year’s St Patrick’s Day passed off peacefully in Dublin. The paper says that thousands of British soldiers had been brought to barracks in the city in case of disturbances.
An edition of the Wexford People from March 1863 contains a letter from the Mayor, John Greene, who records that not a single of case of ‘drunkenness, rioting, or any violation of the law’ was brought before him that year in the aftermath of the St Patrick’s Day celebrations.
In 1927 alcohol sales on St Patrick’s Day were banned in Ireland and this was only repealed in 1961.
It was not until 1931 that the first state-sponsored St Patrick’s Day march was held in Ireland.
TV sitcoms on Paddy’s Day
In How I Met Your Mother Neil Patrick Harris has a green suit. His character Barney convinces Ted to come out and ‘party like there’s no tomorrow’.
Like most How I Met Your Mother episodes there is a moral lesson along the way, but not for Barney who wakes up beside a dumpster in a now crumpled green suit, declaring it ‘awesome’ as he stumbles away.
An episode of the US Office based on St Patrick’s day, peaks with office manager Michael declaring: “It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.”
The St Patrick’s Day clichés are all there including a finale in a bar, with Irish music, green shots and a lot of drunk people.
In 2012, it was the turn of Tina Fey’s 30 Rock to tackle St Patrick’s Day.
Fey’s character Liz Lemon has a series of quips about Irish culture in the episode. My favourite is:
Ultimately Lemon learns a St Patrick’ Day lesson. She has to deal with her own personal feelings. Her on-street reconciliation with boyfriend Criss leads one of the St Patrick’s Day revellers to declare:
Finally, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has a St Patrick’s Day episode, complete with a leprechaun and touching on everything from drunkenness to clerical child abuse. It crams more Irish stereotypes into a 25-minute episode than I thought possible.
When we look at US TV today commenting, on and making fun of, the Irish on St Patrick’s Day, it is worth remembering that this is just the latest instalment in a long and complex history of the Irish influence in America.
This St Patrick’s Day we should concede ownership of our patron saint and accept that we have been sharing him with America for centuries.
Perhaps it is time to embrace your inner Irish American.

In the NYT piece, it quotes a Labour Party stat that Grayling’s various misadventures – 12 in all – had cost British taxpayers £2.7 billion, or €3.1 billion. Ouch.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/from-the-garden-traditionally-irish-people-put-their-spuds-in-the-ground-on-or-around-st-patricks-day-4544101-Mar2019/,"FUNDAMENTALLY POTATOES ARE not difficult to grow.
All you are doing is basically sticking one of last year’s spuds in the soil which sprouts into a plant, which produces lots of other potatoes.
So a single potato is magically transformed into anything from five to fifteen potatoes which you must admit is sort of miraculous.
Since it’s always the first outside sowing I do each year, it’s always exciting after a long winter hibernation.
The most important thing to remember is that potatoes form along the stem between the seed spud and the surface of the soil – the more space you have between the two, the more spuds you get.
So, that means either sowing the spud really deep in the soil or ‘earthing up’ once the plant comes out of the ground (i.e. drawing soil up around the stem to force it to grow longer).
Potatoes won’t really mind if your soil isn’t great, and in fact, they will do a good job of helping you to improve it.
Sowing spuds is an almost universally accepted method of helping to turn a poor, unpromising piece of ground into a vegetable patch.
When you grow your own potatoes you also get to try out lots of varieties that aren’t so readily available in the shops (where the Rooster and Kerr’s Pink hold sway) – you can literally grow whatever variety takes your fancy, for e.g. Orla, Home Guard, British Queen, Duke of York, Setanta, Cara, Sarpo Mira and more.
I think it’s weird that we’ve become obsessed with imported sweet potatoes as a so-called superfood when the humble spud is just as nutritious and what’s more it’s a seasonal, fresh, local food that also supports Irish jobs.
It’s one of the most versatile ingredients we have at our disposal in the kitchen.
Very few dinners (in our house at least) do not contain some portion of potatoes, whether they are boiled, baked, roasted, fried, mashed, chipped, or if we’re feeling sassy au gratin or Dauphine.
And if you think supermarket spuds are convenient, well in my view it’s even more convenient to wander down to the veg patch and dig some spuds fresh from the soil – you don’t even have to get in the car.
The act of harvesting spuds is pure GIY joy.
Rummaging in the soil underneath a potato plant and finding lots of lovely tubers is a moment that gives opening presents on Christmas morning a run for its money.

The soil in which you are planting potatoes requires a generous application of well-rotted farmyard manure, compost or seaweed before planting (ideally a couple of weeks before).
Sow first earlies in mid-March in single rows, 15cm deep, 25cm apart and 45cm between rows. Maincrop spuds are sown in mid to late April. Increase spacing to 35cm.
It is vitally important to include potatoes in your crop rotation as they are susceptible to disease if grown in the same ground year on year.
Check earlies in mid-June to see how they are getting on. Earlies will be ready about 14 weeks after sowing. Maincrops take 18 weeks.
I typically leave my earlies in the ground and dig as required. They do fine in the ground until September at which point we move on to maincrop. Maincrop can stay in the ground until the first frosts – lift them then and store in hessian sacks.
Recipe of the Week: Potato, Kale and Roast Garlic Soup
This is our chef at GROW HQ, JB’s recipe for potato, kale and roast garlic soup. It is delicious, with the garlic cooked beforehand to give it a lovely flavour.
Ingredients:
1 whole head of garlic
1 kg potatoes (any type will do)
1 leek
1 small onion
1 small pinch ground nutmeg
sea salt
50g butter
300g green curly kale or cavolo nero
Directions:
Roast the whole head of garlic (skin on) covered with a drizzle of olive oil in the oven at 120℃ for 30/45 min until the garlic softens. Let the garlic cool. Cut the bottom part of the garlic head and squeeze out the roast garlic pulp…. Smells delicious …
Cook the kale in a large pot of salted boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the kale and cool straight away in ice water.
Squeeze the cooked leave and chop them roughly. This process will fix the chlorophyll and will keep your soup vibrant green.
Peel and chop roughly all the vegetables and sweat them with the butter, nutmeg and salt on low heat in a large sauce pot for 5 min. Cover with 1.5 litres of cold water and simmer for 20/30 min until all the vegetables are cooked through.
Add the blanched kale and the garlic pulp and blend. Check the seasoning before serving.

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-driving-pedestrian-death-sentence-deferred-4536968-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Mar 2019
A GARDA WHOSE careless driving caused the death of a 75-year-old pedestrian has had a nine month prison sentence deferred on condition he pay €5,000 to a charity.
Warren Farrell (33), a garda serving in Ballyfermot, Co Dublin, was driving a marked patrol car in response to an incident at a Topaz garage when his vehicle struck Elizabeth Core.
Farrell had pleaded not guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing the death of Mrs Core at Fonthill Road South, Dublin, on 28 August 2014.
After a trial last December a jury convicted Farrell by majority verdict on an alternative charge of careless driving causing death. Judge Cormac Quinn had advised the jurors they could convict on this alternative charge.
This morning Judge Quinn said the degree of Farrell’s culpability was in the lower range. He said the aggravating factor was his speed.
The trial heard that after seeing Mrs Core crossing from the far side of the road Farrell failed to slow the car. He later told investigators that he believed Mrs Core would see or hear the patrol car and stop crossing and return to her side of the road.
He said he was surprised that she continued to cross the road and immediately applied brakes and entered the bus lane to avoid hitting her.

Farrell said he attempted to mount the car onto the footpath on his left but was unable to do so and the left tyre burst. The front right of the car hit Mrs Core and she was pushed onto the front windscreen.
Forensic investigators put the car’s speed at the point of impact, following heavy braking, at between 50 to 56 km/h. The speed limit on the road was 50 km/h.
Judge Quinn said there is a tension between the duty imposed on gardaí to respond to calls as quickly as possible and the duty not to endanger the public.
He said there was evidence Farrell experienced a “violation of expectancy” where he had expected Mrs Core to stop crossing.
When he saw she continued to cross he reassessed the situation and applied the brakes. Judge Quinn noted that as a result of this up to 2.5 seconds in stopping time were lost.
At a hearing last month (FEB) Thomas Core, Mrs Core’s son, described his mother as “a singer and a dancer” and “the life and soul of family gatherings”.
Reading from his victim impact statement, he said his mother had been fit and healthy for her age and had many more years of her life left. He said his father’s health deteriorated after his mother’s death and he passed away “almost two years to the day she died”.
Judge Quinn extended the court’s sympathy to the Core family. He said that while the consequences of the “bad driving” must be taken into consideration they were not the determinative factor.
He ordered that Farrell pay a fine of €2,000 as well as pay €5,000 over to the Irish Road Victims Association in the next four months. He set a proposed prison sentence of nine months which he deferred under section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 where a court can defer sentence under conditions.

A TURKISH-BORN SUSPECT has confessed to terrorism charges over a shooting on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht which killed three people, prosecutors said today.
Thousands of Dutch mourners including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte took to Utrecht’s streets this evening to pay their last respects to the victims of the rampage, which also left seven injured.
Gokmen Tanis, 37, said he acted alone in Monday’s attack which triggered an eight-hour manhunt until he was captured.
“The 37-year-old suspect confessed this morning to the examining magistrate the criminal offences against him. He also stated that he acted alone,” the Dutch prosecution service said in a statement.
“Because of the investigation, nothing else can be said.”
Prosecutors said on Thursday that Tanis would be charged with “multiple murders with terrorist aims, as well as attempted murder and a terrorist threat.”
He appeared before a magistrate behind closed doors and was expected to be remanded in custody for a further two weeks.
Police had meanwhile released a 40-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday because Tanis had been found at his home, the prosecution service said.
“An in-depth investigation has been carried out into whether the man was involved in the shooting incident or helped in any way. No evidence was found and the man is therefore no longer a suspect,” it said.
Two other men were arrested and released earlier in the week after police sniffer dogs followed a trail from Tanis’s getaway car to their house.

More than 10,000 mourners attended the commemoration march to remember the victims.
Marchers walked in silence to the 24 October Square in the city where the three people –  a 19-year-old woman from Vianen, south of Utrecht, and two men aged 28 and 49 from Utrecht itself – lost their lives.
Many were carrying flowers and long queues formed as mourners stood in line to lay them at the scene where the tram came to a halt, the Dutch public newscaster NOS reported.
The marchers were carrying banners saying: “Utrecht will never be bowed” and “Je suis Utrecht/New Zealand” in a reference to the recent Christchurch shootings and the 2015 attacks in France.
The city’s Muslim community was also well-represented with representatives from a local mosque also laying flowers, carrying a banner saying “Muslims are at peace with humanity”,
Earlier, Utrecht’s mayor told marchers:
“We are showing that Utrecht is no place for violence and hate,” Jan van Zanen told the marchers, after which a moment of silence followed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/drink-driving-exemptions-leo-varadkar-4524105-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|5 Mar 2019
MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT Shane Ross has said proposals to allow convicted drink-drivers who are banned from the road to get an exemption so they can drive to work are a “non-runner”.
The Sunday Business Postreported last weekend that junior transport minister Brendan Griffin has asked officials to study a system currently operating in New Zealand.
In New Zealand, banned drivers can apply for an exemption if a driving ban causes them “extreme hardship”, such as a need to get to work.
“I have asked officials to come back to me on it,” Griffin said. “I am happy to consider and look at proposals.”
Applicants for a limited licence in New Zealand have to apply to a court and prove that not being able to drive causes extreme hardship to themselves or undue hardship to someone else, such as an employer or dependents.

The report states that the proposal is expected to be strongly opposed by the Road Safety Authority. It also states that campaigners for the limited licence believe it should only applied to drivers convicted at the “lower drink-driving range”.
In a statement to Virgin Media’s Tonight Show, Minister Ross said “this idea is a non-runner”.

“Absolutely no question of countenancing any idea of exempting anyone. This idea is a non-runner,” Ross said.
“If the vinters want to suggest ways of stopping driving drinking alcohol, let’s hear them,” he said.
The Bill will not be amended. No exceptions. We have introduced lifesaving legislation. We will not be diluting it.
Speaking to the mediayesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that his initial sense is that he’d be “sceptical about it as a proposal that’s workable”.
“If someone is banned from driving they’re banned for a reason. If you were to make an exception around travelling to and from work I’d wonder about the enforceability of that,” Varadkar said.
“Then you would probably have knock on effects from people looking for other reasons as to why they should be allowed to drive, because they have to look after a sick relative or they have a child with a disability,” he said.
“My initial sense is one of scepticism.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/court-case-gender-quotas-laws-4553828-Mar2019/,"A FIANNA FÁIL activist has been cleared to take a challenge over Ireland’s electoral laws linking the state funding for political parties with their meeting gender quota targets.
Brian Mohan was granted leave today by the Supreme Court to pursue a challenge to the constitutionality of the laws in the High Court at a later date.
Mohan had hoped to run as a candidate for the party in the Dublin Central constituency in 2016′s general election.
In 2015, Fianna Fáil members in Dublin Central and Dublin South-Central were told they could only select a female candidate to run in the 2016 general election.
He challenged sections of the Electoral Act 2012 which sees the state funding of parties slashed unless 30% (at a minimum) of a party’s electoral candidates for a general election are women.
His leave to take the action was dismissed by the High Court in 2016 and later by the Court of Appeal. Both courts found that he was not directly affected by the laws and that his own party – Fianna Fáil – had not challenged them.

The courts also found that Mohan wanted to rely on the right of any political party to challenge the legislation.
In a unanimous decision today, the Supreme Court found that Mohan did have a standing to take a case against the legislation.
It found that the other courts had erred in judging that the indirect nature of the impact of the legislation on Mohan denied him of the standing to take a challenge.
The matter will now go back to the High Court for a full hearing.
On Twitter, Mohan said he was “over the moon” at the court’s decision.
“Well we won our case in the Supreme Court this morning, over the moon, I always knew I’d the right to take this case,” he said.
Mohan is an election candidate in the upcoming local elections.

Greene was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2000 but was released eight years later.
According to RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, Greene died at the end of November but the Church authorities were not informed of his death at the time.  He was 91 years old.

It is also believed that the Raphoe Diocesan Office will be contacting victims of Greene in the next day or two to inform them of his death.
Greene sexually assaulted 26 boys in parishes across Donegal over three decades, starting in the 1960s.
In a2002 BBC interview, one of Greene’s victims, Paul Breslin described the abuse as “worse than hell”.
Breslin was only ten when Greene started to abuse him and he said he had nobody to turn to.
It is not known where Greene died, but RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta understands that he was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea.

THE EUROPEAN AVIATION Safety Agency (EASA) has announced that it is suspending all flight operations of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in Europe.
In a statement this afternoon it said the decision was taken after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight to Nairobi in Kenya on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.
Sunday’s crash comes four months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia killing 189.
The EASA has said that it is “continuously analysing the data” emerging relating to Sunday’s crash and that the decision to suspend Boeing 737 MAX operations in Europe as of 7pm today was taken as a “precautionary measure”.
“The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident,” the EASA has said in a statement.
The Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA) made a decision earlier this afternoon to temporarily suspend the operation of all variants of the Boeing aircraft into and out of Irish airspace.
“This decision has been taken based on ensuring the continued safety of passengers and flight crew, which is the IAA’s number one priority,” the IAA said.
The suspension took effect from 3pm today and followsan announcement by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authoritythat it was banning these aircraft from its airspace. France and Germany have now also closed airspace to the Boeing 737 Max planes, according toFrance 24.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands has also banned the aircraft from its airspace, according to Dutch infrastructure ministry spokesman Roel Vincken.
A Norwegian flight to Newburgh, Orange County, New York – due to leave Dublin Airport at 3.20pm today – has been cancelled. Earlier today the airline said it was grounding its Boeing 737 Max fleet. An earlier 2.55pm flight to Providence was also cancelled.

Turkish Airlines is the latest to ground all flights using its 12 Boeing 737 Max planes.
In its statement, the Irish Aviation Authority said:
There are 13 Boeing 737 aircraft on the Irish aircraft register. The IAA said it will continue to work closely with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and the manufacturer Boeing.
Responding to the suspensions, Boeing said safety is its “number one priority” and it has “full confidence” in the safety of the 737 Max.
“We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.
“The United States Federal Aviation Administration is not mandating any further action at this time, and based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.”
Advice for passengers
The Commission for Aviation Regulation (Car) has advised affected passengers to be aware of their entitlements.
In the event of a flight cancellation, the air carrier must offer you the choice between the following:
If you choose the first option the airline must provide you with care and assistance while you wait for the alternative flight.

FOUR MEMBERS OF an organised crime group connected to the supply and distribution of drugs linked to chemsex have been convicted in the UK.
Two women and two men were found guilty today at the conclusion of an eight-week trial at Inner London Crown Court.
Suellen Miguez (34) was convicted of 14 counts involving the conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs and removing criminal property from the country.
Carlos Edurardio Libardi Da Silva (33) was convicted of 14 counts involving the conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs and money laundering .
Bernardo Henrique Salles (25) was convicted of 14 counts involving the conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs and money laundering.

Isabella Braga Da Silva (21) was convicted of 14 counts involving the conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs.
Detectives from the Met Police’s Trident and Area Command led an investigation into the Brazilian gang for five months between March and July 2018.
Their enquiries found that the group set up a courier network of more than 43 mopeds to transport and sell drugs across London using a dedicated drugs line number.
They predominantly functioned by renting properties for short periods of time and using them as safe houses to store the drugs before moving onto other addresses every couple of days.
Between 25 July and 20 August 2018, the police operation culminated in a series of arrests in Wandsworth and Newham.
On 25 July, Braga De Silva was arrested after being stopped by police beside a car that contained more than £500,000 (€577,737) worth of drugs. Officers also seized £40,000 (€46,219) cash and drug equipment from the vehicle including plastic wrapping and a credit card receiver to handle card transactions.
Miguez and Libardi Da Silva were arrested shortly after on 30 July.
Miguez was seen leaving a self-storage unit in Ingate Place, Battersea in possession of more than £100,000 (€115,547) worth of drugs. It was identified that Libardi Da Silva had dropped Miguez off at the address a short while before and he was quickly located and apprehended.

Salles was linked to the gang through police surveillance and was arrested on 20 August 2018.
Cocaine, heroin, crystal meth, GBL and cannabis worth approximately £3 million (€3,466,402) was seized following searches at five different storage facilities across London.
The investigation found that the gang sold more than £2.5 million (€2.8 million) worth of drugs between 2016 and 2018.
“This investigation saw the largest ever seizure of GBL in the UK. I am incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown by my team throughout the course of this investigation which has disrupted a huge network and taken six dangerous people off the streets,” Met Police Detective Inspector Andy Durham said.
“I hope today’s conviction reassures communities that are listening and taking action. Please keep supplying us with information either about drug dealing, or about people you feel may be exploited by drug dealers.”

US ACTOR JUSSIE Smollett has pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to Chicago police about being the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime.
Smollett (36) – who gained fame on Fox musical drama “Empire” – is charged with 16 counts of felony for allegedly masterminding a false attack in order to gain publicity and increase his pay cheque.
Instead, the 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, has been dropped from the last two episodes of the show’s current season, and his future is now in the hands of the court.

Smollett was charged last month with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.
He allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago in late January, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.
According to court documents published online by local media, the 16-count indictment lists the specific statutes Smollett violated by telling police that he’d been attacked when he knew “there was no reasonable ground for believing” that such crimes had occurred.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-relief-effort-mozambique-southern-africa-4556276-Mar2019/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT has announced it is giving over €1 million in funding to support the thousands of people affected by Cyclone Idai in southern Africa.
Tánaiste, Simon Coveney, and Minister of International Development Ciarán Cannon made the announcement today offering their deepest sympathies to everyone impacted by the “truly shocking” disaster.
“Rapid assessments, including through EU satellite imagery, have highlighted the vast scale of humanitarian need, which is only likely to grow in the coming days and weeks. It is vital therefore that we step up our international response.
“That is why, in addition to our contributions to the UN relief efforts, I am pleased that Ireland will contribute at least €1,050,000 to help those most gravely affected,” Coveney said in a statement.
A week after Tropical Cyclone Idai lashed Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, flood waters have begun to recede in parts, adding fears the death toll could soar as bodies are revealed.
The number of deaths could be beyond the 1,000 predicted by Mozambique’s president earlier this week, said Elhadj As Sy, the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
In addition to worries about the number of dead, As Sy told The Associated Press that the humanitarian needs are great.
“They are nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem,” As Sy said. “And I fear we will be seeing more in the weeks and months ahead, and we should brace ourselves.”

In Mozambique, thousands of people were making a grim voyage toward the city of Beira, which although 90% destroyed has become a centre for frantic rescue efforts throughout the region.
Some walked along roads carved away by the raging waters a week ago. Others, hundreds of them, were ferried in an extraordinary makeshift effort by local fishermen who plucked stranded people from small islands.
Helicopters set off into the rain for another day of efforts to find people clinging to rooftops and trees.
For those who reach Beira with their few remaining possessions, life is grim. Waterborne diseases are a growing concern as water and sanitation systems were largely destroyed.
“The situation is simply horrendous, there is no other way to describe it,” As Sy said after touring transit camps for the growing number of displaced.
What moved him the most was the number of children without their parents, separated in the chaos or newly orphaned.
“Yesterday (we) did a reconnaissance and we found another (inland) lake. So we are still very early in the phase of identifying what the scope of this is, for who is affected and how many are lost,” Emma Batey, coordinator for the consortium of Oxfam, CARE and Save the Children, told the AP.
Luckily, the area is a national park and less densely populated, she said. Still, “there were devastatingly small amounts of people.”

She estimated that another 100 people would be airlifted out today: “We’re only picking up those in absolute dire need.”
No one is still clinging to roofs and trees, she said.

Pedro Matos, emergency coordinator for the World Food Program, said that what rescuers are seeing now is “sometimes it’s just a hut completely surrounded by water.”
“If islands are big enough, we can even see smoke coming out, meaning that they’re cooking,” he said, adding that it remains “super difficult” to estimate a death toll or even the number of missing.
For residents of Beira, life staggered on. People salvaged the metal strips of roofs that had been peeled away like the skin of a fruit. Downed trees littered the streets. And yet there were flashes of life as it used to be. White wedding dresses stood pristine behind a shop window that hadn’t shattered.
Zimbabwe was also affected by the cyclone and as roads began to clear and some basic communications were set up, a fuller picture of the extent of the damage there is beginning to emerge.
The victims are diverse: a mother buried in the same grave with her child, headmasters missing together with dozens of school students, illegal gold and diamond miners swept away by raging rivers and police officers washed away with their prisoners.
The Ministry of Information said 30 pupils, two headmasters and a teacher are missing.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Thursday that officers and prisoners were washed way.

In downtown Beira, a sidewalk is Marta Ben’s new home. The 30-year-old mother of five clutched a teary child to her hip as she described the sudden horror of the storm.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” she said, barefoot, a cooking pot bubbling nearby. “We were not warned. Suddenly the roof flew away.”
She said she and neighbours in their home near the beach hurried their many children away but “we lost some of them.” Hers survived.
Now they claim a patch of sidewalk among others newly homeless. They beg passers-by for aid. They say they have received nothing from the government or aid groups, “not even bread.”
And yet she knows others have suffered more. She described seeing the ragged people who had been ferried by fishermen from communities outside the city. “They looked sad,” she said.
The survivors from inland Mozambique arrived by the boatload, some 50 at a time, mostly children, witnesses said.
“Some were wounded. Some were bleeding. Some had feet white like flour for being in the water for so long,” said Julia Castigo, who watched them arrive Friday morning.
The 24-year-old said the cyclone came as a surprise to her, her husband and two children. It blew away the roof, the door, the windows. Water filled the home.
She looked resigned. “We survived. We’re still here,” she said simply.

https://www.thejournal.ie/green-card-brexit-4526528-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Mar 2019
TRANSPORT MINISTER SHANE Ross has said his department has asked the European Commission to set a date for when motorists travelling to Northern Ireland will not need a green card.
He said the government is currently in talks with the EC about reaching an arrangement on the cards, stating that this is not something Ireland wants to be in place.
In January, motorists were told they would require aninsurance Green Cardto drive in Northern Ireland and the UK in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
Last month, green card forms and electronic application templates have been issued to insurance providers by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.
The MIBI has advised motorists who plan on driving in Northern Ireland and the UK immediately after 29 March to begin applying for their green cards in case a no-deal scenario materialises.
Those who plan on travelling after that period have been advised to contact their insurance company or broker one month in advance of their expected travel date.
Currently, Irish-registered vehicles that travel within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU Motor Insurance Directive. However, a no-deal Brexit would see the UK withdraw from this directive, meaning Irish motorists will require a Green Card to travel there.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed today that those based in the North but travelling by car over the border to the south will not need a green card.
He told the Dáil that understands that there are concerns around the issue of green cards, adding that the vast majority of those with motor insurance will be covered if they driving over the border.
However, he added that drivers will need to prove they have insurance in the form of a green card.
Speaking about drivers from the North who are travelling to the south, he clarified there will be a “grace period” in effect post-Brexit.
Transport Minister Shane Ross, stated “this is not something that the government wants to see, rather it is another consequence of a decision by the UK people”.
“As part of its contingency planning, the Government has raised this matter directly with the European Commission seeking agreement from it to set a date from which green cards would not be required as is possible under the EU’s Motor Insurance Directive.
“The Commission has not given agreement to date and the Government continues to pursue the matter with it,” said Ross.
Ross went on to say that the preparation by MIBI and insurers is an example of ‘prudent advance planning “in preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit”.
The department has requested, and continues to do so, that the EU Commission set a date where green cards would not be required, he said.
‘Asleep at the wheel’
Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty today called on the Taoiseach to directly intervene in the situation, accusing Transport Minister Shane Ross of being “asleep at the wheel” in relation to drivers needing green cards to travel over the border after Brexit.

Doherty said confusions continue to reign as people are unaware of the consequences of not applying for the card, stating that people are concerned about their insurance not being recognised in the North, and cars being impounded if stopped.
The Donegal deputy questioned how the transport minister allowed the situation to get where it is today just a couple of weeks away from 29 March.
He added that some countries outside of the EU, have arrangements in place where such green cards are not required.
Doherty asked why such a deal wasn’t already in place for Northern Ireland, stating that due diligence on the issue should have been done months ago, and not left to the last minute.
Bilateral arrangement needed
Varadkar said the government is continuing in its work in a bid to get an arrangement bilaterally between the EU and the UK, but that has yet to be agreed.
Fianna Fáil’s Lisa Chambers said the government needs to provide assurances to people as to what might happen and what drivers need after the drive over the border post 29 March.
Ross “needs to get his act together,” said Chambers, who said the transport minister should be less concerned about the passage of his judicial appointments Bill and more concerned with the “bread and butter” work of his own department.
Speaking about whether her party had been briefed about what will happen to the border if there is a no-deal scenario, Chambers said the government have been far from transparent on the issue.
Chambers said the Tánaiste has said the government is not planning for a hard border, adding that the most Simon Coveney has stretched to is suggesting the border would be somewhere in the sea.
“He really hasn’t provided more detail than that,” she added.
The “best insight” given by government on the border issue was when a private conversation was recorded between Ross and Coveney at a press briefing.
The Tánaiste was recorded as telling the transport minister “we don’t want to be the government that introduce a border on this island” and Ross replied, “well, I just didn’t know what to say”.
She said that suggests there is a “Cabinet within the Cabinet” where not all ministers are being briefed on the contingency plans for the border.
However, she said it is not credible to suggest that the Tánaiste and the Taosieach have not had the conversation about what would happen in a no-deal scenario, though she doubts there are any discoverable notes written down on paper.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pet-passports-2-4537041-Mar2019/,"THE DEPARTMENT OF Agriculture has launched a tender worth €80,000 for the provision of 75,000 pet passports.
Anyone wishing to travel from one EU country to another with a dog, cat or ferret must have a pet passport, and this also applies to travel between Ireland and the UK.
The government doesn’t know exactly how many passports will be required each year, but said that 25,000 have been issued annually in the past.
This new contract comes on the back of advice issued to pet owners earlier this month on what they’ll needif they’re travelling with them to and from the UK after Brexit.
The requirement for the EU pet passport applies to cats, dogs and ferrets with the legislation meaning that if you’re travelling between EU countries with any of these animals, you need a passport for it.

The 28-page document contains information on its latest rabies vaccinations, when it was microchipped and any other vaccinations it has.
In awarding its contract, the Department of Agriculture said that it must receive the passports in boxes of 200, and delivered in consignments of 5,000.
With Brexit looming, the pet passport that Irish pet owners possess should be sufficient in the event of a Brexit deal making its way through parliament in the short term.
Whatever form Brexit takes, pet owners looking to travel are advised to contact a veterinarian as soon as possible before setting off to make sure all necessary arrangements are in place.
In the event of a no-deal, however, a pet passport issued in the UK won’t be sufficient to return to Ireland with your pet.
If travelling to Great Britain in a no-deal scenario, pet owners must ensure their dog/cat/ferret is microchipped, vaccinated against rabies, have an EU pet passport (so they can get back), have a rabies titration test.
Furthermore, bringing anyone bringing a pet dog, cat or ferret into Ireland from Britain n will have to give the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine advance notice by email before arrival.

https://www.thejournal.ie/laura-brennan-hse-hpv-campaigner-4552742-Mar2019/,"SIX MONTHS BEFORE her death at the age of 26, Laura Brennan was awarded the first ever Patient Advocacy Medal by the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.
The medal, presented at the launch of a HPV vaccination programme by the HSE, recognised her advocacy in trying to get more young women to take up the vaccine.
“What Laura has done is immeasurable,” the Royal College of Physicians said at the time.
“The increased uptake rate of 65%… shows that efforts to raise awareness of the importance of the vaccine are working and Laura has greatly contributed to that.”
But for Laura, it almost wasn’t enough.
In a speech that left some at the RHA Gallery in tears, she spoke about how cancer had robbed her of her life, how it would rob her parents of their daughter, how she would never have children, and how the disease continued to get stronger as she got weaker.
“65% isn’t where I want the vaccine rates to be,” she said.
“As you all know, I won’t be happy until as many of our girls are protected as possible and until boys are included in the vaccination programme.
“But at least it’s going in the right direction.”
Positive outlook
Laura first contacted the HSE in September 2017, after she received a diagnosis of terminal cervical cancer at the age of 25.
Although she initially went through treatment and was predicted to have a good chance of recovering, the cancer eventually spread to her lymph nodes.
Her terminal diagnosis came after an incorrect suggestion that she had a possible bacterial infection from a retained tampon, and an incorrect all-clear after cancer was eventually detected.
Two months after receiving the MRI scan that gave her an all-clear, another doctor told her that her cancer had moved to her chest and that palliative care was among her only options.
But rather than waiting to die, Laura remained positive, claiming that even her nurse thought she was “mental” when she was told her cancer had metastased.
“You can’t really dwell on the questions like ‘why did this happen to me?’”she said at the time.
“I’m only 25, this isn’t supposed to happen to women my age. You have to keep positive about everything.”
Laura Brennan appears in a HPV vaccination campaign video last yearHSEHSE
Laura was too old to get the HPV vaccine when it was first rolled out in Irish schools, but became annoyed by misconceptions about cervical cancer and rumours about the vaccine’s safety after her diagnosis.
She recalls how people told her that cervical cancer was one of the best cancers to get because it was so treatable.
“Even if cervical cancer can be treated and cured, the treatment itself is horrendous,” she recalled.
“Nobody would like to see their daughter go through that.”
With that in mind, she became determined to tell her story to every Irish parent who was considering a decision about vaccinating their daughter against HPV.
“This illness is devastating and it’s going to take my life, but the good news is there’s a vaccine that you can get that prevents it,” she said.
“I just wanted parents to know there is an alternative.”
‘I’ll be in pain’
Laura’s campaign started with her appearance in a HSE video last March 2018, when the service rolled out the second phase of its HPV vaccine information campaign.
In the video, she spoke of her previous optimism that her cancer could be cured and of the false hope that there was a “good chance” she could be cured.
“The vaccine saves lives,” she said. “It could have saved mine.”
The video received hugely positive reaction following its launch, and led to Laura’s appearance on The Late Late Show the following month.
The Late Late Show/ YouTube
In a frank interview with Ryan Tubridy, she spoke about the reality of living with cancer and her fears about what would happen as her health continued to deteriorate.
“Sometime in the future, there might not be a cure for my cancer and I will be in pain, and I won’t be able to get out of bed,” she said.
After her interview, the World Health Organisation (WHO), invited Laura to bring her advocacy of the HPV vaccine across Europe.
She visited the WHO’s European headquarters in Copenhagen to discuss her work, and consulted with them about how to increase the uptake of the vaccine.
Then in September, as Laura launched the latest stage of the HSE’s vaccination campaign and collected her award from the Royal College of Physicians, the health service revealed the uptake rate had risen to 65%, an increase of 15% in previous year.
Internal Department of Health documents seen byTheJournal.ieregarding the launch reveal how Minister Simon Harris sought to recognise Laura’s contribution to this figure.
Speech notes state how the Minister sought to “acknowledge Laura and her ongoing advocacy work”, while she was also on a list of invited guests who the Minister wanted to meet.
Once again, Laura gave a forthright address to Irish parents to consider the vaccine, reminding them of what her own parents were going through with her.
“You don’t want to have to look into your child’s eyes and tell them you could have saved them from a HPV-related cancer,” she said.
“Because even if it doesn’t end their life, it will leave them damaged for life – damaged from cancer and damaged from treatment.”
Generous spirit
Last week, as Laura’s health continued to deteriorate, the HSE confirmed that parents and children seemed to be getting her message.
Latest figures from the executive showed thatthe uptake rate for the vaccine had reached 70%, an increase of 20 percentage points in just over two years.
Despite being in the final days of her illness, Laura continued to campaign and express optimism that the trend was continuing upwards.
“I’m thrilled that people are listening… to the reality of what life with cervical cancer is really like and finding out for themselves that this vaccine is safe and effective,” she said.
It wasn’t expected that her death would come just over a week later.
Her passing at University Hospital Limerick wasannounced by the executive yesterday evening.
Among those to pay tribute to her were Minister for Health Simon Harris, who said the State owed her “a debt of gratitude”, and HSE interim director Anne O’Connor, who recognised the difference her campaigning had made.
“Laura has defined courage and generosity as she supported our work to ensure girls get the HPV vaccine, and are protected from this terrible cancer,” she said.
“We know that Laura has made a difference, and will have saved lives through her great effort and her tremendous generosity of spirit.”
Her family said she wanted to make a difference, and to use the time that she had to “right what she felt was a great wrong”.
Few believed that time would end so soon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/wrc-landlord-rent-4549670-Mar2019/,"A BLACK WOMAN who alleged that she was discriminated against by her landlord has been awarded €12,000 following a hearing before the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).
The American national claimed that she and her husband were given notice to leave their home after informing the landlord they had applied for rent supplement.
She further alleged that the landlord’s son called her a “black bitch” and a “black c**t” during a later confrontation.
Rent supplement
The woman submitted that she had rented the property with her husband, two children and her mother for a period of seven months before she said she was forced to apply for rent supplement when her husband lost his job.
She said she asked the landlord to sign the relevant forms to avail of rent supplement, and he quickly returned them to her.
However, two days later, the woman claimed she received notice to vacate the property in a months’ time.
She was granted the rent supplement, and the landlord gave her an extra two weeks before they had to leave the property.
The woman claims that before she received notice to leave the property, she was subject to “intimidating and hostile treatment”, particularly from the landlord’s son who lived in the adjoining house and was in control of some utilities such as the oil for the heating.
She said she informed the landlord of various alleged incidents – including the son demanding heaters he loaned them be returned when he knew there was no oil in the tank to heat the home and the son taking away and destroying a trampoline and basketball net he’d given them.
In response, she said the landlord replied that he called her “street brawlers” for mentioning the problems with his son, and also accused her of being imprudent with money.
In a later incident, the woman said the landlord’s son blocked her car in a car park where she’d brought her children to a playground. She alleged he called her a “black c**t” and a black bitch, and she reported the incident to gardaí.
She said the relationship completely changed with the landlord when she said she was applying for rent supplement, and claimed she was discriminated against on these grounds.

Defence
In his submission to the WRC, the woman’s landlord said he agreed that he signed the forms for her to sign up for rent supplement.
But, on the date he did so, he said that the rent for that month was already several days late.
The WRC adjudicator described his position: “It was decided given the irregularity of the payment of the rent to terminate the tenancy. A notice of termination of the lease was issued on 15 December.
He said the decision to terminate the tenancy was based on their rent payment record over the previous six months, as they had been in arrears on a number of occasions.
The landlord said her case had been appealed to the Residential Tenancies Board and she was not evicted. She remained in the tenancy a further four months after the initial date she was told to leave the property.
Furthermore, he submitted that any issues the woman had with his son were “irrelevant as he is not a party to the proceedings”. He said he wasn’t made aware of any alleged harassment on his son’s part.
Decision
In the decision made, the WRC adjudicator said: “I cannot accept that the reason for the termination was only due to delayed payments of the rent in some instances, particularly as these payments were delayed rather withheld or not honoured.
As a result, the adjudicator ruled that a prime facie case of discriminatory treatment on housing assistance grounds had been made, which the landlord had failed to rebut.
The adjudicator also said there was no prima facie evidence she was discriminated against on the grounds of her race when the landlord terminated the tenancy.
However, given the landlord’s son was her point of contact when issues arose in the tenancy, the adjudicator was satisfied that the landlord was “vicariously liable” for the son’s actions under the appropriate legislation.
The adjudicator said they were satisfied on the evidence that the landlord’s son had subjected her to a “hostile and intimidating environment and called her offensive names” which constituted harassment.
The maximum compensation that could be awarded in this case is €15,000.
The adjudicator said: “In considering the amount of compensation that I should award, I have noted the effects of the discriminatory treatment has had on the Complainant.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-san-fran-award-4535557-Mar2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said that the City of San Francisco’s posthumous award to Martin McGuinness, which cites his “courageous service in the military”, has caused offence.
Foster said that the reference has caused “a great deal of pain and offence to many people within Northern Ireland”.
“In the later part of his life, Martin McGuinness undoubtedly played a very important role in the restoration of devolution. That peaceful political role was an important part of his life, but the earlier part of his life was one of violence,” Foster said.
Arlene Foster served as First Minister and McGuinness as Deputy First Minister before the Stormont Assembly collapsed over two years ago over the cash-for-ash scandal.

Foster said that she had written to the British Consul General in San Francisco, Andrew Whittaker, who serves as the equivalent of an ambassador for the US city. The award was signed and approved by the Mayor of San Francisco, London Breed.

The award was signed on Friday, 8 March, although it states that it was honoured “on the occasion of the National Day of Ireland”.
“His sacrifice and dedication to secure peace for his people is not only an inspiration to us all, but represents San Francisco values at their best. He leaves a legacy that embodies and celebrates the diverse history and strength of San Francisco and Ireland.”
Foster said that when McGuinness was a commander of the Provisional IRA Derry, “the towns of Claudy and Coleraine suffered indiscriminate car bomb attacks”.
“I hope that Mayor Breed she might take up the invitation to learn more about the activities of the IRA, or even to visit Northern Ireland and find out first-hand from those who suffered from their terrorism.”

Brendan McCarthy (50) carried out the body modifications at his Dr Evil studio between 2012 and 2015.
An investigation was launched following complaints from people who had seen images online of McCarthy removing a client’s ear.
McCarthy has no medical qualifications and is not registered with The General Medical Council.

After he was arrested, McCarthy claimed he did not believe he had broken the law by performing the modifications because his clients had consented to the procedures being carried out.
The defence presented lengthy and detailed legal argument to the Crown Court, Court of Appeal and were refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.
McCarthy pleaded guilty to three counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Wolverhampton Crown Court today.
“This is a landmark case involving body modification. This prosecution was not brought to seek to curtail individual choice or freedom of self-expression but because McCarthy, who was licensed to carry out tattooing and body piercing, was performing what were significant surgical procedures in a tattoo studio in Wolverhampton,” the Crown Prosecution Service’s Rhiannon Jones said.
“The Court of Appeal judgement is clear and unequivocal and we would urge all those thinking of carrying out a body modification to please read it,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/airshow-death-4530742-Mar2019/,"THE PILOT OF a jet which crashed at an airshow in England killing 11 men has said he is “truly sorry” for the part played in their deaths after he was today found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence.
In August 2015, aerobatic stunt flyer Andrew Hill’s vintage Hawker Hunter military jet failed to pull up in time after a loop manoeuvre and ploughed through cars on a busy road during the Shoreham Airshow, in West Sussex, England.
The crash at the Shoreham Airshow on the southeast English coast created two fireballs that sent thick, black smoke billowing into the sky.
A total of 11 people died as a result. Hill survived the crash. He suffered head injuries and was placed in an induced coma before being released from hospital a month later.
Charges were later brought against Hill for the incident.
Today, a jury acquitted him of the charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was also acquitted of negligently or recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft.
In a statementoutside the courthouse today, Hill listed the names of the people who had died and referenced others who were injured in the incident.

“I am truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths and it is they I will remember for the rest of my life,” he said.
“No justice”
Following the verdict, Sue and Phil Grimstone – the parents of Matthew who died in the crash – released a statement,
They said that there “seems to be no justice for our son Matthew and all 11 men who died in such tragic circumstances”.
They called into the question the safety of all aerobatic air displays “when there is no doubt concerning any pilot’s ability to avoid becoming cognitively impaired” when performing certain maneuvers.
“Matthew had no interest in air shows, he could not have cared less. Knowing he died because an aircraft was being flown for fun, for the entertainment of others makes it even harder to bear,” the parents said.
In another statement, Sarah Stewart, a partner at Stewarts, who represent many of the bereaved families called for a wider investigation into the crash, saying:
“It is now almost four years since the Shoreham Airshow disaster killed 11 innocent men. The bereaved families have had to painfully re-live the circumstances of their loved ones’ death again and again,” she said.

25-year-old Conor came through the ranks with Ulster and now plays for English Championship side Jersey, while 21-year-old Kieran is in Connacht’s academy and made his senior debut this season.

The Joyce brothers are also the brains behindNoggin Sport, a community interest company that sells clothing to raise money for mental health charities.
So while some of their team-mates head home from training for a game of Fortnite, Conor and Kieran are often straight onto their laptops to deal with the latest batch of orders for their popular beanie hats, or to respond to people who have reached out from the ever-growing Noggin community.
With the likes of Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien and several GAA stars lending their support to Noggin, that community is growing and the Joyce brothers are hoping their message can make a difference.
“Our aim is to help people and make people realise that it’s ok to talk about how they feel, that mental health and mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of,” says Kieran, who also spent time with Ulster’s sub-academy.
“Everyone has different experiences but at some point or another, everyone goes through tough times. People have self-doubt and go through tough experiences so as we’ve got more and more clubs involved, the outreach has been fantastic.”
Kieran suffered with mental health issues during his time in Queen’s University Belfast, leaving him with first-hand experience of dealing with mental illness and an understanding of how difficult it can be to know who to turn to for help.

“I went home to Conor and we thought we could do something to combine the two,” he says. “Conor came up with the fantastic name of Noggin and the idea of combining sport and mental health and trying to help people. That’s where it was born.”
Noggin launched in 2017 and took off quickly.
“People connected with it,” says Conor, who made six senior appearances for Ulster before joining Jersey two seasons ago. “Everyone knows someone who has been affected by mental health issues in some capacity, so it’s been unbelievable the amount of support we’ve had for it.
“Around the time we were starting, we lost our uncle, who took his own life. That spurred us on to really go for it and try to make an impact, try to connect with people as much as we could so things like that don’t happen as much.
“We’re no experts in mental health but we’d try to advise people to go and see people who are trained in being able to help.
“We receive lots of messages from people opening up to us, which is great.”

Noggin’sonline shopsells beanies, snapbacks, bobble hats and t-shirts, with an increasing number of sports clubs in Ireland and the UK ordering batches of customised hats in their own club colours.
All of Noggin’s profits go directly to charities relating to mental health.
“We use the money to try to impact local communities, whether it be a charity called Mind or the Finglas Suicide Network,” says Kieran. “We’re all about diverting that money to try and help the local community and we’re open to working with different charities in mental health in the UK or Ireland.
“We’re looking to expand on it and really try and get as much money as we can for charity.”
Noggin run social media competitions to raise funds and also link up with high-profile sportspeople like O’Brien, with whom they’re currently running a competition to give away 30 beanies and €1,000 for a mental health charity.

The Joyce brothers are keen to build Noggin into a true community in which people can speak openly about their mental health and feel part of something bigger.
Conor has recently returned from a torn bicep injury.Noggin SportNoggin Sport
They also intend to run workshops and events in the future.
“We hope people in the community will realise that there’s nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to mental illness,” says Kieran. “It’s about creating a community where everyone is part of something.
“You don’t feel lonely or afraid, you feel part of the community where you’re working towards something positive for the future. That’s been really important to us from the off and it’s great to see that the more hats we’re selling and the more people are getting involved, those people are getting more comfortable talking.”
“There’s obviously been a stigma around talking about mental health,” adds Conor. “That’s what we’re trying to do, smash down those barriers.”

A SECOND KOREAN K-pop star has quit the music industry over a growing sex scandal.
Jung Joon-young (30) has admitted to filming himself having sex and sharing the footage without his partners’ consent.
In the space of just two days, singer-songwriter Jung and singer Seungri (29) have both announced their retirements from the music industry over the growing scandal.
Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, is embroiled in a sex-for-investment criminal investigation.
Both singers were members of the same chatroom where Jung and others shared illicit content of at least 10 women. Jung has been charged by police for illegal filming and leaking visual material.
I admit to all my crimes,” he said in a statement. “I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a social media chatroom, and while I did so I didn’t feel a great sense of guilt”.
“More than anything, I kneel and apologise to the women who appear in the videos who have learned of this hideous truth as the incident has come to light”.
‘Ideal cultural exports’
South Korea has been tackling an epidemic of so-called “molka” or spycam videos -mostly of women, secretly filmed by men.

K-pop stars generally cultivate clean-cut images and are actively promoted by the South Korean government as a key cultural export.
Many face pressure to look and behave perfectly in an industry powered by so-called “fandoms” – groups of well-organised admirers at home and abroad who spend enormous amounts of time and money to help their favoured stars climb up the charts and attack their perceived rivals.
Lee Moon-won, a popular culture critic in Seoul, has said that the multilingual Seungri – who has multiple business interests – was popularly seen as “ideal cultural export”.
“Most of his fans would agree that Seungri is an exceptionally hard working star,” Lee has said.
“On top of his singing career, he somehow mastered Japanese and Chinese, which made him a very useful member whenever [he] visited those countries”.
“Learning two foreign languages while being a K-pop star is definitely not an easy thing”.
Seungri was interviewed by police last weekend over accusations he lobbied potential investors by offering them the services of prostitutes at nightclubs in Seoul’s Gangnam district.
The 29-year-old is also linked to a police investigation into Burning Sun – a nightclub where he was a public relations director. Staff there are alleged to have filmed women with hidden cameras and used alcohol and drugs to sexually assault them.

NORTH KOREANS WENT to the polls today for an election in which there could be only one winner.
Leader Kim Jong Un’s ruling Workers’ Party has an iron grip on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as the isolated, nuclear-armed country is officially known.
Every five years it holds an election for the rubber stamp legislature, known as the Supreme People’s Assembly.
The exercise has all the trappings of votes elsewhere, from electoral rolls to sealed ballot boxes to scrutineers for the count.
But in keeping with one of Pyongyang’s most enduring slogans – “Single-minded unity” – there is only one approved name on each of the red voting slips.

With portraits of the leader’s father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung looking down on every ballot box, voters lined up to drop their slips inside.
There is a pencil in the panelled voting booths for anyone who might wish to register dissent by crossing out a candidate’s name. But no one does.
By 6pm, the official KCNA news agency reported, all electors in all constituencies had voted, “except for those abroad or working in oceans”.

Turnout in 2014 was 99.97% and the vote was 100% in favour of the named candidates, a result unmatched anywhere else in the world.
“Our society is one in which the people are gathered around the respected Supreme Leader with a single mind,” election official Ko Kyong Hak told AFP outside a polling station at the 3.26 Pyongyang Cable Factory.
Participation in the election was a citizen’s obligation, he said, “and there are no people who reject a candidate”.
An editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling party, said that voters “should cast approval ballots with their loyalty to the party and the leader, absolute support to the DPRK government and the will to share their destiny with socialism to the last”.
Carnival atmosphere
Dita AlangkaraDita Alangkara
With a total absence of electoral competition, analysts say the election is held largely as a political rite to enable the authorities to claim a mandate from the people.
Today’s voting took place in something of a carnival atmosphere in Pyongyang, children in red neckerchiefs parading in the streets to encourage voters to attend.
Bands played at polling stations, where voters queued up in numerical order according to voter lists displayed for days beforehand, and women in flowing traditional dresses danced after casting their ballots.
The North is divided into constituencies for the vote – there were 686 at the last election, when Kim stood in Mount Paektu, a dormant volcano on the border with China revered as the spiritual birthplace of the Korean people.
He received a 100% turnout and 100% in favour according to KCNA.

THE UNITED STATES has said there is “no basis” to ground Boeing 737 MAX airplanes, after a second deadly crash involving the model in less than five months prompted governments worldwide to ban the aircraft.
Despite the aviation giant’s assurances that the plane is safe and reliable, Ireland and the rest of the European Union have joined India, China and other countries grounding the plane or banning it from their airspace as they await the results of the investigation into the crash.
But the US has so far refused to take similar action against the American aerospace giant’s best-selling workhorse aircraft.
“Thus far, our review shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft,” Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Daniel Elwell said in a statement last night.
A new Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.
That followed the October crash of a new Lion Air jet of the same model in Indonesia, which killed 189 people shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
The widening actions against the aircraft puts pressure on Boeing – the world’s biggest plane manufacturer – to prove the MAX planes are safe, and the company has said it is rolling out flight software updates by April that could address issues with a faulty sensor.
The full extent of the impact of the aircraft bans on international travel routes was unclear. There are about 350 MAX 8 planes currently in service around the world.
The Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA) took steps yesterday afternoon to temporarily suspend the operation of all variants of the Boeing aircraft into and out of Irish airspace.
“This decision has been taken based on ensuring the continued safety of passengers and flight crew, which is the IAA’s number one priority,” the IAA said.
The suspension took effect from 3pm yesterday and followedan announcement by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authoritythat it was banning these aircraft from its airspace.

A Norwegian flight to Newburgh, Orange County, New York – due to leave Dublin Airport at 3.20pm yesterday – was been cancelled. Earlier today the airline said it was grounding its Boeing 737 Max fleet. An earlier 2.55pm flight to Providence was also cancelled.
A spokesperson for the airline said it is looking at re-allocating passengers on other Norwegian flights and it is currently in the process of offering re-bookings to affected passengers.
‘Precautionary measure’
India joined the list of countries to ban the jet, a day after saying it had imposed additional interim safety requirements for ground engineers and crew for the aircraft.
New Zealand has also temporarily banned the aircraft from its airspace, along with Australia, Malaysia, Oman and Singapore.
Turkish Airlines, one of the largest carriers in the world, said it was suspending use of its 12 MAX aircraft from today, until “uncertainty” was clarified.
US President Donald Trump weighed in with his own take yesterday, tweeting: “Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.”
“Pilot are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,” he wrote, referring to the prestigious university.
Trump later spoke by telephone to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who assured him the aircraft is safe, an industry source told AFP.
US carriers have so far appeared to maintain confidence in Boeing, which has been ordered by the FAA to make changes to flight systems and pilot training procedures.

The Scottish journalist is remembered fondly for his coverage of Republic of Ireland international games throughout recent years.
Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, who’s tenure in charge of the national team Robertson covered, paid tribute on Wednesday.
“It’s very sad. I really feel for his family,” McCarthy said.
“He was a great lad, I used to laugh with him because he used to always end his reports with that‘Sky Sports News’line. I always repeated it to him any time I saw him.
“Its just very, very sad and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family.”

“We met at Napier Uni as kids and grew up together at STV & Sky. He’s always been there, always wearing that big grin.
“A fine journalist with an eye for a story, never happier than when offering help to teammates: generously sharing his time, vast knowledge and ideas.
“Fraz loved sport and TV, working in both gave him structure in life, especially after his comeback from major illness.
“We’ve lost a lovely man. I can’t believe he’s gone and I’m so terribly sad for his family.”
Former Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given, who represented the national team between 1996 and 2016 also paid his respects.

David Jones, who currently presents with the network, added: “So sad to have lost Fraser Robertson so young.
“A journalist always committed to the cause, digging and eager to get the stories. Full of energy off camera too and on the golf course. Thoughts with his family at a terrible time.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/petition-brexit-article-50-signatures-4555005-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
MORE THAN TWO million people have signedan online petitioncalling for the British government to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.
The petition, which was launched yesterday, says a “second Brexit referendum may not happen – so vote now”.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now,” it reads.
At the time of updating this article, the petition had just over 2,002,343 signatures.
It was started by Margaret Anne Georgiadou, whotold the BBC: “I became like every other Remainer – very frustrated that we’ve been silenced and ignored for so long.
She said the petition “didn’t do very well for a week”.
“I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,” she added.
The British Parliament’s petitions committee tweeted that the rate of signings is the “highest the site has ever had to deal with”, after the website briefly crashed earlier.
A House of Commons spokesman said the technical difficulties on parliament’s e-petition website were caused by “a large and sustained load on the system”.

The rate of signing is the highest the site has ever had to deal with and we have had to make some changes to ensure the site remains stable and open for signatures and new petitions. Thanks for bearing with us.
The petition comes as the European Council agreed to delay the date by which the UK leaves the European Union by almost two months if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the UK parliament next week.
Following lengthy discussions in Brussels, the European Council has now agreed to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week.
If the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until 12 April 2019 and “expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European Council”.
The UK had been legally obliged to leave the European Union on 29 March (next Friday), two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May, which sets the Brexit process in motion.
If a petition on the website gets more than 100,000 signatures, the Parliament is meant to consider it for debate.
The government is expected to respond to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures.
Data on the website shows the petition’s strongest pockets of support are in north London, Bristol and Brighton – all Remain hotbeds during the 2016 referendum.
There were also strong pockets of support in countries with large British diasporas, including more than 8,000 from France and more than 4,000 from Spain.
It is the third most popular e-petition since parliament launched the website in 2011.
A 2016 petition calling for a second EU referendum should the winning vote and turnout not reach a certain threshold received the most signatories at almost 4.2 million.
A petition to prevent US President Donald Trump from making a state visit to Britain reached 1.9 million signatures.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-tech-giants-must-be-held-responsible-for-publishing-images-of-murder-and-child-abuse-4549982-Mar2019/,"BRENTON TARRANT’S SHOOTING spree in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was shocking for many reasons.
Just one of the many horrific aspects of this mass murder was the fact that he live-streamed it.
Tarrant knew that this video would be widely shared, it was easy for him to ensure that it would because he was a member of aninfamous internet site called 8chan(or infinitychan) which hosted a forum for people to share “politically incorrect” views.
So before the shooting spree, Tarrant posted a link of his live-stream to 8chan, knowing that the community of extremists would spread the video far and wide. The members of the forum applauded his actions with Nazi memes.
Tarrant was able to count on this internet subculture to disseminate his racist murder campaign – but he was also able to rely on Google.
Tech giants shirk responsibility
For too long, the internet giant has been shirking its responsibilities.
Alphabet is Google’s parent company and, as of last year, it was valued at $740 billion.
Google ispioneering self-driving carsand bringing the internet to remote parts of Sub-Saharan Africa via anetwork of giant balloons.
It has one of the most sophisticated algorithms imaginable.
Google also owns YouTube and that site was awash with videos of Tarrant’s attack.
Buzzfeed journalistRyan Mac documentedGoogle and Facebook’s response to the video. He found that it took YouTube more than two hours to take down a video he had reported after it was gaining a lot of traction online.
Facebook also declined to comment on how long it took them to take down Tarrant’s live-stream.
Reddit describes itself as “the front page of the internet”, but its only action in the aftermath of the Christchurch shooting spree has been toban internet groupscalled ‘r/watchpeopledie’ and ‘r/gore’, where users routinely uploaded videos and images showing real people being tortured and killed.
Of course, Reddit has a user policy that prohibits sharing such images and videos but for years they have failed to close these popular forums because they drive traffic to the site, which in turn drives profits.
Alison Parker
Given the scale of the Christchurch mass murders it is likely that the victim’s families will be treated somewhat better than Alison Parker’s family has been treated by Google.
Alison Parker was a journalist in the US who was conducting a routine interview when she and her cameraman were shot dead. The gunman, Vester Lee Flanagan, was a former employee of the media company that Parker worked for.

Flanagan filmed Parker’s final moments and posted them to social media sites. Alison Parker’s father, Andy Parker, has vowed to never watch the footage of his daughter’s final moments, but Google is making that difficult for the mourning dad.
Andy Parker wants all search results that show his daughter’s death to be banned, butGoogle has told him that he needs to report the videos himself.
Said Andy Parker:
He is calling for Google and Facebook to be held accountable for their content in the same way that news platforms are.
Parker is now rallying political support. He wants Congress in America to move to introduce legislation to force the internet platforms to regulate their content.
All Parker wants is for tech companies like Google and Facebook to be treated like any other publisher – but it is a call that Facebook has long resisted.
Facebook are publishers
Forty-five percent of Americans get their news from Facebook but despite this, Facebook insists it is a ‘tech platform’, and not a publisher or media company.
In the UK, Facebook has been exposed for its gross ineptitude as regards child abuse images.
In 2017, theBBC reported 100 child abuse images to Facebook, but 82 of these images remained on the social media site after the reports.
When the BBC contacted Facebook to query why the images were still published on the site, Facebook cancelled a planned interview with the broadcaster and insteadreported the journalists involved to the police.
“It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation,” said Facebook, referring to the communication it  received from the BBC.
Damian Collins MP, head of the Commons Media Committee, said that Facebook’s actions were “disturbing” and the move to involve the police on journalists highlighting that was “extraordinary”.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said:
Drop the hammer
These tech sites mine our data and our privacy for billions of dollars and they have cash revenues rivalling many countries.
It is time for governments around the world to look at introducing legislation that punishes those sites that continue to publish illegal content of a graphic nature, be it images of torture, murder or child abuse.
Internet platforms are publishing this vile content and they have had years now, in which to get their house in order.
It is time, in the words of Andy Parker, to “drop the hammer” on them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ira-man-rape-teenage-boys-4550900-Mar2019/,"AN ALLEGED IRA man has gone on trial accused of raping two teenage boys in a republican safe house in the 1990s.
The man (45) has pleaded not guilty at the Central Criminal Court to charges of sexual assaulting and anally raping two boys in Co Louth on dates in the early 1990s and in 2001.
On the opening day of the trial, Patrick Gageby SC, prosecuting, said in his opening speech to the jury that both complainants in the case lived in a large home owned by a “dedicated republican” and that it began to be used as a safe house.
A man told Gageby that he lived in the house in Louth in the 1980s and 1990s to which IRA volunteers would be brought during the night and stay for a few days or weeks.
He said the accused man first came to stay in the house around 1991 or 1992. The accused became part of the family and that he looked up to him as a “big brother figure”.
The man said that the accused began to abuse him when he was 13 or 14 year’s old. He said he woke up to find the accused masturbating his penis on four occasions and sucking his penis twice.
He said he would push the accused away from him when he woke up and that the accused would apologise for his actions. He said that after the first occasion the accused asked him not to tell anyone about what happened and talked about his experience in the IRA.

He said that the house had a reputation for being haunted and that on one occasion the accused had claimed to have seen his bed lifting up on its own. The accused was told by the owner of the house to go sleep with the boys if he was really afraid and he slept in the complainant’s room with him.
The man said that he went camping with the accused in a nearby field and that he fell asleep in the tent after becoming intoxicated. He woke up to find his head pushed down and the accused had his penis inside his anus.
He said the accused told him to be quiet and to stay still. He said he felt confused about what was happening aside from that he knew he “was being broken in every way imaginable”.
The man said that in 2001 he was living on his own in another part of Co Louth when the accused arrived to his door. The accused convinced him to go for some drinks and while out he apologised for the things he had done to him years ago.
He said that they went back to his house and that he remembers sitting on his couch while drunk. He said the next thing he knew he was face down in his bed and the accused had his penis inside his anus.
The man said that during the incident the accused took his penis into his mouth. He said that he did not agree to any of this occurring.
He said that he turned to alcohol in a bad way in the aftermath of these incidents, but said he had been sober for ten years.
The trial continues tomorrow before Justice Paul McDermott and a jury.

IT WAS A strike move Joe Schmidt’s Ireland had kept in cold storage for three years, constantly working on fine-tuning the moving parts on the training paddock, before executing it to perfection against France on Sunday.
The platform laid by Peter O’Mahony and forwards off a well-controlled lineout maul, Conor Murray identified it was on, firing a pass off his left to Johnny Sexton in between the dummy runs of Bundee Aki and Jacob Stockdale. The out-half was — as he so often is — the fulcrum of the wraparound play.

Garry Ringrose’s transfer — both in accuracy and timing — was perfect and with Jordan Larmour running an excellent decoy line to attract Yoann Huget, Sexton was able to collect, straighten and dart untouched to the line for just his 10th Ireland try, and first since Canada in the 2015 World Cup.
It ended a run of 30 Test matches, both for Ireland and the Lions, without a try for the 33-year-old, who clearly enjoyed the moment as he embraced his team-mates under the posts, before converting his own score.
“Yeah, it is a move we’ve had in the bag for ages,” he says. “Against Italy, we should have played it but we took the wrong option.
“We’ve had it for a while and it’s the first time it’s come out; it’s been working in training for three years, so it’s good that those come off.
“It’s something we always have, these good moves, I don’t think Wales are going to give us too many opportunities with lineouts this weekend and they’ll probably kick long and chase hard. Hopefully, we’ll have a plan for that as well.”
Getting his name on the score-sheet was an added bonus for the World Player of the Year after a barren run.

“It’s not something I’ve thought about really, my brother texted me afterwards and told me that,” he laughed.
“Honestly, it didn’t come into my mind. It’s not like I’m a winger… I’m not too obsessed with scoring tries, my job is to try and make the team score tries.
Decisive, influential and pulling the strings, Sexton was back to something near his best againstLes Bleusin round four after so much had been made of his performances, and body language, during a frustrating start to the championship for Schmidt’s side.
It was no coincidence that Ireland conjured a much-improved showing at the Aviva Stadium when Sexton, and indeed Conor Murray, returned to match-shaping form in the pivot, even if he was pulled ashore for the final 20 minutes to give Connacht’s Jack Carty some valuable game-time in green.

Ireland’s off-colour performances against England, Scotland and Italy will have frustrated nobody more than Sexton, his competitive personality and unflinching desire for betterment and success no doubt leading to a great deal of annoyance.
But, even then, the Leinster captain always maintained that Ireland were not far off clicking and on the back of Sunday’s bonus-point victory, was clearly pleased the team were able to ‘turn a corner performance-wise’.
“Honestly, there was nothing majorly broken in the first few games,” he said.
“There was just some uncharacteristic errors from some individuals and some break downs in just a couple of things. That just adds up and if everyone makes a couple of mistakes then suddenly you have 30 errors and you are in a bit of trouble.
“We speak about the margins. Take me for example, you want to kick it 10 metres from the restart and if you kick it nine-and-a-half there is an error but are not too far off kicking a good one.
“Kick it out on the full by half-a-yard and you’re only half-a-yard from getting it right and you’re not too far away from getting it right and that proved to be the case.”
The out-half continued: “The first 40 [against France] was excellent, we did everything that we wanted to do. We had great intent despite the greasy ball early in the game. Very pleasing and it was good to sort of turn the corner, performance-wise.

There are still parts of the game that we want to improve on, and that we will need to improve on, this weekend for what will be our biggest challenge to date and it’s one we are looking forward to.
After a recovery day on Monday, Ireland’s preparations for Cardiff moved up a gear today but the six-day turnaround from France means Tuesday’s schedule — normally the first proper hit-out of the week — included a gym and pool session before a light run-out on the training pitch.

There was a palpable change in atmosphere around Carton House earlier as Ireland, having put to bed the negative vibes of the first three weekends, head into the final round of championship action with renewed confidence and belief.
Sexton, laid back and relaxed, says they are motivated to end Wales’ 13-game unbeaten run as Warren Gatland’s side bid for Grand Slam glory, having previously brought England and New Zealand crashing back down to earth after long winning streaks.
“I know from talking to some of the Welsh lads from previous tours that the expectation in Wales is huge all the time and it will be at its highest this week to get a Grand Slam. They don’t come around too often,” he said.
“I don’t know if Wales feel like they’re invincible, they’re saying that they’ve forgotten how to lose and all of that. They’ve eked out some results, we’ve played well against teams that have gone on runs before — New Zealand, England, stopping their runs.
“Again, we’ll give them the respect that they absolutely deserve. We’ll analyse them, we’ll talk about where we can get at them, where we think they are very strong and we’ll come up with a plan.
“I don’t think we’ll talk too much about the psychology of them. They’ll be under pressure but so will we. We want to finish on a high and win a championship. We still have a shout and we know that if we get a performance then the pressure is on England and then you never know what might happen.”

THE SIX NATIONS is considering an offer from former Formula One owners CVC Capital Partners to take a stake in the championship, which if accepted would scupper World Rugby’s plans for their so-called Nations League.
CVC – who in December acquired a reported 27% stake worth more than £200 million (€233 million) in the English Premiership — would enrich each of the six unions to the tune of €117 million, according to the BBC.

This comes on the eve of World Rugby hosting a meeting at their headquarters in Dublin over their controversial plans for an annual global competition which is seen as providing crucial financial funds for the southern hemisphere nations.
It is believed that both Ireland and Scotland oppose the Nations League concept primarily because they do not agree with there being relegation and promotion for the Six Nations.
The Six Nations unions -England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Italy and France – have been looking to the future for some time now about increasing their broadcast revenue collectively in a strategy dubbed ‘Project Light’.
Their plan is to embrace both their championship and the November Tests – when the southern hemisphere teams come to them – in one broadcast deal.
CVC’s reported offer – for an approximate 30% share in the Six Nations – is one of several, the BBC suggests.

According to The Times in the UK, CVC tabled their offer which would be restricted to the commercial arm and not the running of the tournament itself, on Monday.
However, it is believed should they accept CVC’s offer it would lead to the Six Nations being taken away from free to air television – it has been rumoured that Amazon are circling.
Sources at the unions have not denied an offer is on the table but insist a deal is not imminent.
The reports will not make World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont’s task any easier when he meets with the Tier 1 chief executives and those from Japan and Fiji as well as players’ representatives on Thursday.

World Rugby outlined its concept for the new tournament last Wednesday, which would start in 2022, saying it was “committed to the global advancement of rugby”.
The proposed Championship would see the formation of two conferences – a European conference and a rest of the world conference – each with two divisions of six teams and a third division comprising 16 teams.
Both the International Rugby Players (IRP) and the London-based Pacific Rugby Players Welfare (PRPW) organisation had been up in arms over original proposals that were leaked a fortnight ago.
The IRP – led by their President and world player of the year Johnny Sexton – were furious at what they saw were commercial interests being placed ahead of player welfare.
The PRPW were threatening a boycott of this year’s World Cup due to the belief that none of the Pacific Islands would be in the 12 team top level competition — with the United States featuring instead, apparently the idea of World Rugby’s ambitious vice-chairman Agustin Pichot.

However, World Rugby clarified these matters last week.
“Under this model, the Pacific Islands and all teams outside the current Six Nations and The Rugby Championship would have a potential pathway” to play annually at the highest level of the game for the first time,” it said in a statement.
“Player welfare is fundamental to our sport,” it added.
“Within the original proposal, players would play a maximum of 13 matches if their team reaches the final, compared to an average of between 12 and 14 Test matches presently. Most teams would play 11 matches.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/hamsters-abandoned-newry-pet-connection-4556605-Mar2019/,"A PET SHOP in Newry has said it was “disgusted” when staff discovered that seven baby hamsters had been abandoned in a “filthy cage” in its car park on Monday.
Pet Connection staff said they discovered the seven Roborovski Dwarf hamsters “surrounded by their own waste and exposed to the elements”.
It is believed that the hamsters are from two different litters and all under the age of seven weeks, with the smallest of them weighing less than 10 grams.
Pet Connection owner Roisin Morgan said this incident is a continuation of a worrying trend in which pets have been dumped in the car park of the Dublin road store.

“This is the third incident of animals being dumped in the car park of our store…people continue to put these animals at unnecessary risk.
“In previous years it has been litters of tiny, defenceless kittens, who just like these hamsters, were too young to have been taken from their mothers,” Morgan said.
Roborovski Dwarf hamsters are not sold by Pet Connection, as they say, the hamster’s aloof characters and tendency to not enjoy being handled means that they are not ideal pets for most people.
Staff at Pet Connection estimate that all of the hamsters will be ready to find a home in 1-2 weeks.
“We operate successful rehoming schemes for many different species through our shop and we will always help people with unwanted pets if at all possible,” Morgan said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sulky-racing-horse-4549849-Mar2019/,"A HORSE WHOSE body was found dumped in a skip bag on the side of a Dublin road was likely used in sulky racing, a charity has said.
A woman who was out walking her dog on Monday came across the horse’s body on Peamount Road in south county Dublin. She contacted theMy Lovely Horse charityand co-founder Martina Kenny went to the scene this morning.
She toldTheJournal.iethat the horse, which she estimated was under the age of two when it died, looks as if it had been used for sulky racing.
“She was shaved like they do for sulkies, her mane was shaved. And she was wearing shoes which she shouldn’t have been at that age. Her feet were still growing, she must have been in so much pain.
“She was a small little pony, she shouldn’t have even been in a sulky trap. They don’t have the strength.”
The charity regularly comes across abandoned horses, both alive and dead, who have been used in sulky racing. The ones who are alive are often so weak they do not survive long after they are saved.
“Every single week we get a call of either a dying horse or a dead horse. All around Dublin we’ve had to put horses down, it’s happening everywhere,” Kenny said.
One horse in a northside Dublin area was so emaciated they had to get a vet to come put her down.
Kenny said this was all in the space of three weeks.
“It’s just crazy, people are dumping animals like rubbish.”

Volunteers from the charity were out again last night attempting to rescue abandoned horses in the same area this body was found.
Regulation
There were calls last year for tighter regulations in relation so sulky racing after a number of instances including one where a horsewas found collapsedin a housing estate in Cork.
Just days before this incident a video had emerged of an exhausted pony beingdragged by two youthson a public road after collapsing as it carried a cart.
An inquest in January last year into the death of a 12-year-old who was thrown from a sulky car on a public roadrecommended specific by-lawsto regulate their use.
Independent TD Mattie McGrath soon after introduced a bill to the Dáil which would prohibit sulky racing, but there has been little movement from the government to put specific legislation in place.
Last year Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, whose remit is animal welfare, told McGrath that the use of sulkies or any other horse-drawn vehicles on the roads is a “legitimate activity provided it is done in a safe manner giving due care and consideration to other road users and the animal’s well being”.
He said illegal racing activities taking place on roads, involving any type of vehicle, was a matter for An Garda Síochána and the Department of Transport.
His department did roll out a number of courses to promote good horse welfare among sulky owners in Dublin, Cork and Tipperary last year.
He said the course encouraged participants to move away from “the road racing practices to racing on tracks and to engage with the regulated sport of harness racing on tracks as operated by the Irish Harness Racing Association”.
“The course provider has a clear understanding of the cultural sensitivities surrounding participation in road-racing.”

THE DEATH TOLL in Mozambique following Cyclone Idai could reach over 1,000, President Filipe Nyusi has suggested.
The cyclone hit the city of Beri on Thursday, before it moved into neighbouring Zimbabwe, unleashing fierce winds and flash floods.
The official death toll currently stands at 84 in Mozambique.
“When we flew over the area… this morning to understand what’s going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,” Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address.
Aerial photographs released by a Christian non-profit organisation, the Mission Aviation Fellowship, showed groups of people stuck on roof tops with flood waters up to window level.
“The scale of damage… (in) Beira is massive and horrifying”, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.
90% of the city of some 530,000 people and its surrounding area has been “damaged or destroyed,” it said in a statement.

“The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous,” an IFRC spokesperson said.
President Nyusi said the Pungwe and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique ”have burst their banks and engulfed entire villages”.
“Communities are isolated and bodies are floating” on the waters, he said.
Beira International Airport was closed because of cyclone damage. However, it later reopened.

Zimbabwe hit
In neighbouring Zimbabwe, Idai has also caused significant damage.
It swept away homes and ripped bridges to pieces, leaving destruction that the acting Defence Minister, Perrance Shiri, said “resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war”.
“There was a lot of destruction both on our facilities and on people,” said Shiri, speaking on television from the affected eastern highlands region.
Some roads were swallowed up by massive sinkholes, while bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods, according to an AFP photographer.
“This is the worst infrastructural damage we have ever had,” Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza said.

The eastern district of Chimanimani was the worst-hit area, with houses and most of the region’s bridges washed away by flash floods.
The most affected areas of the country are not yet accessible. High winds and dense clouds have hampered military rescue helicopter flights.
Joshua Sacco, lawmaker for Chimanimani, told AFP that between “150 to 200 people” are missing.
The majority of them are thought to be government workers, whose housing complex was completely engulfed by raging waters.
Their fate was unknown because the area was still unreachable.
“We are very worried because all these houses were just suddenly submerged under water and literally washed away and that is where we have about 147 missing,” he said.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa cut short his visit to Abu Dhabi, saying on his return home today that “we are deeply grieved as a nation”.

This time the PSG move comes from the right, it’s Mbappe who gets away and turns in a low ball.

A quarter of an hour in, two goals already and it has the look of a game that will produce more.6 Mar 20198:21PMClose!Bernat is causing chaos down the left for PSG. Another passage of play sees the United rearguard prised apart and when the ball is rolled into Bernat’s path in the box, he has so much space.

De Gea’s at full stretch as it goes wide of the post.6 Mar 20198:24PMThat list of absentees has been well-documented in the Man United ranks but the knock-on effect is that the positioning of Bailly is a real problem for them. He’s looking really uncomfortable on the right side of that defence.6 Mar 20198:25PMIt looks like there’s some attempt to get Ashley Young to retreat and help Man United out in that sector.

Suddenly Man United are back in front. Moments previously Marcus Rashford had wasted possession when racing in on the left and dragged a shot harmlessly wide when there was team-mates in an advanced position.He makes up for it, lining the ball up from distance and fizzing in a shot. It looks like it should be dealt with by Buffon in goal but it bounces just before reaching him, he fumbles the catch and it’s the alert Lukaku who reacts to the rebound and lashes home.6 Mar 20198:34PMThat’s three attacks for Man United so far and a yield of two goals.

He beautifully takes it past Bernat and drives in a low ball that pings off a PSG defender it seems and Buffon needed to watch it in a crowded goalmouth to prevent the concession of a third.6 Mar 20198:44PMSolskjaer will be delighted at how they’ve taken a hold of this game and moved into the ascendancy considering how nervy things looked there for a while.6 Mar 20198:46PMLooks dangerous there as PSG counter after a loose pass from Dalot. It’s Mbappe accelerating through the centre but he seems to stand on the ball as he approaches the box with Lindelof near and United can get the bodies back to reorganise.6 Mar 20198:47PMHalf-Time: PSG 1-2 Manchester United6 Mar 20198:49PMSo what about that for an opening period? Plenty drama, it exploded to life two minutes in when the away team and underdogs for this second leg got a dream start through Romelu Lukaku. PSG countered and controlled this game with Bernat bringing them level ten minutes later. But Man United coped with the waves of pressure and grabbed a second goal through Lukaku on the half hour mark. They’re ahead 2-1 at the interval, trailing 3-2 on aggregate and very much in this tie.

Second-half action is under way6 Mar 20199:06PMPSG ping it around in the early stages of the second half without creating anything that’s going to trouble Man United so far. The longer it stays like this, will anxiety start to creep into the minds of the home side?6 Mar 20199:10PMPSG break swiftly, Di Maria floats a diagonal ball in on the counter-attack that could fall for Mbappe but it’s hooked away by Lindelof. Vital touch.6 Mar 20199:11PMPSG are knocking on the door but haven’t tested De Gea yet since half-time. They protest there about being awarded a penalty after Smalling challenges Alves when a high ball comes in but the referee is having none of it.6 Mar 20199:12PMUnited go up the other end and have a couple of crossing opportunities. Dalot hits the first one in but it’s too far and is collected on the left by Pereira. This time the delivery is better but it can’t find Lukaku and rolls wide.6 Mar 20199:12PMFeels delicately poised this one.6 Mar 20199:13PMPSG have the ball in the net through Di Maria but it looks like it won’t count due to offside!6 Mar 20199:14PMYes it won’t count and United can breathe a sigh of relief. A delightful chipped finish by Di Maria after an exquisite flick by Mbappe, which sent the ball through the legs of Smalling, played him in. No goal but a reminder of that Paris Saint-Germain threat.6 Mar 20199:15PMPorto 2-1 Roma:Marega has Porto back ahead. Extra-time beckons if it stays like that in Portugal.6 Mar 20199:17PMIs Solskaer going to oversee an amazing comeback in Paris?John WaltonJohn Walton6 Mar 20199:18PMOne more goal for Man United nudges them in front on aggregate courtesy of their away strikes. They haven’t come close yet since the interval but they showed in the first half that a scarcity of chances is not an obstruction to them finding the net.6 Mar 20199:19PMDraxler looks to guide the ball through audaciously with the outside of his right for PSG. It floats through the air and into the box but with Di Maria lurking, Young sticks out a boot to save his side and the ball flies up into the grateful arms of De Gea.6 Mar 20199:23PMNearly 20 minutes gone in this second half and Man United are hanging on. They’ve managed to repel PSG and leave it still in the balance. Possession mainly with the home side but it’s no relaxing evening for them so far.6 Mar 20199:26PMA hint of a break for Man United as Lukaku does the hard part to escape from a crowd in the middle but opts to spray the ball quickly to the right instead of trying to gallop into space. It’s intended for Dalot but PSG intercept and clear.6 Mar 20199:27PMLooks like Draxler’s night is done for PSG as he holds his leg. Time for Cavani to be introduced?6 Mar 20199:27PMSub:And that’s it for an injured Draxler as his hamstring brings his involvement to a halt. Kehrer also coming off with Meunier and Paredes the pair coming on.6 Mar 20199:28PMDraxler in action against Smalling.John WaltonJohn Walton6 Mar 20199:28PMSo who thought this tie would still be up for grabs with 20 minutes left? Dilemma for United now is when to push on to chase that third goal they need.6 Mar 20199:30PMClose!Electric stuff by PSG as Mbappe plays a one-two that opens up that United backline. He drills in a low centre that is begging to be touched home but it’s Young who dives in to scramble clear for United.6 Mar 20199:33PMNot long on and Paredes is in the book after the PSG player goes in on Pereira and is shown yellow.6 Mar 20199:34PMPoor throw from Dalot and poor touch from Young and suddenly PSG are away. They spurn the opening after Di Maria tore upfield and laid off to Mbappe who ran it out of play with a heavy touch.6 Mar 20199:35PMJust under 15 minutes of normal time to go.6 Mar 20199:35PMNot many options for United to spring on it seems to change this up.6 Mar 20199:38PMSub:And here comes Tahith Chong for United, brought in for Andreas Pereira.6 Mar 20199:39PMThat’s great defensive work by Chris Smalling. Stepover and burst of speed from Mbappe but the ball ends up touching him last as it goes wide.6 Mar 20199:40PMYet another cross is banged in by PSG in the box, this time it’s Meunier and it comes at a fair pace close to De Gea who punches clear.6 Mar 20199:42PMClose!What a chance for PSG to wrap it up! Alves splits the defence and Mbappe gets free but De Gea claws at the ball as he tries to go around him. The French World Cup winner is blocked by Smalling with his follow up and then Bernat has a go from an acute angle but it smacks against the upright.6 Mar 20199:43PMUnited need a scoring hero. 17-year-old Mason Greenwood looks like he’ll get the chance to do that as a depleted squad go into their reserves.6 Mar 20199:45PMTwo minutes of normal time remaining.6 Mar 20199:47PMWill they get one more chance? PSG look like they’ll try to close this one out.6 Mar 20199:47PMCorner to United after Dalot’s long-range shot was deflected wide.6 Mar 20199:48PMWait a minute, it’s going to be reviewed for a possible penalty.6 Mar 20199:48PMDid Kimpembe hand ball it?6 Mar 20199:49PMPenalty to Manchester United!6 Mar 20199:49PMThat is incredible!

Three weeks ago the pre-match conversation honed in on the absentees from the PSG side but the talk of the injury woes has shifted to the other side now.
Check out this list of talent that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has to plot and plan without for tonight:

The advantage lies with Thomas Tuchel’s side on the back of that first leg thanks to second-half goals from Kimpembe and Mbappe. They have that two-goal cushion to fall back on and their form has been good since then.
Streets ahead at the top of Ligue 1, PSG have four wins on the bounce in domestic league action since then, chalking up 11 goals and shipping just three in the process. Mbappe bagged a brace on Saturday with 2-1 win away to Caen.

As onerous a task as that looks tonight for Man United, there’s some solace to be found in how the last week has gone for them on the pitch.
Since that 0-0 draw at home to Liverpool, they’ve beaten Crystal Palace and Southampton – admittedly not the strongest opponents – while netting three times in both games. A brace in each of those games for Romelu Lukaku and with that bunch of players they have to operate without, they could do with the Belgian striker hitting form if they’re going to salvage this.

History is not falling on the side of Man United here. Losing 2-0 in the home leg is a deficit that no team has come back from in this competition to ultimately progress. Anyone envisage a famous comeback to propel them into the quarter-finals?
Then again last night at the Bernabeu proved that revivals can happen with Ajax dumping out the reigning champions Real Madrid.
And let’s not forget the disaster that struck PSG at this juncture two years ago. 4-0 up and flying high from the first leg, they were hit by the comeback to beat all comebacks at the Nou Camp as they crashed to a 6-1 defeat.
Could they get nervous at some stage tonight?

Right we’re close to getting underway as Man United aim for a dramatic turnaround. Looks like a damp one in Paris, the home side in the driving seat as this second leg is about to commence.
And we’re underway!
Straight away and there’s an early reducer put in by Fred on Angel Di Maria. Free kick to PSG just inside the United half.
GOAL: PSG 0-1 MAN UNITED (LUKAKU 3)
PSG 0-1 Man United (Lukaku 3)What a start for Man United! And it’s their in-form striker Lukaku who grabs his fifth goal in three games. Kehrer’s mistake with the backpass, it falls into the path of Lukaku and he rounds the keeper before diverting the ball in. Looked like too heavy a touch initially but he got it into the corner.
That was a simply sensational start and just a great opening for this game. Should give the away team a serious jolt of confidence.
Close!PSG break down the left, flash a ball across from Juan Bernat and Mbappe is inches away from getting a foot to it. In a follow-up passage it takes a good block from Chris Smalling to stop Mbappe.

GOAL! PSG 1-1 MAN UNITED (BERNAT 11)
GOOOOAL!And there’s that early United advantage wiped out! This time the PSG move comes from the right, it’s Mbappe who gets away and turns in a low ball. It should be dealt with but Bailly doesn’t react quickly, Bernat is alert and he’s steaming in at the far post to slot home.
Man United might have grabbed that early goal but PSG have not been rattled by that early setback. They’ve been threatening on the wings and it’s been an uncomfortable evening so far for Bailly in defence. A quarter of an hour in, two goals already and it has the look of a game that will produce more.
Close!Bernat is causing chaos down the left for PSG. Another passage of play sees the United rearguard prised apart and when the ball is rolled into Bernat’s path in the box, he has so much space. His drive is beaten away by De Gea and United survive but it’s a big onslaught they’ve had to face so far.
Another flies in from PSG, this time it’s De Maria who unleashes a drive that arrows in from the left of goal outside the area. De Gea’s at full stretch as it goes wide of the post.
That list of absentees has been well-documented in the Man United ranks but the knock-on effect is that the positioning of Bailly is a real problem for them. He’s looking really uncomfortable on the right side of that defence.
It looks like there’s some attempt to get Ashley Young to retreat and help Man United out in that sector. They definitely need to do something and a spell of possession wouldn’t go astray either in the middle. All PSG at the moment.
Juan Bernat restores PSG's two-goal cushion on aggregate.John WaltonJohn Walton
Still scoreless in tonight’s other Champions League game by the way. If it stays that way Roma will advance at the expense of Porto.
GOAL! PSG 1-2 MAN UNITED (LUKAKU 29)
GOOOOAL!What an amazing first-half! Suddenly Man United are back in front. Moments previously Marcus Rashford had wasted possession when racing in on the left and dragged a shot harmlessly wide when there was team-mates in an advanced position.
He makes up for it, lining the ball up from distance and fizzing in a shot. It looks like it should be dealt with by Buffon in goal but it bounces just before reaching him, he fumbles the catch and it’s the alert Lukaku who reacts to the rebound and lashes home.
That’s three attacks for Man United so far and a yield of two goals. Efficient stuff and Lukaku’s goalscoring run continues!
Sub:Eric Bailly’s night is done. He got clattered a few minutes ago and was down in pain but it hadn’t been an easy half hour or so of defending for him. Dalot comes in.
PSG haven’t got a grip of this since the concession of the second one, Man United look understandably buoyed. Rashford bangs in another shots that is inches outside the far upright but it’s blown subsequently for offside.
Porto 1-1 Roma:Two goals in the night’s other match with Tiquinho edging Porto ahead in the 26th minute before a De Rossi penalty has just drawn Roma level.

Not one the Italian goalkeeping great is going to reflect fondly on. He’s messed that one up and handed Man United a route back into contention.

Oh, Gigi... 🙈""A clanger"", from the veteran keeper allows Lukaku to get his 2nd of the night!Live on Virgin Media Sport.#PSGMUN#UCL#VMSportpic.twitter.com/rbt4A69klm
Close!Nice move by Man United in a congested middle and when the play is switched to the right, Dalot rushes on in plenty space. He beautifully takes it past Bernat and drives in a low ball that pings off a PSG defender it seems and Buffon needed to watch it in a crowded goalmouth to prevent the concession of a third.
Solskjaer will be delighted at how they’ve taken a hold of this game and moved into the ascendancy considering how nervy things looked there for a while.
Looks dangerous there as PSG counter after a loose pass from Dalot. It’s Mbappe accelerating through the centre but he seems to stand on the ball as he approaches the box with Lindelof near and United can get the bodies back to reorganise.
Half-Time: PSG 1-2 Manchester United
So what about that for an opening period? Plenty drama, it exploded to life two minutes in when the away team and underdogs for this second leg got a dream start through Romelu Lukaku. PSG countered and controlled this game with Bernat bringing them level ten minutes later. But Man United coped with the waves of pressure and grabbed a second goal through Lukaku on the half hour mark. They’re ahead 2-1 at the interval, trailing 3-2 on aggregate and very much in this tie. Back shortly for the second half.
Diogo Dalot entered the action during the first half tonight.John WaltonJohn Walton
Kick off! Second-half action is under way
PSG ping it around in the early stages of the second half without creating anything that’s going to trouble Man United so far. The longer it stays like this, will anxiety start to creep into the minds of the home side?
PSG break swiftly, Di Maria floats a diagonal ball in on the counter-attack that could fall for Mbappe but it’s hooked away by Lindelof. Vital touch.
PSG are knocking on the door but haven’t tested De Gea yet since half-time. They protest there about being awarded a penalty after Smalling challenges Alves when a high ball comes in but the referee is having none of it.
United go up the other end and have a couple of crossing opportunities. Dalot hits the first one in but it’s too far and is collected on the left by Pereira. This time the delivery is better but it can’t find Lukaku and rolls wide.
Feels delicately poised this one.
PSG have the ball in the net through Di Maria but it looks like it won’t count due to offside!
Yes it won’t count and United can breathe a sigh of relief. A delightful chipped finish by Di Maria after an exquisite flick by Mbappe, which sent the ball through the legs of Smalling, played him in. No goal but a reminder of that Paris Saint-Germain threat.
Porto 2-1 Roma:Marega has Porto back ahead. Extra-time beckons if it stays like that in Portugal.
Is Solskaer going to oversee an amazing comeback in Paris?John WaltonJohn Walton
One more goal for Man United nudges them in front on aggregate courtesy of their away strikes. They haven’t come close yet since the interval but they showed in the first half that a scarcity of chances is not an obstruction to them finding the net.
Draxler looks to guide the ball through audaciously with the outside of his right for PSG. It floats through the air and into the box but with Di Maria lurking, Young sticks out a boot to save his side and the ball flies up into the grateful arms of De Gea.
Nearly 20 minutes gone in this second half and Man United are hanging on. They’ve managed to repel PSG and leave it still in the balance. Possession mainly with the home side but it’s no relaxing evening for them so far.
A hint of a break for Man United as Lukaku does the hard part to escape from a crowd in the middle but opts to spray the ball quickly to the right instead of trying to gallop into space. It’s intended for Dalot but PSG intercept and clear.
Looks like Draxler’s night is done for PSG as he holds his leg. Time for Cavani to be introduced?
Sub:And that’s it for an injured Draxler as his hamstring brings his involvement to a halt. Kehrer also coming off with Meunier and Paredes the pair coming on.
Draxler in action against Smalling.John WaltonJohn Walton
So who thought this tie would still be up for grabs with 20 minutes left? Dilemma for United now is when to push on to chase that third goal they need.
Close!Electric stuff by PSG as Mbappe plays a one-two that opens up that United backline. He drills in a low centre that is begging to be touched home but it’s Young who dives in to scramble clear for United.
Not long on and Paredes is in the book after the PSG player goes in on Pereira and is shown yellow.
Poor throw from Dalot and poor touch from Young and suddenly PSG are away. They spurn the opening after Di Maria tore upfield and laid off to Mbappe who ran it out of play with a heavy touch.
Just under 15 minutes of normal time to go.
Not many options for United to spring on it seems to change this up.
Sub:And here comes Tahith Chong for United, brought in for Andreas Pereira.
That’s great defensive work by Chris Smalling. Stepover and burst of speed from Mbappe but the ball ends up touching him last as it goes wide.
Yet another cross is banged in by PSG in the box, this time it’s Meunier and it comes at a fair pace close to De Gea who punches clear.
Close!What a chance for PSG to wrap it up! Alves splits the defence and Mbappe gets free but De Gea claws at the ball as he tries to go around him. The French World Cup winner is blocked by Smalling with his follow up and then Bernat has a go from an acute angle but it smacks against the upright.
United need a scoring hero. 17-year-old Mason Greenwood looks like he’ll get the chance to do that as a depleted squad go into their reserves.
Two minutes of normal time remaining.
Will they get one more chance? PSG look like they’ll try to close this one out.
Corner to United after Dalot’s long-range shot was deflected wide.
Wait a minute, it’s going to be reviewed for a possible penalty.
Did Kimpembe hand ball it?
Penalty to Manchester United!
That is incredible! The referee has given it!
In the 93rd minute, Rashford will have the chance to be United’s hero! Scenes!
PSG players protesting, arguments break out but it’s going to be taken.
Goal for Manchester United!
He’s done it! What a penalty by Rashford!
GOAL! PSG 1-3 Manchester United (Rashford 93)
This is absolutely incredible.
Man United are seconds away from an amazing win.
PSG attack and win a corner!
The corner is cleared. Still the game goes on.
Another attack comes to nothing. That could be it.
Three minutes over injury-time played.
No sign of the full-time whistle yet, PSG still attacking.
One more cross swung in but it goes wide.
99 minutes gone and still this match goes on. Free kick to PSG.
Full-Time: PSG 1-3 Manchester United
They’ve done it! Manchester United knock Paris Saint-Germain out of the Champions League and reach the quarter-finals! Incredible!
What a finale and what a Champions League night! An understrength Manchester United land in Paris and overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit. Rashford kept his cool after that controversial penalty award and they’re through to the last eight!
It’s another disaster in Europe for Paris Saint-Germain. Two years on from that collapse in Barcelona, they entered this game well on top after that first leg. Even with that early concession to Lukaku, they still recovered to draw level and boss the match. But it seemed to all change with Lukaku’s second goal and they weren’t clinical enough to hit the net after the break.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pet-travel-no-deal-brexit-4532710-Mar2019/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT has issued advice to pet owners who plan to travel to the UK with their cat, dog or ferret after 29 March and the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
The Department for Agriculture Food and the Marinehas issued advicethat covers three scenarios: going on holiday in Great Britain with your pet, moving to Great Britain with your pet, or travelling from Great Britain to Ireland with your pet.
In all cases, it’s advised pet owners looking to travel should contact a vet as soon as possible before setting off to make sure all necessary arrangements are in place.
With the UK due to leave the European Union on 29 March, a no-deal scenario is more likely than ever. A series of votes are to happen in the House of Commons next week where it’s hoped will clarify what UK parliamentarians want, in order to break the current political deadlock.
Meanwhile, the UK Attorney General and the EU are trying to hammer parts of the current Brexit Withdrawal Agreement into a shape that would be slightly more pleasing to British politicians, without changing the essence of the deal, which has been approved by the other 27 EU member states, including Ireland.
So, in a no-deal Brexit scenario,if you’re travelling to Great Britain on holidays with your pet and returning to Ireland, your pet dog/cat/ferret must:
*For return to Ireland, you’ll need an EU pet passport (not a UK-issued EU pet passport) or an EU health cert issued by a UK government vet. You willnotbe able to return to Ireland on an EU pet passport issued in the UK, but youshould hold onto a UK-issued pet passport if you have one, as it may have important information about vaccinations and other treatments.
Advertisement
**You must wait at least 30 days after the rabies vaccine was administered before the blood test can be carried out.
This is because if the test is administered in Great Britain after 29 March, the pet would have to waitthree monthsfrom the date the successful rabies titration test was carried out before it can travel to Ireland.
NB: This is a stock image, you can't bring a dachshund (or any other dog) on a plane in this way.Shutterstock / Evgeniy KalinovskiyShutterstock / Evgeniy Kalinovskiy / Evgeniy Kalinovskiy
If you’removing to Great Britain with your pet and not returning to Ireland,the situation is mostly in the UK’s hands, so you might need to wait and see what kind of Brexit we get, and what the UK government says you’ll need to enter.
The UK Government have indicated that pet travel rules for entry into the UK may not change for some time after Brexit, but you must check withthe UK authorities for the latest information.
If you’retravelling from Great Britain to Ireland with your pet,your dog/cat/ferret must:
**You must wait at least 30 days after the rabies vaccine was administered before the blood test can be carried out. If the test is administered in Great Britain after 29 March, the pet would have to waitthree monthsfrom the date the successful rabies titration test was carried out before it can travel to Ireland.
***You will not be able to travel to the EU on an EU pet passport issued in the UK, but you should hold on to a UK-issued pet passport if you have one, as it may have important information about vaccinations and other treatments.

https://www.thejournal.ie/louth-crash-gsoc-4549239-Mar2019/,"THE GARDA OMBUDSMAN Commission (GSOC) is investigating a fatal road collision in Co Louth in which two men died.
The crash happened on the R173 near Carlingford just after 12.30am yesterday.
The men, named locally as Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson from Co Down, were pronounced dead at the scene. They were both aged in their 20s.
No one else was injured in the single-vehicle collision. Both men were taken to Louth County Hospital in Dundalk forpost-mortem examinations.

It is believed gardaí had attempted to stop the vehicle prior to the crash. GSOC and An Garda Síochánda have both appealed for witnesses to come forward.
A spokesperson said GSOC would particularly like to hear from motorists who may have dashcam footage from the Carlingford or Omeath area between midnight and 1am yesterday.
“GSOC is currently investigating the incident and would like to speak to anyone who may have seen a black Lexus with a Northern Ireland registration in the area on the evening of Sunday 17 March or early hours of 18 March,” they said.
Potential witnesses and those who have dashcams and were in the area at the time in question have been asked to ring the GSOC witness appeal line on 1890 600 800.

Gannon (32) was selected at a convention in Dublin city this evening by party members.
Gannon was first elected as an Independent to the North Inner City area in the 2014 local elections.

He narrowly missed out on securing a seat in the 2016 general election in the strongly contested Dublin Central constituency, being pipped at the post for the final seat by Maureen O’Sullivan.
May will be the first time the Social Democrats will contest the European elections. The party was founded in 2015 by sitting TDs Catherine Murphy, Roisin Shortall, and Stephen Donnelly.
Donnelly has since left the party to join Fianna Fáil, while Shortall and Murphy remain co-leaders.
“The EU parliament is the most important place politically in the world right now. I am delighted to have been selected tonight to represent the party in this critically important election,” Gannon said in a statement after his selection.

https://www.thejournal.ie/alan-hutch-jailed-revenue-offices-4554869-Mar2019/,"A MEMBER OF the Hutch family living in fear for his safety has been jailed for breaking into the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners and assaulting a man who tried to prevent him leaving.
Alan Hutch (36) was confronted by a staff member who found him in his office as he returned from a tea break. The man was punched several times by Hutch during violent scuffles as he tried to prevent him leaving with a stolen mobile phone. Gardaí were alerted and all property recovered.
The prosecuting garda told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court the Hutch name had been involved in a feud in the Dublin area.
“It’s an understatement, to put it mildly, that people are aware of the Hutch name,” said Derek Cooney BL, defending. He said there had been an orchestrated targeting of people bearing the Hutch name.
He said his client did not like to hear the phrase “dead man walking” but said it was something all members of the Hutch family had been faced with and it was something Hutch had to live with. He outlined that Hutch’s father, taxi driver Eddie Hutch, had been killed on the doorstep of his family home. Hutch received the news of his father’s murder through a phone call while in custody.
Hutch, of Portland Place, Dublin has 73 previous convictions including assault, robbery, burglary, threats to kill, endangerment, obstruction, production of article and road traffic offences.
Hutch pleaded guilty to burglary and assault causing harm to Karl Higgins at the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Hammam buildings, Upper O’Connell Street on 7 March 2018.
Violent struggle
Judge Melanie Greally noted the burglary had developed into a violent struggle when Hutch was interrupted and his escape prevented. Higgins suffered a number of blows during two scuffles.
Two of Higgins’ colleagues came to his assistance and subdued Hutch until gardaí arrived.
Judge Greally noted Hutch has been in custody since the date of his arrest and is very isolated in prison, where he has become “paranoid” in relation to others including prison staff. She said he is “extremely fearful for his own safety and has substantial cause for that fear”.
She took into account his drug addiction and efforts to deal with it, as well as a psychological report which outlined he had been exposed to violence and criminality from a very young age.
The judge noted his guilty pleas were valuable as witnesses may have been fearful if required to give evidence in a case against him. She noted the circumstances associated with the current “feud” and said it was an “unimaginable situation for anyone to be living with on an ongoing basis”.
Sentencing
Judge Greally imposed a four year sentence and suspended the final 18 months on strict conditions. She backdated the sentence to the date of the offence when he went into custody.
Advertisement
During the sentence hearing, Cooney said Hutch was on protection in custody in a single cell and had formed certain views that the prison authorities were contaminating his food and water.
He handed a psychological report into court outlining his family circumstances. His upbringing was described as challenging, with Hutch witnessing violence inflicted on his mother, brothers and himself by his father.
He said that despite this Hutch described missing his father and wishing he was around to “steady the ship” and get him back on the right path. Cooney said his client began using cannabis at a young age, later progressing to heroin. He also became involved with criminality from a young age.
Counsel said Hutch has been addressing his addiction while in custody and when he gets out of prison he wants to assist his mother who cares for a younger brother with special needs.
He said that Hutch’s release will in effect be a “house arrest” as he cannot go out and walk the streets of Dublin.
Additional evidence
Garda Gavin Feeley told Aoife McGillicuddy BL, prosecuting, that at about mid day on 7 March 2018 Hutch got into the Eir building through an unlocked door as maintenance was taking place.
He walked around the building for a time before going through another door into the adjacent Offices of the Revenue Commissioners. He walked upstairs and into the unoccupied office of Karl Higgins, who was on his tea break.
When Higgins returned to his office he found Hutch in his office holding a white box containing his mobile phone and accessories. He shouted at Hutch, who put the box in his pocket and tried to leave the office.
Hutch ran at Higgins who was in the doorway and a scuffle began in which they both fell to the ground. Hutch punched Higgins in the face as they fell. Hutch got up and ran away.
Higgins raised the alarm and followed Hutch who was attempting to open an inner door that was kept permanently closed. Hutch turned and ran back towards Higgins, who shouted at him to drop the phone.
Hutch punched him in the face on at least two occasions in the course of another scuffle, during which Hutch grabbed a steel pole and pushed it onto “the neck or chest area” of Higgins.
Two of Higgins’ colleagues came to his assistance and they managed to subdue Hutch on the ground until security arrived. The phone in the white box was recovered as well as a second phone and a camera. Garda Feely was on duty nearby and was alerted by a staff member.
Hutch was arrested and answered “no comment” to all questions in garda interview. He has been in custody since his arrest.
The court heard Higgins suffered bruising and tenderness to his cheekbone. There was no victim impact report.
Comments are closed as legal proceedings are ongoing.","7.46pm, 21 Mar 2019",

https://www.thejournal.ie/google-search-patrick-quirke-computer-murder-trial-4554971-Mar2019/,"A GOOGLE SEARCH for “rate of human decomposition” was carried out on a computer that was seized from murder accused Patrick Quirke’s house, the Central Criminal Court has heard.
The internet search was carried out in December 2012, 18 months after Bobby Ryan went missing and four months before his body was discovered on land then leased by the accused man.
The user clicked on links to websites that contained articles called: “The five stages of decomposition” and “How the human body decomposes after death”.
The trial also heard emails were sent from Quirke to Vodafone.ie on 12 and 13 May requesting records of all calls and texts to his phone from 2 to 5 June 2011.
Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan.
Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am.
His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013.
The prosecution claims Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Lowry (52).
Computer searches
Detective Garda Paul Fitzpatrick of the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau told prosecution counsel Michael Bowman SC that he examined computers, a thumb drive, an iPad, and a hard drive that were seized by gardaí during a search of Quirke’s property in 2013.
Using forensic software called Encase he searched the contents of one of the computers labelled KKPQ1 which had no make or model and was registered to a “user” but not to any particular name.
He discovered that on 3 December 2012 at about 3.30pm a user searched on Google for “human body decomposition timeline” and later another search was made for “rate of human decomposition”.
Following the searches Google returned a number of pages and Garda Fitzpatrick said there was evidence the user clicked on pages contained within websites environmentalgraffiti.com, forensics4fiction.com and suite101.com.
When Detective Garda Fitzpatrick looked at those pages he found articles headed: “The five stages of decomposition,” and “How the human body decomposes after death.”
Around the same time he said there was evidence of Youtube videos embedded into the webpages viewed but he couldn’t say if these videos had been watched.
When Garda Fitzpatrick looked at the videos one was titled “Body Farm and Beyond” and the text associated with it stated: “Takes you on a tour of the body farm” and contained references to “human remains, skin slippage and DNA analysis.”
The second Youtube video also related to the Body Farm and when Detective Garda Fitzpatrick looked at it, it was described as “a study of human decomposition on real corpses” and contained the note, “you will never forget the smell”. The third video had been removed. There was also evidence of an image from a Wikimedia page which contained a reference to “decomposition stages”.
Half an hour after this activity the witness recovered an email in which Quirke discussed shares with another man.

Detective Garda Fitzpatrick also found older files relating to an operating system that had been on the computer before 25 July 2012. On this he found a record of a website called howstuffworks.com which contained information on DNA evidence and its limitations.
The witness also found a backup folder for an Apple computer which contained a cookie file which showed that someone had searched for “Trace Ireland Facebook Bobby Ryan” on 4 July 2012.
News searches
By June 2014 Detective Garda Fitzpatrick said the bureau had updated its equipment and so he examined the computer again. This time he found references to searches for a slurry tanker on the trading website DoneDeal in December 2012. There was also an email from pquirke@eircom.net to a named person which contained images of a slurry tanker.
When he returned to KKPQ1 in May 2015 using a newer version of Encase he discovered a Word document called Mary.doc and an Excel document called Maryowe.xls.
He also discovered that on 1 May 2013, the day after Ryan’s body was discovered, a page on the RTÉ website titled “man’s body found on Tipperary farm” was visited.
At 8.09am there was a search for “newspaper headlines” and a few minutes later for “body found in Tipperary”.
Another RTÉ page was visited and then at 9.34am there was a visit to a page on Independent.ie headlined: “Man’s body found in Tipperary farm yard.”
There was also a visit to an Irish Times page titled: “Brother of missing man believes body found is him,” and another search for “body found in Tipperary”.
At 16.11pm there was a visit to Breakingnews.ie and a story titled: “Probe after body found in Tipperary.”
The following day there was a visit to the Herald.ie where there was a story about a “Stalker linked to slurry pit body.” The user also searched for “Bobby Ryan” on the Herald website.
There was a further visit to the Examiner website that night and a story relating to Bobby Ryan while on 5 May 2013 there was a search for “Bobby Ryan Tipperary break down”.
Vodafone searches
That evening there was also a request sent to Vodafone customer support asking for help with getting hold of “details relating to my account”.
On May 12, the witness said, Quirke requested from Vodafone an invoice for June 2011. The following day there was a request from Quirke for a log of all incoming calls and texts to his phone from 2 to 5 June 2012.
On 15 May 2013, there were various search queries including one on thesun.ie website for “Mary Lowry and Bobby Ryan”.
The detective garda also carried out an examination of a computer belonging to Mary Lowry on which he found a missing person poster relating to Bobby Ryan. He got no hits when he searched for “murder” or “decomposition” and other key words given to him by the investigating team.
Bernard Condon SC for the defence will cross examine the witness tomorrow in front of Justice Eileen Creedon and a jury of six men and six women.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mortgage-interest-rates-rise-4534732-Mar2019/,"IRISH HOUSEHOLDS ARE in a better position than they were to withstand an increase to mortgage interest rates, which will inevitably rise, according to new research.
Increased rates would lead to payments rising faster than long-term income growth which would likely cause repayment difficulties for some households.
A study by the ESRI and Department of Finance examined effect increased European Central Bank rates would have on those in mortgage arrears in Ireland.
Because global interest rates are low by both by international and historical standards, they will inevitably rise in the coming years.
The research tests how increased rates would affect households in terms of their ability to continue to pay their mortgages.
Advertisement
It found that a 25-basis-point increase in the ECB policy rate in any one year would lead to a 0.1 percentage point increase in new missed mortgage payments.
The research notes that households are in a better position to withstand interest rate increases given the stronger economic circumstances in Ireland since 2014. The improved labour market, through lower unemployment and rising incomes, is particularly important.
However,rates rises would lead to payments rising faster than long-term income growthwhich would likely cause repayment difficulties for some households.
The research also looked at the groups which are most at risk, and found thatyounger (18-35 years), lower income householdswho are at an earlier stage in their mortgage contract are more likely to be affected, as are households ontracker interest rateswho have a contractual pass-through from the policy rate to the lending rate.
Conor O’Toole, ESRI research and author of the report, said that the Irish mortgage market “has recovered considerably from the crisis and households are better placed to deal with adverse shocks”.
“Younger, lower income households who are at an earlier stage in their mortgage contract are more at risk, as are households on tracker rate contracts.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/global-greening-initiative-tourism-ireland-2019-4543104-Mar2019/,"ON THE SURFACE, a leopard statue in Kenya, a DC-3 plane in Hong Kong, and a street-skating event in Paris don’t have all that much in common.
If the group wasn’t bizarre enough already, it also includes a competition Finland, in which entrepreneurs stand waist-deep in the freezing Baltic Sea while pitching ideas to potential investors, Dragons’ Den style.
But they’re not randomly connected: each is linked by this year’s Global Greening, an initiative that sees locations and events around the world lit up green during the St Patrick’s period.
Over the years, the initiative has seen the likes of the Sydney Opera House, the London Eye and Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil daubed in green light to promote Ireland.
So how did it all come about?
“Like a lot of great things, it kind of happened in a couple of different places independently,” Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland – which co-ordinates the initiatve every year – tellsTheJournal.ie.
“Rodney Walshe arranged for the Sky Tower in Auckland in New Zealand to be lit up green for St Patrick’s Day in 2009.
“Then the following year, a lady called Órla Saul who was in our Sydney office and a lady called Donna Campbell made a local approach to have the Sydney Opera House lit up.
“It was so terrific when we saw the pictures afterwards… and I started to show it at various meetings around Ireland, where it got a huge emotional impact.
“You could feel the sense of inspiration in the room. Year after year it started to grow and capture the imagination at home.”
The Intercontinental Hotel in Abu Dhabi, which is taking part in this year's Global Greening initiativeTourism IrelandTourism Ireland
This year, 425 sites in 53 different countries are set to take part, in what’s expected to be the biggest year for the initiative to date.
Famous buildings and sites in the likes of London, Paris, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Rio di Janeiro are among those that will go green this year.

And as can be expected when such a wide range of locations take part, a huge effort is involved in getting some of them over the line.
“You can’t take it for granted when you have something happen one year that it’ll happen the following year, and that you can come back every time,” Gibbons explains.
“There’s a very Irish approach to it, in that we’re really relying on a number of people to help us.
“The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade came on board, and we would never have got places like the Great Wall of China over the line if it wasn’t for the ambassador there.
“It’s the same in places like Mexico or Argentina, where Tourism Ireland wouldn’t have a presence. It can take years in terms of asking diplomatically.”
Optus Stadium in Perth, Australia is another location joining the Global Greening this yearTourism IrelandTourism Ireland
Sometimes, Irish history plays a part too.
“If you look at the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, for example, we had to run that by the Archbishop of Rio di Janeiro,” Gibbons says.
“The pitch that got that over the line was the work that Irish missionaries did in Brazil over 100 years ago. That was nothing to do with tourism at all, but it’s all part of it.”
The mammoth effort goes into the ‘greening’ of so many locations around the world every year has proven almost invaluable.
Gibbons illustrates the value of the initiative when describing how a 30-second NBC television segment on the station’s nightly news ran coast to coast a number of years ago.
“If I was to buy an ad for that long on NBC, it would have cost me $2.5 million, so it’s priceless in terms of its PR value.”
Ultimately though, the success of the initiative is a testament to how keeping things simple can often work best.
“People identify green with Ireland,” Gibbons jokes. “If you take the likes of France or the UK, where the flags are red, white and blue, you’ve got three colours.
“The practicality for us is great!”

https://www.thejournal.ie/1700-buildings-in-dublin-waiting-for-protected-status-4529035-Mar2019/,"Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies on Burlington RoadGoogleMapsGoogleMaps
THERE ARE 1,700 buildings in Dublin waiting for protected status from Dublin City Council, recently released figures show.
According to the council’s planning department, there are currently 400 proposed additions to itsRecord of Protected Structures(RPS) as well as an additional 1,300 recommendations from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht - an “unprecedented number” of buildings, a spokesperson has said.
Buildings listed on the council’s RPS are given special status. If an owner plans to alter a structure it must go through the council’s planning process.
With a such large number of proposed additions, each structure requires expert evaluation which could take up to three years.
Meanwhile, Green Party councillor Patrick Costello is concerned that the council is not taking the issue seriously enough and that buildings remain at risk. ”In particular our more modern built heritage and our industrial heritage,” says Costello. “TheCity Development Planrecognises this heritage but in practice nothing happens”.
According to the council, the minister’s recommendations are based on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH)survey.
NIAH architectural survey of DublinNIAHNIAH
The NIAH is the statutory agency responsible for preparing a comprehensive inventory of architectural heritage in each city in Ireland.
Since 2011, the NIAH has been undertaking a comprehensive, street-by-street, building-by-building survey in Dublin city.
Advertisement
Starting clockwise in the northeast inner city, the survey has now covered most of the areas within the canals. The NIAH are currently surveying parts of the southeast Dublin 2 area and have nearly completed their survey of Clontarf.
As a result, there’s likely to be more recommendations for buildings to be listed on the RPS in the coming years, the council has said, with a possible 500 further recommendations arising from the current southeast survey.
‘Question of sustainability’
For some, this raises the question of timescale and how the city needs to act quicker in protecting its built heritage.
The number of buildings listed for protection or preservation in Dublin has risen from 2,203 in 1999 to 8,741 in 2019.
By comparison, there are 1,110 structures listed on Cork city’s Record of Protected Structures while there are 1,960 structures on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council’s RPS.
Dublin-based architect Ciarán Ferrie has said that the longer buildings remain not listed on the council’s RPS, the greater the risk of demolition they face. Or of being altered indefinitely, particularly more modern structures.
“There is a concern that we’re losing a lot of that architecture,” Ferrie has said. “We’re in danger of doing to the architecture of that period what we did to Georgian architecture 40, 50 years ago, where there wasn’t much value placed on, it was considered a remnant of a historical era we didn’t really want to be part of”.
There’s continued debate in Irish towns and cities about modern buildings, says Ferrie.
In Dublin, for instance, the Central Bank building on Dame Street and Phibsborough Shopping Centre have always divided opinion.
In 2017, Irish architects rallied to protect the former Bord Fáilte headquarters on Baggot Street designed by Robin Walker and completed in 1961. It was subsequently demolished.
With 1700 proposed additions to the council’s RPS – including numerous modern structures – Ferrie fears the city is in danger of losing parts of its modern built heritage if the council does not act quicker to list them.

“[These buildings] are representative of a time in our history whether we like it or not,” says Ferrie.
“There’s a whole other question of sustainability, too -  demolishing buildings only to rebuild something bigger on-site. So it’s not just a question of preservation”.
Costello says that “a lot of amazing buildings are being torn down because they aren’t protected”.
Fitzwilton House on Wilton Terrace was built in 1969 and demolished last year.DoCoMoMo IrelandDoCoMoMo Ireland
A better system could be to follow the UK example whereby buildings are given different grades of importance.
“I think the system [here] is too rigid,” he says. “Either a building is on the list or not. It’s too black and white”.
To address the “unprecedented number” of proposed additions to the Record of Protected Structures, a methodology has been prepared by the council which involves prioritising buildings by significance, according to a spokesperson.
The council aims to have the 1,700 buildings assessed by 2022.
Its Planning and Property Development Department has recently recruited two additional conservation research officers to undertake this “important work”.","8.31pm, 10 Mar 2019",

THE DEATH TOLL from an explosion at a chemical plant in eastern China has risen to 47, authorities have confirmed.
The latest industrial incident to rock China in recent years occurred at around 2.50pm (6.50am Irish time yesterday) at a facility run by Tianjiayi Chemical in Yancheng, Jiangsu province, city officials said on Twitter-like Weibo.
More than 600 people are currently receiving treatment for injuries sustained in the blast.
Around the time of the explosion, China’s earthquake administration reported a 2.2-magnitude tremor in Lianyungang, a city near the Yancheng blast.
The windows of houses and a school in the surrounding area were shattered by the force of the explosion, and residents were evacuated amid concerns about toxic fumes, according to authorities and images published by local media.

A large blaze continued to light up the sky last night, according to AFP reporters who attempted to access the industrial area.
Dozens of fire engines and ambulances — some drafted in from other cities — raced to and from the scene.
Police sealed off all roads and dirt tracks to the site.
An aerial view of the blast area showed a large swathe of destruction in the industrial park, where multiple fires had initially raged.

“At present, on-site rescue is still going on… The cause of the accident is under investigation,” officials said.
Rescuers interviewed by state broadcaster CCTV repeatedly described the ground situation as “complex”, adding that the focus was on trying to pull people from the site.

Emergency services continued to work throughout the night for the rescue efforts, with the initial death toll of 6 now at 47.
History of industrial disasters
Industrial accidents are common in China, where safety regulations are often poorly enforced.
In November, a gas leak caused an explosion at a PVC production plant in a northern Chinese city that will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, killing 24 people and injuring 21 others.
A report published by local authorities in February revealed that the Chinese chemical firm responsible for the accident had concealed information and misled investigators.
Last July, a blast at a chemical plant in southwest Sichuan province left 19 dead and 12 injured. The company had undertaken illegal construction that had not passed safety checks, according to local authorities.
And in 2015, giant chemical blasts in a container storage facility killed at least 165 people in the northern port city of Tianjin.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fine-gael-conference-4554544-Mar2019/,"‘LET’S TAKE IRELAND forward together’ – that is the theme of Fine Gael’s National Spring conference, which kicks off in Wexford today.
Fine Gael loves a tagline. Remember the ‘Republic of Opportunity?’ And no one can forget the ‘Keep the Recovery Going’ line. That onecame back to bite themin the end.
But party sources believe the real theme of this year’s national conference is the “importance of the female voice across all political levels”, which is why there will be a sea of Fine Gael women at White’s Hotel this weekend who are running in local and European elections.
This year’s conference is all about highlighting the party candidates for the local, European and (perhaps not that far off) general election, with candidates like veteran TD and former Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald, as well as former Rose of Tralee winner, Maria Walsh, making appearances across the schedule.
Women for election
The party is keen to highlight that four of the seven European election candidates it is running are women, while so far, Fine Gael has 109 women booked in for the local elections – the highest number achieved by any party, according to a spokesperson.
They added that no party has ever exceeded 100, and the latest figure puts them on 28% representation. The party expects to reach the 30% quota for female candidates.
There will be no member votes at this event, just seminars and debates on issues such as ‘prioritising women’s health’, as well as ‘protecting children on and offline’.

Other discussions will be held on the party’s rules in relation to dispute resolutions.
At the Fine Gael Ard Fheisin November, Gerry O’Connell, chairman of the national executive, said the rule change would allow the party to avoid litigation in the courts and ensure there are “better standards of due process whereby investigations of disputes and adjudication on disputes are separated”.
The party members were told that the new disciplinary rules would put Fine Gael in line with the disciplinary system operated by the GAA.
This year, Leo Varadkar will return to the tradition of giving his speech on Saturday night, and it will be televised.
In his first Fine Gael conference as party leader in 2017, the Taoiseachdelivered his speechat the opening of events due to the scheduled Saturday speech clashing with the Ireland versus Denmark football game.

Two years ago, he promised to reduce taxes for middle-income earners by raising the standard cut-off point.
He hit out at “critics and cynics” who claimed the housing crisis would not be solved. (Varadkar has since said he understandswhy people might be skepticalthat Fine Gael can solve the homeless crisis).
“I don’t believe them. Yes, there are major challenges with housing and homelessness, and no, they won’t be solved overnight. But we have a plan, the plan is working, and we won’t stop until we succeed. Because we believe that everyone should have a home. And we believe that every working person should be able to aspire to own one,” he said.
At the time, the latest figuresshowed that there were 5,250 adults and 3,124 children staying in emergency accommodation – giving a total of 8,374.
The homeless emergency accommodation figuresfor January 2019show that there are now a combined total of 9,987 people homeless and living in emergency accommodation in Ireland, a significant rise of 234 people from December.
The mention of the crisis in 2017 did little to appease Fr Peter McVerry who tweeted his astonishment thathomelessness did not feature on the conference’s agenda.
The Taoiseach later caused a media whirlwindwhen he toldTheJournal.iethat Ireland has one of the lowest levels of homelessness.

This year, there is again no explicit mention of homelessness on the agenda, though there is a seminar titled: “Vibrant communities across Ireland – housing, urban and rural regeneration.”
This will be attended by Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy and Rural and Community Development Minister Michael Ring, so the issue of homelessness surely will arise.
While local and European elections might be the focus of the conference this year, the elephant in the room is the threat of a general election this year.
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil agreed to extending the confidence and supply deal, with leaders of both parties committing to a 2020 election date. But the Taoiseach has acknowledged since that no one knows what is around the corner, or who (or what) might bring this government down.
This weekend’s conference will be about showing that Fine Gael is election ready. So expect big promises, talk of tax cuts and more money in your pockets. One problem for Varadkar making such promises is that no one knows what Brexit might bring for the Irish economy.
Varadkar has said at previous party conferences he was told toshut up and keep his head down. Rather than being quiet, this year, the Taoiseach will be keen to make some subtle, andsome not-so-subtle election promises.

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-centre-e72-million-4556693-Mar2019/,"A SURGE IN the numbers of asylum seekers living in Direct Provision centres sent the fees paid to private firms operating the network of centres across the country soaring to €72 million, including Vat, last year.
In 2018, the numbers of people being accommodated in direct provision increased by 18% from 5,096 at the start of the year to 5,997 at the end of December.
The sharp increase in numbers has resulted in an increase in revenue for the private firms operating the centres, with new figures published by the Department of Justice showing that six firms received payments in excess of €5 million last year including two receiving payments in excess of €7 million.
The figures show that the contractor to receive the highest amount from the Department of Justice was Mosney Holidays plc which received fees of €8.69m.
Mosney Holidays plc operates a direct provision centre for 600 asylum seekers at Mosney in Co Meath and the €8.6m it received last year brings to €136m the company has received from the State between 2002 and 2018 for its Direct Provision service.
The increased numbers of people seeking asylum here has had Department of Justice officials scrambling to identify new Direct Provision centres.
Last year, a move by the Department of Justice to set up a new centre for 115 asylum seekers in the north Clare village of Lisdoonvarna led to tensions in the local community after a local hotelier, Marcus White made his King Thomond hotel available.
Now, the new figures show that White’s James White & Co Ltd received fees of €1.24m for 2018.
Much attention was also given to the arrival of a group of Syrian refugees at the Abbeyfield Hotel at Ballaghaderreen in Co Roscommonin December last year. The figures show that the owner of the hotel, Next Week & Co Ltd received payments of €3.16m in 2018.

Along with Mosney Holidays Plc, one other business received payments in excess of €7m – last year, Alan Hyde’s Barlow Group last year received fees of €7.5m and the group accommodates asylum seekers across Cork and Waterford.
Millstreet Equestrian Services which provides accommodation for over 500 asylum seekers in Cork and Waterford received payments of €6.53 million.
Between 2000 and 2018, Millstreet Equestrian Services has received €82.5 million in fees from the State.
Aramark’s Campbell Catering Ltd last year received €5.89m for operating State owned direct provision centres at Knockalisheen, Co Clare, Co Cork and Co Meath where over 825 asylum seekers are accommodated.
Bridgestock caters for around 500 asylum seekers in Ballyhaunis, Co Mayo and Sligo town and the €5.8m received last year brings to €97m the firm has received in payments between 2000 and 2018.
The firm which operates the largest direct provision centre in the capital, Clondalkin Towers Hotel, Fazyard Ltd last year received €5.5 million.
East Coast Catering Ltd which accommodates around 600 asylum seekers in Dublin and Louth last year received €4.4m.
Maplestar Ltd accommodates 200 asylum seekers at the Eglinton Hotel at Salthill, Co Galway and received €3m in payments.
The figures also show that Onsite Field Management received fees of €2.8 million to provide services for 335 asylum seekers at four centres in Co Kerry.
Sidetracks Ltd, which accommodates 162 asylum seekers at a Great Western Hotel in Galway last year received €2m in fees while another firm, Tattonward Ltd which accommodates 175 asylum seekers at Drumgoask, Monaghan received €2.1m.","7.10pm, 22 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/drugs-deaths-4529478-Mar2019/,"A TOTAL OF 736 people died as a result of drugs in 2016, a rate of two people a day, new figures from the Health Research Board show.
The number is an increase of one person from 2015, and relates to people who have died in Ireland as a result of poisoning, trauma or medical causes linked to drug use.
Of the total number, 549 were male and 187 were female.
The total number of deaths from drug poisoning decreased slightly in 2016 to 354 (from 365 the previous year).
Of the deaths from poisoning,alcoholwas in implicated in 132 (37%) while it was solely responsible for 56 (16%).
Opiateswere the main drug groups implicated in poisonings. Heroin was implicated in 72 deaths in 2016 compared to 83 in 2015, while methadone was implicated in almost one-third of poisonings (103) in 2016.
Deaths related tococainedropped slightly to 41 in 2016.
Meanwhile,prescription drugswere implicated in 258 (73%) of every poisoning death.
In relation to non-poisoning deaths, the number increased slightly with 382 deaths in 2016. Non-poisoning deaths were either trauma (172 deaths) or medical causes (210 deaths).

Commenting on the figures, Dr Darrin Morrissey, Chief Executive at the HRB, said the number of deaths represented the “impact that drug use has on families and society”.
“Behind these figures are lives lost and lives cut short. This HRB report clearly illustrates the impact that drug use has on families and society,” he said.
“The collection of data on drug deaths is essential to understand trends and help service providers design appropriate interventions and help save lives.”
Paula Byrne, CEO of homeless and addiction charity Merchants Quay Ireland, said the numbers were a “tragic reflection of a country failing some of its most vulnerable citizens”.
We are seeing more and more people in addiction left behind, and the longer we leave people in addiction, the more likely their mental health and drug use will worsen.
Ana Liffey Drug Project CEO Tony Duffin stressed that each one of those 736 deaths is “someone’s child, someone’s son, daughter or friend”.
“What is particularly concerning is that the average age of those that died was just 42, meaning a lot of years of life lost unnecessarily. In modern societies we don’t expect people to die at 42.”We know that people can and do recover from substance use issues in their lives, and we need to make sure that our policies increasingly support that happening.”
Dublin GAA star Philly McMahon has made several public calls for the decriminalisation of people who use drugs. Responding to these latest figures he said:
“Look, treating people who use drugs as criminals does not work and needs to change. Over 700 people died as a result of their drug use in 2016, yet if any of those people had come into contact with the state while in possession of drugs our response would have been to prosecute them using the criminal law.
The government launched its National Drugs Strategy, titledReducing Harm, Supporting Recoveryin 2017. The strategy explicitly supports moving towards a “health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/man-drowned-snagged-car-swimming-river-shannon-4525723-Mar2019/,"A FATHER OF one drowned after becoming “snagged” on a car that had been submerged in the river Shannon, gardaí told an inquest into the man’s death yesterday.
Christopher ‘Kippy’ Leo, aged 44, from Cliona Park, Moyross, had gone for a swim at Brown’s Quay, Limerick, when he got caught on the car, Limerick Coroner’s Court heard.
“It is in an area known for joyriding. The car may have been driven in or pushed in,” Garda Alan Dowling, Mayorstone Park garda station, told the inquest.
Eric Woodland from Dalglish Park, Moyross, told the hearing he and Christopher Leo, who were friends, had gone for a walk on 30 June 2018, and stopped for a rest near the riverbank.
“We were sitting down enjoying the sun. It was a roasting hot day. Ann Halvey and her two daughters were paddling in the river and Christopher said to me he was going to ‘show-off’ for the kids,” Woodland told gardai.
“He went in and he went down…suddenly. He was gone under for about a minute and a half, I got worried, I asked Ann to ring the rescue crowd.”
Woodland said Christopher Leo “had one or two drinks that day, but he wasn’t drunk”.

Limerick City and County Fire and Rescue Service were dispatched to the scene and quickly located the man’s body underwater.
“The Fire Service rescue [boat] located him snagged underwater in a car,” Garda Dowling said.
Ann Halvey from Cosgrave Park, Moyross, stated in a deposition, read out by Garda Inspector Dermot O’Connor of Henry Street Garda Station, that Leo was initially “popping up and down” in the water.
She said she thought he was “only messing” when he didn’t resurface. She rang the emergency services and efforts to resuscitate Christopher Leo failed.
John Leo told the inquest he identified his brother’s body later at University Hospital Limerick (UHL).
Dr Gabor Laskai, a pathologist at UHL, said death was caused by “asphyxiation due to drowning”. He said toxicology tests found “low levels” of Xanax and alcohol in Christopher Leo’s system.
He noted the post mortem examination found a “concurrent use of alcohol, anti- depressant; anti-epileptic; antihistamines medications” which combined together would have resulted in “an increased risk of accident” as well as a possible “loss of coordination”.
Limerick Coroner, Dr John McNamara remarked: “It strikes me as very unusual there was a car in (the river), but that is what appears to have snagged Christopher under the water.”
Recording a verdict of “misadventure”, Dr McNamara noted combined low levels of alcohol and medicines may have affected Mr Leo’s “coordination and ability to react”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/injecting-centre-school-4542058-Mar2019/,"IT’S A DULL Thursday morning in Dublin’s south inner city and the preschool pupils of St Audoen’s National School are milling about their classroom.
In one room, a group of 3- to 4-year-olds are being conducted by a teacher through a rendition of Dublin’s Fair City. In the classroom next to that, children are playing with toys, laughing and running around.
The windows of the preschool room look out onto Cook Street, and directly across the road is the entrance to the 40 Steps – old stone steps that lead upwards to St Audoen’s Park and church, in the direction of Christ Church Cathedral.
Every classroom of the primary school looks out onto the street and the green space across the road.
“So the 40 steps are the most common area for drug use,” principal of the school Eilish Meagher explains.
Since 2015, Meagher – who has worked in the school for 18 years and been the principal for eight – has been keeping a log of all the incidents related to drug use and anti-social behaviour that she and other staff members witness from the windows of the school.
Cook Street – a busy side road of tour buses and apartment buildings  – is a hotspot of anti-social behaviour and public injecting by intravenous drugs users.
“We’ve had to call emergency services, we’ve resuscitated people ourselves. We’ve removed drugs off the ground from next to bodies, we’ve seen people die, we’ve seen people beaten up horrifically,” she says.
The 40 Steps - an area of frequent public injecting - as seen from the classrooms of St Audeon's.Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ieCormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Meagher says on average she records about three incidents like this a week.
“But if I could sit at the window and report on everything, I’d fill a book probably in a week,” she says.
Meagher also has multiple photographs she has taken of incidents to go along with the log entries that illustrate the problem.
TheJournal.iehas seen pictures of men tying up, of people injecting drugs into their groins, emergency services trying to resuscitate people, women injecting drugs on the 40 steps, violence, and discarded drug paraphernalia in and around the school.
The reason Meagher is highlighting the issues faced by the school, is that St Audoen’s – along with multiple businesses, residents, parents and community members – are vehemently opposed to the opening of a medically supervised injecting centre on Merchant’s Quay, just 300m door-to-door from the school.
They believe that Dublin 8 has been allowed to decline significantly as a result of an over-concentration of drug support and treatment centres in the surrounding areas.
Eilish Meagher sitting at her desk.Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ieCormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Meagher, the staff, parents and the Board of St Audoen’s believe that the proposed new centre – which will provide intravenous drug users with a safer, medically supervised place in which to inject heroin or other drugs – will only add to the decline and issues already prevalent in the area.
Meagher wants to protect the children of St Audoen’s ensure they are not exposed to the worst features of Dublin’s drug problem.
“So we’re a Deis school in the inner city. Now I’m not big on labels – I don’t label the kids – but the whole initiative of Deis is to deliver equal opportunities,” says Meagher.
From justice to harm reduction
Latest figures showthat about one person a day died from drug overdose in Ireland in 2016 – with the vast majority of these in Dublin.
The sight of people injecting in alleyways and side streets is a common one when walking through the city centre.Discarded needles, bloody rags and other drug paraphernalia litter the streets in some of the cities worst hit areas.

In itsNational Drugs Strategy 2017-2025, the Irish government signals a shift from dealing with drug addiction through the justice system to supporting addicts from a harm-reduction, health-led perspective.
Medically supervised injecting facilities (MSIFs) are a key part of this. About 120 or so exist in the world, with the first being opened in Switzerland in 1986.
The provision of opening Ireland’s first MSIF is contained in the2016 Programme for Government, which states:
Following on from this, the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Act 2017,legislates for the centres, making possession of controlled substances while inside them legal.
The opening of the first centre will be the culmination of years of consultation, research and lobbying work from organisations like Merchant’s Quay Ireland and the Ana Liffey Drug Project.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Essentially, the centres provide drug addicts with a safer, sterile environment in which to inject heroin, cocaine or others drugs under the supervision of a medical professional. Users source their own drugs and inject themselves in booths in the centre.
The presence of a healthcare professional reduces the risk of overdose. A common statistic quoted by those in favour of MSIFs is that no one has ever died of an overdose while inside one.
Minister of State with responsibility for Health Promotion and the National Drugs Strategy Catherine Byrne TD who is overseeing the introduction of the centres.Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
The drug user is able to recover then in a designated area in the centre before leaving.
While inside, the idea is that they can make contact with healthcare and social supports if they wish, and be provided with advice and a point of contact that might otherwise not be available to them.
International research on the centres show that they help to reduce drug-related deaths in the areas where they are opened.
The best available data isn’t able to fully verify that they reduce drug related crime in areas where they are opened, but research finds that drug-related crime does not increase as a result of the centres being opened.
Some studies show that social issues (like disposed syringes, public injecting) decrease as a result of an injecting centre opening, however the data is not comprehensive.
In August 2017, the HSE put out a tender for an operator to open and manage a MSIF in Dublin city over an 18-month period as part of an independently-monitored pilot programme.
The tenderwas awarded to Merchant’s Quay Ireland(MQI) – the addiction support and homelessness service – in February of last year.
Initially, it was planned that the MSIF could be opened at MQI’s Riverbank Centre – on the south quays close to St Audoen’s – without having to apply for planning permission from Dublin City Council.

However, in late-2017, the Dublin Business Alliance (DBA) – which is a lobby group made up of the Licensed Vintners Association, the Restaurants Association and the Temple Bar Company – sought clarification from the council whether planning permission would be needed for the centre.
The DBA is strongly opposed to the opening of the MSIF in the city centre.
Dublin City Councilruled that planning permission would be neededto open the MSIF, and in October of last year Merchant’s Quay lodged an application to open the centre at its Riverbank Centre.
Community opposition
In total,99 objections were lodgedagainst the opening of the MSIF at Merchant’s Quay by a wide range of concerned parties.
As well as St Audoen’s, objections were lodged by local businesses (eg, pubs, restaurants, hostels, hotels and offices in the area), local residents, management companies of apartment buildings and parents with children in the school (among others).
The objections painted a bleak picture of Dublin’s south inner city and the streets and alleyways around Merchant’s Quay.
Anti-social behaviour, intimidation of staff and customers, robbery, public injecting, public defecation and open drug dealing are all listed as common issues for people living and working in the area.
All of the objectors are in agreement that there are already too many services operating in the inner city and that the opening of the MSIF will only compound and add to the issues they face.
There are concerns over how to police drug dealing in the area, especially considering gardaí have been told to use their discretion when monitoring people leaving and entering the centre.

In December of last year, the council came back to MQI requesting additional information before it makes a decision on the application.
MQI must submit a detailed operational plan for the centre (including a policing plan for the area) and must also submit a detailed assessment on why the centre won’t lead to an overconcentration of similar facilities in the area.
TheJournal.iecontacted gardai in relation to the policing plan, but had received no response by the time of publication.
St Audoen’s school
Walking through St Audoen’s on Thursday, the corridors are calm and quiet. In one room, a former pupil now teacher is in the middle of a gym class with enthusiastic pupils.
There are about 200 students at the school, from preschool up to sixth class.
Through doorways, children can be seen learning in their classrooms. It seems like a normal day in a normal primary school, no different from any other across the country.
A corridor in St Audoen's National School.Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ieCormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
But according to Meagher, because of where it’s located, St Audoen’s is different from other schools. In its objection to DCC, business lawyers representing the school point out the unique problems it faces:
“On a consistent basis all staff and children attending the National School witness drug addicts buying and injecting illegal drugs. This happens nowhere else in this State and cannot be consistent with the proper planning and development of the area,” the submission states.
Later, it is stated that gardaí from Kevin Street Station are regular attendees on Cook Street.

The submission also contains two signed letters from child psychotherapists who have worked with the children of St Audoen’s for eight and 11 years – both stating that the normalisation of drug taking in the area was having a detrimental impact on the development of the children.
A large sign on the wall of the school.Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ieCormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
Meagher says that she and her staff work hard to cultivate an atmosphere of peacefulness and calm. She is deeply proud of the school, its record, and the work done by her staff.
While children are inside the school she says she can vouch for their safety “100%”.
“But what they can see in the community and what goes on around it, it’s traumatic,” she says.
“The children do see incidents all the time because they happen on the street in front of them and they happen on the way to school and after school,” she says.
“They see myself and the deputy principal and the caretakers asking people to leave, moving people on. They have seen stuff, definitely.
No consultation
Meagher says that since 2015 she has proactively been trying to get support from government and local politicians to have her concerns addressed, but says she has not been heeded.
She says that current Junior Minister for Drugs Catherine Byrne had promised consultation with her prior to the tender being awarded last year.
“That never happened. So before the press release went out last year [announcing the awarding of the tender] they rang the school half and hour beforehand… We were on mid-term break so we weren’t here, and that was it,” she says.
Meagher and the other objectors believe that the over concentration of drug services in the area (some objectors put the number at 16 to 18 drug treatment centres within 2km of Merchant’s Quay), plays a big part in the public order and social issues prevalent there.
MQI has provided services in the area since 1989. In 2008, it consolidated its existing services into the Riverbank Centre on Merchant’s Quay, just behind Cook Street and St Audoen’s (this is where the planned MSIF will be located).
The distance between St Audoen's and where the MSIF will be located.Google MapsGoogle Maps
At the centre, MQI provide a wide range of homeless, primary healthcare and drug services. They have a Night Café in which up to 50 homeless people can sleep on mats on the ground. They have a needle exchange, provide meals seven days a week and have a wide range other services.
Meagher believes that the service as it is has become too big, and draws people to the area who otherwise wouldn’t come. This, in turn, leads to increased public order and social issues like public injecting, drug dealing, violence and other anti-social behaviour.
This is what’s known as the “honeypot” effect – the drawing of people to the area where the services are located. MQI strongly contests that its service draws people to the area. The charity says that it provides a service in response to the need that is already there.
In the 18 years she has worked in the area, Meagher says the problems in the area have worsened.
“It’s bigger. It’s on a larger scale. The volume of service users has obviously increased and the culture around drugs has changed in that time,” she says.
Discarded drug paraphernalia near the school.
Meagher makes it clear that no violence or intimidation has ever been carried out on school officials or children, but that rather it is what the children witness going on that is harmful.
She is also at pains to stress that she believes MQI and other drug treatment services do good work. She says she or the school have nothing against to idea of injecting centres in principal, but feels strongly that one should not be opened 300m from a primary school.
She feels that the current MQI service as it is is too big for the area, and again, should not be allowed to operate so close to the school, where the safety of children is of paramount importance.
“There’s always going to be illegal drug use, there’s always going to be addiction, there’s always going to be a need for addiction services,” she says.
“If the Department of Health tell me this service is needed, and an injecting room is needed right beside the service – who am I to argue with that?
“And it’s impacting them negatively, and it is going to impact negatively if the service is increased.”
The injecting room
Later on Thursday, in the early afternoon, Derek Parker walks through the basement of the Riverbank Centre on Merchant’s Quay wearing a hard hat.
The basement is yet to be developed, with exposed concrete walls and no flooring. If planning permission is granted, it will be where the injecting centre is built.
Parker – who worked for years as psychiatrist nurse and a community addictions nurse – is the project coordinator for the MSIF.
The area where the injecting centre is due to be built.Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ieCormac Fitzgerald / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
No construction can begin on the facility until planning permission is granted, but Parker points out the different areas and what will be there if the centre gets the go-ahead.
Clients will queue off the street to the side of the Riverbank Centre on the Quays, before entering the facility. There will be a reception and waiting area, consultation rooms and seven injecting booths, as well as an area where people can recover after.
People will pass through the centre before exiting and leaving from the other side of the building and back onto the Quays.
MQI projects that the centre will cater for up to 60 people a day. The pilot programme will last for 18 months and be independently monitored in that time.
Parker is passionate about the project and fully believes that it will help not only to reduce deaths by overdose and increase the quality of life of intravenous drug users in Dublin, but that it will also have a positive effect on the community.
One study of MSIFs found an 80% reduction in discarded syringes in Barcelona between 2004 and 2012.
While the data on reductions in crime and public order issues isn’t comprehensive,the best evidence indicatesthat there is no increase in these as a result of an injecting centre opening.
Speaking toTheJournal.ieafter the tour of the facility, Parker says that he understands the fears and concerns of the school and the wider community.
“We respect their opinion. We can understand if people have some anxiety around this facility,” he says.
Parker says that MQI engages with St Audoen’s and the community “on a daily basis”.
“We are putting our message out there that there is no evidence of any increase in crime or antisocial behaviour around these facilities,” he says.

The current situation, where people are people are exposed to public injecting is “unacceptable”, according to Parker.
“I suppose the current situation is that children are exposed to public injecting, they are exposed to anti-social behaviour,” he says.
“We see this facility as providing an alternative. The current situation is unacceptable, we accept that.
Honeypot
Parker also strongly disagrees with claims that people are attracted to the area because of the services offered – the “honeypot” effect.
“There is again no evidence of a honey pot effect in these facilities,” he says.
“Merchant’s Quay developed its services – we started here in 1989 – our services started and developed as a response to the issue with drugs and the inner city in this part of the city.
“The problem didn’t arise because we were here. We developed our services here in response to the problems.
Parker says that MQI supports thousands of people every year through homelessness and addiction across all of its services.
“Again, I do not believe that the problem in this area is because of Merchant’s Quay,” he says.
He says that he is confident that the injecting centre will help not just the service users, but the entire community, and points to one case of a centre in Paris which is close to seven schools.
The schools were initially worries about the centre being opened, he says, but later came to support it more.
‘Mind boggling’
At St Audoen’s, Eilish Meagher looks out the window of her office and into the park and the 40 Steps, where she has seen so many people inject themselves over the years.

On Thursday morning, the steps are closed, but are due reopen later in the day with a public ceremony. Meagher says she’s never seen the area so clean, but wonders how long it will be before people are injecting there again.
She and the other objectors to the plan are convinced that the injecting centre will only exacerbate the problems of the area, increase anti-social behaviour, and further jeopardise the development and safety of the children of St Audoen’s.
Should the council grant permission for the facility later this year, it will almost certainly be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.
For Meagher, the issues she has are summed up by recent laws and campaigns aiming to increase the safety of children in schools. She talks about a large alcohol advertisement that can be seen from the school.
Under the new laws, it will soon be illegal to advertise for alcohol within 200m of a school. Meagher also talks about the ongoing No Fry Zones campaigns, to stop fast food restaurants being built within a certain distance of schools.
A recent objection to a fast food restaurant being built 300m from a school in Skerriesreceived widespread political support from TDs, senators and councillors – support that Meagher says is lacking for St Audoen’s.
“All these [councils] are meant to be implementing these No Fry Zones and there’s massive support. It’s mind-boggling,” she says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/camile-slammin-ramen-brody-sweeney-3-4530791-Mar2019/,"
RESTAURANT AND FOOD delivery chain Camile Thai is bringing its ‘virtual brand’ Slammin’ Ramen to Dublin six months after first testing the concept in London.
The ramen-based spin-off will not have a physical location. Instead, meals will be prepared and dispatched from one of Camile’s existing kitchens when Deliveroo users order from the ‘virtual’ restaurant.
Camile founder Brody Sweeney said the concept has for the last six weeks been trialled with customers with postal addresses in Dublin 4 and 6.
“We were really encouraged with the business we’re doing on it. It worked so well for us in London that we thought we’ll see how it’ll go in Dublin,” he toldFora.
“We’re testing it at the moment out of one branches (at South Circular Road) and we’re pretty happy with the way it’s going so far.”
It’s early days, but Sweeney said he’s starting to see repeat business for the virtual store coming through and that “sales are growing every week”.
Since Slammin’ Ramen launched in London last summer, sales have become “pretty solid” in the UK capital, though they were slow initially.
“About 80% of customers who order every week are repeat customers. When you’re getting a high level of repeat business, that’s telling you you’re on to something,” Sweeney said.
He said if the business can add sales onto an existing business “without capital investment” and with the same ingredients and kitchen then it makes commercial sense.
Even more Ramen
In July last year, whenForafirstspoke to Sweeneyabout Slammin’ Ramen’s London debut, he said he was searching for locations for possible new Camile stores. Naas, Drogheda, Waterford, Maynooth, Wexford, Kilkenny and Wexford were cited on the wish list.
Sweeney said those options are still being considered and the chain is planning to open seven new restaurants here this year alone, on top of the existing 14 locations.

“Technically every one of those can have a Slammin’ Ramen added on to them,” he said.
“(Camile is) in Cork and Limerick and we have a number of new ones opening this year, so we could have it all around the country by the end of the year.”
While Slammin’ Ramen is currently only available via the Deliveroo app, Sweeney said that once the trial period has ended, he intends to roll out the concept to Camile’s website and app.
“With out own delivery, most of our sales are through our own app. We do far more on that than we do in any other way,” he said.
CamileCamile
The ‘B’ word
Though plans for new Irish Camile outlets are afoot, the “big plan” is for London, which has room for up to 68 branches, according to a study commissioned by the company last year.
“We’re really putting a lot of effort into London and getting it right,” Sweeney said.
Despite this, the company has decided to hang back on its UK expansion.
Camile is one of the businesses operating out of 14Deliveroo Editions ‘dark kitchens’in the UK.
The food delivery service recently announced plans to offer ‘virtual brands’ – like Slammin Ramen – in Ireland on the back of the same concept in London.
It also announced plans to launch Deliveroo Editions here this year.

CANADA’S BUDGET MINISTER Jane Philpott has abruptly resigned, saying she no longer had confidence in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which is embroiled in a major political crisis.
“I have been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet,” Philpott said on Twitter.
“The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system.

The current scandal (you can find more detail in our Explainer here) centres around claims that Trudeau’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was inappropriately pressured by the Prime Minister to prevent the prosecution of a major Canadian engineering firm accused of fraud and bribery.
The affair has been politically costly to date. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s closest adviser and a longtime friend, resigned two weeks ago, according toThe Guardian. Wilson-Raybould has also resigned.
Stating that concerns had been raised by her constituents and other Canadians, Philpottsaid tonight:
“It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rent-hap-simon-communities-study-4523086-Mar2019/,"OVER 90% OF homes for rent in Ireland are beyond the reach of people dependent on state housing benefits, according to a new Simon Communities study.
The charity has called for the implementation of many of the proposals included in the new amendedResidential Tenancies Bill 2018, which is currently under consideration in the Dáil.
The 13th edition of theLocked Out of the Marketreport, published today, found that there were just 8% of properties available on the market to rent (48 properties) which were within Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) limits.
HAP is a form of rental benefit payment to assist lower-income households.
Under HAP, a tenant’s main rent is paid directly to a landlord, with the tenant paying a differential rent to their local council. The tenants must cover their own deposit, and no rent is paid by the council in advance of them entering the home.
The research was undertaken over three consecutive days between 21 and 23 November 2018.
It found that there was a 51% decrease in the number of properties available to rent in November 2018 (569 properties) compared to the first such study in May 2015, when 1,150 properties were available.
Reaction
Paul Sheehan, national spokesperson for the Simon Communities of Ireland, has said Rent Pressure Zones provided for in existing legislation need to be properly monitored and continuously enforced by the Residential Tenancies Board.
“More broadly, it is clear that the private sector is struggling to deliver the level of affordable housing needed in this country in the long-term. The Simon Communities of Ireland believe it is vital that the State, in conjunction with Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, build and invest in social and affordable housing across all tenure types nationwide,” Sheehan said.

Homelessemergency accommodation figures for Januaryshow that there are now a combined total of 9,987 people homeless and living in emergency accommodation in Ireland, a significant rise of 234 people from December.
The numbers taken over the course of one week in January show that there were 6,363 adults and 3,624 homeless children living in emergency accommodation in the state.
“Almost 10,000 people were forced to start 2019 in emergency accommodation. Without an accessible private rental sector or affordable housing, people have nowhere to go if they cannot afford to rent,” Sheehan said.
Deeper look
Looking further into the figures, the study found there only five properties were available to rent within HAP or Rent Supplement (RS) limits across all study areas for a single person on the dates surveyed.
These properties were located in Athlone (1), Cork City Centre (1), Galway City Centre (1) and north Kildare (2).
Simon Communities of IrelandSimon Communities of Ireland
Five properties were available within RS and HAP limits across all areas for a couple over the course of the study, too.
These were also located in the above locations.
“It is alarming that in some of the country’s most-populated urban centres, there is absolutely nowhere to rent for people depending on HAP for their housing. Not one property within Rent Supplement/HAP was available across any household category in Limerick City Centre and Waterford City Centre,” Sheehan said.
The Simon Communities support over 13,000 men, women and children.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-brexit-advice-theresa-may-4542345-Mar2019/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has said he gave British Prime Minister Theresa May advice on “how to negotiate” Brexit but that she “didn’t listen” to it.
Trump made his comments while speaking to reporters during his meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar the Oval Office in the White House.
Trump said that he will stay out of the Brexit negotiations but hopes that the discussions work out.
He said he’s surprised how badly the talks have gone and added that May has failed to follow his advice on how to handle the negotiations.
“I gave the Prime Minister my ideas on how to negotiate it and I think you would have been successful. She didn’t listen to that and that’s fine. She’s got to do what she’s got to do,” Trump said.
“I think it could have been negotiated in a different manner, frankly. I hate to see everything being ripped apart right now,” he said.
He said both sides are very “cemented in” and he called it a “tough situation” and a “shame.”
Looking to the Taoiseach, Trump said Brexit was “tearing countries apart” and added that he was surprised “how badly” it has gone since the UK referendum.

Varadkar pushed the issue of an EU-US trade deal, but the US president launched a scathing attack on Europe stating that they have been very difficult to deal with.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Trump went on to say that he doesn’t think another Brexit referendum would be possible “because it would be very unfair to the people that won”.
The president’s comments came as MPs are due to vote again in the House of Commonsthis evening at 5pm. They will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
The House of Commonslast night voted against a no-deal Brexitwith 321 MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time. A total of 278 MPs voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
During last night’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as May had proposed.
A total of 312 voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while 308 voted against the amendment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hookah-shisha-warning-dangerous-against-4544708-Mar2019/,"THE IRISH HEART Foundation has strongly advised against the smoking of tobacco from hookah pipes due to the adverse health effects the “multiple toxic chemicals” can have.
Waterpipes – which go by names such as hookah, shisha, goza and narghile – are a way of smoking tobacco, sometimes mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, making it more aromatic than cigarette smoke.
The Irish Heart Foundation (IHF) toldTheJournal.iethat the use of water pipes has increased over time and many users mistakenly believe that it is not addictive.
“Hookah smoke contains multiple toxic chemicals that come from the burning of the charcoal, tobacco, and flavourings. Water does not filter out many of these chemicals,” Dr Patrick Doorley, IHF chairperson, said.
Last week, the American Heart Association issueda similar warningagainst the smoking of tobacco in hookahs.
The AHA said that even though direct comparisons between hookahs and cigarettes have some limitations, “a single session of hookah use typically results in greater exposure to carbon monoxide than a single cigarette”.
The AHA added there is a misconception in the US that hookah smoking is less harmful than cigarettes because the tobacco is filtered through water, a claim it says has no scientific evidence.
Because most people smoke hookah in lounges and cafes it is perceived as a social activity and less habit-forming, AHA research found.

In a statement toTheJournal.ie,the HSE said that hookah/shisha is regulated in line with other tobacco products.
Under theTobacco Control Legislation, all tobacco products – including shisha- on sale in Ireland should be compliant with the appropriate health warnings and correct labelling of the product. The legislation also imposes restrictions on areas used for smoking hookahs in accordance with smoke-free requirements.
Despite hookah/shisha being regulated in line with other tobacco products, the HSE has no warnings against it or information about itonline.
Pipe dreams
Globally, hookah usage is spreading among younger people. Data from a survey of seven Middle Eastern countries showed that the rates of hookah smoking ranged from 9% to 15%.
Hookah is available in a number of cafes and lounges around Ireland, however, little research has been carried out on its popularity here.
Dr Doorley of the IHF acknowledged this lack of research but said “while we do not have reliable data on the extent of the use of water pipes in Ireland, we would strongly advise against their use”.
The Environmental Health Service has said it deals with the non-compliance of tobacco products – such as hookah - as a matter of priority. Anyone can report details of noncompliance by contacting the Office of Tobacco Control on 1890 333 100.

But the French publication reports that France want O’Gara on board as a consultant under head coach Jacques Brunel for the upcoming tournament in Japan. Brunel’s side won just two of their five Six Nations games to finish in fourth place in the table.
The former Ireland out-half spent four years in France working as assistant coach at Racing 92.
O’Gara has enjoyed considerable success in his coaching career so far.
Racing won the Top 14 title and reached the Champions Cup final during his tenure there, while Christchurch club Crusaders retained their Super Rugby title in 2018 and are favourites to go all the way again in 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fatberg-removed-from-sewer-wicklow-4544566-Mar2019/,"IRISH WATER HAS urged people to be more mindful of flushing inappropriate things down the toilet after an 8ft sewage blockage was cleared in Co Wicklow.
The blockage occurred as a result of items such as wet wipes, cotton bud sticks, nappies and cotton wool pads being flushed down the toilet instead of being put in the bin.
It was the third blockage, also known as ragging, removed from the Bollarney Wastewater Pumping Station by Wicklow County Council staff in one day last weekend.
Last year, Irish Water cleared more than 6,000 sewer blockages around the country which were caused by inappropriate items being flushed down the toilet.
The utility said thousands of unsuitable items are flushed down the toilet every day.

Annabel Fitzgerald of Irish Water said this has a “significant negative impact” on internal plumbing in homes and businesses, the wastewater network and the marine environment.
“The size and scale of the impact of flushing the wrong items down the toilet is incredible,” she said.
Wastewater infrastructure is being upgraded throughout Ireland, with new treatment plants being built and old plants upgraded as well as the laying of new sewers.
“It is still really important that people recognise the impact of what they flush so the network can function efficiently and effectively,” Fitzgerald said.
“Placing a bin in the bathroom and disposing of sanitary items safely and appropriately has a hugely positive impact on the network and the environment.”

Irish Water is working in partnership with Clean Coasts to deliver theThink Before You Flushcampaign, which reminds people of which items are, and are not, suitable to flush down the toilet.

File imageShutterstock / Red SquirrelShutterstock / Red Squirrel / Red Squirrel
A RECENT ALLEGED sighting of a large invasive rodent species on the banks of the Royal Canal was “a case of mistaken identity” according to officials.
Earlier today, locals near Ashtown in Dublin were warned to be on the lookout for possible Coypu sightings.
The large rat-like creatures, which originate in South America, can grow to a metre in length (including tail) and can weigh up to 9kg.
Waterways Ireland, which manages canals and other inland waterways across the island, has now said it believes the sighting was likely that of a native otter.
“All evidence now leads us to believe that this was a case of mistaken identity and the report was likely that of native Otter, which are present on the Royal Canal,” Waterways Irelandwrote on Facebook.
In 2017, a similar alert was issued in Cork when it emerged the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) trapped 10 coypus in the Curraheen area after a sighting of the rodent two years previously.

“They burrow into river banks, drainage banks, and create an elaborate tunnel system. This undermines these structures and left unchecked they can cause a lot of damage,” Danny O’Keeffe of the NPWStold us at the time.
Muskrat Studios/ YouTube
According to this week’s advisory from Waterways Ireland, eradication programmes to get rid of such rodents can cost several million euro and are not always successful.
It added that the potential sighting at the canal in Ashtown this month “raises concern of further spread” of the rodent, in the wake of their detected presence in Cork.
Despite the case of mistaken identity, Waterways Ireland is encouraging the public to report any possible Coypu sightings, preferably with a confirmation photo.
The agency issued this description:
• Large semi-aquatic rodent up to 1 metre in head to tail length• Features same in juveniles• It can weigh 5-9kg• It has webbed hind feet• Dark fur often with lighter ends and has a white muzzle• Has long cylindrical tail (not fur tail like otter) and small slightly protruding ears• Distinctive features are large bright orange-yellow incisor (front) teeth usually visible• Coypu are generally found near permanent water
The advisory concludes:
Please keep a look out for these creatures along the waterways and report sightings with photographs to any of the following below:
• Waterways Ireland Environment Section 061-922141• NPWS atbiodiversitypolicy@chg.gov.ieor your local National Parks and Wildlife ranger with details of location/date; a photo if available  or•invasives@biodiversityireland.ieor•http://records.biodiversityireland.ie

Manslaughter
Yesterday, detectives from the PSNI Major Investigation Team arrested two men aged 52 and 40 on suspicion of manslaughter. They were taken into custody for questioning.
Detectives conducted a search of a house in Moneymore at the time and seized a number of items. The 52-year-old man who was arrested yesterday was then further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.
However, this evening, the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team said he wasde-arrestedon that suspicion.
The PSNI are now urging parents to talk to their children and encourage them to come forward to tell their stories to police so they can “get an accurate picture of events that night”.
Detectives can be contacted at the dedicated incident room at Dungannon police station by calling 101, extension 53055.

May arrives#Brexitpic.twitter.com/PIUi5ggyZe
[Note: Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker have given a press conference on progress at the Strasbourg talks. The two leaders have agreed a joint instrument providing guarantees on the backstop -more details here.]
BRITISH CABINET OFFICE Minister David Lidington has told MPs in the House of Commons tonight that the UK government has “secured legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration”.
He said proposed new mechanisms would prevent the EU from trapping the UK in the backstop indefinitely.
He said the deal would be put to MPs in a vote tomorrow as planned.
May earlier arrived in Strasbourg for last-ditch talks with senior EU officials ahead of tomorrow’s planned vote.
She arrived after 8pm this evening for her meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Here at home, ministers convened this evening for their second Cabinet meeting of the day, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has spoken by phone with Juncker.
It’s understood that the Taoiseach and his entourage were due to fly to Washington DC this evening ahead of his week-long St Patrick’s Day visit to the States, however, his travels have been delayed until tomorrow.
Varadkar had wanted to travel a day early to America so as to avoid being mid-flight when the Westminster votes were taking place tomorrow.
However, senior sources confirmed that Cabinet members were summoned to a meeting for 6.45pm this evening. “Very sudden,” is how one source described it.
A government spokesperson has said the Taoiseach’s travel plans have always been “flexible” due to the unpredictability of Brexit events this week. It is “very much” the plan that Varadkar’s agreed schedule, which is due to begin on Wednesday, will go ahead.
Some ministers were not present in person this evening as they have already left the country to fulfill their St Patrick’s Day itineraries.

May was greeted this evening at the Strasbourg parliament building by Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Her visit comes after British officials worked through the weekend to secure concessions from the European Union they hope will persuade MPs to back the text.
Britain’s House of Commons overwhelmingly defeated the agreed EU-UK withdrawal deal in January and without significant changes, it is expected to do so again in a vote tomorrow.
The EU has rejected many of May’s demands, which relate to the controversial backstop, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it had made an offer at the weekend.
Guy Verhofstadt, who oversees the negotiations for the European Parliament, said he and European Parliament President Antonio Tajani would meet later with May.
“I hope progress can be made, if it is possible, as a no deal #Brexit would be a catastrophe,” Verhofstadt tweeted.
“We will stand by Ireland & the need to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement.”

Another defeat in parliament could see the UK sever ties with its closest trading partner on 29 March with no new arrangements.
It would also raise the possibility of postponing Brexit, after May promised to allow MPs a vote later this week on whether to accept a no-deal scenario or request a short delay from the EU.
May has promised Britain will leave the EU whatever happens on 29 March, but many MPs fear that a “no deal” exit would wreak economic havoc.
In the face of a cabinet revolt, she promised that if her deal is defeated again then MPs will vote on “no deal” on Wednesday and then on Thursday, on delaying Brexit.
Any postponement would have to be approved by the leaders of the other 27 nations, who are next meeting at a Brussels summit on March 21-22 – a week before Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/drink-driving-bill-michael-harty-td-4545499-Mar2019/,"INDEPENDENT TD DR Michael Harty has said that he disagrees with his Independent TD colleagues on the new, stricter penalties for drink driving legislation, saying that it was an “important” aspect of road safety.
Independent TDs Mattie McGrath, Michael and Danny Healy-Rae have been vocal in their opposition to the changes, championed by Minister for Transport and Independent TD Shane Ross, which sees a more strict penalty for those caught driving while under the influence of alcohol, even if that’s a small amount of alcohol.
In an interview withTheJournal.ieabout a wide range of healthcare issues, Harty explained that he differed from his rural colleagues on Ireland’s newly-changed drink driving laws when viewing it from a medical perspective.
“I took a different view from my rural Independent colleagues on the Road Traffic Amendment Bill,” Co Clare GP Harty said, “which underpinned the change in penalty rather the change in level of alcohol to be illegal.”
The new regulations remove a concession in previous legislation by which some drink drivers received penalty points instead of being disqualified.
It now means that all drink drivers, without exception, will receive a driving disqualification for three months if they are caught above the legal limit.
“Taking a chance by drinking and driving is really taking a chance, so now people understand that if they take a chance and they’re found to be over the legal limit, rather than just issued with a fine of a couple of hundred euros and a few penalty points, they’re now faced with a much more serious penalty of losing your licence for three months.”

Rural TDs had argued that the legislation was too harsh, and could mean that someone gets their drivers’ licence revoked if driving the morning after a bout of drinking.
“In relation to the following morning,” Harty says, “do you want to be on the road the following morning with people who are still over the legal limit?”
“It seems harsh, but nevertheless, they are still over the legal limit,” he says.
He said that the proposals to allow exemptions for those who were caught over the legal limit and have had their licence revoked to allow them to drive to work was an “interesting proposal”.
“If it can be proven that it’s going to seriously impinge on your ability to function in society, perhaps being allowed to drive in a curfew period should be an option,” Harty says, though he doesn’t know “how it would work out practically”.
In a separate part of the interview, Harty said that there was a concern among some rural GPs that they could be targeted by anti-abortion protesters if they are the only one in an area providing those services to the public.
He also said that the 1 January date set by Health Minister Simon Harris, by which abortion services should be made available in Ireland, was “very ambitious” and has led to the “sporadic availability” of abortion services around the country.

This week, the Rural Independents Group, including Harty, put forward a Private Memebers’ Bill on the National Children’s Hospital, calling for construction to be  suspended immediately at the St James’ site.
The motion was rejected by the Dáil; Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath released a statement criticising the Fianna Fáil and Labour’s “absolutely bewildering decision to proceed at this disastrous site”.

But Michael Harty, who is also the chair of the Oireachtas Health Committee, said that it would be “very difficult” to suspend construction at the site.
“It would be very difficult to extract the current contractors from the project, and it could end up in protracted legal difficulties which would lead to further delay of the completion of hospital.”
The project, which has beenhounded by problems since its inception, has been disrupted recently by spiralling costs of completing the hospital; jumping from over €900 million to almost €2 billion. An assessment of how costs increased has been set up by the government – but the cost of carrying out this assessment has also increased (from €450,000 to €600,000).
The capital project has also been caught up in a debate over whether St James’s is the appropriate site for the new national hospital. It was originally meant to be located on a site next to the Mater Hospital in Phibsborough, north Dublin. But after An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission, it was decided that it would be co-located at a site next to St James’s Hospital. Approximately €40 million was spent on moving the plans to a new site.

Harty believes that the hospital should have been built at Connolly Hospital site Blanchardstown, even though it was more important to be co-located next to a maternity hospital rather than a teaching hospital.
The Blanchardstown site is said to have been more appropriate because of the room available to expand the hospital; critics of the St James’ site say that within 10 or 20 years, that the current Children’s Hospital plans won’t meet the demands of the population.
He adds that because of technology advances, the bed requirement may be sufficient but that the ancillary add-ons that the hospital will need and ability to expand “won’t be there, or will be very tight”.
CervicalCheck, and trolley counts

In February, after Sinn Féin tabled a motion of no confidence in Simon Harris as Health Minister, Harty voted against Harris.
This came after a number of issues facing the government, all involving the healthcare sector, including the nurses’ strike, the cost of the National Children’s Hospital, and issues around the CervicalCheck programme.
“The current waiting period of 6 months or more is unacceptable,” Harty says on this, “I’ve had patients that had smears done in August who haven’t had their results back yet.
Although he had previously intended to abstain, Harty changed his mind after hearing that the additional funding needed to prop up the increasingly expensive National Children’s Hospital would mean that a 60-bed modular unit for University Hospital Limerick would be delayed.
“This is one failed commitment I cannot accept,”he said at the time, stating that Harris appeared in front of his health committee and gave a number of statements to the Dáil where he pledged that the hospital unit “would be delivered on and delivered on by 2019″.
“Limerick hospital has the highest trolley count in country,” Harty says. “This week there were 58 people on trolleys or in wards. I was wavering, but funding was not guaranteed for the project… that’s a breach of trust and reigning on commitment given, so it’s very hard to have confidence in that Minister after that.”
Since drawing attention to the issue, Minister has said that money will be made available.
When the HSE plan is published, according to Harty, Simon Harris has committed that funding for the unit will be made available. But after the modular unit is built, there is a third element of construction where staff are trained for the new unit, and “that money hasn’t been made available”.
“So I think the 60-bed modular unit won’t be ready until 2021 at the earliest,” he says.
“And this is only an interim measure: a 96-bed permanent unit in was meant to be delivered by 2021, according to the Programme for Government. If interim unit isn’t made until 2021, when will the permanent unit be delivered?”

https://www.thejournal.ie/siptu-firefighters-assessment-celtic-tiger-buildings-fire-risks-4535832-Mar2019/,"SIPTU MEMBERS IN the Dublin Fire Brigade have called again for a full risk assessment of properties built or extended during the Celtic Tiger period due to fire safety concerns.
The call for this review comes after a large number of fire safety issues were discovered in a recent survey of apartment blocks built between 2000 to 2014.
The Irish Times reported today that one of the largest property management companies in the state, Keenan Property Management, has said that significant fire safety issues had been discovered in “almost all” of the 60 apartment developments that it manages.

Siptu Sector Organiser, Brendan O’Brien said that this was a “stark, but unfortunately, not an unexpected finding”.
“The company must be commended on the proactive approach which it undertook in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in 2017.
Siptu’s Dublin Fire Brigade Convenor, Shane McGill, said that a particularly concerning aspect of the survey for the lives and safety of firefighters, was “the lack of proper compartmentation in many of the buildings surveyed”.
“In such a structure, fire can spread easily and in a very unpredictable manner. Fire and gas can spread through cavities to hidden and difficult areas to access, placing lives at greater risk.”
“Local authorities must act now in order to ensure we do not experience a preventable fire tragedy in this country,” Deirdre Taylor said, who is Siptu’s DFB section chair.

However, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr were both invited.
It has long been tradition for the leader of Sinn Féin to attend, however, the leader of the party had always been Gerry Adams.
Speaking in Washington DC last year,McDonald toldTheJournal.ieshe was not concerned about being left out of the celebrations, adding that the White House was justified in inviting Adams.

Snubbed
“I don’t feel that I was snubbed, it is a matter for the White House who they invite as their guests,” she said at the time.
However, this year, the Sinn Féin leader has got the nod.
McDonald will travel to New York and Washington to brief political leaders with Irish- American interests, and will meet a cross-section of Congress members in the Friends of Ireland Caucus and officials in the US Administration.
McDonald will also attend the Speakers Lunch on Capitol Hill, which Trump will also attend, along with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
In addition, Mary Lou McDonald will meet with leaders of the trade union movement and other Irish American leaders.
McDonald has had a few run ins with the White House over the years. In an interview with this website last year, she recalled that she has only attended the White House on one previous occasion – the year that Adams was not allowed in.
“We waited and waited. We met everybody on the way in, I was saying, ‘Hello congressman, hello senator.’ It was nearly finished, so Gerry said, ‘For the love of God, just go.’ I said: ‘Are you sure?’ He said yes. I walked off and I had literally taken three steps away and I heard him whisper: ‘Traitor.’ I didn’t live that one down, I was the deserter, I left him to fend for himself,” she said, jokingly.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-warns-against-rolling-cliff-edge-as-leaders-meet-for-crunch-summit-4553822-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
European People's Party / TwitterEuropean People's Party / Twitter/ Twitter
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has warned against a “rolling cliff edge” situation as EU leaders meet for a crunch summit just eight days until the scheduled Brexit date of 29 March.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels Varadkar said the EU needed to cut Britain “a little bit of slack” and give consideration to their request for a short extension.
Theresa May confirmed her decision to seek a three month extension to Article 50, the mechanism by which the UK is exiting the EU, yesterday.
Some European leaders warned the date would have to be 23 May, the same date as the European elections, while others warned they would veto any extension unless the British Prime Minister presented a credible strategy at this week’s summit.
May was thrown something of a lifeline yesterday afternoon when European Council President Donald Tusk said a short extension would be possible but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the Commons.
He also said the 30 June date had its merits but created “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”.
Reports have emerged that an extension until 23 May will be given to the UK on condition that May’s draft Brexit deal is passed in the House of Commons next week.
In an address to the nation last night May said she was on the side of the public and reiterated her call for MPs to back the twice-rejected withdrawal deal.
Asked on her way into the summit today if she was prepared to lead UK out on a ‘no deal’ basis in 8 days she didn’t rule it out but reiterated that the Commons should vote to back the deal in the coming days.

A vote could take place as early as Tuesday next.
No deal
If the deal is rejected at the third time of asking, there’s still a possibility the EU could come back and offer a much longer extension in order to avoid the so-called ‘rolling cliff-edge’. This would require the UK to take part in EU elections.
May has said that’s not something she would countenance and strongly hinted she would quit if forced into a corner on the issue by the EU and parliament (we’ve gone into detail on some of the scenarios that could throw uphere).

Stage is set#Brexitpic.twitter.com/SfIlejqLtj
Speaking on his way into the summit this afternoon Varadkar said everyone needed to bear in mind that nobody wanted at no-deal exit.
“No deal can only ever be a British choice. Let’s not forget the March 29th deadline was set by the United Kingdom.”
He reiterated that the UK always had the choice if it so wished to revoke Article 50 at the last moment “and they do not need permission to do that, so no-deal will be a British choice and a British decision”.
He said that if the UK was to remain in the EU beyond this summer it would have to take part in European elections.
That message was echoed earlier by Phil Hogan, the Agriculture Commissioner and former Fine Gael minister.
“Our legal advice is there would be European elections in the UK if an extension was granted beyond 23 May,” Hogan said.

The amount that will be paid will be determined by an Independent Assessment Panel, taking into account the impact of the non-disclosure.
The scheme is designed to provide an alternative, “non-adversarial” option for women affected by the CervicalCheck issue, as the courts process can be both costly and take some time.

The scheme will be up and running in the coming weeks, the Department said.
Minister for Health Simon Harris secured government approval to proceed with the scheme, which will be “open to all women, or their next of kin, in the 221 cohort identified from the retrospective clinical audit as having discordance in their smear test result and where this finding was not disclosed in an appropriate or timely fashion”.
The government also approved the appointment of the Independent Assessment Panel, comprising a retired High Court Judge (previously announced as Mr Justice Aindrias Ó Caoimh), an independent clinician and a person of good standing
InSeptember last year, an interim recommendation of a report into the CervicalCheck non-disclosure issue by Dr Gabriel Scally said that an immediate ex-gratia payment of €2,000 to each of the women involved.
Of the 221 women originally affected by the scandal, 19 have died, including campaigners Emma Mhic Mhathúna and Orla Church.

https://www.thejournal.ie/woman-found-guilty-of-trying-to-murder-a-stranger-4524493-Mar2019/,"A 37-YEAR-OLD WOMAN has been found guilty of attempting to murder a civil servant by slashing her neck as she walked home from work in Dublin two years ago.
Laura Kenna had argued that she was legally insane at the time and had attacked Fionnuala Burke in the context of delusions about death, vampires and cannibalism.
Kenna, of no fixed abode, was charged with attempting to murder Burke on Lower Drumcondra Road in the city on 3 January 2017, and of assault causing serious harm to her on the same occasion.
She had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to both counts and went on trial at the Central Criminal Court.
The trial heard that Burke was working for the Department of Social Protection, and was walking home when she noticed a woman sitting on a wall outside a house. As Burke approached, the woman, Laura Kenna, sprang up and pushed her back onto a grassy area. Kenna didn’t say anything but started to stab her.
Burke felt the short stab wounds and could also feel her face being slashed before she felt a dramatic slash straight across her neck. Kenna then spoke, telling Burke that she’d let her go if she handed over her bag.
The jury saw photographs of the large, deep cut across Burke’s neck. It had penetrated through muscle and cut through the thyroid gland. She was operated on and treated in intensive care after the attack. She also had other injuries to her face and body.
Kenna later admitted to gardaí:
The main issue for the jury to consider was Kenna’s state of mind at the time; there was a conflict of opinion between the experts on this issue.
A consultant psychiatrist engaged by the defence testified that the accused was suffering from a mental disorder at the time, and so was entitled to the special defence of not guilty by reason of insanity.
Unemotional
Dr Stephen Monks of the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) told the jury that she was suffering from schizoaffective disorder, a chronic mental illness related to schizophrenia.
He said she had carried out the ‘frenzied and vicious’ attack on Burke with the intention of killing in the context of delusions about death, vampires and cannibalism.
She had a knife for the purpose of killing somebody, he added. He testified that she did not know the nature and quality of her actions and couldn’t stop what she was doing.
However, a consultant psychiatrist engaged by the State disagreed. Professor Harry Kennedy, also of the CMH, testified that she was not delusional at the time, but carried out the attack in anger and out of a ‘sense of entitlement’; she told gardai she’d needed money.

Prof Kennedy said her attack would not come under the definition of insanity. He said that she possessed ‘callous’ and ‘unemotional’ personality traits and had the ability to ‘fabricate for her own interests’.
She’d told him that she had followed another woman that night ‘but let her go’, something he said indicated that she knew what she was doing in selecting her victim.
Barristers for both sides delivered their closing speeches yesterday.
Barry White SC, defending, reminded the jury that both doctors had agreed that Kenna had fit the criteria for the special insanity verdict when she had attacked another woman a few weeks before this attack.
A jury, in that case, had later reached a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity on that charge.
However, he pointed out that Prof Kennedy considered her to have a mental disorder after the Drumcondra attack, but not during it, and said the professor had ‘Ms Kenna going from mad to bad to mad’.
“You heard from Dr Monks that this is highly improbable,” he said.
Anthony Sammon SC, prosecuting, reminded the jury that he had said at the outset that this would not be an easy case.
“I did not tell you that this was a retrial and that another jury had struggled with this,” he said, referring to a previous jury failing to reach a verdict, something the defence had disclosed in this trial.
“That is now known to you and it endorses the statement I made that this is a difficult case,” he said.
He noted that there was no blood test that could establish a mental condition.
“One has to go through the torturous process that has been revealed to you in this case,” he continued, referring to the doctors’ interviews with the accused and reviews of her history.
He explained that the Oireachtas had decided that 12-citizen juries would have to answer the question of insanity.
The six men and six women of the jury were told that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kenna had carried out the attack. However, the defence had to prove only on the balance of probabilities that she satisfied the special defence of not guilty by reason of insanity.
Justice Tara Burns sent them out to begin considering their verdict yesterday afternoon. They had spent a total of two hours and 23 minutes deliberating before reaching their unanimous verdict of guilty on both counts.
Justice Burns said she was extremely grateful to them for their work on what had been ‘a particularly difficult case’ and exempted from jury service for 10 years.
She adjourned sentencing until Monday 25 March for preparation of a victim impact statement. She also directed a report from Kenna’s treating doctor.

https://www.thejournal.ie/measles-outbreak-north-dublin-4523557-Mar2019/,"AN OUTBREAK OF measles has been confirmed in north Dublin, the HSE has said.
The organisation said this is a community outbreak of measles affecting both adults and children. There have been five cases since the start of February.
The HSE has advised people who think they have the condition to stay at home and to contact their general practitioner for advice.
Measles is a highly infectious illness and spreads very easily. There was another outbreak, in Donegal, earlier this year.
Seven of the 25 cases of measles reported to the HSE to date in 2019 relate to the outbreak in Donegal. Overall, 13 of the 25 cases have been confirmed, eight are possible and four are probable.
There were 77 reported cases, including 73 confirmed cases, of measles in Ireland last year, up from 25 cases in 2017. Provisional figures had previously indicated there were 86 cases, but this number was revised downwards by the HSE.
Globally, 98 countries reported more cases of measles in 2018 than the previous year. There were at least72 measles-related deathsin Europe in 2018, up from 42 in 2017, but none in Ireland.
Unicef has warned that this “alarming” global surge is “a growing threat to children“.
“This is a wake-up call. We have a safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine against a highly contagious disease – a vaccine that has saved almost a million lives every year over the last two decades,” Peter Power, UNICEF Ireland’s Executive Director, said last week.
It’s understood that all the confirmed cases to date this year relate to people who have not been vaccinated. In 2018, about seven in 10 of the confirmed cases involved people who were not vaccinated.
In a statement released today, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) said all individuals “should be aware of their measles immunity status before travel (either immune from infection or being vaccinated with the correct number of doses for their age) and seek MMR vaccination (if appropriate) to ensure protection against measles while away”.
Measles symptoms include:

The Department of Health gives the following advice in relation to the MMR vaccine:
Measures to prevent the spread of measles if you think you may have the condition:
Risk of measles from international travel:
There are ongoing outbreaks of measles in multiple countries in Europe and worldwide. Most of the cases in the EU in 2018 were reported from Romania, France, Greece and Italy.
Most people who get measles on holiday do not know they were exposed until they develop disease, the HSE said. Unrecognised exposures to measles have occurred at airports, on planes, at concerts, in shops and in healthcare settings.
Advice for people travelling abroad:
Vaccination remains the most effective measure against infection. Children aged six-11 months who are travelling to other countries and regions where measles outbreaks have been reported are recommended to get the MMR vaccine.
A dose given before 12 months of age does not replace the dose that would normally be given at 12 months of age, the HSE advised.
Older children should be age-appropriately vaccinated. Children who have missed their recommended doses should get the MMR vaccine from their GP.
Adults may be at risk of measles, particularly those under 40 years of age who have never had measles or two doses of a measles vaccine.
Complications of measles:
Measles can cause chest infections, fits (seizures), ear infections, swelling of the brain and/or damage to the brain.
Measles is a notifiable disease and GPs and hospital clinicians should immediately notify public health authorities if they suspect someone has measles.","5.56pm, 4 Mar 2019",

THE GOVERNMENT SPENT more than €260,000 to send Ministers abroad on trade missions for St Patrick’s Day in 2018, figures seen byTheJournal.iereveal.
The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show that at least €267,000 was spent on trips abroad as part of the ‘Promote Ireland’ programme last year.
Members of the Cabinet and almost 50 civil servants visited more than 40 countries in an effort to promote Ireland’s political and economic interests abroad.
Those who travelled included the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers and Ministers of State, as well as the Chief Whip, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and the Attorney General.
More than €190,000 was spent on flights, with tens of thousands also spent on hotel accommodation and thousands more on gifts for dignitaries – including €350 on a customary bowl of shamrock for the US President.
While the entire cost was more than Ministerial visitsin previous years, particularly those made when Enda Kenny was Taoiseach, it pales in comparison to trips taken at the height of the Celtic Tiger.
Information previously supplied toRTÉ, showed that in 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern’s government spent €560,000 when they travelled abroad for St Patrick’s Day.
The annual visits last year were part of ‘Ireland Connected’,a Government trade strategy billed as a “comprehensive, strategic approach to high-level visits and trade missions”.
Ahead of last year’s trips, the Government announced that it was hoping to express its position on Brexit and Northern Ireland during the visits, as well as to campaign for membership of the UN Security Council from 2021 to 2022.
Only Minister for Health Simon Harris, whocancelled his tripto deal with hospital overcrowding, and Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who promoted Ireland at home, did not travel.
As part of an audit of last year’s programme,TheJournal.ieasked each Department, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Attorney General about the costs associated with each visit.
The request asked how much was spent on travel, accommodation and other expenses for each member of Government who travelled, as well as for any officials who travelled with them, and the amount each Department or office spent on gifts.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar
As tradition dictates, the Taoiseach had the most high-profile trip abroad last year (one whichdidn’t pass without controversy), visiting the US to spend St Patrick’s Day with US President Donald Trump in the White House.
The total cost of the trip for Varadkar and eight officials, who included Chief of Staff Brian Murphy, Secretary General Martin Fraser, Government Press Secretary Nick Miller and security for the Taoiseach, came to more than€54,000.
Transatlantic and internal flights for each member of the delegation cost a total of€32,281, with Varadkar and Murphy travelling to and from Ireland in business class for€5,808each.
Five nights’ accommodation for seven members of the delegation cost€8,672, with accommodation for the Taoiseach’s security totalling an additional€916for four nights.

Meanwhile, the Tánaiste was sent much further afield on a 19,000km round trip to China and Hong Kong, with three officials from the Department accompanying him at a total cost of€27,522.

That included a trip in business class for the Minister and two of his officials from Manchester to Hong Kong, and in the opposite direction from Beijing to Dublin via Amsterdam.
A third official travelled from Ireland to Hong Kong and back via Beijing and Istanbul for less than half that price at€2,546, while a further€957was spent on internal flights for the delegation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-brexit-delay-talks-4554993-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL has agreed to delay the date by which the UK leaves the European Union by almost two months if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the UK parliament next week.
If the agreement is not passed by the House of Commons the new deadline will be 12 April and Britain will be expected to indicate a way forward to the European Council before that date.
At that point the UK will face the choice of participating in the European Parliament elections at the end of May or else exiting the EU without a deal.
Following lengthy discussions in Brussels the 22 May deadline was unanimously agreed upon by the 27 leaders of the European Union’s member states as a number of possible rumoured deadlines circulated ahead of, and during, the meeting today.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May had sought an extension until the end of June.
The UK had been legally obliged to leave the European Union on 29 March (next Friday), two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May, which sets the Brexit process in motion.
Speaking at a press conference after the agreement was announced the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU is ready for all outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit.

Juncker says they've tried everything to get this deal over the finishing line.pic.twitter.com/P6KJ5f5tdt
In the conference the President of the European Council Donald Tusk said the UK now has four options: a deal, no deal, a long delay or revoking article 50.

He said:
He added that the meeting has left him more optimistic about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.
Theresa May refused to select her favourite of Tusk’s four options when asked about it in her own press conference, however she reiterated that she will not countenance revoking article 50.
The British leader welcomed the EU’s decision to delay Brexit and said the British parliament now has clear choices about what to do next.
“I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision,” she said.
It had been argued that there would be legal implications of granting an extension to article 50 beyond the European elections.
Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan had said previously that the EU’s legal advice is “there would be European elections in the UK if an extension was granted beyond 23 May”.
The draft Withdrawal Agreement next week has already been rejected twice before – first by an historic majority of 230 votes, and then by a majority of 149 votes.
It’s expected that a third ‘meaningful vote’ will be held next Monday or Tuesday. If the deal is rejected for a third time, it’s not clear what would happen next.
French President Emmanuel Macron was among those who said that a vote against Theresa May’s deal would lead to a no-deal Brexit.

Migrants living in direct provision centres in Mosney, Co Meath and Clondalkin Towers, Co Dublin have been signed up to vote following a recent registration drive.
“You’re dealing with communities that are incredibly isolated, communities with little recourse,” Sean McCabe, a candidate for Cabra/Glasnevin in the upcoming local elections, has said.
Over three days in Mosney and Clondalkin, McCabe and a number of residents of the centre went door-to-door, he says, registering people to vote.

“We did our very best to reach people who weren’t in at the time,” McCabe has said. “It was met with great support.”
“Sometime we can take our own democracy for granted. There’s a democratic deficit in some of the countries people are coming from.”
Non-EU citizens can only vote in local elections in Ireland. EU citizens can register in both the locals and European elections, both of which will be held on 24 May.
Similar registration drives have taken place in Cork recently.
Stephen Murphy, a social inclusion worker at Cork Council Centre, says that over 300 people have registered to vote since registration drives were launched.
For many people, there was a lack of awareness of their eligibility to vote. “Not only people coming to Ireland but also their Irish colleagues,” Murphy has said.

As part of the Shape Your City campaign, developed by local businesses and communities, Murphy has spearheaded 15 events to register people to vote. The only requirement is that people have resided in Ireland for six months.
McCabe has said that the reaction to registration drives in Mosney and Clondalkin was largely positive, that it has raised awareness of those eligible to vote in the upcoming elections.
“If you have all the local candidates and councillors canvassing Mosney and Clondalkin, then you have something transformational.”

The town has been selected by the Department of Justice as one of a number of towns to run a pilot community sponsorship programme to welcome and help to integrate refugees into Ireland.
The meeting was held to provide locals with information about the town’s participation in the programme.
It was attended by Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and Integration David Stanton, as well as an official and two refugees who have already participated in the programme in other towns.
However, speakers were interrupted on a number of occasions by protesters, who shouted concerns about the background of the refugees arriving in Ireland.
One individual repeatedly asked the Department of Justice to confirm or deny whether any members of the Islamic State group were living in Direct Provision centres in Ireland.
Another demanded to know why the government did not seek to provide asylum for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman from Pakistan who was sentenced to death for blasphemy in 2010.
However, Lynne Glasscoe of the Lismore Welcome Project toldTheJournal.iethat the protesters were a minority group who attempted to “overwhelm” the meeting.
“There were some people who were there who may have come from Dublin and Waterford,” she said.

“They were scattered throughout the hall and they were obviously well-organised to actually make their presence felt.
“It was a concerted campaign, but I don’t think that they achieved whatever their aims were. I didn’t really think that we were going to be of sufficient interest for people to come down from Dublin or from Waterford.”
Glasscoe also said that “the majority of people” gave the speakers a standing ovation at the end of the meeting to show their support for the project.
She added that locals were not prepared to be “railroaded by negative persons” attempting to sabotage the meeting, and said everyone would remain welcome at future meetings “as long as they weren’t outrageous”.
Independent Minister and Waterford TD John Halligan said the people of Lismore had made it clear that they were not interested in the views being expressed.
“It is important to note that those who protested at the meeting are not from Lismore, they travelled to the town to cause hassle and attempt to turn what was such a positive community programme into a negative situation,” he said.
“It is shameful that this group of xenophobes thought they had a right to cause such disruption.
“However it is a fantastic reflection on the people of Lismore that, instead of listening to the negativity in the room, they instead gave standing ovations to the members of the Lismore Welcome Project panel.”
In a statement today, Minister Stanton has said that he “welcomes the initiative by the people of Lismore to welcome a Syrian family to their community through Community Sponsorship and was pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the community last night”.
“The clear message from the vast majority of those present was one of solidarity with those fleeing conflict,” Stanton has said.
“This solidarity is in evidence in communities right across Ireland and the Department will be working in the coming months to support other communities who wish, in a very personal and very positive way, to offer solidarity to families fleeing conflict through the Community Sponsorship mode”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bollard-blanchardstown-shopping-centre-4540637-Mar2019/,"A SEVEN-YEAR-old boy, who lacerated his left eyebrow when he collided with a bollard while walking with his mum at Blanchardstown Shopping Centre, has been awarded €20,000 damages in the Circuit Civil Court.
Barrister Grainne Berkery, counsel for Conor Askin, who is now aged 13, said the boy’s claim was based on the inadequacy of lighting at a taxi rank on the south side of the centre where the bollard was situated alongside a footpath.
Conor, who lives at Ravenwood Crescent, Clonee, Dublin 15, sued Green Property Investment Fund, Fitzwilliam Square West, Dublin, owners of the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre, through his mother Tracie Askin.
Askin told Circuit Court President Justice Raymond Groarke that she and her two young sons were walking along the footpath on the night of 20 November 2012, when Conor caught the top side of a bollard with his left eyebrow.
Berkery, who appeared with Mason Hayes and Curran Solicitors, said he had been taken to the emergency department of Temple Street Children’s’ Hospital where a laceration to his eyebrow had been closed with medical glue and paper stitches.

She said he had been left with an almost inch long scar which, fortunately remained partly hidden by his eyebrow.
Awarding Conor damages of €20,000, Judge Groarke said the court had to decide if reasonable care had been taken by the defendant to make sure that all people using the footpath were alerted to the fact that there was a bollard actually constructed in the footpath which was something for users of the path to see and avoid.
He asked was there adequate lighting at the location and adequate warning given of the bollard or was this an accident waiting to happen albeit many years after the shopping centre opened.
“Firstly there was an edge to the bollard and a child coming in contact with it was likely to sustain an injury,” Judge Groarke said. “Children are more entitled to the protection of the law than anybody else and the presence of an edge was an accident waiting to happen in itself.”
He said the nub of the case was whether there was adequate lighting to alert a child, who may or may not have been paying a degree of attention, to the presence of the bollard.
The court was of the view that adequate care had not been taken to alert users of the footpath to its presence and, given Clonor’s age, he did not find there was any contributory negligence on his part.
The court heard that the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre, which catered for 1.2 million shoppers a month, had been opened in 1996 and the bollard had been in place since then. Up until the 2012 accident well over 200 million had used the centre without incident regarding bollards that had been put in place to stop motorists parking on footpaths..","8.31pm, 13 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-checks-northern-ireland-border-4538597-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Mar 2019
THE UK GOVERNMENT has announced that there will be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
No import tariffs will apply to such goods in the immediate aftermath of a 29 March exit.
A statementreleased this morningsaid the “unique social, political and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland must be reflected in any arrangements that apply in a no deal scenario”.
“This government is committed to the Belfast Agreement and to do everything in our power to ensure no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
“Today we are confirming a strictly unilateral, temporary approach to checks, processes and tariffs in Northern Ireland. This would apply if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March.
“The UK government would not introduce any new checks or controls on goods at the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, including no customs requirements for nearly all goods.
“The UK temporary import tariff announced today would therefore not apply to goods crossing from Ireland into Northern Ireland.
The measures, the statement said, “do not set out the position in respect of tariffs or processes to be applied to goods moving from Northern Ireland to Ireland”.
In order to protect biosecurity on the island of Ireland, the statement said, border inspection posts would be needed to inspect animals and animal products from countries outside the EU entering the North.

Tariffs for the rest of the UK
While there will be no tariffs imposed by the UK on goods moving across the land border into Northern Ireland, tariffs will also not be applied to around 87% – up from 80% at present – of imports in a no-deal Brexit to the rest of the UK under a temporary scheme.
The tariffs on various goods where they will be applied are presented by the UK government as a percentage of the “most favoured nation” (MFN) – this is the tariff imposed by the EU on imports from countries that they do not have a free trade agreement with.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will become one of these countries. Currently, no tariffs are paid on the import of goods from Ireland into mainland UK, for example, but that would change in a no-deal.
Tariffs will apply to goods such as beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products. This will help to “support farmers and producers who have historically been protected through high EU tariffs”,the Guardian reported.
In the case of beef, for example, the tariff imposed will be 53% of this MFN. The tariff applied to butter will be 32% of the EU MFN, poultry meat will be 60% and lamb will be the full existing EU MFN tariff rate.
Other products that will remain subject to tariffs are finished vehicles, certain ceramics, fertilisers and fuel, and bananas, raw cane sugar and certain kinds of fish.
“If we leave without a deal, we will set the majority of our import tariffs to zero, whilst maintaining tariffs for the most sensitive industries,” UK Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said.
Irish Farmers’ Association president Joe Healy said that the beef industry, in particular, “will not survive the kind of tariffs being talked about”, given how much is exported from Ireland to mainland UK.
“We export over 50% of our beef to the UK.  If this is subject to tariffs, it will be a ‘direct hit’ of almost €800m on the sector,” he said.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee agreed a no-deal would be disastrous for Irish farmers.

She said that it was up to the UK now to ensure that it had solutions in place to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
“We have always said we would need to have very difficult conversations,” she said. “We need to have those now. We need to avoid getting to the point where there would be any imposition of tariffs.
No deal vote
The announcement comes as MPs prepare to vote later today on whether the country should leave the EU without a deal in just over two weeks. The House of Commons overwhelmingly rejecting a draft divorce agreement last night.
Last night’s votecame in the wakeof last-minute measures announced on Monday night by British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Speaking immediately after the vote, May told MPs that the government would now hold a debate and vote today on whether the UK should leave without a deal.
If a no-deal option is voted down tonight, the government is planning another Commons vote tomorrow on whether or not they want an extension to Article 50. That will only happen in the event that today’s vote shows support for a deal.
However, May last night warned that “voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/facebook-passwords-data-breach-4554641-Mar2019/,"FACEBOOK HAS ADMITTED that millions of passwords were stored in plain text on its internal servers – a security slip that left them readable by the company’s employees.
The social media giant has, however, said there is no evidence that employees had abused access to the data.
The passwords were stored on internal company servers and no outsiders could access them, Facebook said.
“To be clear, these passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,” vice president of engineering, security, and privacy Pedro Canahuati said in a blog post.
The blunder was discovered during a routine security review earlier this year, he said.
Canahuati has said the issues have been fixed.

As a precaution, Facebook will notify everyone whose password was found stored in this way.
“We estimate that we will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users and tens of thousands of Instagram users,” Canahuati said.
Facebook has reminded users of some steps they can take to keep their account secure:
This incident comes following an array of controversies centred on whether Facebook properly safeguards the privacy and data of its users.
In April, Facebook revealed it believed that up to 87 million people’s data was improperly shared with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica.
Last September, the social media giant said that up to 50 million accounts were breached in a security flaw exploited by hackers.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jastine-valdez-inquest-death-4541843-Mar2019/,"THE FAMILY OF murdered student Jastine Valdez will hear details of events leading up to her death at an inquest later this year.
Her parents Tess and Danny Valdez were present as a date for the hearing was scheduled at Dublin Coroner’s Court.
The 24-year-old student was abducted in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow on Saturday 19 May 2018.
Inspector Frank Keenaghan of Bray Garda Station applied to Deputy Coroner Dr Crona Gallagher for a date for hearing for the inquest.
A previous inquest hearing heard Valdez died of asphyxia.
She had taken the 5.40pm bus from Bray to Enniskerry and arrived in Enniskerry village around 6pm on the date of her death.

She was abducted in broad daylight on a busy road at 6.20pm. A witness who saw her being forced into the boot of a Nissan Qashqai rang 999.
Her body was discovered shortly before 3pm on Monday 21 May 2018 in dense woodland at Rathmichael, south Dublin.
Previously, the hearing heard that Danny and Tess Valdez travelled to the city morgue on 22 May to identify their daughter’s remains. A statement from Danny Valdez was read out in court.
He said he travelled to Dublin City Morgue with Garda Patrick Mackey of Bray Garda Station.
“There I saw my daughter Jastine and I identified her as my daughter,” Danny Valdez said in his statement.
The formal identification took place in a viewing room at 6.10pm.
A post-mortem conducted by Deputy State Pathologist Dr Linda Mulligan gave the cause of death as asphyxia.
Deputy Coroner Dr Crona Gallagher adjourned the inquest for a full hearing to take place on Monday 4 November 2019.

It is tradition during the St Patrick’s Day trip to Washington DC for the Taoiseach to have breakfast with the vice president.
Generally, this is done the morning before the Taoiseach meets the US President in the Oval Office. This week both events will take place on Thursday.
Last year, breaking with the traditionof allowing the media access to the conversation, the press were left on the lawn of the vice president’s home.
At the time the Taoiseach said it was the US administration that made the decision to have the meeting in private.
Prior to the meeting, Varadkar repeatedly said he would talk with Pence about social issues, including LGBT rights.
LGBT rights
Varadkar toldTheJournal.ielast year that he would raise the issue of conversion therapy and LGBT rights with Pence.
The Taoiseach said he would raise the “wider issue” of LGBT rights with Pence, if he had the opportunity.
“I am told Vice President Pence is not a supporter of conversion therapy even though some people have mentioned he is. But I imagine I will have the opportunity, I am going to be meeting him over breakfast on Friday morning, so if I have the opportunity I will certainly be mentioning the wider issue of equal rights and freedoms for LGBT citizens,” Varadkar said last March.
Advertisement
The US vice president describes himself as a “Christian, a conservative and a Republican” and has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT issues.
After last year’s private meeting, Varadkar said that he had privately spoken to the Pence family about LGBT rights.
“I did privately get to speak to them about equality bout my support for equal rights for women and the LGBT community in America and Ireland,” Varadkar said.
Pence also told Varadkar last year that the Taoiseach’s partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome in Pence’s home if he decides to attend this year’s St Patrick’s Day visit to the US.
It is not yet confirmed if Barrett will be attending this year’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations in Washington DC.
Brexit
Yesterday, the Taoiseach wasforced to delay his travel plansafter moves were afoot with Brexit. However, after a press conference this morning, ahead of the Brexit vote in Westminster, the Taoiseach travelled to the States, touching down in the US just a few hours ago.
The plane was not WiFi enabled so Varadkar was left in the dark as the vote result came in. He is yet to comment on the result, though he is expected to speak to the Irish media in Washington DC tomorrow.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTE this evening that the focus now has to be on London because that is “where the crisis is and that is where the solutions need to come from”.
TheJournal.ie’s Political Correspondent Christina Finn will be bringing you all the latest updates from Leo Varadkar’s visit to Washington DC this week, including his meeting with US President Donald Trump on Thursday.

A NURSE WHO gave CPR to a bus driver who’d fallen unconscious while driving in Dublin city centre this week has said that she cried when she saw the driver safe and well in hospital two days later.
Aoife McGivney described the incident when speaking to Ryan Tubridy on last night’s Late Late Show on RTÉ One.
The Mater Hospital nurse had been on board the 16 bus when the driver fell unconscious and the vehicle went through a red light on Dublin’s O’Connell Street.

“We kept rolling through the red light, and we ended up going over a bicycle,” she said. “I jumped into action… I said we need to stop this bus.”
The bus had knocked a cyclist off his bicycle but he managed to jump out of the way before the bus drove over it. He suffered only minor injuries.
Passengers were able to get the driver’s foot off the accelerator, and McGivney sought help in removing him from the bus and lying him on the ground.
She said: “I started CPR. We did compressions, you know the usual, the AED, call 999.”
The nurse also described meeting the driver, Martin, since Monday’s incident.
“He’s great. I went into the hospital on Wednesday. I wanted to give him space,” she said. “I met him and well… I cried. I bawled… I’d seen him go through this trauma. It’s very different when you see someone and you’re trying to help them so much.
McGivney then received a warm ovation from the audience on the show at the close of the interview.

https://www.the42.ie/stuart-lancaster-leinster-3-4548878-Mar2019/,"STUART LANCASTER SAYS he was firm in his mind when making a decision over his future after signing a new contract to remain as Leinster senior coach for the next two seasons.
Both Lancaster and head coach Leo Cullen re-signed with the defending European and Pro14 champions last week in a major boost for Leinster as they bid to build on their recent success.

While the duration of Lancaster’s new deal was not disclosed, the 49-year-old confirmed he has agreed terms to remain at the club until 2021, in what is an excellent piece of business by Leinster.
Lancaster had been heavily linked with a role on Andy Farrell’s Ireland coaching team after the World Cup, but made the ‘easy decision’ to stay with Leinster after rehabilitating his own career in Dublin and helping the province to a fourth Champions Cup crown in 2018.
The former England head coach’s stock has risen immeasurably during his three years at Leinster, and speaking toThe42this afternoon, Lancaster explained that his hands-on role and day-to-day responsibility within Cullen’s coaching ticket was a significant factor in him committing his future to the province.
“It was pretty easy, really,” he toldThe42. “I think I’ve said from the outset that I’ve been very lucky to have the opportunity to come to such a top club after coaching England.
“I’ve got the remit to look after attack and defence, coaching on a day-to-day basis so from a coaching point of view, it’s a brilliant environment to be in.
“The big consideration for all these things are your family as much as anything else. It has worked well, the commute has been a challenge but it’s doable. My wife and kids are happy in that they can come across whenever they want and I can go home and see them.

“It was quite an easy decision to make and obviously with Leo staying as well, it means that we can continue to work together and build on what we’ve achieved so far.”
On the speculation linking him with a move back into international rugby with Ireland, Lancaster explained: ”I speak to Andy all the time. I spoke to him during the Six Nations and we will catch up soon. But for me, the priority is to be a great club coach.
“I was firm in my mind that I wanted to stay here. I mean obviously, Andy has got the challenge now of building his own coaching team. I’m sure he’ll build it over the course of the next four to six months.
“The reality is he needs it in place for January 2020. I’m sure he’ll do that but I’ve said consistently, I enjoy the day-to-day stuff here. I enjoy club coaching and I’m very lucky to be at a great club.”

With his signature very much in demand elsewhere, retaining the services of Lancaster is a massive coup for Leinster and CEO Mick Dawson heading into the next two seasons.
Working in tandem, Cullen and Lancaster have formed an excellent relationship, guiding Leinster back to the summit of European rugby while claiming a first-ever double last season.
After his reign in charge of England ended in disastrous circumstances following the 2015 World Cup, Lancaster has rebuilt his reputation in Dublin and has been consistently linked with vacancies back in the English Premiership.
That he has ignored interest from home to remain in position at Leinster is a major endorsement for the structures in place at the club and the long-term vision Lancaster has for the province.
“To keep developing the team and the group to play consistently well,” Lancaster says of his hopes for the next two seasons. “That’s the ultimate goal as a coach. You want to build great teams, you want to help individuals achieve success.
“We want to fight on two fronts every year, both in Europe and in the Pro14, and in the fortunate position this year where we are able to do that. We’ve played well in the league and had a lot of games this season without the players who play for Ireland, and the team have still delivered in the Pro14.

By the time Lancaster’s new deal runs out in 2021, he will have been at Leinster for five seasons.
He added: “When I first arrived I could see the potential from before I arrived. I saw more than enough in the team to believe success could be built.
“When you’re doing the maths, in another couple of years, five years is quite a long time actually. I coached England for four years and in my mind, I wanted to do it for eight, but it didn’t happen that way.
“Five years, when you look back, it feels like a long time but in coaching terms, I still feel there’s an awful lot we can still do to improve.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-mike-pence-speech-4547072-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reporting from Chicago
THE TAOISEACH has said he wasn’t nervous ahead of giving his speech at the US Vice President’s house this week, stating that he wanted to be “respectful” while also expressing “Ireland’s values”.
Headlines in the international press were dominated by the Leo Varadkar’s breakfast meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, with chat show host Ellen Degeneres alsoexpressing her joyat the Taoiseach taking his boyfriend to meet Pence.
Pence, who has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT rights, told Varadkar last year that his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome at his official residence at this year’s St Patrick’s breakfast.
Speaking at the event – which was open to press, in a departure from last year – the Taoiseach gave remarks noting that in modern day Ireland politicians were judged not by their sexual orientation, “skin tone, gender or religious beliefs” but by their actions.
Nerves
When asked by reporters today if he was nervous ahead of giving the speech, the Taoiseach said no.
“No I wouldn’t say I was nervous but I gave consideration about what I was going to say and how I was going to say it. Ultimately Matthew and I were guests at his home so I wanted to make sure what I had to say was respectful. And I hope it came across that way.

“But at the same time expressing what are now Ireland’s values, that everyone is equal before the law regardless of their religion, or lack thereof, their gender, the colour of their skin, or who they love,” said Varadkar.
When asked how did Matt feel about being there, the Taoiseach laughed, stating:
But the Taoiseach said when he and Barrett got the invitation from the Pences “it was different”.
Matt wanted to accept the invite
“He felt that it was an invitation that he wanted to accept. I hope as well that they take up our invitation to come to Ireland. They’re a family with a really genuine Irish connection to Co Sligo and to Co Clare.
“And I think as we found during the various referendum campaigns in Ireland and the progress that we’ve made on women’s rights in particular that what helped to change Ireland was personal stories, people understanding the personal and human stories that are behind these issues,” he said, adding:
The Taoiseach said yesterday that Pence and Varadkar had not discussed the speech beforehand.
“We didn’t really discuss the speech but we had a good chat afterwards on different issues and I had the chance to meet him again in the White House.
“I met his brother who was recently elected to congress and his sister too.
“They are very nice people and certainly have made me feel welcome when I have been in DC. Obviously we have very different views on social policy but I think the best way to manage these things is to engage with people rather than boycotting them and that’s what I intend to do.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/kerry-babies-joanne-hayes-4526167-Mar2019/,"THE WOMAN WHO was wrongly accused of murdering a baby in Kerry in the 1980s has filed High Court action against the State, a year after she received an apology from the Taoiseach over her treatment in the case.
Joanne Hayes is set to sue over being wrongfully arrested and subsequently charged with the murder of ‘Baby John’, whose body was discovered on a beach near Cahirciveen in Kerry.
After receiving apologies from the State last year, she has yet to receive compensation and this week filed High Court action against a number of parties, including the gardaí and the State.
The investigation into the 1984 death and subsequent Tribunal into the child’s death centred on Hayes, as she faced accusations that she was the baby’s mother and had killed him.
The case gained notoriety in the media, with Hayes gaining sizeable public support with critical commentary on how she was treated by authorities.
A garda review of the DNA evidence just last year proved that Hayes was not the mother of the child, and she has since been exonerated.
In January last year, both the gardaí and the government apologised to Joanne Hayes.
Acting Garda Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin wrote to Hayes to formally apologise to her on behalf of An Garda Síochána.
Speaking at a press conference to coincide with this in Kerry, Superintendent Flor Murphy said: “It is a matter of significant regret for An Garda Síochána that it has taken such a long time for it to be confirmed that Ms Hayes is not the mother of Baby John,” he said.

Leo Varadkar said that Joanne Hayes had been treated very badly by the Irish State.
He said: “I absolutely want to reiterate the apology to Joanne Hayes made by the gardaí yesterday and do so on behalf of the Irish State.”
This was echoed by Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan. He said: “Joanne Hayes was subject to a prolonged ordeal that was simply wrong on every level. This was unacceptable even at the time and as Minister for Justice and Equality, and on behalf of the State, I am deeply sorry that this happened.”
Following these apologies, the issue of compensation that would be offered to Hayes came to the fore, with Tánaiste Simon Coveney telling the Dáil he was not at liberty to speak about compensation for Hayes but said that it is something he is sure the Government will want to act quickly on.
Last month, the Irish Daily Mail reported that an agreement had not yet been reached with Hayes regarding compensation from the State.
In separate filings, her siblings Michael, Kathleen and Edmund have also issued proceedings against the same parties as Joanne – An Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecution, the Department of Justice, the Attorney General and the Irish State.
TheJournal.iehas contacted the parties involved for comment in relation to this matter.
An Garda Síochána said it had no comment to make.
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said: “Ms Hayes has asked for her privacy to be protected and we have sought at all times to respect her wishes, while endeavouring to reach a settlement with her and others in this complex case.
“Correspondence was received from the solicitors from the Hayes family in recent days, which is currently under consideration.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-ireland-2-4503134-Mar2019/,"Almost 6,300 people live in 38 Direct Provision centres across Ireland.
Some 730 individuals have been granted protection status or permission to remain in Ireland, including 206 refugees.
The DP system was established in 2000 to house asylum seekers entering the country. It was originally intended to be a temporary measure where people would be housed for a six-month period while their asylum application was processed.
Close to 450 people have been living in DP centres for over five years as they await a decision on their status or subsequent appeals.
In recent weeks,TheJournal.iehas been highlighting people’s experiences ofliving in DP.
Here, we speak to women who live in the centres in Clondalkin and Mosney about why they are seeking asylum in Ireland and the impact of raising a family in an institutionalised setting.
File photoShutterstock / Motortion FilmsShutterstock / Motortion Films / Motortion Films
Raising children presents many challenges. Raising children in a Direct Provision centre presents many more.
Families in the centres generally share the same room meaning there is little to no privacy, meals are provided at set times and they often cannot cook, and conditions can be cramped and difficult.
Anita* and her husband William* are raising their three children in the DP centre in Clondalkin Towers, west Dublin. They have two teenage children, a boy and a girl, and a younger daughter.
The family have been living in Ireland for just over three years. They fled South Africa due to violence and intimidation. Anita said the family home was burned down and both William and their son Thomas* were attacked by gangs. She said the family was targeted because William is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
“The reason I came to Ireland is because I am in an interracial marriage. There is a lot of xenophobia in South Africa.
“My family was in danger. The main thing that really pushed us out of South Africa was my son was attacked and that was the final straw, My children, although they were born in South Africa and I am a South African, they are not classified as South African – not by government, but by the community – because William is not from South Africa.
Thomas was just 11 years old when he was attacked by a group of males in 2015. He was hospitalised with his injuries. The family decided to leave South Africa and Anita said they chose Ireland as they didn’t need visas to travel here.
“We paid somebody who brought us over here. Ireland was open to South Africans, we didn’t need visas to come here.
“If you flee because of any type of persecution or being endangered you don’t have time to wait for visas so you just have to go wherever is available. We paid about 80,000 rand (about €5,000). We sold quite a bit of our stuff to make it possible,” Anita said.
Broken jaw
The family moved to Clondalkin last October, having previously lived in DP accommodation in Mosney and, for a longer period, Athlone.
Anita said the family had settled relatively well in Athlone, where they and other asylum seekers lived in mobile homes.
However, the situation deteriorated last year when Thomas was attacked. Anita said another boy punched him, breaking his jaw in two places. A few months later Thomas was attacked again, this time by a group. Anita believes both attacks were racially motivated.
“His life was actually then in danger in Athlone. They told him, in so many words, if he says who did it, they will deal with him. Four or five months after his operation, they did it again and that is what brought us here.
Anita said she contacted the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) and management at the DP centre in Athlone, requesting a transfer to another centre.
File photoShutterstock / Motortion FilmsShutterstock / Motortion Films / Motortion Films
“It wasn’t safe for him to stay there because he wasn’t free to walk around the way he wanted. It’s already stressful staying in Direct Provision and then to be housebound like that … He was out of school for two months because they put a plate in his jaw and then he had metal braces.”
Anita said the attacks had a big impact on Thomas and changed his behaviour.
A local youth club has arranged for Thomas to take part in counselling once a week. “It’s helping him, I can see a difference in him,” Anita told us.
She said Thomas is busy studying for his Junior Certificate and doing better overall but “doesn’t go out that much, the only place he goes to is school”.
FGM and violence

Sandra* is raising a teenage daughter in the DP centre in Mosney, Co Meath.
She fled eastern Africa due to physical and sexual violence she experienced at the hands of two former partners. She said her daughter’s father was extremely violent and a supporter of female genital mutilation (FGM), the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons.
She said her husband’s family arranged for their first daughter to undergo FGM on the day she was born. There were complications and the baby girl died later that day.
“His family said, ‘We have to do ritual, otherwise the two of you may die’ … I didn’t realise what was happening.
“They brought the baby away and when she came back she cried and cried and cried. I was suspicious and asked what they did to her but they wouldn’t say.”
Sandra said her baby later “started gasping for air”.
“I didn’t even get to go to the burial, I don’t know what they did with her. It was a horrific experience, the worst moment of my life.”

Sandra wanted to leave her partner but he was violent and, shortly after the birth, she said he began raping her.
“He was so violent, so cruel towards to me … it was through the continuous rapes I conceived [my second child].”
Sandra was working on a farm in a bid to save enough money to escape. She gave birth to another daughter. Her husband said the baby would not be circumcised until her first birthday. He also wanted Sandra to be circumcised and told her this would happen on the same date.
Sandra said she was terrified and fled in the middle of the night. She said her former partner tried to find her and the baby, but family and friends refused to tell him where they were.
Sandra later became involved in another relationship that over time also turned violent. She said her new partner hid her and her daughter’s passports so she wouldn’t be able to leave. Sandra said she eventually found the passports and gave them to a friend for safe keeping.
Sandra said her partner threatened to burn the house down, with her and her daughter inside. She said he left the house and her daughter used a kitchen knife to untie her.
They fled to a local church, which arranged a safe place for them to stay. She said a woman from the church, who was aware of her situation, arranged for her and her daughter to go to Ireland.
They have been living here since 2016 and their asylum application is ongoing.
Sandra is worried about the impact these experiences have had on her daughter but said she has tried to protect her as much as possible. She said her daughter has settled in well and “loves school”, adding: “She feels safe and secure here.”
“She had made a lot of friends and is really settling in well. Some friends have been to the centre, but she doesn’t want to tell all of them she lives here.”
Sandra said her daughter’s teachers have been giving her extra help so she can keep up with her classmates, adding she is “very grateful to the school”.
If granted permission to stay in Ireland, Sandra said she wants to get a job and settle here permanently.
Rape crisis centre
Sandra goes to regular counselling sessions at a local rape crisis centre, something she said is helping her process what she has been through, telling us: “It has really helped me to open up, to be free.”
Noeline Blackwell, CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, said such centres are often used by asylum seekers but they don’t keep statistics on how many access their services or call their 24-hour helpline (1800 77 8888).
“We are glad to be able to work with some of them but we worry that there are others, refugees and vulnerable migrants, who may not [access services],” Blackwell told us.
She stated that, in addition to counselling, the organisation’s training team “regularly run courses for frontline workers who work with refugees and asylum seekers, to help them to deal sensitively with those who are traumatised by sexual and other gender based violence – when we can access funding to do so”.
“We are also exploring how we can better tailor our services to give such vulnerable migrants more access. We certainly recognise the need.”
Rental market
Emily* and her young daughter live at the Clondalkin DP centre. They too have been granted leave-to-remain status for three years.
Emily said she left southern African over three years ago for safety reasons. Her daughter was born in Ireland. She said raising a child in a DP centre, where residents are from many different backgrounds,  is “very difficult”.
“You can raise the child with your own rules as a mother, but the other kids who are around – depending on how they are raised – influence them.

“You find it’s very difficult sometimes to control your own child in the way you want to, the way you want them to grow up. Unlike when you are in your own house, you know your rules and can apply them.”
During the week, it was announced that Clondalkin Towers is set to remain open for at least another two years.
Prior to this development, there had been calls for the planned closure of the centre to be postponed on humanitarian grounds as residents such as Emily and her daughterstruggled to findalternative accommodation, as reported byTheJournal.ie.
There were 235 people, including 78 children, living in the centre as of last month. About 70 residents already have protected or leave-to-remain status and face having to find private rented accommodation; this figure includes 19 refugees.
Emily told us it has been very difficult to find somewhere else to live due to the rental situation in Dublin.
“Truly speaking, I don’t even know [what will happen]. You think, ‘Oh I’ve got my papers, this is what I’m going to do’, but it’s not like that, it’s not as easy as that. You encounter so many difficulties,” she said.
Impact on mental health
Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre, has consistently highlighted the negative impact living in DP can have on a person’s wellbeing.
A spokesperson said a “significant factor” is “the length of time people wait for asylum applications to be decided, without knowing how long they will be waiting”. They said “living years on end in this limbo” can have “an overwhelming impact on people’s mental health”.
Nasc is among the organisations to call on the government to implement a vulnerability assessment “that will help determine people’s needs in terms of their accommodation and the other services they will need to be able to access to ensure they are getting the supports they need”.
A hallway in the Clondalkin DP centre.
“If people who would be deemed to be vulnerable – for example people experiencing trauma as a result of torture or sexual violence; people who are LGBT; people who are trafficked – are not being supported appropriately in Direct Provision, that is because they are not being assessed for those vulnerabilities and assigned accommodation that suits those identified vulnerabilities,” the spokesperson said.
A vulnerability assessment is a statutory obligation of opting into the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive, which was transposed into Irish legislation last June. However, it is yet to be introduced here.
The Nasc spokesperson said vulnerable adults and children who may be experiencing trauma or mental health issues are “not necessarily getting the supports they need to overcome these issues that would be specific to the asylum/refugee experience”.
They said a “very significant problem” is the continued lack of a vulnerability assessment for people in the asylum process which can help identify these issues as soon as possible, to ensure people receive appropriate supports.
The spokesperson noted that specialised supports are concentrated in urban places and main cities and “it may not be logistically possible for people in remote Direct Provision centres to reach them”.
A spokesperson for the Irish Refugee Council said the organisation has “spoken with several people who feel unsafe in centres for a variety of reasons” such as traumatic past experiences.
“Direct Provision is a form of institutionalised living and what these issues highlight is the fact that accommodating people in their hundreds for protracted periods of time in this manner results in interpersonal issues and conflicts arising.
“This form of accommodation is very stressful and can exacerbate existing traumas. Significant delays in processing applications also mean that people are living in these circumstances with no way of knowing how long it will continue or when they will be able to move on with their lives,” they added.
One of the bedrooms in the Clondalkin DP centre.
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice and Equality said any health issues of DP residents are addressed by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health.
They said the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which falls under the department’s remit, liaises closely with colleagues in the HSE and other departments and agencies “to address the health needs of residents”.
“Any residents with complex medical conditions are assessed in Balseskin Reception Centre so that their needs can be addressed. Protection applicants have access to all emergency medical services immediately on arrival in the country,” the spokesperson said.
They added that GPs or medical personnel in hospital can refer asylum seekers who have suffered torture or trauma for specialist medical services in Dublin or other centres.
The department did not respond to a request for comment on why a vulnerability assessment has not been introduced to date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-ferries-passenger-compensation-4523785-Mar2019/,"IRISH FERRIES HAS brought a High Court challenge over a finding that it must pay compensation to thousands of passengers affected by the cancellation of sailings between Ireland and France last summer.
The company says it had to cancel the services because a new ferry it had ordered, the WB Yeats, to operate the service between Dublin and Cherbourg was delayed for several months.
The challenge has been brought against a National Transport Authority (NTA) decision in January, that arising out of the cancellations, the company breached EU regulations concerning the rights of passengers travelling by sea.
The NTA issued the company with two notices requiring Irish Ferries to pay compensation to impacted passengers within a period of two months.
The notices direct the company to pay compensation to passengers impacted by the cancellations who had to travel from Rosslare instead of Dublin, and from Roscoff instead of Cherbourg.
The notices also state passengers who were delayed in reaching their final destination who have already requested compensation from the company must also be paid compensation.
Non-compliance with the notices is an offence, with a maximum fine on conviction of €250,000.
The company disputes the NTA’s finding and says it and the notices are invalid, irrational, in breach of its Constitutional Rights and EU rights.
Irish Ferries also says the NTA has misinterpreted the relevant EU regulations.
The cancellations occurred because a new ship it had commissioned from the German shipyard Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft was delivered some “200 days” late Irish Ferries counsel Paul Gallagher SC told the High Court today.
Counsel said the delay came as a shock to Irish Ferries and made headlines in the media.

Counsel said the company took steps including offering “an immediate no quibble reimbursement in full” to affected customers, offered vouchers for €150, as well as “the opportunity to rebook on alternative sailings of their choosing”.
Some 5,700 bookings were affected by the cancellations.
Counsel said the majority of affected passengers, some 82%, chose to travel on alternative sailings to France with Irish Ferries.
The remainder either cancelled and accepted a refund or chose to travel by landbridge through the UK, and were compensated by Irish Ferries for the fuel expended while crossing Britain.
Counsel said that his client is concerned about the long term implications of the NTA’s decision.
The situation Irish Ferries found itself was extraordinary, was not of its own making, and it was unable to secure another ferry to operate the planned sailings, counsel said.
All affected passengers counsel said were informed of the situation a minimum of seven weeks before the proposed sailing, he added.
In its judicial review action, Irish Ferries seeks various orders including one quashing the NTA’s decision and the notices it issued to the company.
It also seeks various declarations from the Court including that the NTA’s decision and the notices are invalid, are irrational and are without any legal basis.
The further seeks declarations including that the decision and the notices fly in the face of common sense, take into account irrelevant considerations, and are disproportionate.
Permission to bring the challenge was granted, on an ex-parte basis, by Mr Justice Seamus Noonan, who also placed a stay on the notices from coming into effect.
The judge made the matter returnable to a date in May.","7.46pm, 4 Mar 2019",

**********
Twynham was born in Manchester but raised in North Wales. At 11, he started playing football relatively late, but that didn’t prevent his essential talent blooming.
An attacking midfielder, within two years he was selected for the Bobby Charlton Soccer School – the programme which also identified David Beckham – and impressed during a tournament in France to the extent that the country’s biggest clubs came calling.
He was brought to Liverpool’s School of Excellence, but his slated trial game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy. Instead, he was invited to Manchester United by Brian Kidd and Nobby Stiles for a week-long trial.
Custom dictated that the best player would give a speech at the end of the week. Come Friday, that fell to Twynham. United gave him a Youth Team Scheme contract that ran for six years…all but one of which Twynham completed.
“I should have signed for Liverpool, I’d have had a better chance!” laughs Twynham toThe42.
Initially, things went well.
He shared digs with David Beckham for a while, and the pair became close friends.
They went together to United’s FA Cup semi-final replay against Oldham in 1990, and embraced each other madly amid the euphoria of Mark Robins’ extra-time winner; his second critical goal of that cup run as it sent United to Wembley to win the first trophy of the Ferguson era.
Afterward, Twynham and Beckham found themselves in the United dressing room, with a jocular Ferguson telling them they reeked of hot dogs before sending them on their way home.

“We were best mates”, recalls Twynham of Beckham. “I don’t know why he doesn’t mention that in his book, we were best mates for a while. Maybe somebody thought it wouldn’t be good to mention a con.
“I like him. Even though he is a humble guy now, and he is a good guy, he was a bit of a big-time Charlie back then.
“Nobody ever thought he was going to be what he became. But he wanted fame. He wanted it.
“He just had confidence. He grew. He had great technique and great stamina; he’d run all day. The coaches that say they knew he’d be so good are lying; they never expected him to be a superstar.
Twynham does get a mention in another former housemate’s book. “His sunbed partner!” laughs Twynham whenThe42mentions Robbie Savage.
“Yeah, we were only on 40 pounds a week so we used to go the sunbeds together to save money, as he was a skinny little shit.
“We’d top and tail in the same sunbed at the same time!”
**********
And then he left.
“There’s not many people who would walk out on the biggest club in the world, but it wasn’t meant to be”, says Twynham plainly.
If few would walk out on Manchester United, fewer still would do so to the soundtrack of repeated pleas from Alex Ferguson to stay.
Twynham was 18 and had another year left on his contract, but resolved he needed to get away from it all.
“I wasn’t happy. I had a good season the year before but it was becoming apparent I wasn’t going to make it.
“I was just homesick. I didn’t want to be there anymore. I didn’t feel comfortable, I didn’t feel confident.
I just didn’t want to play football anymore, I’d lost my desire.”

Although Manchester wasn’t exactly separated from his home in North Wales by wide oceans and sprawling lands, Twynham struggled to settle and made frequent trips home.
Everything came to a head after one such return.
“I went AWOL one weekend, and when I came back [youth team coach] Eric Harrison had a go at me and said, ‘Where were you?’ and I told him I just didn’t want to play for the club again.
“I then had to go through the channels, so I had to go see Alex Ferguson. He tried to talk me out of it, and told me I’d a future of making a living from the game.”
Ferguson sent him to Wrexham to train, in the hope that the ragged experience of lower-league football would convince him to stay with United, but Twynham’s mind was made up: he wanted to go home.
There were a few reasons behind his decision to get out of United and return home, among them his chafing amid the singular world of a football academy in which the dreamers were many and the dreams few.
“It’s quite hard”, reflects Twynham.
“There’s 40 of you on YTS, living in digs. There were fights, lads were always on the wind-up. It’s intense.”
Fights occasionally happened in the dressing room after training, with players engaging in boxing matches wearing nothing but towels. “And if the towels fell off, we’d keep on going” remembers Twynham.
Twynham was once in the middle of one of these fights, in which he scrapped with defender Ashley Westwood. The pair were caught, and sent to Alex Ferguson’s office.
Both made their way to Manchester’s kind of Mordor nervously, with Westwood’s eyes already discoloured and swelling up.
The amateur boxers were then hit with a profound bit of luck: Ferguson wasn’t around.
“We were with each other every day” says Twynham of the atmosphere among United’s youth ranks.
“We were seeing each other every day. If you are a weak person, it can feel a bit like being bullied at school.
“We were training close to the first-team, too, and among them you are almost like a fan, aren’t you?
“I had a run-in with Peter Schmeichel, and a run-in with Paul Ince.
“Ince was an absolute wanker.”

Twynham says he could handle himself, but it had just become too wearying amid a wider disillusion that he wasn’t going to make the grade at United.
“I wanted to be at home, I felt I was just pissing in the wind. I thought that there’s more to life than this.
“I didn’t get on with Eric Harrison from day one. He was very important at the club. It was Eric Harrison who made those kids. He believed in them and he deserves a lot of credit. But I just didn’t see eye-to-eye with him.
“I was signed by Brian Kidd and Nobby Stiles, not him.”
The style of play didn’t help Twynham either. More comfortable running with the ball at his feet, Harrison drilled his players to “pass, pass, pass.”
His game-time was, admittedly, stymied by players who he says “went onto be the best players in the Premiership, some to be the best in the world.”
He ignored his father’s pleas to stay on for at least another six months, if not see out the final year of his contract.
“I just couldn’t get my head down.
“Looking back now, it probably was the biggest mistake of my life. It’s just one of those things, I can’t turn back the clock, can I?”
Ferguson ensured United paid up the rest of his contract, which the club were not obligated to do.
So Gary Twynham left United with £15,000 and returned home to Wales.
“He wanted to look after me”, says Twynham of Ferguson. “To make sure I looked after my life.”
**********
Less than a year later, Ferguson was looking out for Twynham again. This time he was writing a character reference as Twynham appeared in court.
“I got in a fight in Rhyl and got nicked for it”, says Twynham. He was charged with assault and sentenced to nine months in prison.
“Prison was great!”, laughs Twynham.“When I was coming in, it was on the radio that an ex-United player was being sent down. So they were all waiting for fucking Ryan Giggs or someone, so when I turned up they were fairly disappointed!”

A prisoner who ran a cooking course in the prison enrolled Twynham before he had arrived.
“He was a United fan. It had been in the paper that Ferguson gave me a character reference, so he thought about using me to get to talk to his idol!”
The course was a success – Twynham ate what he cooked – but more successful was the football team.
Having impressed, the prison arranged him a trial with Darlington.
“They looked over the walls on massive ladders! No, that’s a joke.
“The prison go to football clubs so they got me a trial with Darlington. I had a worldie and they wanted me to sign at half-time.
“I think I was the first con to sign professional terms.
“They gave me a little wage. I got out of prison and they put me in digs, and I ended up in the play-off final.
“So I started the season in prison and ended it at Wembley.”
**********
That game was to decide who would be promoted to the second division, and Darlington lost 1-0 to a Plymouth team managed by Neil Warnock.
To Twynham’s frustration, he never managed to make a step up from the club.
“I had a good season. I was a strong and quick player. At Darlington we had Robbie Blake and Sean Gregan, and they went on to play in the Premiership.
“He asked, ‘You’re not playing right-wing are you? Oh no’.
“I got Man of the Match that night, I thought, ‘Now I’ll get my move’, but it never happened. I had a good season but fell out with the manager Dave Hodgson.”
From there Twynham dropped to non-league level, bouncing around with a number of clubs before spending a “disastrous season” with Hednesford Town.
“I went AWOL a couple of times. They gave me a couple of warnings but I fell out with the chairman.
“So I got sacked from the Conference and went back to the Football League.”
He went to Macclesfield and played nine times in the 2000/01 season, but then returned to Wales: playing with Haverfordwest County, Port Talbot, and finally, Barry Town, with whom he was relegated from the Welsh Premier League.
At the beginning of Twynham’s final season, Real Madrid paid Manchester United €37 million for David Beckham.
Everybody leaves eventually.
**********
Ironically, Twynham has now settled in Manchester, where he works as a mobile phone engineer.
“I’ve a good job now, I love it. I love it more than football. I make good money and you don’t get out of breath driving, do you?”
So how does he look back on it all, as the man who walked out on Manchester United?
“If I was going to make it, I’d have made it. I went to Darlington and it didn’t materialise.
“I wasn’t good enough at the end of the day.”
Was it difficult realising he wasn’t good enough? Or, given that he had walked out on United, was it a slight relief?
“It’s a bit of both.”
Twynham remains a United fan, and is back watching them every week having stayed away for a while, although that wasn’t through any personal angst.
“I still love football, I still watch it. I’m a United fan, but I didn’t watch them while Mourinho was there as I just didn’t like him.
“But now Solskjaer is there, it’s great.”","8.00am, 10 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/cavan-atm-theft-4533025-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ IN CAVAN have begun an investigation after the theft of an ATM from the wall of a bank on Main Street, Kingscourt.
The alarm was raised at 4am and officers attended the scene.
Upon arrival, they discovered a large digger had been used to remove the ATM from the bank.
It was placed on a trailer being towed by a light-coloured four-wheel drive vehicle (SUV).

This vehicle left the scene in the direction of Carrickmacross.
The scene has been sealed off to facilitate a technical examination by garda crime scene examiners.
Gardaí have asked anyone with information in relation to the incident to contact them at Bailieboro Garda Station on 042 969 4570.
In a separate incident at 4.15am in Dungannon, Tyrone, thieves used a digger to steal an ATM from a garage.
The PSNI said the digger caused substantial damage to the building, before it was set alight at the scene. It had been stolen from a business a short distance away.
Police in the North also appealed for witnesses to come forward.

SPACEX’S NEW DRAGON capsule successfully docked on the International Space Station today, NASA and SpaceX confirmed during a live broadcast of the mission.
“We can confirm hard capture is complete,” NASA said.
The announcement was met with applause at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.
The docking began at 10.51 am Irish time, more than 400 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, north of New Zealand – and 27 hours after the capsule’s launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida.
Although the contact appeared slow, the ISS and the capsule were moving at a speed of over 27,000 kilometres per hour in orbit around the Earth.
On board the ISS, the crew – American Anne McClain, Russian Oleg Kononenko, and Canadian David Saint-Jacques – were scheduled to open the airlock at 1.30 pm Irish time.
The mission is a test launch with only a dummy on board the capsule ahead of a manned flight scheduled for later this year.
The Dragon capsule will remain on the ISS until Friday before detaching to splash down in the Atlantic. It will be slowed by four parachutes, in what is the one of the mission’s riskiest stages.
The launch is a key step towards resuming manned space flights from US soil after an eight-year break.
SpaceX, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, has made the trip to the ISS a dozen times before since 2012, but only to refuel the station.
Transporting people is a more complex task, requiring seats, a pressurised cabin with breathable air, temperature regulation and emergency infrastructure.

‘NASA ‘rocking’ again’
After its shuttle program was shut down in July 2011 following a 30-year run, NASA began outsourcing the logistics of its space missions.
It pays Russia to get its people up to the ISS orbiting research facility at a cost of $82 million (€72 million) per head for a round trip.
In 2014, the US space agency awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing for them to take over this task. In SpaceX’s case, NASA has agreed to pay $2.6 billion (€2.29 billion)  for six round trips to the ISS.
The switch from NASA owning spacecraft to paying private firms for a service was initiated under former president Barack Obama – but due to development delays, has come to fruition under US President Donald Trump.
“We’ve got NASA “rocking” again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all!” Trump tweeted Saturday evening.
Return to the Moon
Since 2017, NASA’s official mission has been to return to the Moon – a project awarded $21.5 billion (€18.9 billion) by Congress in the 2019 budget.
Jim Bridenstine, head of the US space agency, has explained NASA wants to reduce costs in low orbit to devote resources to getting back to the Moon and constructing a small space station in lunar orbit in the 2020s.
“As a country, we’re looking forward to being one customer of many customers, in a robust commercial marketplace in low Earth orbit, so that we can drive down costs and increase access in ways that historically have not been possible,” he said yesterday following Dragon’s launch.
But Musk has admitted that marketing travel in the Dragon capsule is not a priority – and he is more interested in distant exploration of the solar system.
At the post-launch press conference yesterday, he reiterated his dream for a permanent Moon base – and sending people to Mars.
Musk has already locked in his first private customer to fly to the Moon: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. But it won’t happen before 2023 – with the rocket, far more powerful than that used for the Dragon mission, still in development.

https://www.the42.ie/zack-elbouzedi-interview-march-2019-4536006-Mar2019/,"AFTER PARTING COMPANY with West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 2017, Zack Elbouzedi headed north in a bid to prevent his career from going south.
Evidence of vindication of that decision was in short supply when he got his first taste of competitive senior football the following January.
Elbouzedi was introduced as a half-time substitute for Elgin City in their Scottish League Two game away to Peterhead. On a rainy Tuesday night in the north-east of Scotland, Peterhead ran out 7-0 winners — a goal for every hundred spectators in attendance.

Granted, Elbouzedi was only there on a one-month loan deal from Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who were two rungs above fourth-tier Elgin on the Scottish football ladder.
Nevertheless, he was soon re-evaluating his prospects. The track record of the Scottish Highlands as a successful launchpad for young Irish footballers is about as extensive as Tipperary’s reputation as a surfer’s paradise.
As he began to recognise the flaw in the sweeping generalisaton that a footballer is always closer to realising the dream once he’s somewhere east of the Irish Sea, a return home became Elbouzedi’s most enticing option.
Halfway through his contract with the Scottish Championship club, the Dubliner negotiated his release from Inverness last August. A few months later, he was announced as one of Waterford’s first additions for the 2019 season.
“I signed for Inverness on a Friday and on the Saturday I played in a friendly and did my knee, which put me out for five and a half months. When I got back, the team were in a good bit of form and the manager had a settled team, so it was hard to get in,” explains the 20-year-old, who was restricted to five substitute appearances during his season at the Caledonian Stadium.

“Getting injured just after joining a new club, it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances. You’re up in the Highlands as well, where there aren’t that many eyes on you. It’s over three hours away from Glasgow so it’s completely off the radar. You’d have to be doing exceptionally well to be noticed up there.
“The fact that I wasn’t even playing meant my chances of being noticed were really slim. I’m still young but I needed to be playing games to learn my trade in first-team football. With the number of players being signed from the League of Ireland now, it’s getting more and more respect from clubs in England. That’s the way I looked at it.”

A versatile attacker who’s capable of operating in advanced roles whether wide or central, Elbouzedi was signed by West Bromwich Albion from Malahide United. Initially he enjoyed the pursuit of a professional career in England, but despite being satisfied with his own development, a breakthrough seemed a remote possibility.
“I personally thought there was favouritism towards their own local boys over there. After about a year and a half, I didn’t feel like I was going to get a fair crack of the whip,” he says.
“They were in the Premier League at the time too, so with the players they were able to bring in because of the finance they had, it was really tough to push on. I learned a lot — there were some good coaches and some great people — but it was hard to feel like you were progressing.
“I was playing in centre-midfield then and there were three or four other lads in that position from Birmingham who had come through their academy. I thought I was doing well in training but it was always those lads who got the benefit of the doubt. The coaches seemed to want them to do well, maybe because it looks better if a player comes all the way through their academy from the age of eight or nine. That’s just how I saw it anyway.”
Although Elbouzedi was frustrated by the status quo he perceived at West Brom, he made inroads nevertheless at international level. Born in Dublin to a mother from Kilbarrack and a father from Libya, he has been capped by Ireland at all age grades from U15 to U19, as well as being named in the U21 squad to face Luxembourg later this month.
At the U17 European Championships in 2015, he helped Ireland to earn a draw against a Netherlands side that included Manchester United’s Timothy Fosu-Mensah and in-demand Ajax star Matthijs de Ligt. At U19 level, Elbouzedi was involved in victories against the likes of Italy, Portugal and Belgium.
Libya have been in touch with a view to convincing him to emulate Eamon Zayed by switching his allegiance to the North African nation. While he was flattered by the interest, Elbouzedi doesn’t intend to relinquish his ambition to represent Ireland at the highest level.

“People [from Libya] have tried to contact my dad about it a few times but my focus is on Ireland. It’s nice that they’ve shown interest in me and I know it would make my dad happy, but I feel Irish so that’s who I want to play for,” he says.
“My dad is equally happy as well that I’ve played for Ireland. He’s lived here for 30-something years so he’s basically Irish himself. I was born in Ireland so playing for Ireland is what I’m focused on when it comes to international football.”
After his disappointing spell in Scotland, Elbouzedi made his Waterford debut in last month’s season opener against Shamrock Rovers. The Blues were beaten by the last kick of the game in front of a 4,152 crowd at the RSC, but they rebounded in impressive fashion seven days later when he scored the second goal in a 2-0 win at Cork City.
“It was my first senior goal, which was great,” says Elbouzedi. “My mam and dad were in the crowd as well so it was special, particularly in the derby. They’ve been brilliant to me, supporting me through tough times, so it was a really good feeling to share it with them.”
Alan Reynolds’ side have been unable to build on that victory at Turner’s Cross, taking just one of the nine points on offer. However, Elbouzedi is confident that a new-look Waterford team will click in time for the start of their Europa League campaign in July.
He says: “I’m enjoying my football again after what was a fairly tough year and a half. I came home to try and play with a smile on my face again. That’s what I’m doing at the moment. Alan Reynolds has given me the freedom and the confidence to play the way I know I can play. The results haven’t been great but I’m enjoying my football.
“The opportunity to play in Europe was another big reason for coming to Waterford. That’s not something that comes around a lot. It’s great for the club and it puts more eyes on everyone. It’s an experience I’m really looking forward to.”

THE OFFICE OF the Ombudsman received 148 formal complaints from residents living in direct provision last year.
There are currently 38 direct provision centres operating around Ireland. Generally re-purposed or purpose-built facilities, these centres are used to accommodate asylum seekers in Ireland. Some centres are state-run but most are tendered out to various private contractors.
Today’sreportlays out official complaints made to the Ombudsman’s office since January 2018.
In one instance reported last year, a man living in a direct provision centre in visited the Ombudsman’s Office to complain about his treatment by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which has responsibility for the direct provision system.
The man said that his partner had moved to the Mosney Accommodation Centre in Co Meath and that he’d requested a transfer to be with her.

Although he’d informed his current accommodation centre that he was visiting his partner, the centre decided that his bed space was abandoned. The man, therefore, had nowhere to sleep that night while waiting for the decision on his transfer request.
The Ombudsman contacted RIA. It then issued a letter approving the man’s transfer request and the man was admitted to stay in Mosney that evening.
Among last year’s complaints relating to official bodies as well as direct provision centres there were 20 complaints about facilities in centres including complaints from residents about food, lack of cooking facilities and availability of transport.
There was also 14 complaints about accommodation and 13 complaints about refusals to re-admit residents to centres.
The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was the subject of 18 complaints in 2018 while there were 14 complaints relating to the Department of Employment Affairs & Social Protection.
The IRPP was set up in 2015 in response to the refugee crises in Europe.
‘Unsuitable system’
Complaints made in 2018 bring the total number to 263 since the Ombudsman’s office began accepting complaints from people in direct provision in April 2017.

In his report, Ombudsman Peter Tyndall reiterated his opinion that “direct provision is not a suitable long-term system for those waiting for a decision on their asylum application”.
The asylum system in Ireland has come under increased pressure in recent months. As a result, hundreds of asylum seekers have been placed in emergency accommodation since September.
The Office of the Ombudsman has the responsibility of examining complaints from people who feel they have been unfairly treated by certain public bodies.
While the right to work – introduced last year – has had a positive impact for some living in the system, today’s report notes, residents who have taken up employment will soon be asked to pay a proportion of the cost of providing accommodation in line with their income.
A spokesperson has said “any complaint about the calculation of the charges can be examined by the Ombudsman”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-lone-parents-who-work-get-up-very-early-in-the-morning-but-leo-varadkar-doesnt-care-about-us-4530291-Mar2019/,"THIS WEEK ST Vincent De Paul issued a report that illustrated that the number of lone parents who are working, but still living in poverty, has doubled from 2012 to 2017.
The author of the report, Dr Tricia Keilthy highlighted that in 2012, 1 in 11 households headed by working lone parents was living in poverty but that proportion had increased to 1 in 5 by 2017.
The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar was questioned about the report in the Dáil andargued against the accuracy of the report.
Keilthy used data from the CSO’s Survey on Income and Living Conditions but Varadkar sited the same data to claim that poverty among lone parents had decreased during that time.
He didn’t argue against the fact that one in five lone parent families in work was living in poverty, but rather he argued that this was a slight decrease in the poverty rates for lone parent families overall.
He is right about the overall decrease in the consistent poverty rates of all lone parents, but this report specifically examined the poverty rates for lone parents in paid employment.
It is a spectacular policy failure by the Fine Gael government, that while overall poverty rates are falling as our economy recovers, working lone parents have seen their poverty rates double as a direct result of the government’s ‘work activation’ policy.
In Budget 2012, one parent family reforms were introduced which meant that by July 2015 lone parents would lose their one parent family payment when their youngest child turns seven.
The ‘work activation’ measures also reduced the supports available to working lone parents.
The Exchequer impact analysis suggests that the reforms led to a net saving of €261.5 million over the period from 2013 – 2016.
This net saving was borne by working lone parents and their children and therefore it can be no surprise that poverty doubled for our families.
Advertisement
It is completely disingenuous of Varadkar to conflate the overall decrease in poverty with the proven increase in poverty among those lone parents who go out to work.
We are repeatedly told that work is a route out of poverty so it is extremely worrying that increasing lone parents are forming part of Ireland’s working poor.
When the reforms were announced, the then Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton pledged not to proceed with these changes unless there was an affordable Scandinavian-style childcare system in place.
It goes without saying that this did not happen.
On paper, Irish wages and social welfare can seem relatively high, however, we have some of the highest childcare and housing costs in the EU and we also face a dearth of quality public services.
This means that Ireland has a cost of living crisis. Many young families are struggling with the exorbitant costs of childcare and housing costs and the impact of this on lone parent families is more severe.
Lone parent families are five times more likely to live in poverty than 2-parent families and are bearing the brunt of family homelessness.
Social Welfare rates for lone parent families are inadequate according to the Vincentian Partnership Minimum Essential Standards Calculator.
The activation policy that was introduced in recent years has reduced supports for working lone parents and has trapped our families in poverty. This was all foreseeable and predicted.
If this government is serious about tackling child poverty, it needs to start targeting supports to the poorest families. We need a complete reversal of the changes to the One Parent Family payment – to ensure that work pays.
We need flexible education courses and employment opportunities that support the dual roles of learner or earner and primary carer.We also need a statutory maintenance enforcement agency that ensures all parents are held responsible for their children and removes the onus of seeking maintenance from the contentious court system.
It is a massive indictment of the current Government’s priorities that the only group that has seen an increase in poverty over this period are parents who are raising children alone and are also in paid employment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-we-need-a-fair-and-transparent-system-for-deciding-which-expensive-new-drugs-to-fund-4524438-Mar2019/,"THE NATURAL RESPONSE of an individual or the family of a person with a life-threatening disease is to advocate for funding for the best drug that could save their life.
That is exactly what you do when you’re fighting for your life or the life of a loved one. That drug might be Orkambi, Pembro or Spinraza.

But what is the role of the state in those complex decisions around funding new drugs, where individual rights may conflict with broader principles concerning the distribution of state resources?
Is it possible to achieve an objective process that citizens can agree on and politicians will comply with?
New ‘high-tech’ drugs are extremely expensive, too expensive for countries to pay for all of them at the prices quoted by drug manufacturers. If they did, there would be no money left over for healthcare services.
Moreover, research shows that many new drugs, such as cancer drugs produced during the last decade, do not show sufficient improvement on existing drugs to justify public funding.
In choosing what to fund, they must consider the ‘opportunity cost’, that is, all of the alternative things that could have been funded with the same money.
How does the state decide which new drugs to fund?
In Ireland, the job of the HSE’s National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE), is to review new drugs that have met EU safety standards.
It decides whether or not to recommend the new drug and make it available to Irish citizens by funding it through the public health system.
This work involves an examination of the cost-effectiveness of a drug to see if it provides significant benefit to patients above and beyond similar treatments on the markets and whether that benefit is commensurate with the cost the pharmaceutical manufacturer is charging for the drug.
The measurement of the drug’s value is in QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). This considers the number of additional years a drug might potentially add to a person’s life and the quality of life the patient can expect.
Ireland’s policy is similar to the UK’s.
The NCPE has a cost-effectiveness threshold, a price per QALY over which treatments are less likely to be recommended.
This provides a consistent framework against which the benefit of all new drugs can be measured, while still allowing scope for special consideration for conditions such as rare diseases.
What happened with Orkambi?
The pharmaceutical company Vertex developed the drug Orkambi to treat cystic fibrosis and ran clinical trials of the drug with Irish patients. Ireland has the highest incidence of the disease in the world.
The Orkambi drug then passed EU drug safety standards and, in Ireland, it was referred to the NCPE to assess its potential benefit in the context of the Irish population.
In 2016, the NCPE concluded that Orkambi did not demonstrate sufficient additional health benefits to patients over and above existing drugs at the price it would cost the state.
The decision of NCPE was reported widely in the media. Many patients who had participated in the drug trial and who were already taking the drug were told they would not have access to Orkambi in the future as the state would not cover the cost.
At the time, the final decision regarding the allocation of funding for new drugs rested with a single individual, the Minister for Health.
The NCPE decision prompted a vocal campaign by families of people with CF, and trial participants publicly expressed their fears over the drug being withdrawn from them.
The ensuing media coverage and political scoring by opposition parties put the minister under pressure to ignore the advice of the state’s expert committee, and he eventually relented.
It was a positive result for CF sufferers, but it highlighted serious weaknesses in the drugs approval process. After the Orkambi experience, the Minister announced that responsibility for making decisions on funding new drugs would be transferred back to the HSE.
What happened with Pembro?
During the summer of 2018, Dr David Fennelly, an oncologist, advocated through the media for funding to trial the new cervical cancer drug Pembrolizumab.
Dr Fennelly was treating Vicky Phelan with the drug, which was approved by the FDA in America in June 2018 for some women with advanced cervical cancer but had not yet been licensed to treat cervical cancer by the European Medicines Agency.
The FDA caveated the announcement warning it was an accelerated approval and that further studies were required to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit in patients with advanced cervical cancer.
Ms Phelan, who campaigned successfully to secure access to the drug for women affected by the CervicalCheck affair, continued advocating for the state to extend access to the drug to others suffering from cervical cancer.
In December 2018, over-ruling its own policy of allowing the HSE’s expert committee, NCPE, to decide on the overall benefits of the drug to the population, the government announced its decision to approve Pembro for all women with cervical cancer.
Where do we go from here?
Few would begrudge a person with a life-threatening illness access to life-saving treatment.
For that reason, we need strong policies in place, policies that we as a society agree on so that funding decisions are not made arbitrarily where they can be strongly influenced by media or exploited by the pharmaceutical sector.
These recent events reveal some serious weaknesses in how we allocate critical state resources in one area of healthcare.
The Helsinki Declaration (1964), the gold standard ethical guidance document for all research conducted in human subjects, recommends researchers leading clinical trials to inform a Research Ethics Committee in advance about what will happen to the trial patients’ treatment once the trial is finished.
Given Irish patients participated in the Orkambi drug trial, could it have been foreseen the state would be on the back foot in any negotiation on the price of the drug if the trial was successful and trial participants had not received any guarantee from the manufacturer that they would have access to the drug post-trial?
Although the QALY (quality-adjusted life year) approach to inform decision-making is not without criticism, as yet, we have no better framework for comparing the benefit of drugs for different diseases.
If politicians do not adhere to the guidelines set out, the decision-making process becomes compromised, politized and unfair.
Furthermore, the inconsistency in its decision-making process strengthens the hand of pharmaceuticals in negotiations around drug pricing. One might also ask, what is the point in having a committee and protocols when we don’t stick to them?
The Pembro story raises important ethical questions around doctors advocating for drugs for individual patients or specific groups of patients, especially without discussing the broader questions of opportunity cost, and fair and transparent allocation of resources in healthcare.
What happens when the money runs out?
The Sunday Business Post reported last week that the State has almost fully committed its 2019 budget for new drugs.
Is there a danger that funding will be redirected from other essential services to meet our growing drugs bill?
It is the duty of the state to allocate funding in a way that is fair, efficient and transparent and we need a system that can do this in a consistent and robust way.
From a citizen’s perspective, we need to think about what is the best way to do this and whether we can reach a consensus on the key principles to underpin the distribution of limited funds.
Maybe we need to focus our debate on the right to affordable medicines, not just the right to medicines.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-season-clock-changes-4527090-Mar2019/,"A EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT committee this week decided that season clock changes should be scrapped by 2021.
Now all member states are being asked to decide whether they want to stay permanently on either winter or summer time.
Since 2001, all members states have switched to summertime on the last Sunday of March and then back to winter time on the last Sunday of October.
A consultation by the Commission last year found that over 80% of people favoured abolishing the twice yearly season clock changes. And a poll on behalf ofTheJournal.ieandClaire Byrne Live/Amárach Researchfound 67% of Irish people believe we should stop the clock changing ritual.
The way it works now, we get the benefit of brighter evenings in the summer and in the winter our mornings are not dark for as long as they otherwise would be.
Here are the current arrangements:

Basically, if we choose summer time, we will have brighter evenings all year round but in winter our mornings will be darker that our current winter mornings. This is a consideration in particular for children who would be going to school in the dark on winter mornings and also commuters.
But there are benefits for those working in the agricultural sector as there is an extra daylight hour for outdoor activities.
If we choose winter time we will have brighter mornings that we do now for work and school commutes but our summer evenings will not have as much of a ‘grand stretch’.
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, who has responsibility any seasonal time changes has not given an indication of which option he would prefer.
His predecessor Frances Fitzgerald has in the past spoken of the fact that the European Parliament committee had highlighted the benefits of introducing summer time for  a longer portion of the year.
At the end of last year the Department of Justice launched a public consultation on seasonal clock changes so Irish people can help the government decide whether we want to stay on summer or winter time.
The department toldTheJournal.iethat this consultation has now closed. It comprised a public survey which received over 16,000 responses as well as 71 submissions from individuals and stakeholders.
An opinion poll of 1,000 people by Amárach Research was also commissioned.
“A report on the consultation exercise is being prepared and will be considered by an interdepartmental steering group for submission to government,” a spokesperson said.

AN AFGHAN MAN who died after reportedly jumping into gunfire to save his fellow worshippers is among the first named victims of yesterday’s New Zealand gun attacks.
A right-wing extremist,has been charged over the attacks on two mosquesin the city of Christchurch, which left 49 people dead and dozens more injured.
The attacks have prompted an outpouring of grief and deep shock in the usually peaceful country, which prides itself on welcoming refugees fleeing violence or persecution.
Throughout the day people laid flowers at a makeshift memorial just beyond the police cordon around the Al Noor mosque, where most of the victims died.
Many offerings were accompanied by handwritten letters laden with sadness and disbelief, from residents of what one local driver called the “city of sorrow”.
“I am so sorry that you were not safe here. Our hearts are breaking for your loss,” read one of the notes.
An imam who was leading prayers at the Linwood mosque at the time of the attack said the Muslim community would not be shaken by the massacre.
“It was a very bad day, not just all of us, all of New Zealand,” said Ibrahim AbdulHalim. But, he added: “We still love this country”.
The attacks have beencalled terrorismby Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and are thought to be the deadliest attack directed against Muslims in the West in modern times.

Speaking outside a court this morning, the son of 71-year-old Daoud Nabi, the first victim to be named, demanded justice for his late father, who believed New Zealand to be a “slice of paradise”.
Nabi had lived in New Zealand for more than 40 years after fleeing Afghanistan as a refugee in the late 1970s.
His son Omar learnt that his father had died after trying to shield someone else from a bullet.
“I got told by my best friend’s father… that he leaped on somebody else to save their life,” he told Stuff.co.nz.
“He jumped in the firing line to save somebody else’s life and he has passed away.”
Another of Daoud’s sons, Yama, was on the way to the mosque when he bumped into a friend who told him “your father saved my life”, according to Australian newspaper The Age.
“I never thought it would happen in New Zealand. It’s a peaceful country,” Yama Nabi told AFP, tears welling up in his eyes.
There were reports on social media that Daoud Nabi had opened the door to the terrorist, greeting him with the words “hello brother”.
‘Brave little soldier’
Another victim, 14 year-old Sayyad Milne died at the Al Noor mosque which he attended with his mother and friends every Friday, the New Zealand Herald reports.

His father John Milne said his son’s death hadn’t been officially confirmed, but he’d been told the teenager had been seen lying on the floor of the mosque, bleeding.
“I’ve lost my little boy, he’s just turned 14,” he told the paper, adding that his son had been a keen footballer.
“A brave little soldier. It’s so hard… to see him just gunned down by someone who didn’t care about anyone or anything.”

Jordanian barber Wasseim Alsati and his daughter Alin, four, are both in hospital with serious injuries after being shot at the Al Noor mosque.
In a video filmed from his hospital bed Alsati asked people to “please pray for me and my daughter”, who has been flown to Auckland for treatment.
A friend of Wasseim’s, Carolyne Phillips, who was at the hospital with him, said he had undergone surgery for a perforated bowel, an injury to his pelvis and to get shrapnel and bone out of his hip socket.
Alsati reportedly moved to New Zealand from Jordan in 2014.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-donald-trump-capitol-hill-lunch-4542885-Mar2019/,"Christina Finn reports from Washington DC:
SLICK, POLISHED AND for everything to go off without a hitch – that’s what Varadkar was hoping for in Washington after thingsdidn’t exactly work out that waylast year.
You may recall the tenor of the domestic headlines exactly 12 months ago today after the  Taoiseach joked at a Capitol Hill lunch about intervening on behalf of Donald Trump in order to stop a wind farm being built near Doonbeg.
This time around, the traditional schedule of Washington events went more smoothly.
Notably, headlines in the international press were dominated by the Taoiseach’s breakfast meeting with Vice President Mike Pence.
Pence, who has been criticised for his views and his legislative record on LGBT rights, told Varadkar last year that his partner, Matt Barrett, would be welcome at his official residence at this year’s St Patrick’s breakfast.
And speaking at the event – which was open to press, in a departure from last year – the Taoiseach gave remarks noting that in modern day Ireland politicians were judged not by their sexual orientation, “skin tone, gender or religious beliefs” but by their actions.
TheWashington Post notedin its piece: “This is the first time that Pence has hosted the partner of an openly gay world leader at his residence, though that may simply be a reflection of their low numbers.”
The headline in The Guardianobserved that Varadkar had delivered “pointed remarks on sexuality”.
The Daily Beast stated: ‘Mike Pence Meets With Ireland’s First Openly Gay Prime Minister’.
Business Insider was a little more direct with it’s headline:
‘The Irish Prime Minister brought his boyfriend to meet Vice President Pence’
daraghdaragh
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Pence, and his sister Anne (Pence’s wife is away at the Special Olympics) welcomed the couple, making small talk in front of the cameras.
There was some speculation over whether Varadkar would mention the issue of gay rights – but his comments on the issue, delivered from a podium as the vice president looked on, were to the point. Pence is deeply religious, so it’s notable that Varadkar rolled out the expression ‘all God’s children’.
He told the guests he had always been fascinated by US politics “in many ways it helped to inspire me to believe in the power of politics to do good because ultimately that is what politics is all about”.
“It helped inspire me to run for office. I also knew at the time that I lived in a country where if I tried to be myself, at the time I would have ended up breaking laws.
“But today that has all changed. I stand here as leader of my country, flawed and human, where I am judged by my political actions and not my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.
“And I don’t think my country is the only one in the world where this story is possible. It is found in every country where liberty is cherished.
Brian LawlessBrian Lawless
Of course, the breakfast was dotted with the usual talk of Irish ancestry, with Pence stating that he yearned to return to his homestead in Ireland, adding that plans are underway for his mother and him to return this year.
The Taoiseach said he was delighted that the vice president had decided to take him up on his invite, and that he would happy if they could visit Ireland. Varadkar also commended Pence’s mother, who still has acúpla focal.
Gaffe free
The Taoiseach managed to avoid the gaffes of last year, limiting the jokes and anecdotes and keeping the mood rather serious in his speech on Capitol Hill.
The lunch is one of only two official occasions each year that the US president visits the Hill.

Taking to the podium, Trump said he had gotten to know his “friend” Varadkar “very well” in recent years, telling the crowd that he could barely believe this was his third St Patrick’s Day as president.

While there were tributes to the Irish diaspora, their hard-work and inspiration to America, the focus, just as it had in the Oval Office earlier, turned to Brexit.
Trump said Brexit is “turning out to be a little more complex than they thought it will be, but it’s all going to work out. It always does.”
He thanked Varadkar for briefing him on Ireland’s position, and said he respected the country’s position.
Earlier, sitting alongside Varadkar at the White House, Trump told reporters that he was surprised at just how badly Brexit negotiations had gone.
He also claimed tohave offered his advice to Theresa May, but said she didn’t listen to it (he didn’t expand on the nature of the advice).
There was notable tension in the air in the White House when Trump let rip into the EU for treating the US “badly”.
“They are willing to talk to us and if they don’t talk to us we are going to do something that is going to be pretty severe economically… they have treated us very badly,” said Trump, who then threatened to tariff European products.
At the lunch, Trump said Brexit had turned out to be a little more complex than expected, but he thanked the Taoiseach for bringing him up to speed.
While the UK’s exit from the EU dominated, Varadkar managed to get one other Irish issue into his speech: the E3 Visa.
The visa is currently only offered by the US to Australian citizens. Because Australians only use about half of their allotment, Ireland is seeking access to the remainder of the unused visas.
“I believe the new E3 visa programme is true to our shared history and offers a chance for a new generation of talented, hard-working dreamers to give something to this great country. I hope that will come to pass,” said Varadkar.
Later it emerged that Trumphad personally spokento the sole senator holding up progress on the issue.

There were some slightly odd, freewheeling comments from Trump later at the traditional shamrock ceremony, when the Presidentobserved of the Irish:
“They’re smart. They’re sharp. They’re great. And they’re brutal enemies!”
Varadkar, in his own speech, congratulated Trump on the “booming” American economy.
“Your ambition is to make America great again, and we can see the results today,” Varadkar said.

In the crowd, that peculiarly Irish-American phrase “top of the mornin’ to ya” could be heard.
But aside from that and Trump’s awkward pronunciation of Varadkar’s title (‘Tea-SHOCK’ … it had been spelt phonetically on the autocue) there weren’t too many cringeworthy moments this year, compared to the last few visits.
Nothing close to, for instance, Paul Ryan andthe Worst Pint of Guinness Imaginable.

https://www.thejournal.ie/contract-garda-shoes-4538733-Mar2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS issued an invitation to tender worth almost €6 million for the supply of footwear to An Garda Síochána and the Irish Defence Forces.
The contract requires the supply of shoes “in all stock sizes to both male and female members” of the gardaí and Defence Forces.
The estimated value of the tender for footwear for the gardaí is €2.5 million, with €3.3 million earmarked for footwear for the Defence Forces.
The duration of the contract is three years, with the option of extending it by a further 12 months.
After recent Budget provisions for an extra 800 gardaí, it is expected that there will be around 14,000 serving gardaí within the coming years.
The cost of the footwear, then, comes to around €180 per garda over the course of this contract.
In order to be awarded the contract, tenderers must submit two samples in sizes 9 and 10.
The gardaí require two types of footwear – a lightweight operational safety boot and a lightweight operational safety shoe.

There are no fewer than 38 specifications that these shoes must meet – including the type of leather used, padding foams, inner lining, heel grip and the laces used.
Examples are also given of what the shoes may look like when finished.
An Garda SíochánaAn Garda Síochána
An Garda SíochánaAn Garda Síochána
As of 31 January, meanwhile, there were 8,921 Defence Forces in Ireland. The requirements for footwear for the Defence Forces, however, are more extensive than that of the gardaí.

Within the tender documents, potential suppliers are also advised to consider any “Brexit considerations” in their proposals.
“Tenderers must provide as part of their proposed business plan a methodology demonstrating in a clear and comprehensive manner how they propose to deal with the different possibilities of the Brexit outcome,” the documents note.

https://www.thejournal.ie/amsterdam-red-light-district-4553194-Mar2019/,"FROM 1 JANUARY 2020, it will no longer be permitted for guided tours in the city of Amsterdam to go through the Red Light District, local authorities have said.
Authorities said that tours along the windows cause “a lot of bustle in the Red Light District and are not respectful towards sex workers”.
“That is why they are no longer allowed from next year,”the city said.
This measure forms part of strict new measures on guided tours in the city that will take effect next year.
This includes the prohibition of free tours and recruiting participants, imposing a tax on tourists who participate in a tour, and a maximum of 15-20 on these tours.
Currently, those offering tours in the Red Light District must apply for a special exemption and abide by certain rules. From next year, guided tours throughout the city will need to apply for these exemptions.

In evaluating the current exemption system, the city said that tours were still causing a nuisance for locals in Amsterdam.
A survey found that 80% of sex workers say the tourists being given the guided tours “have a negative impact” on their business, while a number of the workers are still experiencing abusive behaviour and unwanted photography.
More than 1,000 groups pass through the Oudekerksplein square in the Red Light district every week, and anyone who offer tours illegally will liable for a fine of €190, with fines rising as high as €2,500 for companies who repeatedly break the rules.
This is the latest of a series of steps from the Dutch capital to ease the pressure from tourism. Some 18 million tourists flock to Amsterdam every year – more than the entire population of the Netherlands.
The city has taken major steps to push back against unruly visitors, mainly groups of young men who roam the Wallen at weekends, on pub crawls or to celebrate stag parties drawn by easy access to drugs and prostitution.
It has instituted stiff fines and penalties for breaking public disturbance laws, while in August 2017 it announced compulsory clean-up breaks in streets and monitoring of crowds.

Justice Eileen Creedon told the six men and six women this morning that they will not hear any evidence today and are not required again until next Wednesday.
She added that she is “very conscious” of the level of media coverage the trial has attracted and the pressure that brings.
She reminded the jurors that they decide the case based only on what they hear in court, adding: “It’s being discussed by just about everyone in the country but don’t talk to anybody about the evidence.”

The trial will continue next week.
Quirke (50) of Breanshamore, Co Tipperary has pleaded not guilty to the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan.
Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving his girlfriend Mary Lowry’s home at about 6.30am.
His body was found in an underground run-off tank on the farm owned by Ms Lowry and leased by the accused at Fawnagown, Tipperary 22 months later in April 2013.
The prosecution claims Quirke murdered Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Ms Lowry (52).

https://www.thejournal.ie/denis-obrien-dail-4522891-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|5 Mar 2019
THE SUPREME COURT has ruled that Denis O’Brien’s privacy was not breached during a 2015 debate about the sale of Siteserv.
The judgement was delivered by Mr Justice Frank Clarke at a sitting of the Supreme Court in NUI Galway this morning.
The judgement came on foot of an appeal by the businessman againsta High Court decision from May 2017, when Ms Justice Úna Ní Raifeartaigh ruled in favour of the Clerk of the Dáil and the Dáil Committee on Procedures and Privileges (CPP).
O’Brien had argued that his privacy was breached by two TDs – Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty, and the Social Democrats’ Catherine Murphy – who gave statements to the Dáil during a 2015 debate about the sale of Siteserv.
The businessman alleged that those statements breached his constitutional right to privacy.
Those same statements were subsequently declared to be protected under privilege by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privilege (CPP), the committee against which the High Court action was based.
Dismissing his appeal today, Mr Justice Clarke found that the case against the CPP amounted to an indirect challenge to utterances made in the Dáil, which was not allowed.
He noted that there was a constitutional obligation on the Houses of Oireachtas to protect the constitutional rights of citizens in respect of matters that happened within them.
However, he also found that the CPP enjoyed the same immunity and privilege as the Houses of Oireachtas in how it considered complaints by citizens who felt their rights had been breached.
“The Court has concluded that the challenge with Mr O’Brien has sought to bring to the decision of the CPP involves, in substance, an indirect or collateral challenge to the utterances of the deputies themselves,” the judge ruled.
“If that should lead to a different result, then a court would have been, at least indirectly or collaterally, involved in dealing with utterances made in the Houses.

“In the Court’s view, such a course of action is impermissible under the Constitution.”
‘Chilling effect’
Both TDs involved in the case welcomed the decision, with Murphy saying it was further recognition by the courts that parliamentary privilege was an important aspect of Ireland’s democratic system.
“The public interest must always be to the fore and that is what has underpinned everything I have done to date,” she said in a statement.
However, she added that it was “hugely incumbent” on elected representatives to recognise the responsibility that came with the use of Dáil privilege.
Her comments were echoed by Doherty, who added that he had made his statement in the Dáil in the public interest and in good faith.
“I shudder to think of the effect on parliamentary debate and our democracy if this judgement had gone the other way,” he said.
“This would have a major chilling effect… illustrated by the fact that journalists themselves were unsure whether or not they could report the comments made by Catherine Murphy at the time.”
Today’s ruling was originally due last week, but was delayed because of a ruling in a separate, unrelated hearinginvolving the Public Accounts Committee.
It is the second – also unrelated – case O’Brien has lost in the courts in the past week.
On Friday, the businessmanlost a High Court actionclaiming defamation against the Sunday Business Post over articles the newspaper published in March 2015.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/philippa-perry-the-book-you-wish-your-parents-had-read-4519745-Mar2019/,"PSYCHOTHERAPIST PHILIPPA PERRY has written a new book about parenting – called The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read. In it, she explores how to parent well and give your children a healthy upbringing – while not being too hard on yourself. Here are her practical thoughts on ‘the monster under the bed’.
When they are very small, children may talk of ghosts or monsters under the bed. Rather than paying attention to the story or the reason they give, pay attention to the feeling they are expressing.
Instead of dismissing the idea that there are monsters under the bed out of hand, name the feeling the monsters seem to be representing. “You sound scared, can you tell me a bit more?” Or, “Let’s make up a story about these monsters. What are their names?”
If you do this, you may be able to vanquish the monsters. Do whatever fits your natural style; it isn’t so much the words we use, it’s staying with our children until they feel soothed rather than dismissing them as silly.
For all you know, those monsters may be representing your impatience at bedtime or something else complicated that your child can’t articulate.
Even when it’s impossible to trace the source of every feeling, that doesn’t mean the feeling isn’t real. It still needs validating. And making your child feel silly with a “don’t be silly – you know monsters are made up” is unlikely to soothe them.
What’s important is to keep the lines of communication open.
Advertisement
If you dismiss your child by telling them they’re being silly, they learn not only to clam up on the ‘silly’ communications but also those you wouldn’t consider silly.
The distinction between ‘silly’ and ‘not silly’ is so clear to us we might assume it is to a child as well. But nobody can help feeling what they feel, even if other people would feel differently in the same situation, even if other people think it is silly.
You want to be the person your child can talk to. If you tell them they are being silly to complain when Granny made them a nice lentil stew, they may feel they can’t tell you when the creepy piano teacher puts his hand on their leg.
The difference between those two things is loud and clear to us but to a child they are both filed under “something icky”. And if some icky things are dismissed as irrelevant by you, your child is likely to feel it is not worth the humiliation of sharing any more of them.
You may think this is an extreme example because Granny’s stew and a piano teacher touching a child’s leg are so very different. But your child has not been in the world as long as you have, has not had all your experience, has not read everything you have read, has not yet understood sexuality.
Your child may not have learned to register alarm at being touched inappropriately in the same way as they feel alarmed about eating something they don’t like.
To them, both are an assault on their senses. Telling a child they are being silly about anything will close down communications from them to you, and that might be a dangerous thing to do.

Brian Sheerin of the Racing Post writes:“The winning machine that is Altior has a record in his sights as he seeks to continue his ruthless domination of the two-mile chasing division by posting his fourth consecutive success at the Cheltenham Festival in today’s feature Queen Mother Champion Chase.“After victories in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and Racing Post Arkle, Altior last year devoured the Cheltenham hill once more to defeat Min in this race.If he can now retain that title his unbeaten run will be extended to 18 races, the jumping world record held by Big Buck’s.“It was a Tuesday to forget for Gordon Elliott with the leading trainer at the previous two festivals drawing a blank on the opening day, but better can be expected on Wednesday, with horses like Delta Work to look forward to.“As a festival winner unbeaten over fences, it is not hard to see why Delta Work heads the market for the RSA Novices Chase, and he’ll be ridden by Davy Russell.Elliott also has strong claims in the Ballymore Novices Hurdle with Battleoverdoyen while Tiger Roll will be bidding to win back-to-back Glenfarclas Cross Country Chases under Keith Donoghue.”13 Mar 20193:21PMOne of our tipsters Thom Malone looks ahead to Altior’s record-breaking opportunity.“Altior is looking to break the record for consecutive wins over obstacles. He holds it jointly with Big Bucks with a scarcely credible 17 victories in a row. He has turned up at the last three festivals and won by seven lengths in the Supreme, six lengths in the Arkle and seven lengths in last year’s Champion Chase. He is a phenom and there is little to no reason why he won’t win again. Min is the second-best horse in the race, and has finished second anytime he has come up against Altior.There’s no reason he can flip that form, nothing else is even close. Altior is odds-on, arguably not that short, given his record. Frankel was dossing around the place at 1/20 at a similar stage in his career. After Altior wins on Wednesday, and he will win, debates will rage as to where next for this superstar. Enjoy those debates and enjoy this horse, a true champion.”13 Mar 20193:31PMBrian Gleeson reports that one punter has put a hundred grand on Altior to win £40,000.13 Mar 20193:32PMAnd they’re off!13 Mar 20193:34PMFour to jump, Altior’s in second behind Saint Calvados.13 Mar 20193:36PMAltior had to win ugly after a dodgy last fence but he powered home in the end!13 Mar 20193:39PM‘He found it hard work but what an absolute monster,’ says jockey, Nico de Boinville, ‘I think we should just celebrate him.’13 Mar 20193:40PMQueen Mother Champion Chase result1.Altior Nico de Boinville 4-112.Politologue H Cobden 11-13.Sceau Royal D A Jacob 16-113 Mar 20193:51PMTrainer of Altior, Nicky Henderson looks emotional as he chats to reporters: ”He had to have a little fight but he made it exciting for everybody; including myself!“I think he was getting a little lonely but as soon as Nico said go he was off. It was a cracking good race for everybody; for me it was hell.“He can do anything; Saint Calvados went a good gallop which helped us. Altior made one mistake at the water but that was about it. We’re incredibly lucky to have a horse like this. To have had two horses consecutively in your life like these two (Sprinter Sacre as well) is incredible.”[via Five Live]13 Mar 20193:55PMIt’s the Cross Country Chase up next at 4.10.“Tiger Roll should be the most famous horse in training,” writes Thom Malone, “He’s seeking victory at a fourth Cheltenham Festival when he attempts to defend his Cross-Country crown on Wednesday.“He’s favourite to become the first horse since Red Rum to win back to back Grand Nationals at Aintree. He will not be revered like an Altior, but his achievements are impressive if unorthodox. After he won the two-mile Triumph Hurdle in 2014, he only won once in his next 11 starts.“He was then switched to fences and a further 11 starts later he won at the Festival again, this time over four miles. Some argue that the real skill of training a horse is concealing his true ability; Tiger Roll looked to be thoroughly exposed. It had taken him 25 races to begin to show his true ability. Hardly the form profile to suggest the Tiger was a star in the making. Since that win at the 2017 festival, Gordon Elliot’s little star has earned a lighter workload, with considerable success.

Like the course officials at Prestbury Park, we had an early morning inspection and we’re good to go too for Day 2.
After yesterday’s hugely dramatic afternoon, today looks like — in theory — a less surprising day.
Who do you fancy then?
Stephen Ward is taking in the action today. As is a certain Grand Slam-chasing Wales coach.

Altior looks unbackable in today’s feature race. The Nicky Henderson-trained runner is the overwhelming favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase.
This is how confident The42 readers are:

The first of the day is theBallymore Novices’ Hurdleat 1030.pm. There’s lot of support for 9-2Battleoverdoyen, under Jack Kennedy, as Gordon Elliott will hope to get off the mark.
AP McCoy will be a particularly interested spectator however; as Thom Malon writes:
He was a 20-time champion jockey, in fairness, he earned the nickname. Sir Anthony, as he can now be called, was synonymous with the green and gold JP McManus silks. On Wednesday the horse, Champ, named in honour of the great man is near the top of the market for the Ballymore Hurdle. Sometimes little should be read into a horse’s name. This appears not to be the case here.
AP famously said of his employer, “JP has a plan for every horse”. The same man had a plan for Limerick hurling, and that worked out ok.
The horse has done little wrong thus far, winning his last four starts. In the opener on Wednesday, he faces his stiffest task to date. Champ the jockey was renowned for his strength in adversity, how heavy will the expectation of the moniker weigh on the horseChamp?”
Andy Murray arrives at Prestbury Park.Andrew MatthewsAndrew Matthews
And we’re away in the first of the day!
Phew! Apologies for some technical disruption at a crucial time.
In the meantime, Mark Walsh has steered City Island to the win ahead of Champ. It’s Walsh’s second win so far of the Festival.
That’s a fifth winner of the week for Ireland by my count. Trainer Martin Brassil chats to ITV; it’s his first Festival victory.
1.City Island (M P Walsh) 8-1
2. Champ (B Geraghty) 9-2
3. Bright Forecast (Nico de Boinville) 25-1
It’s theRSA Novice Chase next up at 2.30.  We got Katie Walsh’s tips earlier in the week and she had a fancy for one runner in this renewal.
“I’m a big fan ofDelta Work(15/8) in the RSA Chase, he deserves to be a short price favourite. He’s not flashy, he just sticks his neck out and tries. He gets it done. He beat Le Richebourg earlier in the season and that form is all tying together nicely.”
AP McCoy just spoke really, really strongly on the BHA decision yesterday to ban three rider who were deemed to have “continued in the race when it appeared to be contrary to the horse’s welfare” after the National hunt Chase. ‘It’s indefensible’ he insisted and questioned why an Australian was making the decision.
We’re almost ready for the line and Delta Work, under Davy Russell, is looking pretty relaxed, we’re told.
He heads the market at 9-4, the Nicky Henderson-trained Santini is second favourite at 3-1, while Topofthegame is 7-2.
There’s a bit of pressure on the Russell-Elliott combination to work their magic here.
And they’re off with little bother.
Top Ville Ben is down but both horse and jockey, Sean Quinlan, look fine.
Topofthegamejumps like a stag on the last to put himself in front ahead of Santini and storms home for a Paul Nichols win.
Jockey Harry Cobden says this could be the start for this horse.
1. Topofthegame (H Cobden) 4-1
2. Santini (Nico de Boinville) 3-1
3. Delta Work (D N Russell) 15-8 Fav

Willie Mullins has half a dozen rider going off in the next race, theCoral Cup Handicap Hurdle; Russell and Elliott will go again with Farclas meanwhile.
Paul Nicholls is back in the winners’ enclosure at Cheltenham thanks to Topofthegame and he’s not exactly talking him down. “There were shades of Denman there. We’ve always thought a lot about it. He’s got it all, he’s got pace, he’s got the jumping. He was unlucky as Exeter but was that the making of him?
“He travelled too well at Kempton but perfectly today. He’s rated the same as Denman and he’s only going to get better. That was a cool, first-class ride from Harry. His 99th win of the season.”Via BBC

Here’s that angry AP McCoy reaction to the jockey ban news, which we mentioned earlier:

And we’re off in the 2.50pm!
Monbeg Theatre is leading the way with four to jump…
Wicklow Brave’s in front at the last…
What a finish! I think William Henry won it by a nose from Wicklow Brave!
William Henry gets the win at 28-1!
1.William Henry (Nico de Boinville) 28-1
2.Wicklow Brave (Mr Patrick Mullins) 28-1
3.Ballyandy (Sam Twiston-Davies) 14-1
4.Brio Conti (Harry Cobden) 10-1
Patrick Mullins on Wicklow Brave sportingly congratulates Nico de Boinville, William Henry’s jockey.
So it’s the big one next up with Altior as close to a dead cert as you can get in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Brian Sheerin of the Racing Post writes:
“The winning machine that is Altior has a record in his sights as he seeks to continue his ruthless domination of the two-mile chasing division by posting his fourth consecutive success at the Cheltenham Festival in today’s feature Queen Mother Champion Chase.
“After victories in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and Racing Post Arkle, Altior last year devoured the Cheltenham hill once more to defeat Min in this race.
If he can now retain that title his unbeaten run will be extended to 18 races, the jumping world record held by Big Buck’s.
“It was a Tuesday to forget for Gordon Elliott with the leading trainer at the previous two festivals drawing a blank on the opening day, but better can be expected on Wednesday, with horses like Delta Work to look forward to.
“As a festival winner unbeaten over fences, it is not hard to see why Delta Work heads the market for the RSA Novices Chase, and he’ll be ridden by Davy Russell.Elliott also has strong claims in the Ballymore Novices Hurdle with Battleoverdoyen while Tiger Roll will be bidding to win back-to-back Glenfarclas Cross Country Chases under Keith Donoghue.”
One of our tipsters Thom Malone looks ahead to Altior’s record-breaking opportunity.
“Altior is looking to break the record for consecutive wins over obstacles. He holds it jointly with Big Bucks with a scarcely credible 17 victories in a row. He has turned up at the last three festivals and won by seven lengths in the Supreme, six lengths in the Arkle and seven lengths in last year’s Champion Chase. He is a phenom and there is little to no reason why he won’t win again. Min is the second-best horse in the race, and has finished second anytime he has come up against Altior.
There’s no reason he can flip that form, nothing else is even close. Altior is odds-on, arguably not that short, given his record. Frankel was dossing around the place at 1/20 at a similar stage in his career. After Altior wins on Wednesday, and he will win, debates will rage as to where next for this superstar. Enjoy those debates and enjoy this horse, a true champion.”
Brian Gleeson reports that one punter has put a hundred grand on Altior to win £40,000.
And they’re off!
Four to jump, Altior’s in second behind Saint Calvados.
Altior had to win ugly after a dodgy last fence but he powered home in the end!
‘He found it hard work but what an absolute monster,’ says jockey, Nico de Boinville, ‘I think we should just celebrate him.’
1.Altior Nico de Boinville 4-11
2.Politologue H Cobden 11-1
3.Sceau Royal D A Jacob 16-1

Trainer of Altior, Nicky Henderson looks emotional as he chats to reporters: ”He had to have a little fight but he made it exciting for everybody; including myself!
“I think he was getting a little lonely but as soon as Nico said go he was off. It was a cracking good race for everybody; for me it was hell.
“He can do anything; Saint Calvados went a good gallop which helped us. Altior made one mistake at the water but that was about it. We’re incredibly lucky to have a horse like this. To have had two horses consecutively in your life like these two (Sprinter Sacre as well) is incredible.”
[via Five Live]
It’s the Cross Country Chase up next at 4.10.
“Tiger Roll should be the most famous horse in training,” writes Thom Malone, “He’s seeking victory at a fourth Cheltenham Festival when he attempts to defend his Cross-Country crown on Wednesday.
“He’s favourite to become the first horse since Red Rum to win back to back Grand Nationals at Aintree. He will not be revered like an Altior, but his achievements are impressive if unorthodox. After he won the two-mile Triumph Hurdle in 2014, he only won once in his next 11 starts.
“He was then switched to fences and a further 11 starts later he won at the Festival again, this time over four miles. Some argue that the real skill of training a horse is concealing his true ability; Tiger Roll looked to be thoroughly exposed. It had taken him 25 races to begin to show his true ability. Hardly the form profile to suggest the Tiger was a star in the making. Since that win at the 2017 festival, Gordon Elliot’s little star has earned a lighter workload, with considerable success. There have only been eight starts since that 2017 win, he’s won half of them, including the biggest race of them all at Aintree. On Wednesday the little Tiger can continue to Roll his own way.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-meltdown-4540958-Mar2019/,"LAST NIGHT, THE House of Commons voted against a no-deal Brexit.
But the vote wasn’t straightforward as Prime Minister Theresa Maylost control over her own partyas MPs voted on a series of amendments before the main vote.
After last night’s chaos, today will see yet another vote in Westminster as parliament now votes on whether to delay Brexit until the end of June.
And, as if back from the dead, May has signalled her intentions to bring back her withdrawal agreement and put it to a vote AGAIN – after it was soundly defeated twice already.
This morning’s papers in the UK took largely similar takes on the latest Brexit debacle.
No fewer than three newspapers opted for the word meltdown in their front page headlines.
The Times of London described a “Brexit meltdown” where “May’s deal [is] back from the dead”. The paper also says May will have secret talks with the DUP and Brexiteers to secure some compromise.

The I leads simply with “meltdown”, with 13 pages of coverage of last night’s events inside.

The Daily Mirror also goes with “meltdown” and says rebel ministers inflicted another “humiliating defeat” on the prime minister.

In its headline, the Daily Mail said that “chaos reigns”, and adds that May lost control after “ministers’ mass revolt to rule out no deal”.

The Guardian go with “May’s final warning to Tory rebels: back me or lose Brexit”.

In the Daily Telegraph, it says: “Brexit delayed until further notice after gang of four rebels.”

The Daily Express, meanwhile, describes a “defiant May” and headlines the front page with “don’t let EU bullies win the day”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/man-who-trapped-and-attacked-woman-in-laneway-jailed-for-five-years-4525697-Mar2019/,"A MAN WHO trapped and attacked a woman before beginning to masturbate in front of her has been jailed for five years.
Chico Makamda (36) with an address at Viking House, Coffee House Lane, The Quay, Waterford, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to sexual assault, false imprisonment and robbery at Adare Lane, Dublin, on 16 April 2018.
Judge Melanie Greally sentenced him to seven and a half years for the offences of false imprisonment and robbery, but suspended the final two and a half years for a period of two and a half years on condition that he leave the country within 14 days of his release.
Judge Greally also sentenced him to four years for the offence of sexual assault, which will run concurrently with the other sentences. She backdated the sentence to 16 April 2018, the day he first went into custody.
Garda Ruth Finnegan told Elva Duffy, prosecuting, that in the early hours of the morning a woman in her early fifties was on her way home after a night out when she stopped in Adare Lane to relieve herself behind some bins.
Makamda approached her and blocked her in beside the bins. He punched her three times in the stomach and she fell onto the ground, hitting her head on the concrete.

He attempted to pull her jeans down and kept trying to lie on top of her while the woman tried to stop him. He then stood up, took out his penis and began masturbating.
The woman managed to stand up and pull her jeans fully up. Makamda put his penis away but continued to block her from escaping.
Makamda fled when another man arrived and said he would call the gardaí. After he was gone the woman realised that her wallet and phone were missing from her handbag.
Finnegan agreed with Paul Carroll, defending, that a lot of what his client said in interview “does not make a heap of sense”.
Makamda has 15 previous convictions, including for an offence of indecency and for the false imprisonment of a woman in a laneway. He is originally from Angola and has been in Ireland since 2009.
Carroll said his client had no connection with any family members and had effectively been homeless for some time. He asked the judge to take into consideration the fact that Makamda had a low range of cognitive ability according to a psychiatric report.
Judge Greally said it was clear from the victim impact report that the woman had been “completely traumatised” and that she now fears to go outside. She said each of the offences were aggravated by the impact they had on the victim and by the level of violence.
She said she was taking into consideration his early guilty pleas, his admissions to gardaí, his social isolation in Ireland and the difficulty that prisoners from outside the country face while imprisoned.

https://www.thejournal.ie/yellow-vest-protest-paris-march-2019-4546558-Mar2019/,"A MOTHER AND her child have been rescued by French firefighters after yellow vest protesters set a residential building ablaze on another day of demonstrations in Paris.
Protesters looted luxury stores and clashed with police this afternoon as part of the 18th consecutive weekend of demonstrations against French president Emmanuel Macron.
The violence started when protesters threw smoke bombs and other objects at police along the Champs Elysees and targeted a police van, prompting riot police to retreat.
Fires were put out at two newspaper kiosks, which sent black smoke high into the sky, and several protesters smiled as they posed for a photo in front of one charred kiosk.
Among the buildings targeted by demonstrators was a bank on the ground floor of a seven-storey residential block.
Eleven people in the building, including two firefighters, sustained light injuries, as other residents – including a mother and child - were evacuated.

Symbols of the luxury were also targeted, as shops selling Hugo Boss and Lacoste items were smashed-up and had their mannequins thrown out of windows.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner estimated that up to 8,000 demonstrators were in Paris today, including 1,500 “ultraviolent ones that are there to smash things up”.
Castaner ordered police to retaliate against these “inadmissible” acts, condemning those who “call for violence and are here to ferment chaos in Paris”.
French police attempted to contain the demonstrators with tear gas and water cannon with limited success.
Paris police told Associated Press that 82 people were arrested by mid-afternoon.
The rioting comes at the end of a two-month national debate that Macron organised to respond to protesters’ concerns about sinking living standards, stagnant wages and high unemployment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-brexit-march-4546874-Mar2019/,"BRITISH MEP NIGEL Farage has begun a 435-kilometre march to London to demand that Britain leaves the EU this month.
Around 100 Brexit supporters have joined the Eurosceptic politician on the journey from Sunderland to the House of Commons, which is expected to conclude on 29 March.
Speaking at the start of the march today, Farage explained to reporters that the march was beginning from the northeastern city because it was a “symbolic” location.
“It was the Sunderland result on the night of the [Brexit] referendum that made us think — wow, this is going to happen,” he said before setting off.
“I believe we are witnessing a betrayal. I think we are witnessing, in terms of our nation’s democratic history, one of the saddest chapters.”
However, Farage also admitted that he intends to cover just a third of the trek to London.
“Unfortunately, I have a European summit to go to, one or two things like that,” he told the BBC.
It comes as British Prime Minister Theresa May attempts to push her EU withdrawal deal through the House of Commons for a third time.
If it is approved, the prime minister will ask the remaining 27 EU leaders to sign off on a Brexit deadline extension through June to allow parliament to pass the necessary legislation.
If the deal is rejected again, May will have to seek a longer delay that some EU leaders have said could last through the end of next year.

However, many on the mach felt that an extension would go against the will of those who voted to leave the EU.
“We are a little forgotten by the politicians,” retired banker Christopher Treggelis said.
“My democratic vote has been ignored,” pensioner Steve Coward added as the group set off along their North Sea route for the town of Hartlepool some 20 miles to the south.
“I’m taking to my second right, which is to protest peacefully about the parliament ignoring my democratic vote,” he added.
Other marchers brandished Union Jacks and signs reading “Democracy” and “Liberty”.
Some said that any economic pain caused by the breakup would be short-lived and worth the benefits of greater independence.
Sunderland store owner Janice McBeth said she was sure “this country will thrive” down the line.
“I’m not naive – it might be difficult, a few shortages, trade barriers,” she said. “But it will be sorted out.”
The march is designed to echo similar processions witnessed in England’s northeastern coalfields in the 1930s that saw workers protest poverty and the closure of a big shipyard.
The Jarrow March of 1936 was the most famous, with a few hundred people reaching London and treated as heroes once they returned home.

https://www.thejournal.ie/online-safety-act-richard-bruton-4522600-Mar2019/,"A NEW ONLINE Safety Act to improve online safety and ensure that children can be protected online has been proposed by Minister for Communications Richard Bruton.
Bruton proposed harmful online content that needs to be targeted under his plan includes serious cyber bullying, material which promotes self-harm or suicide and material designed to encourage prolonged nutritional deprivation that would have the effect of exposing a person to risk of death.
An Online Safety Act, according to Bruton, would place new requirements on operators to:
“The situation at present where online and social media companies are not subject to any oversight or regulation by the State for the content which is shared on their platforms is no longer sustainable,” Bruton said.
“I believe that the era of self-regulation in this area is over and a new Online Safety Act is necessary,” he said.
Online Safety Commissioner
Bruton said that in passing an Online Safety Act, it was important to set out clearly the powers and role of an Online Safety Commissioner.
It is proposed that a number of powers could be provided to the Commissioner.
Advertisement
For example, the Commissioner would certify that each Online Safety Code is either “fit for purpose” or requires changes to it.
The Commissioner would also require a service to remove an individual piece of content within a set timeframe, on receipt of an appeal from a user who is dissatisfied with the response they have received to a complaint submitted to the service provider.
They would also, among other powers, be able to impose administrative fines in relation to failures of compliance and publish the fact that a service has failed to comply or cooperate with the regulator.
“Many parents find it difficult to keep up with the latest technology, or the latest app. That is understandable given how quickly online games and technology can evolve. To me it emphasises why the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner is so important,” Bruton said.
Bruton said there are two ways in which an Online Safety Commissioner can be established including through a new Media Commission by restructuring the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), along the lines of the multi-Commissioner Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.
Alternatively, he said there could be two regulatory bodies, one of which would involve restructuring the BAI and assigning its responsibility for content which is subject to editorial control (such as traditional television and radio). The second online safety regulator would be a new body responsible for online content that is not subject to editorial controls (such as social media).
Consultation
The Minister also announced the commencement of a six-week consultation period on the options which he has set out today.
“I urge all parents and students, all teachers, all industry and groups who have views on these issues and who have concerns about possible impacts to make their views known so that we can take them into account as we develop legal proposals which are implementable,” Bruton said.
Following the consultation period, Bruton will be a draft Bill to government, setting out a detailed plan of how progress will be made.","8.28am, 4 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/new-zealand-assault-rifles-4553171-Mar2019/,"
NEW ZEALAND IS banning the sale of assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons with immediate effect, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today, rapidly delivering on a pledge to tighten the country’s gun laws.
The move comes less than a week after a white supremacist rampaged through two mosques killing 50 people as they prayed, sparking global revulsion.
“Every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country,” Ardern told a press conference.
Besides assault rifles and military-style semi-automatics, Ardern said the ban includes high-capacity magazines and devices similar to bump stocks – which can turn ordinary rifles into virtual semi-automatics.
Legislation will be introduced in parliament when it meets in early April, but an interim measure means a ban on new purchases has – for practical purposes – already been enacted.
Reaction in the still-shocked country was positive.
“It’s a good thing, why would we need to have guns like this in our houses?” Kawthar Abulaban, 54, who survived the shooting at Al Noor mosque told AFP.
“The semi-automatics, why would you keep that inside your house? It’s not right.”
‘Real action’
Alleged shooter Brenton Tarrant livestreamed the carnage in real-time, and the horrific scenes have prompted global concern over access to guns and the use of social media by extremists.
New Zealand’s ban looked likely to intensify the gun debate, with debate sparked on Twitter almost immediately after the announcement as Americans and others around the world praised Ardern’s quick action, while American gun supporters called for defence of their constitutional right to bear arms.
US Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the praise for the ban.
“This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like,” Sanders tweeted.
“We must follow New Zealand’s lead, take on the NRA (National Rifle Association) and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.”
No reaction was immediately seen on the feed of US President Donald Trump.
Bidding farewell
For a second day, hundreds of mourners gathered under grey skies in the shattered city to lay to rest more dead, including a local convert to Islam and an elderly man who died trying to greet his white supremacist killer.
Amid the prayers and sobs there were Muslims, non-Muslims, schoolchildren and even at one point a phalanx of bikers.

Pupils wept and embraced as they said goodbye to 14-year-old Sayyad Milne and 24-year-old Tariq Omar.
Sayyad’s father John Milne said his son was gunned down while praying at Al Noor, the first of the two mosques attacked.
Milne, who was at Thursday’s funeral, had previously described his son as “my special little one” who longed to play for Manchester United.
Mourners arrived at the cemetery in long lines, schoolgirls struggling to keep scarves on their heads in windy conditions.
A mournful cry of “Allahu Akbar” over a loudspeaker signalled that the service had begun. Mourners prayed before lifting the two victims above their heads and carrying them to their graves.
Many shed tears, and held one another for support, as they left the cemetery following the ceremonies.
Omar coached junior football teams.
Local media reported that he was dropped off at the Al Noor mosque on the day of the killings by his mother, who survived the attack because she was trying to find a parking space when the gunman launched his assault.
“He was one of those people that everyone knew,” Cashmere pupil Bailey Jordan, 15, told AFP as he left the funeral, which he described as “really heartfelt…a tough time for everyone.”
Christchurch United Academy Director Colin Williamson described Omar as “a beautiful human being with a tremendous heart and love for coaching”.
‘Number of graves waiting’
One neighbour of the Milne family said the service was “very respectful, very moving” and attended by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
She said she looked across the cemetery to see that so many more funerals would need to be held in the coming days.
“What struck me was the number of graves waiting… and the area they took up,” the woman, who declined to be named, told AFP.
In a rambling “manifesto”, Tarrant said he was motivated partly by a desire to stoke religious conflict between Islam and the West.
But people of all faiths in Christchurch have come together to mourn and denounce the killings, with the city festooned in flowers, cards and tributes.
New Zealanders had already begun answering government appeals to hand in their weapons, prompting a barrage of derogatory messages online — most apparently from the US pro-gun lobby.
Families of the victims had faced days of anxious waiting to receive the bodies as criminal investigators and pathologists rushed to formally identify each person.
But police said today that all 50 victims had been identified.

FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE analyst Chelsea Manning has been jailed for refusing to testify to a grand jury investigating Wikileaks.
Manning was jailed today for contempt of court after a brief hearing in which she confirmed she had no intention of testifying. Manning told judge Claude Hilton she “will accept whatever you bring upon me”.
Manning said she objects to the secrecy of the grand jury process and that she already revealed everything that she knows at her court martial.
Manning will remain in jail until she testifies or until the grand jury concludes its work, Hilton has said.

Manning served seven years of a 35-year military sentence for leaking military and diplomatic documents to anti-secrecy website Wikileaks before then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence.
Manning’s lawyers asked that she be sent to home confinement instead of the prison due to medical complications she faces.
Hilton said US marshals can handle her medical care, however. Prosecutor Tracy McCormick said that US marshals have assured the government that Manning’s medical needs can be met.
Manning anticipated being jailed. In a statement before today’s hearing, she invoked her First, Fourth and Sixth amendment protections when she appeared before the grand jury in Alexandria on Wednesday.
Manning said she had already answered every substantive question during her 2013 court-martial and is prepared to face the consequences of refusing to answer again.
“In solidarity with many activists facing the odds, I will stand by my principles,” Manning said. “I will exhaust every legal remedy available”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/radicalised-france-inmate-knife-attack-4526047-Mar2019/,"A ‘RADICALISED’ INMATE at a prison in France has been shot and injured in a police raid after he seriously wounded two guards in a knife attack, sources told AFP.
The raid also left his visiting partner fatally wounded.
Prisoner Michael Chiolo and his female partner were in the family-visiting area of a high-security prison in Normandy when police moved in and detained them, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on Twitter.
Chiolo and his partner were shot and wounded in the operation.
“The woman died” of her injuries, a source close to the case said. Chiolo was less seriously wounded in the cheek.
Elite police units moved in some 10 hours after 27-year-old Chiolo wounded the prison guards with a knife.
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet suggested the knife might have been smuggled into the prison by his partner.
“There is no doubt as to the terrorist nature of this attack,” Belloubet told reporters earlier.
‘Radicalised’
Chiolo, who was serving a 30-year sentence, is thought to have become a “radicalised” Islamist while in prison.
Chiolo was serving his sentence for kidnapping leading to a death, armed robbery and condoning terrorism.

He and an accomplice were sentenced on appeal in 2015 for choking to death an 89-year-old man they had tied up while robbing his home.
He was also sentenced to a year in jail – when already in prison – for asking fellow inmates to “reenact” an attack by Islamic State gunmen on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November 2015.
During his rampage this week, he shouted “Allahu Akhbar”, a prison staff representative told AFP.
France has suffered a series of deadly attacks from Islamist extremists since 2015 and is on high alert amid concerns about the return of Islamic State group jihadists from Syria.
The Paris state prosecutor said separately that accounts by witnesses suggested Chiolo “wanted to avenge” Cheriff Chekatt.
Chekatt was shot dead by police after killing five people and wounding 11at a Christmas marketin the eastern French city of Strasbourg in December.
Demands from prison officers
The attack comes as French prison staff, who have been demanding better working conditions, have repeatedly stage weekly protests on Tuesdays.
In January 2018, prison staff held three weeks of protests after a guard was attacked by a jihadist inmate at a high-security jail in northern France.
Trade unions and experts have continuously warned of the spread of extremism in French prisons. This has to the government to build special facilities to house dangerous individuals who are sometimes held in solitary confinement.
The Conde-sur-Sarthe prison, where the latest rampage occured, is one of France’s most secure jails. Unlike other facilities, it doesn’t suffer from overcrowding, according to Belloubet.
Despite having been identified as an extremist, Chiolo was not housed in a secure wing for radicalised inmates which was opened in September, she added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trinity-investigate-bugging-incident-university-times-4552190-Mar2019/,"TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN has launched an investigation after reporters from one of the university’s student newspapers planted a recording device outside a student’s on-campus apartment where an alleged society hazing event was taking place.
Editors of the University Times are now facing a petition calling on them to step down over the “bugging incident” but the paper says it stands over its reporting.
Last Friday, theUniversity Timespublished a story about the initiation ceremony of an elite, invite-only sporting society and admitted it planted a recording device outside the apartment of the society’s president.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, Trinity College Dublin confirmed that an investigation is progressing which is being conducted by the Junior Dean.
The university added that a separate investigation was also underway into the alleged hazing incident reported by the University Times (UT).
‘Bend over’
The UT had reported that on 27 February theKnights of Campanileheld an initiation ceremony on campus which started in the main square, moving on to the apartment of the all-male society’s president.
Reporters who waited outside the apartment said they heard members being hazed inside. Members were allegedly being told to “bend over”, to “get in the shower” and that “it’s gonna be a long night boys”.
“The reporters placed a recording device outside the apartment and proceeded to wait upstairs out of sight for over an hour and a half,” the UT reported.
The device was discovered when society members left the apartment and moved to another location.

UT has said that the device is still in the possession of the society and therefore any quotes used in its article are from reporters on the scene and not from the device.
The paper’s editor, Eleanor O’Mahony, toldTheJournal.iethat on the night in question they had not planned on using the recording device but did so because “one of our reporters had it on hand”.
O’Mahony added that those involved in the report have no intention of stepping down and continue to stand over their work.
“We take our work seriously. We’re happy to stand over our reporting,” she said.
‘Integrity destroyed’
Earlier today, Trinity News reported that apetition had been launchedto remove the funding for the University Times editor’s salary and accommodation from the Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union constitution.
O’Mahony said that the petition was “personally very disappointing”.
“The aftermath of controversy like this is not the time to make decisions about the long-term future of the paper,” she said.
In a recent editorial,Trinity News- a separate college publication - called for the students involved in the story to face consequences as it claims their actions have “breached any code of journalistic ethics worth the name”.
“If UT escapes this situation with no consequences, and believe, as both the current and incoming editors who wrote the story seem to, that secret recordings are acceptable news sources, then students should be worried,” Trinity News said in an editorial this week.
The paper argues that the UT will be tainted if the editors remain in their positions.
The Knights of Campanile toldTheJournal.iethat it would not make an official comment on the incident until the investigation by TCD is complete.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-varadkar-white-house-shamrock-4541992-Mar2019/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has said that he hopes to visit Ireland this year while meeting Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office in the White House.
Describing Ireland as a “special place”, Trump referenced his golf resort at Doonbeg in Co Clare.
“I have a very warm spot for Doonbeg, I will tell you that. And, it’s just a great place,” he said.
The US leader made similar comments during last year’s sit down in Washington DC.
Before travelling to the White House the Taoiseach indicated that he and Trump would discuss future trade deals between the US and the UK and he would urge the president not to sign any deal that would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Speaking to reporters alongside Varadkar ahead of their private meeting, Trump said that he will stay out of the Brexit negotiations but hopes that the discussions work out.
He added that he’s surprised how badly the talks have gone and said that UK Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to follow his advice on how to handle the negotiations.
Speaking after the meeting Varadkar said he and Trump have “very different views” on whether Brexit is a good or bad thing.

“It was a real opportunity for me to set out Ireland’s position, particularly when it comes to protecting the Peace Process, the Good Friday agreement and avoiding a hard border,” the Taoiseach said.
He added that the pair also discussed immigration and Trump offered “strong support” for securing more visas for Irish people to work in the US and also backed aiding the plight of the undocumented Irish in America.
Breakfast
This morning Vice President Mike Pencehosted Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrettfor breakfast at his residence on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in Washington.

A NATIONAL ORGANISATION that promotes reading for children is warning that government budget cuts have gutted school libraries, leaving many students across Ireland without books to read.
Children’s Books Ireland (CBI) say the situation has been deteriorating since the Department of Education withdrew its €2.2 million grant for school libraries in 2008 and now many schools are left with a dated stock of tatty unsuitable books while newly built schools have dedicated libraries with nothing on their shelves.
Two years ago the CBI launched Robert Dunbar Memorial Libraries, a book-gifting programme named after its late patron, in a bid to stop the rot. It was immediately flooded with 300 applications from schools across the country.
“Reading those applications was very, very grim,” Director of CBI, Elaina Ryan, toldTheJournal.ie.

“The same situation was playing out in schools all across the country. Primary and secondary. Urban and rural. It can be particularly keenly felt in rural areas where the kids run out of books and there’s no public library nearby. The kids are left with nothing.”
The situation has also left many teachers buying books with their own money and numerous schools have been left unable to provide books for students who have learning difficulties or those who use English as an additional language.
This year the all-island Robert Dunbar Memorial Libraries programme is being gifted to four schools in Dublin, Tipperary, Derry and Belfast. The schools will each receive a library worth €8,000 as well as a ‘Patron of Reading’ programme, training for students and staff and resources and print materials worth a combined €40,000.

The organisation has launched asurveyin partnership with UCD and the School Library Association to get hard stats about the health of school libraries across the country.
The survey will run until the end of the school year and CBI is urging all schools to take part so it can present a detailed picture of schools’ needs to the Department of Education.
This year’s Robert Dunbar Memorial Libraries winners are:

https://www.thejournal.ie/hookah-shisha-warning-american-heart-association-4529928-Mar2019/,"SMOKING TOBACCO IN hookahs results in inhaling toxic chemicals, often at levels exceeding cigarette smoke, that may harm the heart and blood vessels, the American Heart Association has warned.
Waterpipes – which go by multiple names such as hookah, shisha, goza and narghile – usually consist of a head or bowl that holds tobacco, a body, water base and hose that ends with a mouthpiece.
Hookah tobacco is usually a combination of dried fruit, flavoured tobacco and substances to keep the tobacco moist. Burning charcoal is placed on top of the tobacco-filled bowl.
Smoking sessions usually last for up to 30 minutes or more, during which users can inhale litres of smoke.
“Although direct comparisons between hookahs and cigarettes have some limitations, a single session of hookah use typically results in greater exposure to carbon monoxide than a single cigarette. Even short-term exposure to carbon monoxide in hookahs is toxic and can interfere with exercise capacity,” the AHA said in a scientific statement, published in its journal, Circulation.
Aruni Bhatnagar, PhD, chair of the writing group for the statement from the AHA said there is a misconception that hookah smoking is less harmful than cigarettes because the tobacco is filtered through water, a claim he says has no scientific evidence.
“Hookah smoke contains harmful substances and the American Heart Association strongly recommends avoiding the use of tobacco in any form,” Bhatnagar said.

He added that there is growing evidence that hookah tobacco smoking acutely impacts heart rate and blood pressure while chronic use is associated with increased coronary artery disease risk.
Misconceptions
In the US, recent surveys have shown that people 18-24 years of age accounted for 55% of hookah smokers nationwide.
The American Heart Foundation has noted that the spread of hookah smoking among young people is promoted by sweetened and flavoured hookah tobacco. Unlike cigarette tobacco, hookah tobacco, often colourfully packaged, can be sold in candy and fruit flavours, which appeal to younger audiences.
Globally, hookah usage is spreading among younger people. Data from a survey of seven Middle Eastern countries showed that the rates of hookah smoking ranged from 9% to 15%.
Hookah is available in a number of cafes and lounges around Ireland, however, little research has been carried out on its popularity here.
Because most people smoke hookah in lounges and cafes it is perceived as a social activity and less habit-forming, AHA research found.
The AHA is concerned that there is a misconception among young hookah users that this method of tobacco use is harmless.

Conan, Kilcoyne, Scannell, Porter, Roux, Larmour, Marmion and Carty were all introduced by Schmidt at different junctures during the second half. Could do little to reverse Ireland’s fortunes or change the outcome.
Larmour’s late try avoided the whitewash and saw the Leinster fullback score his first Six Nations try, but it was merely a consolation.

https://www.the42.ie/emma-byrne-2-4547129-Mar2019/,"EMMA BYRNE WILL tonight create history when she becomes the first female inductee to the FAI’s Hall of Fame.
It is a fitting tribute to Ireland’s most successful footballer. To start with the easy measurables: in 16 years with Arsenal Byrne won 28 major honours, including 11 league titles, 10 FA Cups and the 2007 Champions League.
Only Robbie Keane has played more often for Ireland at senior level, and Byrne’s 134 games makes her the most-capped women’s player of all time.
So, entirely appropriate that her sparkling achievements are enshrined.
By their nature, these recognitions tend to fossilise careers, but Byrne’s will stubbornly evade such a fate. For whatever successes await women’s football in Ireland in the future, they will bear a lineage from Byrne’s career.
“She has left a legacy”, says her long-time international teammate Aine O’Gorman. “It’s a tough one for her, but she will be proud that she has left a legacy.”
Before Byrne walked away from international football, she took the time to make a final stand.
What we are fighting for here is equality”, she told the media assembled at Liberty Hall in April 2017. “We are fighting for the future of women’s football.”
The country was rapt to attention by the united front of 14 international players that day, standing together with representatives of SIPTU and the PFAI as they laid out their demands for better treatment from the FAI.
The players’ demands were modest and their burdens, to that point, considerable, having been forced to change out of tracksuits in airport toilets so as they could be returned to underage men’s teams.
The players asked to be compensated for a loss of earnings when on international duty, access to a gym membership, a €300 match fee and to be represented in discussions by the PFAI. Were their demands not met, the squad threatened not to fulfill the upcoming fixture against Slovakia.
The press conference took place on 4 April, and the players’ demands were met by the FAI in less than 48 hours.

SIPTU’s Deputy General Secretary Ethel Buckley was involved that day, and remarked at a public meeting in Dublin last month at how swiftly an agreement was reached once a mediation process began.
Emma Byrne and her teammates address the media at Liberty Hall.Donall Farmer / INPHODonall Farmer / INPHO / INPHO
It was anything but swift for Byrne. She had been agitating for better treatment for the women’s team for years, giving an interview in March 2014 in which she threatened to quit over the FAI’s failure to compensate players, along with the Association’s withdrawal of a daily €30 allowance.
Byrne was then criticised publicly by her own manager Sue Ronan, who responded by saying she was “disappointed” by the “timing” and “inaccuracies” of Byrne’s comments, citing the fact that the daily allowances had been withdrawn for all international teams bar the senior men’s as proof that the women’s team had been “treated equally” by the FAI.
Byrne, along with Aine O’Gorman, refused to let the issue drop. Eventually, the battle led to Liberty Hall, and Byrne’s retirement four months later. “Thank you to the PFAI, SIPTU, the FAI and the Irish media for making my last battle a successful one.”, wrote Byrne in her farewell social media statement.
Buckley said the most important element of the squad’s success was their unity; their determination evident in the image of 14 players standing together before the media.
“The togetherness was a massive part of why it sent such a strong message”, remembers O’Gorman.
“Emma was the captain and she kept us all together. She had to lead by example and she showed great leadership.
“When push came to shove, she kept us all together.
“She kept the team together. It was tough, what we had to do, but it has bettered women’s football and women’s sport in this country. She had a lot to do with it, and she can be very proud of that.”
PFAI solicitor Stuart Gilhooley sat alongside the squad at Liberty Hall.
“You can’t understate the role Emma Byrne played. She was the biggest and best name in the history of Irish women’s football, and will be for some time to come.
“Herself and Aine O’Gorman were regarded as the two leaders of the progress. They had been trying for two years to work with the FAI and bring about an improvement in conditions. They realised they were going nowhere and contacted the PFAI through [General Secretary] Stephen McGuinness.
“He could see that they were being treated as not second-class citizens, but fifth-class citizens.

“He said to Emma that they needed to be a united squad and that there was no room for weakness. If they wanted to get what they wanted, it was necessary that they were all together.
“Emma was 100% on board with that. Once she spoke, everyone was going to listen.”
Thus it came to pass.
The first qualification campaign after the players’ stance showed some encouraging signs, most notably a 0-0 draw away to European champions Holland which was achieved in spite of a spate of injuries.
“When Ireland do finally qualify for a major championships”, says Gilhooley, “people will look back at what Emma, Aine O’Gorman and all the players did, but particularly Emma, and say ‘She may not be here, and she may not be involved at all, but a large part of the credit for this goes to her in the same way as Roy Keane is given credit for professionalising the FAI after Saipan.
“She was the one who said, ‘This needs to improve for future generations.’
“It’s important that everyone recognises that she wasn’t going to gain much for herself out of that. In fact, she gained almost nothing for herself out of that.
“I think she deserves similar, if not more credit, as she dragged women’s football from the dark ages into the twenty-first century.”
Byrne’s first job after school was actually with the FAI, working in the ticket office of the Association’s old headquarters on Merrion Square.
O’Gorman hopes Byrne is employed by the FAI again soon.
“It would be great to see her getting back involved in Irish football as she’s a huge loss. She could probably still be playing if she wanted to, and get to 200 caps!
“Her experience would be so valuable to anyone coming through.”","8.00am, 17 Mar 2019",
https://www.the42.ie/garry-ringrose-vanstone-ruddock-france-4532379-Mar2019/,"IF YOU WERE to have a debate about the best outside centres in world rugby at present, Garry Ringrose’s name would be very much in the mix.
Still just 24, the Dublin man has become a key cog for Leinster and Joe Schmidt’s Ireland, a player of intelligence and decision-making class, essential to both teams’ defences and capable of delivering crucial cutting edge in attack.
He makes his return from a hamstring injury for Ireland against France in the Six Nations today and his team-mates are happy, perhaps even a little relieved, to see him back in the 13 shirt.

“He adds an extra dimension,” says Ireland captain Rory Best. “Garry has that X-factor, there’s no doubt about it. He just has the ability in a really, really tight game like we’re going to get against France to potentially unlock something from nothing.
“I’ve played with a few players in an Irish jersey who had that ability and whenever it comes to tough moments that’s really important.
“To see how hard he’s worked to get back quickly, it’s a real bonus for us. Garry is just a little bit different. He doesn’t have the sheer size but his footwork is just electric.”
Oddly enough for a player who is so perfectly suited to the 13 jersey now, Ringrose was mainly a scrum-half up until he was in fifth year in Blackrock College and only became an outside centre in sixth year, via a stint at fullback.
Ringrose wasn’t a star in his early school days, but he eventually shone in Blackrock’s Leinster Schools Senior Cup success in 2013, when he was a goal-kicking influence who scored a long-range solo try in the final against St Michael’s College.
Since then, he has excelled consistently but it wasn’t always the case that Ringrose looked destined for the top of the game. Far from it.
Justin Vanstone, the current Blackrock senior team coach, was in charge of the school’s ‘House’ team – a development side for the senior team – when Ringrose was in fourth year but initially sent him to play with the Colts, a step below.
Ringrose hadn’t been able to get onto the Junior Cup team as a scrum-half in third year, playing for the seconds. However, when he was dispatched to the Colts, something began to stir.
“He was too good and got sent back to me,” recalls Vanstone. “I actually taught Garry in third-year Maths as well. As well as being a coach’s dream, he was a teacher’s dream.

“Very self-driven, very self-aware, he knew what he was good at and what he wasn’t so strong at.
“When I sent him to the Colts, he listened, he was never a guy who questioned why others were ahead of him. He focused on making himself better and made sure that it was clear I’d made a mistake. That’s Garry in a nutshell.”
There was something about Ringrose’s subtly clever play that suggested to Vanstone that he would thrive with more space, despite his relatively small stature at that stage. A move to fullback bore fruit.
“Garry has a great sense of space, great spatial awareness,” says Vanstone. “He’s a good footballer, makes really good decisions and is very calm.

“We realised we needed to get Garry on the ball more and more. He wasn’t the biggest guy at that stage but I liked how he made up for it in other ways. Technically, he was very sound.”
And yet, Ringrose still wasn’t marked out as a future professional when he reached sixth year, but an injury at 13 saw him making the move into midfield and suddenly his potential kicked into full gear.
His catch-pass, kicking, defensive and decision-making skills were perfect at outside centre and he was a vital figure as the Peter Smyth-coached Blackrock side won the Cup.
Only months later and after leaving school to join Leinster’s sub-academy, Ringrose was selected for the Leinster U20s despite being a year young for that level.
He played in a game against Leicester Tigers’ academy at Ashbourne, where then Ireland U20s coach Mike Ruddock was watching.
“He got the ball out in the five-metre channel close to the touchline,” recalls Ruddock.

“There were three young Tigers looking to hunt him down but with the most incredible bit of footwork I’ve seen – other than Shane Williams – Garry managed to dance through these three would-be tacklers and come out the other side without any of them touching him.
“Not only that but he ran on and scored. It was standout stuff and you’re looking for that when you’re putting a national squad together.”
With that major green tick alongside his name, Ringrose was brought into the Ireland set-up a year early, starting the first two Six Nations games before Ruddock dropped him for the remainder of the 2014 championship.
Ruddock felt the 18-year-old wasn’t quite suited to the heavier, more physical games in the Six Nations – when the weather can be poor – but kept Ringrose in his plans for that summer’s Junior World Championship.
“I left him out and I remember saying that he needed to keep working hard on becoming a little bit more physical with his defensive duties. He did that, went away and worked hard with a real focus on it.”
Ringrose proved to be a sensation in New Zealand in 2014, excelling as Ireland finished fourth. He was nominated for World Rugby Junior Player of the Year after a string of performances that included a two-try showing against Wales in Pukekohe.
“He was fantastic and put in a great physical shift in defence,” says Ruddock. “Straight away, we were all talking about him as a potential senior player.”
Advancing into the Leinster academy proper for the 2014/15 season, Ringrose had another year with the Ireland U20s under Nigel Carolan, helping them to seventh place in Italy in the 2015 World Championship.
His senior Leinster debut came at the start of the 2015/16 season – a campaign in which he made 20 starts – and he was an Ireland international by November 2016, making his debut against Canada at the age of 21.
Throughout the rise, Ringrose has looked unflappable and remained unfailingly level-headed. One couldn’t meet a more polite interviewee.

“He’s got a lovely set of parents,” says Vanstone of Ringrose, who still helps out in Blackrock whenever asked. “The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, and his younger brother Jack [who plays for UCD in the AIL] is the same.
“What was really impressive with Garry and Jack was the way they supported each other. Garry talks about his family a lot in interviews and he very much lives that life too – he’s so supportive of Jack.

Ruddock has always been similarly impressed with Ringrose’s character, enjoying a chat with the Leinster midfielder whenever they bump into each other now.
“He was the same with the U20s – humble, respectful, unassuming,” says Ruddock. “Let’s be honest, he’s a good-looking guy, a bit of a film star profile, but he doesn’t walk around with any sort of cockiness about him and you’ve got to love that about the guy.
“Every time I see him he doesn’t seem to have changed at all. He’s at ease in anyone’s company and I think he’s a great ambassador for Irish rugby. I’ve met his mum and dad and he’s from a lovely family, so it’s very easy to see why he’s like that.”
Ringrose – who many people feel was hard done by not to tour with the Lions in 2017 – is already a vital figure for Ireland and he will be even more important in the post-Schmidt era after this year’s World Cup when there will be an inevitable sense of transition.
“He is the kind of guy you can build a side around,” says Vanstone. “He’s an excellent role model.
Ringrose is a key figure for Ireland at the age of 24.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
“He could have another eight years or more at the highest level, which is kind of scary!”
Best, who will vacate his position as Ireland captain after the World Cup, also has respect for Ringrose’s unfussy style of leadership.
“The way Garry leads is a wee bit similar to the way Earlsy [Keith Earls] leads, it’s not so much talking in big groups but it’s managing people around him,” says the Ulsterman.
“When you’re training and playing, he manages the forwards, drags us around the place. He’s so fit, he sets so early and puts pressure on you to set too. It’s that little bit of talk too.
“He leads, firstly, by his actions on and off the pitch.”

https://www.the42.ie/katie-taylor-34-4543109-Mar2019/,"Gavan Casey reports from Philadelphia
WHEN YOU ASK Katie Taylor about women’s boxing’s detractors, it can go one of two ways.
If criticism has been particularly prevalent as it was following her three-round blow-out of IBF mandatory challenger Kimberly Connor in July of last year, she’ll sound off in her own way. The annoyance, of course, is evident more in her intonation than the substance of what she actually says, most of which is magnanimous enough.
But last Wednesday,Taylor dismissed that same criticism in far fewer words.
She made the point that she pays attention only to people who actually cover boxing, and not those looking to fill space in Irish newspapers. She made a rather more telling point, too, that these criticisms don’t hold much credence across the Atlantic Ocean, on the other side of which she is legitimately moving the dial.
And never was that more accentuated than it was at the Liacouras Center in Philadelphia on Thursday.

Moments after Taylor tipped the scales ahead of her world-title unification bout with Rose Volante, she approached the team belonging to US broadcasters DAZN, manager Brian Peters in tow, for an obligatory pre-fight chat. She cut the figure of someone who’d been through this rigmarole before — which she has.
I find Taylor to be more than generous with her time, generally speaking, but on weigh-in days there is always a trepidation on behalf of the writer. You find yourself caught between trying to justify your employers’ — or your own — investment of your being there in the first place. You’re acutely aware that Taylor had a press conference literally yesterday, and she probably hasn’t eaten much if at all since, and she doesn’t like interviews anyway so she’s probably not all that keen for a yap.
You’ll always get from Taylor the fist-bump, the smile, the sense of appreciation that you’re there from Ireland to cover her fight. But you’re never sure whether or not to ask for a quick natter. Obviously, whether you’re sure or not, you ask.
No sooner than I did ask — and I’d picked up a decent anecdote regarding Volante’s words for Taylor during the fighters’ staredown in any case — a woman leant across the barrier and asked Taylor: ‘Katie, would you mind if we get a picture?’
Taylor was instantaneous in her acceptance, already in position for the picture before the woman in question took a backward step and poised her phone.
And then in came Sugar Ray Leonard for his picture with the champ.
It was watching Taylor and this literal deity of boxing embrace arm-in-arm which made this writer re-examine what she had said during that actual interview last week:
There can be few more knowledgeable than Leonard who, from the mouth of literally any boxing fan, and in the eyes of all, is one of the five greatest ever to lace up the mitts.
And funnily enough, this was his second time to ask for — and receive — a picture with the Irish sporting icon, the first being a few months back in Boston.

They have a phrase in America: ‘Real recognise real’.
And while Taylor is not the type to truly denigrate the naysayers of the women’s game — even if she’d probably like to — a quick pic with Sugar Ray must go a long way toward forcing the talking heads’ notions to the bowels of her subconscious.
Major fights lie in wait for Katie Taylor if she can see past Rose Volante on Friday night.Jeff Fusco / INPHOJeff Fusco / INPHO / INPHO
It would be wrong to overdo it: I’d love to tell you that when I asked my taxi driver if he knew who was fighting at Liacouras Center on Friday night, he leant back and said to me: ‘Well everybody knows Katie Taylor’. He did not. More of an MMA fan, he said, costing me some serious colour.
But I’ll balance that with the following: as I stood atop the photographers’ platform to phone-record Taylor and Volante’s weigh-in, an American gentleman from a local publication turned to me and said: “Dude, that Irish girl is going to fuck her up.”
What makes you say that?I asked.
“Bro”, he goes, “I was in Boston for her fight against that Spanish girl who has the sister [Cindy Serrano, Puerto Rican], and that girl is no joke, but this girl from Ireland made her life a fucking misery for 10 rounds.”
It might be the Spanish girl’s sister, Amanda Serrano, also from Puerto Rico by way of Brooklyn, who eventually silences Taylor’s detractors. She’s a seven-weight world champion. Albeit, five of those titles have been vacant, and the title fights in question have been sanctioned by the Puerto Rico-based WBO who refuse to publish women’s rankings, and whose belt — the lightweight version of which is currently held by Taylor’s opponent on Friday, Rose Volante — is a Lidl Ladyball-coloured pink.
But Serrano is a significant threat to any fighter operating within the realm of lightweight, and she spurs something in Taylor that few others do.
Rivals Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano are due to face off later this year.
Serrano has said repeatedly that she intends to put an end to the Taylor hype train. She says she has the power to knock Taylor out. She has declined on several occasions to be interviewed by this publication, at the same time.
In an October interview withThe42, Taylor said of Serrano:
It could be argued that Taylor was breaking from character in making such an assessment. Equally, it could be argued that she had assumed character for the purpose of this prospective fight. The truth, as it tends to in these cases, probably lies somewhere in between, but Taylor is well able to trade verbal barbs when needs be.
Here’s another truth, though: provided all goes to plan before then, Taylor-Serrano will headline at the Theater in Madison Square Garden in September, and it’ll be the biggest women’s boxing match of all time, bar none.
Absolutely, that points to a void in quality in the women’s game throughout history. But equally, it points to a changing sport: three years ago, the idea that two women could headline pretty much anywhere, live on TV, would have been dismissed off-hand. That’s the Taylor effect Stateside in a nutshell.
Now, proceed with caution. I personally don’t think Serrano will take that fight, even though she has signed with Taylor’s promoter, Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom, with a precise view to making it.
It wasn’t lip service when Taylor described her as ‘mentally fragile’. Veteran Serrano, as super a fighter as she is, titles or no titles, clearly can’t bear the thought of losing to a relative newcomer to the pro ranks: for years she’s fought tirelessly for recognition, and to be soundly beaten by a three-year pro is likely too much for her to bear. We’ll see on that front.

Amanda Serrano should lie in wait for Katie Taylor down the line...Joel PlummerJoel Plummer
But even before then, Taylor will partake in a women’s fight that changes the game, probably as the co-main event to Anthony Joshua in New York on 1 June.
Delfine Persoon, the WBC lightweight champion, is no joke. She dispatched of a fine opponent in Melissa St Vil last weekend with minimal fuss. She fought in front of what could be best described as acoustic atmosphere in her native land — and honestly, God knows how bad her management team are when she’s not a star even at home — but she walked through the game St Vil with the swagger of a long-reigning champion.
She issued a statement to Taylor in her TKO6 — ‘I’ve held up my end of the bargain’.
Now, it’s over to Taylor to get the job done against Volante in what is the last of her roadblock fights.
Yes, Volante is unbeaten and yes, ‘unification clash’ has got a ring to it, but this is another opponent Taylor should deal with. It’s the last of those hold-up fights — the bridge between ‘just another fight’ and the truly significant fights in and around her division.
Persoon offers a legitimate challenge, as does Serrano, as does undisputed welterweight champion Cecilia Braekhus — the latter being first million-dollar fight for Taylor, or any female boxer — beyond that.

But it’s a testament to her impact on the sport, and perhaps the boxing fan or journalist’s understanding of what it takes to build a career, that the questions asked in columns or by talking heads in Ireland aren’t asked in the States.
Here, there is a collective cognisance that she’s onto something.
And while Taylor will never say it, that’s where manager Brian Peters’ remarks regarding billion-dollar US broadcasters DAZN ring true:
By the end of 2019 or the start of 2020, I’d be interested to hear the thoughts of those who claim Taylor’s professional career, and the sport within she operates, aren’t worth much.
It’s a big ‘if’ but victories pending, a series of fights with Persoon, Serrano and Braekhus would be unprecedented — in both the male or female ranks. They’ll be wildly celebrated in the States.
Perhaps then, it’ll hit home.

A SHOOTING AT a school near Sao Paulo has left several people dead, police sources said, with initial reports putting the death toll as high as eight.
Sao Paulo’s state military police department told AFP that “several people were shot” when two assailants entered the institution in Suzano and opened fire.
Military police Colonel Marcelo Sales has said that two assailants entered the school grounds in the early morning, armed with a .38 caliber revolver and a “medieval weapon that looked like a bow and arrows”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/baby-of-isis-bride-shamima-begum-dies-in-syria-4531896-Mar2019/,"
THE NEWBORN SON of UK-born teenager Shamima Begum has died in a refugee camp.
Begum was 15 when she and two friends left London to marry IS fighters in Syria in 2015. She recently resurfaced in a refugee camp and gave birth last month.
Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, has confirmed that the infant died at a camp in North Syria.
Now 19 years old, Begum told journalists last month that she wanted to raise her son in Britain but that the government revoked her citizenship.

Begum has said that her two previous children had died in the past three months — a daughter, Sarayah, became ill, and a son, Jerah, whose death was linked to malnutrition.
“In the end, I just could not endure any more,” she said of her desire to get out of Syria.
The teenager’s Dutch jihadi husband Yago Riedijk, who is in a Kurdish-run detention center, said last week that he wanted to return to the Netherlands with Begum and their son.
British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said last month that he had revoked Begum’s UK citizenship.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sim-card-swap-scam-eir-4529815-Mar2019/,"A WARNING HAS been issued about a new type of scam that reportedly allows fraudsters to remotely access people’s bank accounts through their mobile phones.
The scam – known as a ‘SIM Card swap’ – is said to enable fraudsters to control mobile users’ bank accounts by taking over their smartphones while they are locked.
It is believed to target people who have online banking apps on their smartphones, which fraudsters can access by using the user’s unique SIM Card IP address.
Garda Sergeant John Kelly toldC103′s Cork Today Showthat an Eir Mobile customer in Dublin was hit by the scam earlier this week.
“The injured party noticed that their phone signal was lost for approximately two hours,” Kelly said.

“When the signal returned to the phone, a quick approval loan of €7,000 had been applied for on the AIB Online function that he used.”
Kelly also said that there were a number of other attempts to transfer money via person’s SIM Card IP address while their signal was down, all of which failed.
He added that the easiest way to avoid becoming victim to the scam was to use secure WiFi connections.
“This is a new one, it’s completely new to me,” he said. “If you had talked to me about this last week, I wouldn’t have heard of it.”
A Garda spokesman toldTheJournal.iethat it was not aware of any major problem related to this type of scam in Ireland.
“Our advice is for phone customers is to notify their service provider if they notice any unusual activity,” the spokesman added.
A spokesperson for Eir Mobile has been contacted for comment.

He said that it was important that the Irish “embrace our responsibilities as global citizens and play our own personal and essential role in saving our planet and our environment”.
He ended his message with the inclusive message: “May I wish all those who share this island – be they Irish people by birth or descent or those who have a connection with Ireland wherever they may be in the world – and all those fellow global citizens who are friends of Ireland, a happy and peaceful St Patrick’s Day.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/aidan-odriscoll-murder-4536012-Mar2019/,"AIDAN O’DRISCOLL was “executed” on a busy street in a “well-planned” hit that was part of an internal dispute between the Real IRA and the New IRA, the Special Criminal Court has heard.
Colin Casey (32) and Daniel Hegarty (24), with unknown addresses, pleaded guilty to four counts of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of the killers of Aidan  O’Driscoll in Cork city more than two years ago.
A third man, Eoin Morrissey (19), with an unknown address, also pleaded guilty to two counts of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of O’Driscoll’s killers.
O’Driscoll, a senior figure in the Real IRA in Munster, died after he was shot four times on the Old Commons Road, in Blackpool, Cork City on 7 December 2016.
The Special Criminal Court heard that Casey collected the alleged gunmen from the Redemption Road area of Blackpool after they had arrived in a silver Nissan Almera. He drove them from that location in a white Vauxhall Astra van which he subsequently burned out, along with the Nissan Almera.
Hegarty collected a bag used by the alleged killers in the vicinity of Farranferris, Blackpool in Cork city, which he buried at an isolated location. He also set fire to a Honda CBR motorbike used to transport the bag, and was involved in the burning of a red Opel Astra car.
Firelighters
Morrissey provided Hegarty, his first cousin, with a firelighter which was used to burn the red Opel Astra car. He was also charged with following Hegarty to Inchamay, Naad, Banteer, where the red Opel Astra car was burnt out, so as to provide transport for Hegarty after the burning.
The State was unable to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the three men knew a murder was to be committed, prosecuting counsel, Ronan Kennedy BL, told the court.
At their sentence hearing today, Detective Sergeant Niall O’Connell, of Watercourse Garda Station in Cork, told the court that the execution was well-planned and preparations had been in place for a considerable amount of time.
Detective Sergeant O’Connell said gardaí believed the shooting was part of an internal dispute between the Real IRA and the New IRA and investigations remain ongoing. He said the garda investigation established that two males were involved in the fatal shooting, neither of whom were Casey, Hegarty or Morrissey.
The detective agreed with Mr Kennedy, prosecuting, that the Old Commons Road was the “heart of Blackpool”. It was a busy area with lots of vehicles and pedestrians passing through it. Children were attending a nearby drama school at the time of the shooting.
He said O’Driscoll had travelled from his employers’ yard to the Old Commons Road at approximately 4.50pm on the day in question where he was to carry out some renovation work at an address that was familiar to him.

After crossing the road, O’Driscoll was confronted by a gunman who fired a shot into him. O’Driscoll tried to run from his assailant and the first attacker’s gun appeared to jam, the detective said. A second gunman exited the driver’s side of a silver Nissan Almera and followed O’Driscoll across the road.
Detective Sergeant O’Connell said Mr O’Driscoll was shot four times in total. He said three bullets were recovered from his body with the fourth recovered from a hedge down the road.
“A (fifth, unspent) bullet was found on the roadway which had been ejected from one of the guns,” O’Connell said.
He said the culprits fled in a silver Nissan Almera before driving to Cemetery Road where a white van driven by Casey was waiting. Casey got out of the van, opened the rear doors, and the people from the Almera got into it, the detective said.
Casey, described as somebody who worked in the motor trade, told gardaí that he drove the white can from his house to Cemetery Road where a number of people “jumped in”. He said he didn’t know who they were.
‘Under pressure’
He said he was told earlier that day to look for cars associated with O’Driscoll. He said he did what he was told to do and he was under pressure to do it.
Hegarty, a mechanic with no previous convictions, outlined to gardaí how he travelled together with his friend to a location where he was told to wait by the side of the road. A short time later, he was handed a bag which he was to bury.
He told gardaí that he had an idea what was in the bag but would not say. He said he knew something bad was going to happen on the day in question, but that was the extent of it.
Morrissey, a mechanic’s apprentice, admitted to his role in the disposal of the red Opel Astra. He said he only realised afterwards that the car had been used in the shooting.
His barrister, Tim O’Leary SC, said his client had no affiliations with or tendencies towards illegal organisations, and had only become involved in events two weeks after the shooting.
Justice Tony Hunt fixed 12 April at the date for sentence. Hegarty and Casey were remanded in custody while Morrissey was remanded on continuing bail.
Detective Sergeant O’Connell said the garda investigation involved 100 gardaí and the allocation of 1,300 jobs. He said 10,000 hours of CCTV footage was viewed, 63 phones were analysed and over 700 statements were taken.
He said it was clear from mobile phone analysis that, from earlier on in the day, “all the elements” were in place and vehicles were in position for the shooting.
Comments are off as legal proceedings are ongoing.

“I confirm that I made a once-off bridging loan to the Association to aid a very short-term cash ﬂow issue.
“This is the only occasion on which I provided the Association with a short-term loan.”

Speaking to reporters in Chicago, on the second leg of his St Patrick’s Day trip to the US, Varadkar said Muslims should not be afraid
At least 49 people were killed yesterday at two mosques, when a man opened fire on people while videoing the massacre.
One man was arrested and charged with murder, and two other armed suspects were taken into custody while police tried to determine what role, if any, they played in the cold-blooded attack that stunned New Zealand.
It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said yesterday, noting that many of the victims could be migrants or refugees.

“I condemn the act of terrorism that occurred in New Zealand. It was an act of terrorism. Also an act of cowardice because it targeted children and people who were at prayer.
“We’ve expressed through our embassy and our diplomatic channels our solidarity and support  for the people of New Zealand and the government of New Zealand at what is a very difficult time for them.”

The Taoiseach then moved to reassure Muslims in Ireland, stating that they have nothing to fear.
“To our Muslim community in Ireland, all 70,000 of them, to Muslim communities all around the world, I think “That we don’t allow the terrorists to win by changing our lifestyles or changing the way we look at each other because of what was a terrible act.”
An Garda Síochána said yesterday that it has a productive and positive relationship with the Muslim community in Ireland built up over many years.
Community gardaí will be visiting mosques provide support to the country’s Muslim community following the mass shootings in New Zealand.

https://www.thejournal.ie/karen-bradley-ballymurphy-4529936-Mar2019/,"THE FAMILIES OF the victims of the Ballymurphy massacre have refused to meet Karen Bradley after controversial comments she made about killings during the Troubles.
On Wednesday, the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary told the House of Commons the deaths in Northern Ireland “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
Her comments caused uproar, with many politicians and others deeming them deeply offensive to victims’ families.
Bradley later apologised, saying she was “profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt” that her words had caused, adding that she didn’t believe what she said.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Bradley has requested to meet victims’ loved ones to apologise in person but families affected by the Ballymurphy massacre have declined her invitation and called on her to resign.
In a statement sent toBBC Northern Ireland, the group said they have been requesting a meeting with Bradley since she took up her position last year, but that she “hasn’t even replied to these requests”.

“Families request that those parties who support our campaign join us and refuse meet with Karen Bradley. Do the dignified and appropriate thing, resign Karen Bradley,” the statement reads.
Eleven people died in the massacre which took place in the Ballymurphy estate in Belfast between 9 and 11 August 1971 – 10 were shot dead by British soldiers and one had a heart attack.
‘Outrageous and ridiculous’ comments
Yesterday Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters he had met victims’ families in the past and they are still grieving and hurting, adding that many of them have unanswered questions.
He said Bradley’s comments were “insensitive” and “wrong”.
“Bear in mind what we’re talking about here is, we’re talking about the killing of civilians, not combatants. We’re talking about peaceful protesters in Derry on Bloody Sunday, we’re talking about Ballymurphy, we’re talking about Kingsmills, we’re talking about Dublin and Monaghan.
When asked if he thought she should resign, he replied: “Not going to go there”.
In the Dáil yesterday, Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary described the comments as “absolutely callous and completely out of order and totally inappropriate”, while Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty said the remarks were “outrageous and ridiculous”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/abdelaziz-bouteflika-algeria-4535908-Mar2019/,"ALGERIAN PRESIDENT ABDELAZIZ Bouteflika has announced that he will drop his bid for a fifth term in office following weeks of protests against his candidacy.
The country’s official news agency, APS announced that the 82 year-old would not serve a fifth term in office, implying that the president would remain in office until his current term expires on 28 April.
It follows widespread protests in the north African country in recent weeks, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to demonstrate against his bid for another term in office.
“There will be no presidential election on 18 April,” the veteran leader said, adding that he was responding to “a pressing demand that you have been numerous in making to me”.
He also vowed “to hand over the duties and prerogatives of the president of the republic to the successor freely chosen by the Algerian people”.
This evening, Algerians took to the streets in celebration, and honking car horns and singing rang out in the capital Algiers following the news.
“Peacefully, we have overthrown the puppet!” people sang in the streets of the city centre.
Former colonial power France also welcomed the president’s decision.

“France expresses its hope that a new dynamic that can answer the deep aspirations of the Algerian people will rapidly take hold,” the country’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said in a statement.
On Monday barristers across Algeria had joined strike against Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term, demanding the Constitutional Council rejected his candidacy on grounds of “incapacity” to carry out the role.
Bouteflika’s rare public appearances since a stroke in 2013 have been in a wheelchair, and he returned to Algeria on Sunday after spending two weeks at a hospital in Switzerland.
His return from hospital in Geneva came as protest strikes shut down the capital’s public transport system and many schools across Algeria on Sunday.
Bouteflika became president in 1999, and he has clung on to power despite his ill health.
Dubbed Boutef by Algerians, he had helped foster peace after a decade-long civil war, but he has also faced criticism for alleged authoritarianism.
When the Arab Spring uprisings erupted across the Middle East and North Africa, Bouteflika’s regime smothered dissent and played on fears of a repeat of Algeria’s civil war.
He was elected for a fourth term in April 2014 with 81.5 percent of the vote, despite not campaigning for election.
Bouteflika also has a history of medical problems, and has often flown to France or Switzerland for treatment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-speech-4521697-Mar2019/,"
US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump rallied right-wing activists yesterday with a speech touching on immigration, trade and the threat of “socialism”.
Trump’s speech came as he sought to move on from a bruising week in domestic and international politics.
“We believe in the American dream, not in the socialist nightmare,” he said to applause from hundreds of supporters at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington.
“America will never be a socialist country,” Trump added in a mammoth two-hour speech that seemed to draw energy from the fervent reception offered by some of his influential supporters in the room.
It was his first public appearance since coming home empty-handed, and to criticism from all sides, after a nuclear-disarmament summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
He told CPAC the meeting was “very productive” – but that he would not “make a deal just for the sake of doing it”.
The White House is also smarting from explosive testimony on Capitol Hill by Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen on Wednesday that branded him a cheat and a racist.
Trump, often speaking in mocking tones, portrayed the Green New Deal climate strategy touted by the left of the Democratic party as a socialist plan that will devastate the fossil fuel and automotive industries.
He said progressive healthcare policies would “lead to colossal tax increases” – and accused the Democrats of having “totally abandoned the American mainstream” on issues such as immigration and abortion.
‘These people are sick’
With the federal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia reportedly approaching its conclusion, Trump again berated Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team as partisan hacks out to get him, adding that “these people are sick”.
His voice dripping with sarcasm, he suggested that his call in summer of 2016 for Russia to find and release Hillary Clinton’s emails was a joke that had been obtusely taken at face value by the media.
On the foreign front, Trump repeated his claim that the last Islamic State group fighters in Syria would be captured or killed imminently – “as of tomorrow”.
Advertisement
On Thursday he told US troops “we just took over” 100%of the caliphate.
Two weeks earlier Trump had declared the fall of the so-called caliphate would be announced “over the next 24 hours.”
He railed against Chinese tariffs on American goods and said the US loses $500 billion a year to the world’s second biggest economy – “such a disaster.”
Trump regularly ignores the dominant US services sector to focus only on goods, when in 2017 the US trade deficit with China was actually $337 billion – not $500 billion.
Trump last year initiated a tariff war with Beijing, which has taken a nasty bite out of US growth.
Although both sides say they are now close to resolving the dispute Trump insisted he’s “fine with it” and told his supporters:
The word “socialism” has been in heavy rotation since some Democratic candidates began openly embracing liberal platforms including the Green New Deal and a Medicare for All.
On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the four-day conference in National Harbor, Maryland, to warn that Democrats are taking a “hard left turn” ahead of 2020.
“Under the guise of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the last century. That system is socialism,” he said.
Trump’s speech came at the same time Senator Bernie Sanders, who has embraced the label of “democratic socialist,” spoke at a rally in New York, assailing Trump as “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.
‘Freedom’ or ‘socialism’
It was Sanders’ first major speech since announcing he will again seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
Republicans hoped Trump’s address would serve as a diversion from the Mueller investigation and to the testimony this week on Capitol Hill by the president’s former personal lawyer Cohen implicating him in crimes.
In December a court sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for hush-money payments to two women and for lies to Congress – both of which he said were to protect Trump — and tax evasion.

https://www.thejournal.ie/geoffrey-cox-codpiece-4529643-Mar2019/,"BRITISH ATTORNEY GENERAL Geoffrey Cox has reportedly claimed that the Irish backstop posed a threat to the human rights of citizens in Northern Ireland.
He’s faced a bit of backlash for his remarks,reports The Guardian, including from a woman who is challenging the UK Home Office over its treatment of Northern Irish citizens.
“Hearing Geoffrey Cox attempt to argue the backstop would breach human rights in Northern Ireland has me speechless,” Emma DeSouza saidon Twitter.
“What the UK puts Northern-Irish born Irish citizens through is a breach of rights and the Good Friday Agreement.”
It’s been argued that the backstop breaches the Good Friday Agreement, as if checks were placed along the Irish Sea, it would mean changing the relationship between Northern Ireland and the UK. On that same basis, however, Brexit itself could be argued as a breach of the Good Friday Agreement, as the relationship between Northern Ireland and Ireland will probably change.
In this case, it’s reported that Cox argued the backstop contravened Northern Irish citizens’ human rights, as it would leave them within the European Union but with no representation in the European Parliament.

Cox’s codpiece
Earlier today in the House of Commons, Cox answered questions on the progress that had been made during negotiations with the EU. He was asked if it was still the plan to change the backstop, and add a codicil, or additional note, to the Irish backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement.
“It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop which will cause me to review and change my advice. That is government policy, that is the discussions we are having.”
Cox’s advice on the backstop in its current form caused quite a stir. MPs spent days in December calling for it to be published, which it eventually was, and made quite a splash when it landed.
The Attorney General’s legal advice confirmed that the backstop would “endure indefinitely” and would mean that there will be more customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain than there are currently.
Cox says that there are parts of the deal that contradict each other, meaning that it’s not clear whether the backstop is temporary.
It’s this advice that has led Brexiteer MPs to criticise the backstop, and call for changes such as placing a time-limit on it or allowing the UK to withdraw from it without needing the approval of the EU.
Cox has been attending talks in Brussels this week in the hope of finding this codicil, that would mean he can change his legal advice without changing the essence of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Speaking to the House of Commons about the codicil, Cox playfully said:
During a separate bout of questioning, Cox also committed to publishing his next bout of legal advice, too: “I shall publish my legal opinion on any document that is produced and negotiated with the EU.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-delay-4551168-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Mar 2019

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is set to formally request that Brexit be postponed.
May is due to write to the European Union, likely asking it to agree to extending Article 50 until 30 June.
A three-month extension would mean Britain doesn’t have to take part in May’s European elections; the new European Parliament is set to convene in July.
Other EU member states are expected to consider her request at a summit in Brussels tomorrow.
However, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker today said a decision is unlikely to be reached this week, meaning a second summit may be needed next week.
Juncker told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that the remaining 27 EU members states’ hands are tied until the political indecision in London is resolved.
“As long as we don’t know what Britain could say yes to, no decision can be taken on our side either,” he said.
Juncker insisted the deal on the table is the EU’s final offer.
“Nothing more can be done, we’ve reached the end of the road,” he said.
Juncker said May needs to present Brussels with an agreement approved by the British parliament as well as “a clear timetable”.
Britain is currently set to leave the EU on 29 March, just nine days from now.
‘Constitutional crisis’
May’s appeal for an extension comes amid doubt over whether or not the House of Commons will vote on her Brexit deal for a third time.
The planned vote was thrown into doubt on Monday when John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the government cannot have another meaningful vote on the deal if changes are not made to it.
Bercow said MPs from both sides of the House had expressed concerns to him about being asked to vote repeatedly on the “same fundamental proposition”.

Solicitor General Robert Buckland has claimed the UK is facing a “major constitutional crisis” as a result.
May’s official spokesman yesterday agreed there is “a crisis” afoot but blamed MPs who didn’t back the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the British government and the European Union.
Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block another vote on the deal – it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January and again last week.
The majority of MPs (413)last week votedin favour of extending Article 50 for three months, with 202 voting against the government’s motion.
‘Blazing row’
Some people have argued that postponing Brexit is somewhat pointless as European leaders have said the deal struck between Britain and the EU cannot be renegotiated, while hardline Brexiteers view it as a tactic to stop the process altogether.
There was a “blazing row” at a British Cabinet meeting yesterday, according to Sky News, with some ministers reportedly saying any delay must be brief — meaning there is the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal at the end of June.
As the crisis rumbles on, a number of opponents are said to be eyeing up May’s job. Former Foreign Secretary and Brexiteer Boris Johnson is one of the frontrunners – something that could further split the Tories, with some MPsvowing to quit if he becomes leader.
‘No appetite’
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, meanwhile, has said there is “a lot is concern” among EU member states about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50.
Speaking after Cabinet yesterday evening, Coveney said: “The disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months or another whatever period of time is something that I think people will need convincing on.”
Coveney added that it has been “very clear” there is “absolutely no appetite” from the EU to reopen negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which campaigned in favour of Brexit and props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Negotiations to get the DUP and other MPs, including some within May’s own Conservative Party, onside are ongoing behind the scenes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/consumer-rights-post-brexit-4520150-Mar2019/,"CUSTOMERS WHO BUY from British shops should check what their consumer rights, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)has said.
It’s also warned that ordering from non-EU businesses carries a Vat rate of €22 or more (plus shipping). You also legally have to pay import charges such as customs or excise duties on items you buy from outside the EU, which are valued at €150 or more.
As part of the EU, Ireland’s consumer rights come from the Consumer Rights Directive (CRD), which means that in most cases, you can cancel your order within 14 days of delivery. We’re also exempt from tariffs and customs costs as Ireland is part of the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market.
But once the UK leaves the EU, Irish customers ordering from UK-based businesses will no longer automatically have access to these rights. If the business they are ordering from is in the EU, then your rights will not change because of Brexit.

If a shop in Ireland is owned or run by a UK chain, all your consumer rights will be exactly the same when you buy from a shop in Ireland despite Brexit.
To check where a business is located, the CCPC advises not to rely too much on the website’s domain name (for example, .co.uk).
The CCPC advises that in general when buying from a website outside the EU, it is very important to read the terms and conditions on the website, and ask:
If you buy something before the 29 March, the day that the UK is due to leave the European Union, your 14-day cancellation period under the CRD may no longer be valid if you try to cancel your order.
If you buy something from a UK-based business before Brexit that has a fault, or if it is not delivered, you may not have access to redress using the European Consumer Centre or the European Small Claims Procedure after Brexit.
More information is availablehere on the CCPC website.

https://www.thejournal.ie/votes-for-irish-citizens-abroad-london-parade-presidential-election-referendum-4543443-Mar2019/,"THE VOTES FOR Irish Citizens campaign group will be marching in London’s St Patrick’s Day parade on Sunday to call for a yes vote in this year’s referendum on voting rights in presidential elections.
A yes vote in October’s referendum would mean Irish citizens living outside the country would be able to cast their vote for the first time in a presidential election.
As things currently stand, Irish people who have emigrated abroad are unable to vote in Dáil or presidential elections or in any referendum that takes place in Ireland.
Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad (VICA) says a yes vote would help “close the gap in unequal citizenship with respect to the franchise and honour the international role of the Irish President”.
‘Out of step’
The campaign group’s entry in London’s parade is set to celebrate the contribution of Irish citizens in the UK, “who represent Irishness globally but are denied a vote”.
Float organiser and VICA member, Alan Flanagan, said that Ireland has been out of step with the rest of Europe and the world for too long.
“Ireland gained global attention in 2015 and 2018, with images of its newer emigrants returning home to vote in the equal marriage and abortion referendums appearing in social media and international press. However, while the engagement, determination and passion of Ireland’s young people gained so much admiration around the world, Ireland still lags behind in extending democratic participation to its overseas citizens,” Flanagan said.

The referendum was initially due to take place in May but was moved because of Brexit according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, as well as the local and European elections being held in the same month.
Before Brexit, Irish citizens living in the UK could vote in the EU elections in their British constituencies – to vote in their Irish constituency they would have still needed to travel home.
Because of Brexit, Irish citizens will now need to travel home to vote.
The ‘home-to-vote’ right also expires after 18 months of non-residency, after which Irish citizens living abroad can’t take part in any elections in Ireland.
However, post-Brexit Irish citizens will still retain the right to vote in Westminster and local elections the same way British citizens may vote in Dáil and county council elections but are excluded from constitutional referenda here.
Invested
VICA has said that given the possibility Irish citizens living in the UK will be unable to vote in EU elections after Brexit, the need to extend the presidential election franchise to overseas citizens is “felt all the more keenly by a community that has proven themselves connected to Ireland, and invested in its future and place in the world”.
Sarah Cantwell, VICA member, has been living in London for six years but said her personal ties with Ireland continue to deepen.
“I regularly travel back to help care for family members and to help out with activist movements. Ireland is where I was raised and I plan to live there again in the future.”
“Having a say in which President represents me as an Irish citizen, would acknowledge and affirm the reality of my connections and responsibilities in Ireland,” Cantwell said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/marvin-food-ordering-3-4544189-Mar2019/,"
THE SCENE FOR online food delivery in Ireland has changed dramatically in recent years with the arrival of Deliveroo and most recently Uber Eats.
Along with Just Eat, this big three have dominated the space – but there are smaller players active beneath the surface like Dublin-based Marvin that are trying to carve out their own slice of the market.
Launched in 2015, co-founder James Galvin admits that Marvin has kept a fairly low profile compared to its multinational competitors.
Now with increasing competition from big names, he says he has to get a “lot more tactical” in his efforts.
Marvin, which is part of the Hungry group that also has operations in Denmark, runs a similar model to Just Eat where restaurants can list their food for online ordering with delivery carried out by the outlet’s own fleet.
It actually beat Deliveroo to the punch by launching in Ireland just before the on-demand food delivery food giant arrived here in 2015.
“There was always the threat of a third-party delivery company coming in and trying to shake the market,” says Galvin, who is the former managing director of Just Eat in Ireland.
He says he knew that competition would inevitably force Marvin to rejig its strategies while trying to stay true to its original aims.
“In terms of us being probably the least well-known within the marketplace, we don’t react to everything that our competitors do, mainly for a few reasons,” he says.
“One is that we are not convinced that third-party delivery can be possible at scale, particularly in the current way it operates today.”
That hasn’t stopped the rise of on-demand delivery though. In November of last year, Deliveroo’sdirect rival Uber Eats rocked into town, heating up competition between the companies.

Just Eat has been active in Ireland for over a decade, mostly operating its food delivery booking system for restaurants that have their own fleets, butit has been rolling out its own network of riders too.
This week, the UK-headquartered company reported a 43% bump in revenues in 2018 to £779.5 million – with pre-tax profits of £101.7 million – and it expects to surpass the billion-pound sales mark in 2019.
Battles
Marvin doesn’t have these same deep pockets as the other players so it must “choose (its) battles a lot more wisely”, Galvin says.
“We’re a smaller company, we don’t have the budgets to compete even if we wanted to. We have to be a lot more tactical in terms of how we try to compete in the market overall.”
The company, he says, can be choosy about what areas it launches in and with what restaurants.

“There are spots around the country that we definitely have much more brand recognition in than other spots. That’s deliberate because we’ve targeted those areas specifically for tactical reasons. We believe that they’re easier battles for us,” he says.
Originally Marvin had a “scattergun approach” of trying to sign up as many restaurants as possible.
Galvin adds that the next hurdle for the company is improving its brand recognition among customers.
“We’ve kind of been under the radar a bit with consumers and that’s fine, that’s the next battle for us. Once we achieve we what we need to achieve in terms of restaurateurs, we really have to work harder in making sure our brand is front of mind.”
Marvin is active around Ireland with 800 restaurants on its marketplace, both in urban and regional areas: “There would be towns and provincial areas that might surprise a few people as well.”
Without disclosing the exact number of Marvin users, Galvin says there are hundreds of thousands of accounts at various levels of activity.
Rivals
Despite the seeming dominance of food delivery’s big three, there are some Irish firms trying to take a small slice of that pie.
One startup, Delivery Tab, is trying its hand at on-demand delivery with cyclists deployed on the streets.
On the other side of that coin, Flipdish –which recently raised €4.8 million– builds a software platform to help restaurants and takeaways build their own apps to avoid using marketplaces like Just Eat and Marvin entirely.
Marvin only works with restaurants that have their own means of getting grub from A to B and Galvin can’t see the company ever giving into supplying delivery riders.
“Our average commission rate is around 8% for restaurants,” he says. That contrasts with Just Eat’s marketplace percentage, without delivery, of around 13%.

Deliveroo and Uber Eatshave commissions in the regions of 20% to 30% for their delivery services.
“Our full (unique selling point) in the marketplace is about value. My theory is that if were to try to compete with the third-party delivery companies, we couldn’t offer the same level of value that we do today,” Galvin says.
He’s convinced that Marvin can claim a decent market share around the country, much like its Scandinavian sister company:
“They are the clear number two in Denmark, eventually that will be my aim here.”

It’s time to do the weekly food shop. You sit down on the couch, strap a VR headset on, and browse the aisles of your local supermarket.
Or maybe you feel like getting out of the house, so you head to the supermarket in real life, load up on groceries, and walk out. No need to queue at the checkout – the scanners can tell exactly which items you have in the trolley, and your payment implant means you can pay with the wave of a hand.
It may sound far-fetched, but this kind of future is closer than you’d think. In Sweden,more than 4000 residentshave microchips implanted into their hands, meaning they can pay for food and travel, or get through office doors, without fumbling for a card.

“It’s nothing more than piercing an ear and putting a tiny radio transmitter, essentially, under your skin,” says Bruce Burke in the latest episode of Future Stories. He’s the founder of#PAY Symposium, a US conference dedicated to the future of the payments industry.
In fact, many retailers in Sweden simply don’t accept paper money, due to negative interest rates on cash which make depositing notes and coins a costly effort. The country’s central bank is now pushing for other European countries to adopt the same approach.

WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED the frightening moments when a crush started outside a Co Tyrone hotel where a St Patrick’s Day disco was due to take place last night.
Three teenagers were killed in the crush outside the Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown and a number of others are being treated in hospital.
One of the deceased has been named as 17-year-old Lauren Bullock, who was a pupil at St Patrick’s College in Dungannon. School principal Catherine McHugh said she was a “shining light in our school community”.
The two other teens have been named as 17-year-old Morgan Barnard and 16-year-old Connor Currie. They both attended St Patrick’s Academy in Dungannon.
One boy who went to the disco told theUlster Heraldthat the teenagers were waiting for the gate to open so they could get in.
“Then everyone just started swaying back and forth and pushing from side to side. Suddenly there was a rush forward and the whole queue collapsed and everyone fell to the ground.”
He said he was pinned down on the ground with other people on top of him for around 20 minutes before he was pulled out.
“It was the worse thing I’ve ever experienced, really frightening. I’m traumatised and after this I don’t know if I ever want to go out again.”
Police are working to establish the exact cause of the incident.Liam McBurney / PALiam McBurney / PA / PA

‘My friends can’t breathe!’
A teenage girl who was caught up in the crush described the panic as she and her friends “screamed and pushed back” when the crowd began to move in. Two of her friends fell to the ground.
“I tried to pull them up but at that point there was no room for them to even come back up. So I started screaming at the top of my lungs:
The teen fell herself shortly after.
“As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my life,” she said in a Facebook post today.
The girl said people in the pile-up were “scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breathe”.
Other young people in the group began to pull people out.
“I seen [sic] a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I seen his friends screech as they found out he wasn’t going to make it.”
The two friends she went to the disco with were not injured but another teenager she knew was killed in the crush, she said.
She said everyone had gone there  for an enjoyable night, “but unlike the rest of us, they didn’t make it home”.
Liam McBurney / PALiam McBurney / PA / PA
Police have said they are working to establish the exact cause of the incident. They are continuing to interview people who were there.
A PSNI Major Investigation Team (MIT) has now been appointed to investigate the incident.
“Our heartfelt sympathy is with the family and friends of [the victims] who tragically lost their lives last night and all of those who were there and who may be suffering today,” PSNI assistant chief constable Alan Todd said.
“A major investigation is underway and I can confirm that a specialist team of detectives has now been assigned to the enquiry. They will seek to establish the full circumstances of this dreadful incident,” he said.
Todd said this will be an extensive investigation with “potentially hundreds of witnesses”.
“We will proceed in a sensitive manner and our enquiries are likely to take some time to complete. I thank the Cookstown and wider community in advance for their patience and support,” he said.
Anyone who was present at the Greenvale last night is being urged to get in touch with MIT detectives.
“I can understand that there may be some reluctance to contact police if you are underage, but please do not be concerned. We are investigating the deaths of three young people, young people just like you. That is our focus. We want to be able to give their families answers and your recollection of the events as they unfolded is crucial,” Todd said.
Detectives can be contacted at the dedicated incident room at Dungannon police station by calling 101, extension 53055.
Anyone with any images or footage can pass it to policehere.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-islamic-stater-return-4535037-Mar2019/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT has said an Irish woman reportedly detained in Syria on suspicion of Islamic State membership will be allowed to return to Ireland.
Lisa Smith, who has a two-year-old child, has been detained in Syria by US armed forces.
The Dundalk native previously worked in the Irish Defence Forces but left service in 2011. She went on to convert to Islam and married a Muslim man. It is believed she departed for Syria in 2015 after her marriage broke down. While there, she married a British man. It is understood he was killed two months ago.
Speaking this week, Leo Varadkar said that while more information is needed about the case, Smith will have the right to return to Ireland.
“As an Irish citizen, she will have the right to return to Ireland, as will her child who’s an Irish citizen,” theTaoiseach told reporters on Monday.
“But it’s not just as simple as coming here, and everything proceeding as if nothing had happened.
If Smith does return, it will be the first case of Ireland repatriating a member of the Islamic State group. A small number of Irish citizens have returned from Syria and Iraq, but they did so under the radar.
Readers will already be familiar with the case ofBritish teenager Shamima Begum, who had lost two children and was pregnant with her third when she expressed a desire to leave a Syrian refugee camp and return home to have her baby in England. She said she wanted to raise her child there.
Begum had left London at 15 to join the Islamic State group. In interviews she gave in the refugee camp, she said she did not regret joining the terror group. After heated debate in the UK, the British Home Office made the decision to revoke her British citizenship.
The now 19-year-old gave birth to a baby boy but he perished of pneumonia in the camp before he turned three weeks old.
Two other women from the UK who are living in Syrian camps with their children have also been stripped of their citizenship,according to news reports.
The Dutch justice and security minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus recently revealed his government is cooperating with Syrian authorities in relation to the return of female Isis members and their children to the Netherlands.
However the minister also said, when asked about helpingShamimia Begum’s Dutch husband, that his government does not offer any help to Dutch men in Syria willing to return.
The French government has confirmed it is preparing for the return of French jihadists, though it said this will be done on a “case-by-case basis”.

And although US President Donald Trump has pushed for European countries to take back hundreds of fighters captured in Syria, he has shown an unwillingness for his own country to do the same, even with so-called Isis brides.
When a 24-year-old-woman from Alabama said she wanted to come home, Trump instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeonot to allow her backinto the country.
Hoda Muthana left the US to join Islamic State in Syria when she was 20. She has an 18-month-old son and has said she regrets joining the terrorist group.
She told ABC News: “I wish I could take it completely off the net, completely out of people’s memory… I regret it… I hope America doesn’t think I’m a threat to them and I hope they can accept me and I’m just a normal human being who’s been manipulated once and hopefully never again.”
TheEuropean Commission’s Radicalisation Awareness Network(Ran) hasa manualfor member states on how to respond to the return of terrorist fighters and their families.
It lists a number of reasons that people return, including;
Withfemale returnees, the manual says that some may be unhappy with their experience of hardship and oppression or that their husbands may have been killed in the fighting. Others come back for medical treatment for their children. In a few instances, families have paid for the women’s freedom, rescuing them from terrorist organisations.
Ran explains thatreturning men- in particular – may have been involved in war crimes such as murder, rape and slavery, and may have taken part in terrorist or violent extremist atrocities.
When it comes tofemale members of the terrorist group, the network says depicting them as victims can deprive women of their agency and ignore the fact that Western women who join jihadist groups tend to be “very motivated by ideology”.
According to Ran, many women were led to believe that joining Daesh would give them a sense of empowerment.
Although the main role of women in the Islamic State group is that of a wife and child-bearer, some are also enforcers of public virtue. The all-female al-Khaansa unit can dole out punishments and operate roadblocks to search women. Several Western women have joined this unit.
Childrenwho have been born into and grow up in areas of Islamic State battle have often been exposed to extreme levels of violence. Ran said this creates trauma and potentially desensitises children to brualisation and violence.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said Lisa Smith and her child will have the right to return to Ireland as both are Irish citizens. The government does not have the option of revoking her citizenship – not that it has indicated it would want to anyway – because this would leave her stateless, something that is contrary tointernational human rights law.
Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan has also said every effort will be made to ensure she gets home. He said this is a very complex situation, and that the relevant facts must be ascertained before further steps are taken.
There will be a number of issues for the Irish State to tackle if Smith does return, not least that the government has no experience with this particular situation. Lisa Smith would be a test case.
Rukmini Callimachi, Terrorism Correspondent with the New York Times toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandyesterday that allowing Smith – and other Irish citizens in Syria – to return would put it “far ahead of the curve” as other European countries have been slow to take people back.

The big challenge for Western countries is in sanctioning Islamic State fighters and members on their return.
The Taoiseach has said a security assessment will be carried out before Smith is allowed to return, but that “going to live in Syria, in what was called the Islamic State is not in itself an offence or a crime”.
“I know the authorities there want to interrogate her to see if she was involved in any crimes there, but it’s very possible that she was never a combatant, for example. There may need to be a prosecution there and we need to make sure that if she does return to Ireland that she isn’t a threat to anybody.”
Prosecution is “the real puzzle”, according to Callimachi, who pointed out that there is a presumption of innocence in the justice systems of Western liberal democracies.
She said what is “shocking”, is that Western countries had almost five years to plan for this moment but have left it until “the last little pocket of land is about to fall”.
The European Commission’s Radicalisation Awareness Network is focused on resocialisation and rehabilitation, even if someone has been prosecuted and is in prison.
It recommends that there is investment in resocialisation while returnees are still in detention to decrease their risk of recidivism to violent extremism.
It also suggests that member states consider complementing criminal justice policies with resocialisation efforts for returnees where prosecution is not an option due to a lack of evidence.
Member states are also advised to consider whether they should provide education, employment and housing to help foster rehabilitation.
Mental health practitioners should be involved in screening and treatment if needed. And it should be acknowledged that while returnees might be the perpetrators of violence, they may also be victims of rape, beatings and torture.
Deradicalisation will be an important part of this process and Shaykh Dr Umar Al-Qadri, chair of the Irish Muslim Peace and Integration Council, toldTheJournal.iehe is concerned that Ireland does not have the necessary legislation or systems in place now.
“It’s important that they contact people like myself who can assist in deradicalisation. Religious leaders need to be part of the solution and the government hasn’t contacted me yet. I don’t think they even have the vision to contact those who can provide a counter narrative to those who are radicalised.
Dr Al-Qadri said he twice met with individuals who expressed a desire to join Islamic State at a time when it was starting to gain attention but was “not known for the atrocities we know of now”.
“I spoke to these individuals about how it was a wrong and extreme narrative that has no place in Islam, and that it was a contradiction.
“It did work and I believe it is possible to deradicalise people like Lisa provided there is regret and an acknowledgement they were wrong. There is a chance.”

The famous nightclub has gone on the market along with the Jackson Court Hotel. The property, comprising No. 28-31 and No. 35 Harcourt Street, is for sale by private treaty.
The nightclub, popular since it first opened in 1996, has become a mainstay of the capital’s nightlife in recent years. It most recently inspired a musical written by Ross O’Carroll-Kelly author Paul Howard.
The club’s owners, Cathal and Paula Jackson, have decided to retire.

“Over the past 23 years I have been totally committed to setting up and establishing Copper Face Jacks as one of the most enduring and successful entertainment venues in Ireland,” Jackson said in a statement today.
“It is now time to hand over the reins to new owners who have the energy and the expertise to take Coppers to the next level”.
Dermot Curtin, the agent selling Coppers, has said that because “nothing remotely like this property and business has ever been offered to the market in recent times, there are no comparable sales to measure this opportunity against”.
“However, having spent much of their working lives creating and operating this incredibly successful business, the vendors understand fully what the property is worth and will easily recognise a fair and realistic offer, when it presents itself”.
While the selling agent has not indicated the market price,RTÉhas suggested that it could go for up to €40 million.","4.29pm, 14 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/tom-clonan-who-is-responsible-for-the-incendiary-devices-posted-from-dublin-to-london-this-week-4527216-Mar2019/,"THE IMPROVISED INCENDIARY devices discovered in London this week raise grave security questions – both in the UK and Ireland.
Three suspicious mail packages were discovered on Tuesday of this week.
The first A4 sized package, bearing Irish ‘Love Ireland’ stamps, ignited on opening at 9:55 am at Compass House, near Heathrow Airport.
This postal package, of which pictures have been circulated widely, appears to show evidence of ignition and some burning and charring.
It has also been reported that the package contained ‘jiffy bags’ containing a ‘gel-like’ substance, which failed to fully ignite.
Following the alert that this incident generated, a further two suspicious packages were identified.  At 11:40, the staff at Waterloo Station isolated a similar, suspicious package.  No attempt was made to open it.
Then at 12:10, another similar package was intercepted at City Aviation House in London City Airport.
It is reported that counter-terrorism officers of the London Metropolitan Police have been in contact with an Garda Siochana to discuss the contents and configuration of the ‘viable’ incendiary devices, in order to establish who might have perpetrated the attack.
With regard to the question of Islamist extremists, the pattern of yesterday’s incident does not fit with their modus operandi to date.
Islamic State terrorists in Europe and the UK have tended to use improvised explosive devices known as TATP IEDs – based on Tri-Acetone, Tri-Peroxide bomb-making materials.
These devices are highly explosive and generate a large, powerful detonation – such as that seen in the Manchester Arena attack in which 22 people, mostly children, were killed in May 2017.
I spoke to a former Defence Forces colleague today – a highly experienced Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) or Bomb Disposal officer – with decades of experience of dealing with improvised explosive devices, both in Ireland during the Troubles and throughout the Middle East.
Based on descriptions of the manner in which the Heathrow device was ignited – by friction on opening the package – and based on the evidence of the manner in which it burned, he expressed the view that the device most likely consisted of a gel containing potassium or sodium chlorate and some other readily available household ingredients.
These devices are viable but crude and unstable.  They are designed to burn easily and very quickly and at a very high temperature in order to do as much damage as possible despite detection by a smoke alarm or other fire alarms and countermeasures.
They are typically placed among combustible materials in shops and other premises for maximum effect.
Between 2004 and 2006, dissident republicans placed 10 of these firebombs in premises around Newry and in the border area.  Four large commercial premises were completely destroyed – gutted by fire.
In February 2014, the New IRA sent a large number of these incendiary devices, by mail, to British Army recruitment offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury and Slough.
Advertisement
The New IRA, as a consequence, are of interest in relation to Tuesday’s incidents.
There are a number of features of the incident that are puzzling and which suggest that perhaps an individual or ‘lone wolf’ may have been involved.
The pictures, which purport to show the suspicious package, show two Irish ‘Love Ireland’ postage stamps.  If posted in Ireland, this would have been insufficient postage for the London destination.
If posted in Britain, the Irish stamps would not have been valid for postage.  In both instances, the placing of insufficient or invalid postage stamps on the package would have alerted extra attention – anathema to an experienced terror cell.
According to An Post, over two million items of mail are handled through Irish sorting centres each day.  “Huge volumes of mail” travel between Ireland and the UK using “a variety of means, roads, via ferry or air”.
An Post added that: “Since images of the packages in question have become available, our sorting staff have been briefed on what to look out for and to be extra vigilant”.
If posted in Ireland therefore, these packages would have been placed among mails and packages on board Irish passenger aircraft bound for London.
To cause a viable, but crude and unstable incendiary bomb, to be placed on board a flight from Dublin to London is a reckless and evil act – irrespective of who, precisely is responsible.
If such a device had been disturbed or compressed or otherwise struck whilst among other freight and baggage on a passenger aircraft – it could have triggered a catastrophic fire.
If this had happened after takeoff or in a pressurised aircraft at 37000 feet over the Irish Sea, the consequences would be unthinkable.
If transported by surface mail, a similar catastrophic fire could have been triggered among combustible freight on board a ferry bound from Dublin Port to Holyhead.
If posted in the UK, the packages posed a deliberately lethal threat to dozens of innocent Royal Mail postal workers and other innocent civilians going about their business in the targeted areas in London City Airport, Heathrow and Waterloo Station.
Tuesday’s incident, whoever is responsible, is a most unwelcome reminder of the pervasive threat posed by incendiary devices during the troubles.
In addition to the millions of pounds worth of damage inflicted in such attacks, dozens of innocent men, women and children also lost their lives in fire-bomb attacks.
Those who would carry out such attacks today – as individuals or groups, invoking whatever twisted logic, should desist immediately.
The consequences of such reckless actions, whether intended or otherwise, are potentially catastrophic.
The threat should not be downplayed and should be categorically and unequivocally condemned by all Irish citizens.

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
FROM JIM WRAY’S grave in a cemetery overlooking Derry, his brother Liam can see the exact spot in the Bogside where the 22-year-old fell after being gunned down by a British Paratrooper on 30 January 1972.
Jim was shot twice as he ran for cover in Glenfada Park. Two witnesses to the Saville Inquiry said he was laying on the ground, wounded, when a soldier fired the shot which ended his life.
Today his family, and the families of the other 13 people killed on Bloody Sunday, will hear if the soldiers who fired upon them will face prosecution over the killings.
Jim’s brother Liam (65) says that the family have waited a lifetime for this day. He says they have never given up fighting for justice for the man they knew as ‘the gentle giant’ and his anxiety is rising as day looms.
“There is an anticipation and anxiety,” he says. “After 47 years obviously this is a moment in time that our family have, from day one, always demanded happen. It will be a big day when we hear the news and we just hope that it won’t be a big disappointment.

On 30 January 1972, in what would become known as Bloody Sunday, British soldiers fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians who were taking part in a civil rights march in the bogside in Derry.
In all, 28 people were shot. 13 people died while another person succumbed to their injuries a number of months later. The Widgery Tribunal was held immediately afterwards and largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame.
A second investigation, the Saville Inquiry, was set up in 1998; in 2010 the report was published, and found that the killings were both “unjustified” and “unjustifiable”. The Prime Minister at the time David Cameron apologised on behalf of the UK.
The relatives of those killed have been seeking justice for their family members; it’s expected that the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service will announce today whether charges will be brought against the British soldiers involved.
The looming possibility of prosecutions has caused some controversy lately, prompting people like former British minister Boris Johnsonto defend the soldiersand claim that prosecutions could mean the IRA would “get away” with crimes committed during The Troubles.
Last week, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley cameunder increased pressure to resignafter saying that the killings committed by the British military and police during The Troubles “were not crimes”.
She has since repeatedly apologised for her remarks, in the media and to the House of Commons, saying that she did not mean what she said.
On Tuesday night, ahead of the second Meaningful Vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the British Ministry of Defence announced that its legal fees would be “entirely” paid by the UK government.

Kevin McKinney’s 35-year-old father Gerard was shot in the chest in Abbey Street in the Bogside. Witnesses said that when he saw a soldier, he stopped and held up his arms, shouting “Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!”, before being gunned down. The bullet went through the father-of-eight’s body and struck and killed 17-year-old Gerard Donaghy behind him.
Kevin, who was just 11-years-old when his father was killed, says that his family have forgiven the soldier, that he “was not to blame, rather it was the British establishment who sent him there”.
He says the British government, politicians and all those involved in the day’s killings should be put on trial and that the “soldier played only a small part in a bigger machine”.

“Putting a soldier in jail wouldn’t make me happy whatsoever,” he says.
“Those are the people who should be put on trial. It will never happen though.
“Our faith is very strong,” he says. “Whatever these soldiers did, they will have to answer to God.”

Kate Nash (69) lost her brother William on Bloody Sunday. The 19-year-old dock worker was shot in the chest near the Rossville Street barricade. His dad Alex saw his son being shot and went to help him, and was then shot himself.
Nash says her stomach is “in knots” waiting for today’s news on prosecutions. She has dedicated her entire life to being a voice for her brother and says the families, “just want justice”.
“I want prosecutions and I want convictions,” she says. “My view is that whatever a judge decides is punishment, I will accept. I want murder convictions, that is what is important to me.
“The sentence would not be important to me, it is the prosecution and conviction. That would give me a little closure because it is a burden too. There’s a constant struggle in my mind and thinking ‘how dare they do this’, all the emotions you go through.
“I hear politicians talking about jailing this one and that one, but not soldiers, because they shouldn’t have to face that. What makes them special that they shouldn’t have to face it?

John Kelly lost his 17-year-old younger brother brother Michael that day. He says his mother never got over her teenage son’s death.
“Michael was standing with a group of other boys at a barricade in the Bogside,” he said.
“The soldiers opened fire and hit Michael in the stomach. I helped to carry my brother to the ambulance and I still remember checking him in the back of the ambulance and hoping that he would survive. We brought him into the casualty area and the doctor came along with a nurse and checked him before pronouncing him dead. I remember asking the doctor to check him again to be sure. But he said he was sorry, he was gone.
“My mother never got over Michael’s death. She was so devastated by his death she wasn’t capable of looking after herself. She visited the cemetery every single day. There was one time she walked to the cemetery with a blanket under her arm and when someone asked her where she was going, she said she was taking it to Michael’s grave to keep him warm.
John says that he is hopeful of prosecutions for the soldier who took his teenage brother’s life.
“This is the major day for us in that hopefully we will achieve prosecutions of those who murdered our loved ones,” he says. “What I want is the prosecution of the soldier who murdered my brother. He was a young innocent boy. I want the soldier convicted and I want him to go to jail. I see things quite simply, if anyone is convicted of murder they are sent to jail for life and I believe that should happen here also.
“We have been living this for 47 years, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have done a lot of hard work over the years to get to where we are today. Certainly we hope that it will all have been worthwhile.”
Across the city in the Waterside, the DUP’s Gregory Campbell says the unionist community feel “angry over double standards”. He says that soldier prosecutions will set a “bad precedent” and that the two soldiers killed in the city by the IRA in the days before Bloody Sunday “have been totally forgotten”.
“It appears that there is a hierarchy of victimhood,” he says. “Because there are some relatives of victims who seem to get an inordinate amount of money, resources, investigations and now possibly challenges in court to lead to conviction or whatever, whereas for others there are none of that.
“There is nothing that displays a hierarchy of victimhood more than that.
“And this week we will again see evidence of double standards.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-4-4532186-Mar2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has called on the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to resign, but believes there is a “systemic problem” in Britain that wouldn’t be solved by Bradley’s resignation.
Speaking to reporters this morning, McDonald added to calls on Bradley to go, over comments made in the House of Commons earlier this week.
The Sinn Féin leader also went on the attack against the British government today, accusing the Conservative party of “recklessness” and “indecision”.
On Wednesday, Bradley said in parliament that deaths in Northern Ireland during the Troubles “that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes”.
She added: “They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way.”
After a number of statements seeking to clarify her comments, she said on Thursday evening that she was “profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt” that her words had caused.
Speaking to RTÉ News, Bradley said again that she was “profoundly sorry” for the offence caused, and said she didn’t believe what she said.
The Northern Ireland Secretary has since faced a barrage of criticism over her statement, while this FactCheck foundher original claim to be false.

Sinn Féin’s McDonald said today that “certainly her comments are a resigning matter”.
“It’d be hard to overstate the level of anger and stress it’s generated,” she said.
With a series of crucial votes in Westminster next week that will decide the UK’s course with Brexit, McDonald said these votes coming with just 20 days to go until Brexit was a further sign of the British government “playing down the clock” and “playing for time”.
She said: “If Britain wishes to Brexit, who are we to stop them? They’re not taking the North of Ireland with them. And they’re certainly not going to wreck the Irish economy, or upend our peace process or our peace settlement.”
The Sinn Féin leader added that it’s essential that Dublin and Brussels stands firm in the coming weeks and “doesn’t blink”.
Yesterday, Michel Barnier offered the UK a new Brexit deal which would see it leave the customs union but keep parts of the backstop which would ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.
In a number of tweets sent this afternoon, Barnier said the UK has been offered a way to exit the “single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, in response to Barnier’s tweets, said the ball is in the UK’s court.
He said: “We were and remain happy to apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland, if they want to go back to that. It doesn’t have to trap or keep all of Great Britain in the single customs territory for a prolonged period, or at all.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/from-the-garden-grow-cook-eat-is-back-on-tv-this-month-and-will-be-tackling-food-waste-4524597-Mar2019/,"IF YOU ARE space constrained in your growing, it’s worth considering a fundamental point when deciding what to grow: not all vegetables are the same.
They don’t all give you the same bang for your buck so to speak.
First of all, it’s worth considering that some vegetables are incredibly fast growing and therefore give you a very quick return from the space you have allocated to them.
This means you can very quickly start growing something else in the same space once you’ve harvested them.
You can be eating white turnips for example about two months after sowing them. Radishes will be ready even quicker than that. Other vegetables are very slow growing and will monopolise a piece of ground for ages before giving a return.
Garlic is sown in winter and is not ready to eat until the following summer. Purple sprouting broccoli is growing for almost a year before you get to eat it.
Secondly, different vegetables take up different amounts of space in the ground.
Each carrot for example only needs 3-4cm in your soil, while the Brussels sprouts plant needs to be planted 1m away from its nearest neighbour.
On top of this, there is the question of ‘yield’. Some vegetables return a lot of food for the space they take up. Others really don’t.
At the end of a very long growing season, a well-grown sweetcorn plant, for example, will only give you two cobs for all your effort. You will most likely only get four sweetcorn plants in a metre of growing space since they are planted about 50cm apart. Eight corn on the cob from a metre is a pretty poor return.
Take that same metre of growing space and plant it up with beetroot and you will get about 40 beetroots in four rows with each beetroot spaced 10cm apart in the rows.
Or, if you sowed the metre of space in an oriental green such as mizuna, you will get to harvest food from the plot on multiple occasions since oriental greens are what are known as “cut and come again” vegetables. That is, you cut the plant down to about 5cm and it grows back again to give a second bounty.
Equally well, it’s worth thinking about growing vegetables (or vegetable varieties) that are difficult to source in the supermarket. For example, Jerusalem and globe artichokes, purple sprouting broccoli, fennel, endive, chicory and oriental salads, others are difficult to source fresh, including peas, broad beans, French beans and runner beans.
Finally, some vegetables can be considered particularly valuable because of the time of year in which we can harvest them. Any vegetable that is available to eat fresh from the garden in the tricky “hungry gap” months, from March to May, is worth its weight in gold.
Purple sprouting broccoli is an example of this, which is why we’re generally willing to allow it monopolise space in the vegetable patch almost all year around.
GROW COOK EAT is Back
The GIY TV series GROW COOK EAT is back on RTE 1 TV on March 13th at 8:30 pm presented by yours truly and partner-in-crime Karen O’Donohoe and made possible by our friends in Stop Food Waste and Bord Bia.
In this second series, we share our knowledge on how to successfully plant and grow onions, pumpkins, sweetcorn, courgettes, kale, beans and chillis for all shapes and sizes of gardens and containers.
Every week chef Katie Sanderson uses the freshly grown produce to create seasonal dishes which are easy to make and delicious to eat.
We’re also highlighting some serious food issues including plastic packaging and food waste.
We visit a large scale water harvesting project in a Dublin fire station, a Social Eating Programme in Educate Together National School in Tramore; and the state’s largest Brussels Sprout grower in north County Dublin.

In the first episode, we focus on a household staple – the onion. Easy to grow and very low maintenance, both red and white varieties are sown in the raised bed with Karen holding back some of the sets for container growing.
Meanwhile, I am entirely upstaged by my 12-year old son who gives a masterclass in keeping hens. Karen also heads home to Cork to visit one of her favourite places, Mahon Farmers’ Market to meet the people committed to growing and cooking fresh and seasonal food.
Recipe of the Week: Quick Sausage Casserole
I often use a sausage casserole recipe when I need a quick fix for a mid-week dinner and this recipe takes around 15 minutes to prep. Combine some good quality sausages with seasonal veg and you have a really delicious, healthy and hearty meal.
Ingredients
4 large potatoes
4 carrots
8 good-quality sausages (e.g. Jane Russell)
2 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tsp paprika
400g can chopped tomatoes
400ml vegetable stock
1-2 bay leaves

Directions:
Turn the oven to 180°C.
Peel the potatoes and carefully cut them in half, then into quarters.
Peel the carrots and cut each carrot into about 4 or 5 even pieces.
Prick the sausages all over with a fork – this helps the fat to run out of the sausages, so that they don’t split open as they cook.
Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based casserole and fry the sausages, turning often, until lightly golden all over – this should take about 10 minutes.
Remove the sausages from the pan and put them on a plate.
Add the chopped onion to the casserole (there will still be some oil in the pan from the sausages) and continue to cook over a low heat for 5-10 minutes, until the onion is slightly soft.
Add the garlic and paprika and cook for another minute.
Add the chopped potatoes and carrots and stir everything around in the casserole so that the vegetables are coated with the oil.
Add the tomatoes, bay leaves and stock – to measure the stock, you can use the empty tomato can,  filled up it will hold 400ml of stock.
Bring to a simmer, so it’s just bubbling gently. Return the sausages to the casserole. Using your oven gloves, carefully put the casserole into the oven.
Cook for 45 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through and serve.

https://www.the42.ie/paddy-barnes-2-4548435-Mar2019/,"Gavan Casey reports from The Theater at Madison Square Garden, New York
THREE-TIME IRISH Olympian Paddy Barnes says he’ll “probably retire” from professional boxing after suffering a shock split-decision defeat to Oscar Mojica on his US debut at Madison Square Garden’s Hulu Theater.
The unheralded Texan Mojica, previously 11-5 with just one KO, scored what appeared to be a legitimate knockdown in the second round only to see it ruled a push by referee Danny Schiavone, but he was still awarded the contest on split scores of 58-56 x2, 56-58.
Barnes, the naturally smaller man on the night, was battered and bloodied but fought gallantly, frequently bringing the 4,000-strong, Irish-heavy crowd to its feet.
Despite moving up two divisions from flyweight to bantamweight, Barnes had been expected to take care of business against rank outsider Mojica in a bid to rebound from last summer’s stoppage defeat to Cristofer Rosales in a world title fight in Belfast.
Instead, he was well beaten and saw his professional record drop to 5-2 (1KO).

The two-time Olympic bronze medalist, 31, nodded and applauded the judges’ verdict in the American’s favour. Speaking post-fight, a distraught but brutally honest Barnes said:
“The fans are great, like, but at the end of the day it’s my health and all. If I’m going to box like that, there, what’s the point in boxing on?
Barnes and Mojico trade stiff jabs.Frank Franklin IIFrank Franklin II
Barnes walked out to tune of U2′s ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’, which in itself got a rapturous reception before the sizeable crowd even realised it was a fighter’s entrance music.
Walked to the ring by close friend Carl Frampton among others, and cheered on by Irish WWE star Balor at ringside, it was the Belfast man who found himself bloodied within seconds.
A right hook by Mojica bust Barnes’ nose, painting his face red for the remainder of a testing opening round in which both men enjoyed their share of success.
The second was an absolute war. An assault to the body, with Mojica delivering a ferocious left hook south of Barnes’ rib cage, sent the Irishman staggering backwards before he slumped to the canvas, grimacing, under the Texan’s weight.
It was as legitimate a knockdown as the night is long, but incredibly the man in the middle ruled it a push on behalf of the justifiably furious Mojica. Thankfully for the Texan, it didn’t prove costly in the end.

A belting encounter played out from there, Barnes occasionally coming to life and firing back in threes and fours to the guttural approval of those in attendance. But he seemed to be constantly chasing the contest instead of leading it.
For every ‘Go on!’, there were two or three gasps as the physically larger and stronger Mojica landed at will, redecorating Barnes’ face with blood from his nose during almost every stanza.
The self-styled ‘Leprechaun’ nearly took the roof off, and Mojica’s head with it, by way of a thudding overhand right in the closing stages, but didn’t really come close to finding a finishing blow.

A thrilling encounter was awarded to the correct victor, with the Irish audience only half-heartedly booing the decision.
A thrilled Mojica, meanwhile, paid his dues to Barnes.
“It was really important for me [to hurt him with that body shot], even though they didn’t count it as a knockdown. It gave me confidence. I knew I could hurt him throughout the other rounds. I got a little away from my gameplan, but I stayed sharp for the most part. I deserved to win.","11.24pm, 17 Mar 2019",

Last year’s champion Native River finished fourth and the favourite Presenting Percy couldn’t make an impression, ending up in 8th place.
The race had not began promisingly for Mullins with his other three runners all out of contention on the first circuit. Kemboy unseated David Mullins at the first fence, Bellshill was later pulled up and then Invitation Only took a bad fall with Definitly Red brought down in the process.
“It’s good to get it,” said Mullins. “I didn’t think I was going to have a good Cheltenham this year, the way it was going for me.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/epilim-conference-dublin-4554690-Mar2019/,"ISSUES SURROUNDING A medicine used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder by pregnant women will be heard at a conference in Dublin today.
The National Conference on the Consequences of Epilim will address a number of issues facing families, healthcare professionals and policy makers in relation to use of the drug sodium valporoate, also known as Epilim.
The drug first came into medical use in 1962, but its use by pregnant women has been restricted by the European Medicines Agency in recent years.
The agency became concerned after evidence emerged that there is an increased risk of disabilities to children exposed to the drug in the womb, a condition known as Foetal Valproate Syndrome.
Children who have the condition may develop physical problems, such as spina bifida, as well as developmental issues such as autism, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder.
Although there is no reliable data for how many people in Ireland have the condition, the Health Service Executive has suggested that up to 1,200 people have been affected by it over the past 40 years.
“It’s a serious issue,” Peter Murphy, head of Epilepsy Ireland, tellsTheJournal.ie.
“It has been compared to thalidomide back in the 1960s, and it’s currently part of review that’s ongoing in the UK regarding Valproate and three other products.

“They’re taking it very seriously there, and we’re looking for something similar here.”
Among the issues set to be discussed at today’s conference are the pharmaceutical makeup of the drug, how to reduce the risks associated with it, how to diagnose and manage foetal valproate syndrome, and how those with it live with the syndrome.
The conference will also look at who knew about the side effects of the drug on children exposed to it in the womb, and whether the problems with it were communicated to pregnant women effectively.
Murphy explains that in some cases, women were taking the drug before becoming pregnant and continued to take it during their pregnancy.
Murphy also says that individuals with Foetal Valproate Syndrome, many of whom are adults, often require a wide range of support systems, and that groups such as OACS Ireland have called for more services to become available.
Groups have also called upon Minister for Health Simon Harris to establish an inquiry to find out what happened that led to pregnant women being prescribed sodium valporoate and if there were risks involved in doing so.
However, today’s conference will just look to build on initiatives to do with risk reduction and the establishment of support services for those affected.
“It’s really about a conversation, about acknowledging the problem, and informing and educating people,” Murphy adds.
“Hopefully it’s something that leads to the next step, which is a need to look at this.
“There’s a lot of families involved, and they’re just looking for an explanation for what happened.”","6.05am, 22 Mar 2019",

The report, which has been submitted to Minister for Children Katherine Zappone, includes technical reports prepared as part of the commission’s investigation into the Tuam Mother and Baby Home.

The investigation into the home, which was run by the Bon Secours nuns as a home for unmarried mothers from 1925 until 1961, announced in March 2017 that it haduncovered a significant amount of human remains at the site,
A decision tocarry out a full forensic examination of the site was announced last October.
It follows an investigation into the home by local historian Catherine Corless, who cross-referenced death certifications from the home with local burials, and found that796 children who died at the home were not given an official burial.
The Minister will consider the findings of the latest report and consult the Attorney General, before she seeks Government approval to publish the report as quickly as possible.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rte-northern-ireland-competitions-4545185-Mar2019/,"RTÉ HAS BEEN criticised for changing its policy on premium rate competitions, resulting in people in Northern Ireland being unable to participate.
The national broadcaster changed its policy in January after an internal review showed that it would be in breach of Northern Irish regulations should it continue to allow people in the North to enter the competitions.
The policy will prevent Northern Irish audiences from entering competitions by phone or text where a ‘premium rate entry cost’ is incurred. Competitions include those featured on The Late Late Show, The Ray D’Arcy Show, and RTÉ One.
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Assembly Member Justin McNulty said he had been contacted by “quite a number of constituents” complaining about the issue.
“This is a shambles, and to be frank, it’s a partitionist policy which is preventing people from here participating in these competitions,” said McNulty.

He said he raised the concerns with both RTÉ and the Department of Communities in Belfast.
RTÉ said the change in its policy on premium rate competitions “reflects the outcome of a review examining how regulations governing these competitions in particular are applied in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland”.
“Current regulations in Northern Ireland require that ‘any prize competition’ must have a substantial degree of skill and must be free; regulations in the Republic differ from this.”
McNulty said: “Programmes like The Late Late Show and the Sunday Game are part of every Irish family’s viewing habits, and to tell those of us who live in the North we cannot participate in competitions like the rest of the viewing public on this island is just mind boggling.”
RTÉ said it made the decision following the review to ensure it wasn’t in breach of regulations in Northern Ireland.
It said that this decision applies to premium rate competitions only.
The Department of Communities had not responded to comment at the time of publication.

https://www.the42.ie/johnny-mcdonnell-interview-4547298-Mar2019/,"JOHNNY MCDONNELL DOESN’T do anything halfheartedly, and that includes interviews.
“I’ve got goose pimples on the back of my neck thinking about it,” he says at one point during a 106-minute conversation withThe42. “You have me wound up thinking about this,” he says later on.
It was that wholehearted approach which brought McDonnell success in football and ultimately enabled him to become a St Patrick’s Athletic legend, in addition to many other impressive feats.
1. Early days
Now 53, McDonnell recalls how his first experience of organised football came at Belvedere FC at the age of “eight or nine,” staying there all the way up until U18 level.
McDonnell excelled at this level, to the point where he was picked by Dublin representative teams. He remembers one game up in Milltown against Belfast Schoolboys, where soon-to-be Man United player Norman Whiteside was among his opponents. He also got called up by the international underage team, coming into the squad after future Ireland star John Sheridan withdrew due to injury.
McDonnell’s League of Ireland career began at Shamrock Rovers, who he signed for in 1983.
Bohemians boss Billy Young also wanted to sign the youngster, but the Hoops, who were coached by Jim McLoughlin and Noel King at the time and were at the start of a memorable era where they won four league titles in a row, eventually won the battle for his services.
“I lived in Phibsborough, but I never supported Bohs. Rovers would have been the team I supported when I was a young fella,” he explains.
“I rang Billy and told him I was going to Rovers and I just heard [the line going dead]. I don’t think he spoke to me for a few years [after], but he was a lovely man. I had many encounters with him over the years.”
McDonnell’s time at Milltown turned out to be relatively brief, as he failed to establish himself in the first team, making just a handful of appearances at senior level.

The quality of the squad was such that he can remember lining out for the reserves with a team that featured players of the calibre of Mick Neville, Liam O’Brien and Anto Whelan among others.
Despite the frustration of not playing, McDonnell still regards his experience at Rovers as invaluable.
“I remember I was sitting down in the dressing room. Dermot Keely had just signed for Rovers. I’d been there before Dermot came along. He said ‘here, you have to move there’. I said ‘no, I’m not moving’.
“We all stripped together [the reserves and the senior team] in the dressing room and then the teams were divided out then. I went ‘this is where I strip’. Dermot looked at me. I looked at him. And there was a bit of a standoff. I was only young at the time. And he said ‘well move over, will you?’
2. Upheaval
Realising the move to Rovers wasn’t going to work out, McDonnell made the slightly left-field decision to move to the US to play football, in the process turning down an offer to join Joe Royle’s Oldham, who were then in the English second tier. An old Irish underage room-mate, Denis Irwin, was at the club that he now regrets not joining at the time.
America invoked feelings of homesickness and McDonnell was back in Ireland within a couple of months.
In 1984, the young Dubliner joined Home Farm and there he linked up with a man who would go on to have a substantial and recurring influence on his career — Brian Kerr.
Kerr was working as an assistant at the club and McDonnell had already met the future national team boss during their time together in the Irish underage set-up.
One notable occasion in those early days saw McDonnell and his team-mates line out against Derry City for thefirst-ever League of Ireland match at the Brandywell, with the Candystripes prevailing 3-1.

Adapting to regular senior football was “easy enough” for McDonnell,” having been well prepared from his time at Rovers, while his team-mates included Mick Moody, Terry Daly and Dave Henderson.
McDonnell impressed in these early matches and when manager Mick Lawlor left the club to manage Drogheda, he convinced the promising defender and Kerr to come with him.
3. The start of something special
Yet both Lawlor and McDonnell’s time at the Drogs was short-lived. The former Shamrock Rovers star resigned by November 1986 and the youngster left after just a year, reuniting with Kerr, who had undertaken his first job as a number one with St Patrick’s Athletic.
The Dubliner did not take long to build a top side. With McDonnell an integral player, Pat’s were soon challenging for the title.
In the 1987-88 campaign, they were pipped to the league by Dundalk, losing out on the final day by a single point.
The following season was not quite as encouraging, as the Saints came fourth, 10 points behind champions Derry.
But it was in the 1989-90 campaign that they finally triumphed in the league, gaining revenge on the Candystripes by finishing three points ahead of them.
McDonnell says Kerr deserves considerable credit, as Pat’s ended a 34-year wait to win the trophy.
“You know who I compare Brian to sometimes? The Meath [GAA] manager Seán Boylan. Seán used to pick fellas from the second division in Meath to play in the great Meath teams. I always think of Brian like that. He could go and identify a fella.
“I remember he rings me one day and says: ‘Howya? I want you to come down with me and see a fella, a bit of a player.’ We went down to Mount Merrion and Paul Osam was playing. I said to Brian: ‘Seriously?’ He said: ‘I just wanted to be 100% about him. He looks a little bit lazy.’
“But you could see straight away Paul was going to be a great player. He could have been even better than what he was. He really could have been absolutely anything.
“But we signed Paul that week and he was playing in the Leinster Senior League at the time and not even in the top division. That’s how good [Brian] was.”

On Osam, McDonnell adds: “He could play anywhere — central midfield, right, left, up top, centre half, I always felt you were waiting for the phone call for Paul to go away. I’m not saying he wasn’t dedicated, but at the time, Paul was probably happy where he was. I felt there was more in him and I don’t mean that in a bad way. Somebody probably should have taken a chance on him.
“Brian also pulled Mark Ennis out of nowhere. He had him at Shels’ B team years ago. He was a skinny, scrawny fella. We’re looking at him going: ‘Brian, are you serious?’ He goes: ‘This fella’s alright.’
“He signed Joe Lawless from Bohs. I think he had to pay for Joe, but the partnership was brilliant. Joe did all the battering and the hard work, and Mark was a brilliant goalscorer.”
“Damien Byrne would have been a fair bit older than us. He was probably 30 odd when we won the league in 1990. Pat Fenlon came from Chelsea. Brian said to me: ‘John, there’s a young fella in Ballybrack, will you bring him to training?’ I lived in Ballybrack.
“[Curtis] was very unlucky also. He was to sign for Aberdeen. Ian Porterfield was the manager — he got sacked. He was to sign for Swindon — Lou Macari was the manager, and he got sacked. Every time he was about to put pen to paper, managers were getting sacked.
“Lennie Lawrence at Middlesbrough signed him and he went on [to have a successful career in England]. He probably would have done a lot better internationally, only Denis Irwin was playing at full-back.”
4. Success at last
McDonnell can still remember vivid details in relation to that 1990 title triumph.
“It was a bank holiday weekend. It was the old season format. In around this time of year. We had UCD on the Sunday. We were playing in Harold’s Cross when Inchicore was being renovated. We beat UCD. Then we played the next day on the Monday as well against Drogheda.
“Derry would have been the team competing with us for the league at the time. Alex Krstic, Paul Doolin, a number of the Rovers fellas would have gone up with Jim McLoughlin to Derry.
“We won the league in Drogheda with a game or two to go.”

Although McDonnell felt pressure amid this hectic run-in, there was a confidence within the group that superseded everything else.
“When you win a league and you’re going through a season, no matter what happens, you kind of get this self-belief, and not in a cocky way, that no matter what happens today, we’re going to be okay. We only conceded 22 goals that season and 12 or 13 games were 1-0 or 2-1 wins.
“I remember we were doing meditation and visualisation with that team. Even back then, Brian was doing that type of stuff. Concentration, think about what you’re going to do, how you’re going to play the game. They call it ‘managing the game,’ he was doing that stuff back then. And what happens in the next minute is the most important thing, not the last minute. You’re like: ‘What’s he on about?’ But it always gave you confidence.
“I remember we went down to Cork and they battered us – Patsy Freyne, John Caulfield, Pat Morley and that group. Me and John used to have some terrible battles. We defended and defended. Long throw-in from Curtis, Joe Lawless turned it around, boom, Mark Ennis stuck it in the back of the net — that’s what won us the league that year. That was a huge win that led on to pushing us into the last three or four matches.
“We used to train behind the goal where the shed is in Inchicore. The slaughterhouse was there and there was grass used to graze the cattle. We used to train in there. We used to chase the sheep off the pitch or put them with their parents.
“We used to go across the road, into the flats in Inchicore, sweep the glass off the tarmacadam pitches.
“And there’s nothing wrong with my hips or ankles. One fella was saying to me this 4G pitch stuff is a bit hard on your ankles.
“The co-operative pitches were there with the steel goalposts and stuff. Sometimes the locals would be giving out.”

5. Moving on
Despite these fond memories, McDonnell left Pat’s not long after they won the league in favour of a return to Shamrock Rovers.
“Pat’s hadn’t a penny,” he explains. “Rovers offered me money. The team was kind of breaking up. A couple of lads went to Bohs. If we were getting offered a tenner at Pat’s, Rovers were offering 40 quid a week or something.
“Brian went fucking ballistic when I went. There was no money coming into the club. I don’t know the logistics of it or what happened, but they had no money to offer players.
“I remember Pat Fenlon went to Bohs. There’s a fella, Malachy Brophy, he’s an optician and Pat’s eyesight wasn’t great. He always had to wear glasses. Sometimes in training when it got dark, it would affect him.
“There wouldn’t have been a lot of people wearing contact lenses at that stage, that’s how far back it was. Pat went to Bohs — they offered deposits for fellas putting down houses. It was a substantial amount of money that other clubs were offering.
“If you ever see Pat and have a chat with him, say: ‘Did you ever hear of a fella called Malachy Brophy?’ He’ll laugh. He’ll totally get it.”
McDonnell continues: “Brian didn’t speak to me for fuckin’ [a long time] after leaving Pat’s. Brian just couldn’t hold it together because of the finances. He couldn’t get [why we left] and thought we should stay at the club. We were together and we were a group. But fellas had to pay bills.”
Life at the Hoops was not perfect either, however. Rovers were no longer quite the formidable force they had been in McDonnell’s first stint there, as they struggled to adapt to the fallout and financial issues that arose after the club waved goodbye to their much-loved Milltown home.

6. Coming home
The club’s then-manager, the late former Ireland international Ray Treacy, asked McDonnell to slot in at right-back — a position he was less than comfortable filling.
“They went on to win the league at Rovers after I left and Rovers were obviously trying to build something themselves.
“But John McNamara was the chairman. I said ‘look John, it’s costing me money if I don’t play, I’m not getting appearance money. I’m playing right full, I’m not happy. I think Pat’s and Rovers agreed a fee.
“Brian got things going again, the club got back on their feet and he brought a few fellas back.”
After a year away, McDonnell’s second spell at Pat’s proved just as rewarding as his first. In addition to some familiar faces, new players were recruited, including Eddie Gormley, Dave Campbell and Richie O’Flaherty.
“Again, a mixture of a team that would have been [not renowned as the league’s best players],” he says.
Success was far from instantaneous after McDonnell re-joined the Saints. In his first three seasons back, they finished seventh, ninth and fifth, gradually rebuilding the side, before a 1995-96 campaign to remember. By now team captain, he can still clearly remember the day when Pat’s emulated their 1990 predecessors by winning the league title.
“A couple of seasons before, Bohs had lost the league after their bus broke down [before a crucial game].
“It was pissing rain, I’ll never forget it. The pitch was in bits. And Paul Campbell scores a magnificent free kick. So both titles I won with Pat’s, we won them in County Louth. That was a good night. We stopped everywhere on the way back I can tell you. It went on for a few days back in Inchicore also.
“The groundsman, Harry Boland, was a gas character. He used to say to Brian, talking about managers: ‘I’ve seen them come and I’ve seen them go.’ He was there all his life as the groundsman. Brian would say ‘you’ll never see me go’. Harry said: ‘We’ll see about that.’ And Brian did leave to join the Irish youth team. And Harry was still there, so Harry got one up on him — not too many people do.”

7. Man manager
While Kerr left the Richmond Park outfit, his legacy remains. McDonnell admits to owing the esteemed coach a considerable debt of gratitude due to the influence he had on him both on and off the pitch.
“Brian needed to go to the next level and what he did with all the youth teams was fantastic, history. All the top players that would have come through himself and Noel [O’Reilly], I wasn’t surprised what he did and how quickly he did it.
“I remember being in an airport and Gerard Houllier comes up going ‘Brian, Brian, Brian’. He was the manager of Liverpool at the time. But people forget that Brian would have played against all their teams. He had the total respect of all the managers around Europe.
“He was brilliant for me, not only as a footballer, but as a person. He had that in him as well. You know the old schoolteacher look? Brian would sit down and say ‘I’m disappointed about that’ or whatever.
“I’m sure if you spoke to Richard Dunne or Damien Duff or Robbie Keane, they would probably say something like I’m saying to you now.
“There’s no doubt he has that about him and that’s why he’s successful. When you do things for him, you absolutely do it, and he gives you that self-belief and confidence.”
8. Northern exposure
Not long after Kerr departed Pat’s, McDonnell followed suit. With Pat Dolan installed as manager and the experienced player now in his 30s, he did not feel part of the club’s long-term plans and consequently chose to move on.
“It’s probably just my personality,” he adds. “Other people feel a bit threatened with me sometimes. I’d started doing my coaching badges, I knew I wanted to go into coaching, I got the opportunity to go up the north.
“Prior to that, Pat Fenlon had moved to Linfield and the manager was Trevor Anderson. Trevor went down to Newry with Joe Rice. They wanted to get a few players in to compete with the Glentorans and the Linfields.
“So I went to meet with Joe and Trevor and it was a bit of a no-brainer. I went in looking for two and I got four. Pat’s were still offering two and a half.”

McDonnell helped his new team gain promotion to the top flight, before taking over as player-manager the following season.
“Trevor left — I don’t know what happened. So they said ‘you have to take over the team Johnny’. That was my first experience of managing and coaching. I loved it, it was absolutely brilliant.
“Everything fell into place, because all these lads [from elsewhere] used to just go up on the Saturday [to Newry]. I couldn’t do that. I was training Tuesday, Thursday and playing on Saturday. I remember doing three nights a week in pre-season and people started hearing about these fellas at Newry. So I put the hours in at Newry. We qualified to Europe through [finishing fourth to reach the 1999 Intertoto Cup].”
To this day, McDonnell remains the only person ever to manage Newry in Europe. In the first round, they came up against Croatian side Hrvatski Dragovoljac, losing 1-0 away, before prevailing 2-0 at home to secure an aggregate victory.
In the second round, they faced Bundesliga side Duisburg, again holding their own. They lost the first leg in Germany 2-0, before exiting the competition despite a commendable 1-0 win in the home encounter, thanks to former Shels and Bohemians star Mark Rutherford’s 27th-minute goal.
“My claim to fame in Newry is: when I went to Newry, they were a town and when I left, they were a city,” McDonnell laughs, referring to the decision togrant the area city statusby Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate her Golden Jubilee in 2002.
9. Managing expectations
After resigning from Newry, McDonnell’s next destination was Dublin City, a newly formed League of Ireland club at the time who were previously known as Home Farm Fingal.
The move to Shels coincided with the official end of McDonnell’s playing career. In addition, while working as a number two at the Dublin club, along with Gerry Smith, he agreed to temporarily coach the Irish team at the 2003 Fifa World Youth Championship. His old friend Kerr had initially been expected to manage the side in the tournament hosted by the United Arab Emirates, but had to opt out, after agreeing to become the Ireland senior boss.
The competition was originally planned for earlier in the year, but got postponed because of the Iraq War, instead taking place in late November and early December.
The Irish squad included Glenn Whelan, Keith Fahey, Darren Potter, Stephen Paisley, Paddy McCarthy, Stephen Kelly, Wayne Henderson, Brian Murphy, Willo Flood, Stephen Elliot and Kevin Doyle. The Boys in Green emerged top of a group that also included Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Ivory Coast. In the round of 16, however, they suffered an agonising golden-goal 3-2 loss to Colombia after extra time.

Of all the Irish players who featured on that trip, the individual who has had the most successful career out of all of them was arguably Whelan, who would go on to play regularly in the Premier League with Stoke, as well as winning 85 caps and counting for Ireland.
“You knew what you were going to get with Glenn, you were getting 7/10 every match. People think he always goes backwards and sideways — Glenn has a good range of passing. But when he plays that holding role, he does it well. He breaks things down and you can guarantee, he’ll be there for you week in and week out, and he would complement the likes of Keith Fahey.
“Keith would do the big cross-field diagonal balls, or he’d drive forward with the ball. Darren Potter was a great player. He was at Liverpool at the time, but spent most of his career at Wimbledon.
10. Once a Saint…
In 2004, not long before Shels famously gave Deportivo a scare in a memorable Champions League qualifier, McDonnell departed the club. The lure of a return to Pat’s, this time as manager, proved too strong to resist. He took over from Eamonn Collins, who subsequently agreed to take McDonnell’s old job at Tolka Park.
The Richmond Park outfit had fallen on hard times and were in danger of relegation in McDonnell’s first season, but he helped steer them to safety ultimately.
The following campaign saw an improved Pat’s side finish seventh in the table as well as reaching the FAI Cup final, which they lost after extra time, amid a thrilling 4-3 encounter to a Stephen Kenny-managed Derry City team.
“We probably should have won,” he recalls. “That would have been a huge achievement for me, because Pat’s hadn’t won it since 1961.”
Gradually though, McDonnell was putting together a fine squad, which included gifted players such as future Ireland international Keith Fahey and Mark Quigley.
They finished second in the league, seven points behind Paul Doolin’s Drogheda, with the runners-up spot paving the way for a memorable 2008-09 Uefa Cup run.
In Europe, Pat’s secured aggregate victories over Latvian club Olimps, as well as Elfsborg, whose side included experienced Swedish internationals such as Anders Svensson and Teddy Lučic.
“One of their midfielders had about 90 caps for Sweden, Keith Fahey played him off the pitch,” McDonnell remembers.

They eventually bowed out in the next round, losing 2-0 to Hertha Berlin on aggregate, after a creditable 0-0 second-leg draw against the Bundesliga side, whose team featured Lukasz Piszczek (currently at Dortmund), Andriy Voronin (on loan from Liverpool) and Arne Friedrich (who would earn 82 Germany caps over the course of his career).
“We played them in the Olympic Stadium, a fantastic place, the 2006 World Cup final had been played there. The whole experience was brilliant. We went unbeaten that season at home in Europe.”
11. A star in the making
Undoubtedly the standout performer to emerge from this improbable run was Fahey, who would go on to sign for Birmingham in 2009, spending four years in England and making over 100 appearances for the club, with his participation in a 2011 League Cup triumph the clear highlight from his time across the water.
“Keith had come back from England [he played for Arsenal and Aston Villa at youth level]. He was at Bluebell and he did a bit at Pat’s. We sold Keith to Drogheda for a few quid. I said ‘we have to sell you’. We did need the money at the time. I said ‘you’ll be back’ and within six months, he was back playing for us. He just didn’t hit it off in Drogheda.
“He was always too good [for the League of Ireland]. There was no one else but himself holding Keith back. Once we got him a bit of belief in himself and he played so well on the European run, Birmingham bought him and he did brilliantly.
“There would be times where Keith got to boiling point and would show a bit of frustration. I’d say to him: ‘I’ll see you on Tuesday, don’t come in on Monday.’ I knew if he came in on Monday, something could annoy him and there might be a bit of trouble at training. I don’t mean that in a bad way. He wanted everything to be 100% right.
“He used to come in on Mondays with Gary Dempsey and Mark Quigley, they set training alight. It would be flying — bang, bang, bang, 100 miles an hour.
“Keith took his chance with both hands, starting for Ireland under Giovanni Trapattoni in the qualifying campaigns.
“I went to see Keith play in his first match for Birmingham at Old Trafford. We hung around after the match. He was playing against Paul Scholes, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick in midfield. The tighter the game got, the better he got. He never gave the ball away in the tighter areas, he was brilliant.
“After the game, he knew where I was sitting, so he came over. Keith said: ‘How did I do?’ I said: ‘Well, you were only playing against Scholes, Carrick and Fletcher, and you weren’t any worse than the three of them. Is that alright?’ He had a big smile and gave me a hug.
“I have good time for Keith. I don’t speak to him every week, but we meet up for coffee and stuff. He always reminds me — we played Spurs in a friendly match with Pat’s in Inchicore. One of the music festivals was on at the weekend and we played Spurs on the Monday. Sean O’Connor and ‘Fats’ never made training on the Sunday morning after the festival. I didn’t play either of them and he couldn’t believe it. He realised then that this was serious stuff. It was all prior to the European success as well. I said ‘no, you’re not playing against Spurs’. He said ‘but Robbie Keane…’ I said ‘I don’t care, you’re not playing against them, you didn’t turn up for training. End of story.’
“It was the night Gareth Bale made his first appearance for Spurs.They beat us 1-0. Robbie scored the winner.”

Pat’s finished second again in the 2008 season, albeit a substantial 19 points behind champions Bohemians. It was then that McDonnell chose to end his third stint at the club.
“I thought I couldn’t get any further with this. I needed a break. I’d been there for years and years, and felt I’d taken the team as far as it could go.”
12. Islands in the sun
In September 2009, McDonnell briefly returned for a second spell in charge at Newry, but the club was no longer the force it had been in his previous stint. He resigned after only seven months at the helm, having taken nine pointsfrom a possible 60 in the league.
A month later, he was back working with Kerr. The former Ireland boss was in his second year in charge of the Faroe Islands and decided to appoint McDonnell as assistant manager.
For the Euro 2012 qualifiers, they were paired in a group with Italy, Estonia (who would go on to face Ireland in the play-offs), Serbia, Slovenia and Northern Ireland.
“It’s like the west of Donegal. There’s 49,000 people [in the Faroe Islands]. Brian had turned the whole thing around for them. They got a couple of draws and I did one campaign with him. Brian would have been up there more than I would.
“If the match was on the 20th, Brian would be up there for three weeks. I’d go for 10 days prior to the matches and we’d be preparing the teams.
“We were winning 1-0 and just as the official was putting the board up for five minutes [added time], they scored. And they beat us 2-1 in injury time. That kind of knocked us back a bit.
“We beat Estonia at home. We drew with Northern Ireland at home — we were winning 1-0 and Kyle Lafferty scored a late equaliser for them. We were beaten 1-0 at home by Italy. They all played — De Rossi, Bonucci, Chiellini, Balotelli.
“We played Italy away. Cesare Prandelli was the manager. He had been the ex-Fiorentina manager. He played his first match in Florence. He had a fair idea they were going to win the match — he would have been sacked if they didn’t. The place was packed — he brought back Cassano, Montolivo, fellas who had been left out of the team.
“We went to look at the stadium the night before. There’s a big statue of Gabriel Batistuta. We didn’t let the lads train, because we used to find if we let them train the night before the matches, it was too much for them. We used to just let them have a look to see where they’d be on the pitch, visualise things.
“The ground was full before we even arrived, because it’s Prandelli and it’s Florence. The lads were in their tracksuits. Next thing we hear this big roar. The Azzurri had come in and they’re in their fucking Armani suits. It was unbelievable. The suits were worth a whole lot more than the tracksuits we had.
“The game started and we were well organised. I said to Brian ‘there’s about 15 minutes gone and it’s 0-0′. I said ‘we’re doing alright, aren’t we?’ He said: ‘Yeah, but we haven’t touched the fucking ball yet.’
“They beat us 5-0. It was a June night. I’ll never forget it. De Rossi was playing in midfield with Pirlo and Montolivo just ahead of those two.
“I went: ‘This is what football’s about.’ I went down after the match, shook hands and the whole lot. Somehow, I got Pirlo’s jersey. The two buses were outside the ground together. We’re coming out and we’re scrapping away, bringing gear out.
“Cesare Prandelli’s standing there having a smoke. He goes ‘hello, well done’. He was being very polite. His English wasn’t great, but in my best North Dublin accent, I go ‘it was the bleeding fourth goal that killed us there’. We just laughed and shook hands.
“We’d go back to the Faroes and analyse how the matches went — a debriefing and all that stuff. We went back home to Dublin four days later. I had to go back to work. It was a taxi business. I kind of found it hard after playing against World Cup finalists, Italy. I just go back to work and the first guy goes: ‘Howya boss? Ballymun please.’ I’m just after playing with the Italians. So from one extreme to another, but great times.”

On the Northern Ireland game, McDonnell adds: “They arrive and they’re staying at the same hotel [as us] in the Faroes. We used to have to fly Dublin to Copenhagen, Copenhagen to the Faroes.
“One of the lads who was part of the Northern Ireland travelling party, I said: ‘Any chance of giving myself and Brian a lift back to Belfast?’ So we drew 1-1 and they gave us a lift back. I told my brother we’d be in Belfast in about an hour and a half, so he came up and brought us home.
“So we not only took a point off Nigel Worthington’s team, but they gave us a lift back on the chartered flight.
“We then beat Estonia in the Faroes. Brian was out doing the interviews with the TV. Just the joy out of the lads that played for us, to get something out of the game, to get a win, it was one of the best nights I’ve had.”
13. The beginning of the end
Once Kerr and McDonnell finished up with the Faroes after that campaign, the latter went back to Shels, this time as manager. Nevertheless, the Dublin club were by now an under-the-radar First Division outfit, after suffering serious financial problems, in contrast with McDonnell’s stint as assistant a decade previously when they were the top side in Ireland.
“Longford had a good team that year. They won the league, we finished second and Galway were third. We finished about 10 points ahead of Galway. Our goalkeeper got injured three games prior to the end of the season. In the play-offs, we got Galway and they beat us.
“And then I did a season at Drogheda. I went up there and finished halfway through it. It just didn’t happen for me. The chairman was a lovely fella. That was kind of my last hurrah with the league clubs.”
These days, McDonnell is back at Belvedere, working with a number of talented youngsters who hope to someday emulate the success he has enjoyed in football. He also helps out Dublin City University’s Collingwood Cup team and as much as he enjoys this work, the St Pat’s legend says he would be open to a League of Ireland return in some capacity one day, having been away for the past four years.

For almost all of his career in football, McDonnell balanced life in the sport with a second job, and he intends to keep doing so for the foreseeable future.
“You always had to. I was full-time at Pat’s for the last two years, but other than that, you’re always doing something else. Keith Long was working [another job] up until last season. He’s only just gone full-time with Bohs. The industry’s not there.
“There are always two or three clubs [that are the exception], Dundalk or Rovers are full-time. But you always had something else going on. And it was always something that would allow you to do your football, which was great with the taxi business. I used to work for an insurance company, but was finding it hard to get time off work, so [other jobs] suited me. The football pushed me into something flexible.”
14. Epilogue
And given all he has achieved in football, McDonnell’s advice for youngsters is certainly worth listening to.
“You can’t be the best centre half in Ireland if you don’t work hard,” he says. “I would absolutely take constructive criticism.
“I wouldn’t have needed people to tell me I played well, and I don’t mean that in a cocky way.
“I would have known playing a match, I played well, yet what could I do better? Or I would ask people that I trusted what I could do better.
“At Pat’s, I used to go and watch Jackie Jameson and Bohs playing, to see what way he turned, so if I was playing against him the following week, I knew a little bit about him.
“For the career I’ve had, I’ve been all over the world, I could walk away from football and [be happy].
“People say you played against Roy Keane and Eric Cantona at Manchester United, what was it like? I go: ‘It was just a match.’ It was just your next match and I was comfortable in what I was doing.
“I couldn’t play friendlies or challenge matches. My concentration would go, because I need to be a 100% all in. I treated the game with respect no matter who I was playing against, whether it be Tony Cascarino, or Alan Shearer, or others I’ve played against. Once I got on the pitch, I wanted to win everything. I wanted to win the chase for the ball, to not concede any goals.
“I have youth and inter-league caps, I got beaten in two cup finals, I won a league up the north, I won two leagues down here, player of the month awards, this and that. All my stuff is in my ma’s house. Sometimes I just go out, and open the press, and remember.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-long-awaited-surrogacy-laws-still-wont-recognise-many-parents-4513551-Mar2019/,"INTERNATIONAL SURROGACY ARRANGEMENTS are popular among Irish couples, according to a recent survey involving 90 countries.
The surveycarried out by Families through Surrogacy, an international non-profit organisation that provides support to couples and individuals going through this process of assisted human reproduction, concludes that Ireland has the second-highest rate of surrogacy use in the world.
Indeed, the Department of Foreign Affairs reports that 159 babies born to surrogates abroad have entered Ireland with their intended parents via Emergency Travel Certificates in the last decade.
Nonetheless, surrogacy remains unregulated by Irish law – this is why the vast number of Irish couples who want to use surrogacy to conceive must go to the US, Canada, the Ukraine and other jurisdictions where this method of assisted human reproduction is recognised.
In those jurisdictions where surrogacy is regulated, both of the child’s intended parents, ie the couple that commissioned the arrangement, are recognised as his/her legal parents.
However, this is not so upon their return to Ireland, and proposed surrogacy laws will not alter this.
Under Irish law, provided he is the genetic father, the intended father in an international surrogacy scenario can be recognised as the child’s parent and guardian following a successful court application.
But the intended mother or, in a same-sex relationship the intended co-father, cannot be recognised as the child’s other legal parent and can only be appointed a guardian by the court a minimum of two years after the child’s birth.
The General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill contains long-awaited proposals to regulate surrogacy in Ireland, but it will not change the existing status quo to enable such intended parents (mothers/co-fathers) who chose international surrogacy (or who might choose it in the future) to establish their legal parenthood under Irish law.
Instead, it will only regulate surrogacy arrangements carried out in Ireland.
The General Scheme was drafted by the Department of Health, which has emphasised that the State can only regulate assisted human reproduction activities that occur in Ireland.
This is contrary to the approach adopted by the State under the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 because that legislation expressly regulates assisted human reproduction activities that occurred outside of the State.

So an intended parent of a child previously conceived via donor sperm in an Irish or foreign clinic can apply to the court to be recognised as a legal parent if he or she is the mother’s spouse, civil or cohabiting partner.
Similarly, the original draft of the 2015 Act would have allowed an intended parent of a child previously born through a surrogacy arrangement, in Ireland or abroad, to apply to the court for recognition as a legal parent.
He or she would have to be the genetic male parent’s spouse, civil or cohabiting partner, and an Irish citizen, or ordinarily resident here.
The surrogate’s consent to the making of the court order would have been necessary.
Interestingly, the surrogacy arrangement could even have been commercial in nature, ie one where the surrogate received a fee.
However, the surrogacy provisions contained in the original draft of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 were deleted in their entirety six months before the Act became law.
As enacted, the 2015 Act regulates donor-assisted human reproduction, but not surrogacy.
Even if the State is wedded to the notion of only regulating domestic surrogacy going forward, it is unfair to penalise those couples who previously availed of international surrogacy at a time when surrogacy was simply not a viable option here in Ireland.
About 68% of all surrogacies for Irish couples are estimated to have taken place in Ukraine.
The State cannot enact legislation that willfully chooses to ignore the intended parents of those Irish children previously born to surrogates abroad.
Any new surrogacy law should at least enable an intended parent of a child previously born to a surrogate abroad to apply to an Irish court for a declaration of legal parenthood.
Before enacting future legislation on surrogacy, the Oireachtas must first look back and reconsider one significant part of the proposals that were scrapped from the original draft of the Children and Family Relationships Act almost five years ago.

Kieran O'Connor is battling cancer for a third time since 2017.Cathal Noonan / INPHOCathal Noonan / INPHO / INPHO
FORMER CORK DEFENDER Kieran O’Connor went out for a walk just a few days after recently having part of his leg amputated.
Kieran enjoyed an exceptional football career with the Rebel county and the Aghada club. He started for Cork in two All-Ireland finals and was part of the panel that ended a 20-year wait to lift the Sam Maguire in 2010.
A distinguished man-marker, he was regularly assigned the job of marshalling some of the best forwards in the country, including Kerry legends Colm Cooper and Declan O’Sullivan.
Kieran was never daunted by those challenges. He savoured the opportunity to face down players of that quality.
And as Kieran remarked in an interview with theIrish Examinerlast November, “two different Cork managers on two different teams asked me to mark those players, so I had to be showing something”.
He reached the pinnacle of his sport, but now he was battling cancer for a third time and part of his leg needed to be removed.
This was a different challenge to the ones he experienced in a Cork jersey.
But when his former Cork manager — and local Aghada man — Conor Counihan came to visit him a few days after the amputation, the same irrepressible spirit that carried Kieran throughout his football career was evident once again.
Counihan was inspired by Kieran’s character in the face of yet another setback.

“Unfortunately, his leg had to be amputated below the knee but he was still very positive and that,” Counihan tellsThe42.
“I met him I’d say a couple of days after that, he had been fitted with a prosthetic and he had been out on the road walking up and down.
“He was very, very positive and then the news broke last week. But again, having talked to him, he’s been quite positive. Everyone around the place is very positive. Obviously, it’s a tough story but I think everyone in the community has been amazed at the level of support that he has got.
“It’s incredible, it’s the attitude you want everyone to have but I don’t know could everyone produce it to the extent that Kieran does.”
Kieran and his clubmate Pearse O’Neill have grown up together in Aghada and the pair are heading for their 40th birthday this year.
Along with Counihan, Aghada had three representatives in the Cork squad who were victorious in 2010. Counihan managed the side to glory, while O’Neill played a key role in their attack as they edged out Down in the All-Ireland final.

O’Neill reflects on the fond memories they all shared when they brought the Sam Maguire Cup to their home parish that year, and in the three decades he soldiered alongside Kieran, he can’t remember the defender ever having a bad game.
“Any time there was a marquee forward against us at U21 or senior or whatever grade, Kieran was the man for him. He’s always delivered. He’s a tremendous man-marker and one of these lads who will always be up for the battle.
“He relished the bigger names and never let us down.”
Writing in the Irish Examiner last weekend, Cork’s 2010 captain Graham Canty referred to Kieran as one of Cork’s“100 percenters”.
O’Neill often experienced that quality in Kieran when they were paired together for drills at Aghada training, and he always found him to be a tricky opponent.

“Even in training he was a competitor. You’d never get anything easy off him.”
RALLYING SUPPORT
Kieran was first struck with cancer when a type of bone tumour called Ewing’s sarcoma was discovered in 2017. The diagnosis stemmed from a pain in his right ankle, which Kieran mistook as the long-term effects of racing around after the likes of Cooper and O’Sullivan.

After shrinking some of the tumour, Kieran had surgery to shave off part of the bone. He underwent chemotherapy while also having scans and blood tests carried out as part of his treatment.
Kieran came through all that and was already looking to the future just before Christmas 2018 when he embarked on a charity calendar idea called the ‘Local Bulls Calendar’.
A number of willing locals rallied alongside him to put their skin on display in the photos for the fundraiser, with all the proceeds going towards Pieta House and Mercy Hospital for mental health and cancer awareness.
Counihan “shied away” from the venture, but he wasn’t surprised to see Kieran making such a gesture so quickly after his own illness.
“He’d be a great community person and great to give time to other people. That wouldn’t surprise me at all.”
Local support rushed to Kieran’s aid once more when he was struck with cancer again recently. People have come together to organise fundraisers to help Kieran and his family cover his medical costs.
Aghada GAA and the ‘Friends of Kieran’ group have organised a walk which will take place later today, while a Go Fund Me Page has also been set-up for him.
At time of publication, the amount raised stood at over €292,000 although that figure is likely to keep rising.
“The family is going to need as much [help] as they can get,” says O’Neill of the ongoing fundraising efforts for Kieran.
“We’re not stopping with that and we’re gonna push it as hard as we can. There’s going to be some significant costs coming down the road for Kieran and the family so we’ll keep that motoring as much as we can both through Go Fund Me and other fundraising initiatives.”

Canty’s article about Kieran’s health battle has brought his story to a national audience in the last week, and several people have reached out to the Aghada club looking to offer whatever help they can in Kieran’s time of need.
Counihan acknowledges that while revealing his story to the public can be somewhat exposing for Kieran, he reiterates that the former defender has maintained a positive outlook throughout.
And the wider support is greatly received.
“Look it’s some story to have in the Ireland we live today. We all complain about it, but look, this is really the positive side of it.
“He’s turned that into a positive, the idea that so many people would be concerned and [would] contribute.
“I suppose it does put you in a very special place, that so many people would take time out to send you a message or whatever it is. I suppose that’s very powerful in itself in terms of ‘look, people really care.’”
BY HIS SIDE

Kieran’s wife Sinéad went to primary school in Aghada, while Kieran attended a different school nearby.
O’Neill, who was in the same class as Sinéad, reckons the pair met and became an item when they were around 18. From then on, it was Kieran and Sinéad together for life.
“They’re literally tied at the hip for so many years,” says O’Neill.

Sinéad was due to have a baby when Kieran was first diagnosed with cancer and Kieran has previously highlighted the strength she showed to take care of their children at home while he was receiving treatment in hospital.
O’Neill echoes Kieran’s words about the woman who has always been by his side.
“She’s a really amazing woman.
Counihan adds:
“In fairness to Kieran and Sinéad’s families, they’ve been marvelous. It’s all been very quiet for them in the last 12 months, they’ve supported one another and the strength of both families has been incredible through this.
“I think this has helped Kieran in a major way.”
THE BATTLE AHEAD
A huge crowd is expected at today's walk for O'Connor.Anthony Connolly / Aghada GAAAnthony Connolly / Aghada GAA / Aghada GAA
Both O’Neill and Counihan have been in regular contact with Kieran throughout this ordeal. His resolve has surely been tested since his illness was first discovered, but his enthusiasm in the face of despair continues to reassure everyone that he’s ready for another battle.
The O’Connor family have a longstanding history in the Aghada GAA club, and O’Neill notes that they come from a tight-knit community where everyone is happy to lend a hand when a crisis strikes in their locality.
“Kieran is tough, competitive and he’s always been a fighter,” says the former Cork forward.
“I’m playing with Kieran 30 years and that’s the one overriding thing I would say about Kieran. He’s a competitor and the bigger the better.
“He’s as tough as it gets, a real hard kind of character.”
Kieran will hopefully be able to attend today’s walk where a big crowd is expected to turn out and pledge their support.
Counihan explains that Kieran’s story has resonated with people around the country, particularly those with links to the GAA.
And the former defender can take some encouragement from the number of people who want to help him overcome the biggest fight of his life.
“He’s taken an awful lot from the support he’s got, not just financially but emotionally [as well]. People sending texts. There’s so much good will out there, it’s just hard to imagine.
“People just want to do something and I’ve no doubt we’ll get a phenomenal turnout. Hopefully it gives heart to other people who are in difficult situations that people really do care out there.”
The #FriendsOfKieran are organising a 5km ‘Walk for Kieran’ today at 2pm to raise much needed funds for Kieran’s ongoing treatment for a rare form of bone cancer.
The walk begins at the Aghada GAA Grounds and people are encouraged to arrive from 12.30pm.
The event will be attended by a host of Kieran’s former team mates as well as a number Cork GAA stars from across the last three decades. Refreshments will be served at the clubhouse afterwards.

TWO FORMER PUPILS shot dead eight people, most of them students and staff, at a high school near Sao Paulo, Brazil, yesterday before killing themselves, authorities said.
The two assailants burst into the school grounds in the early morning, armed with a .38 caliber revolver and a “medieval weapon that looked like a bow and arrows,” military police Colonel Marcelo Sales said.
After shooting at students in the yard, the killers headed to the language center where several pupils were hiding and “[killed themselves] in a corridor,” he said.
Brazil is one of the most violent countries in the world, and the victims in this case were five students aged 15 to 17, two school officials aged 38 and 59, and a 51-year-old car wash owner who was shot by the attackers before they arrived at the school, said Sao Paulo’s Public Security Secretary Joao Pires de Campos.

Eleven other people were wounded in the shooting at the Raul Brasil public school in Suzano, on the outskirts of Sao Paulo in southeast Brazil.
“It’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen,” said Sao Paulo State Governor Joao Doria.
Tearful residents later held a street mass near the school, where flowers and candles commemorated the dead.
President Jair Bolsonaro expressed his sympathies on Twitter to “the families of this inhumane attack,” describing it as “a monstrosity and enormous cowardice”.
The two assailants, who wore hoods, were identified as former pupils aged 17 and 25. The reasons for the attack are unknown.
Screams of terrified pupils
Worried family members quickly arrived at the school alongside firefighters and security services.

“I found out when my daughter called me and said: ‘Mommy, come quickly, there are injured people, dead people’,” said the mother of one pupil, who gave her name only as Rosa.
The attack took place at around 9:30 am (12.30pm Irish time) during a break period for some students, authorities said.

Website UO1 said the two killers “entered the school shooting with their heads covered by a hood”.
Another website, G1, published a grainy video purportedly taken inside the school in which the screams of terrified pupils can be heard as they come across dead classmates.
“We locked ourselves in a classroom,” said Milene Querren Cardoso.
“We tried to help each other until the door opened and we thought it was the criminals coming for us; but no, it was the police… and we ran out.”
GloboNews showed video images of pupils fleeing the scene after escaping over a wall.
Education Minister Ricardo Velez published a statement offering “solidarity with the parents, families and staff at the school in this moment of shock, mourning and pain.”
‘Encouraging violence’
It is not the first mass school shooting in Brazil’s history.
In April 2011, a former pupil killed a dozen school children and injured many more before turning his gun on himself at a school in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro.
Brazil had 64,000 murders in 2017 – a rate of almost 31 per 100,000 inhabitants, or three times higher than the level the United Nations classifies as endemic violence.
Rahel Patrasso / Xinhua/PA ImagesRahel Patrasso / Xinhua/PA Images / Xinhua/PA Images
Far-right leader Bolsonaro controversially passed a law relaxing gun ownership rules soon after assuming power in January, delivering on a campaign promise. He has also spoken out in favor of allowing people to carry weapons on the streets.
Politicians and social media users were quick to debate whether Bolsonaro’s measures, or images from similar such mass shootings on US school and university campuses, were to blame for this attack.
Gleisi Hoffmann, president of the opposition Workers Party, said: “Tragedies like this are the result of encouraging violence and the liberation of the use of weapons.”
But Vice President Hamilton Mourao dismissed any suggestion Bolsonaro’s policy was to blame.
“Are you suggesting the gun those guys had was legal? It’s got nothing to do with it,” he said, although acknowledging that the subject would be discussed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/woman-charged-with-kim-jong-nams-killing-freed-in-shock-ruling-4534161-Mar2019/,"
AN INDONESIAN WOMAN held for two years on suspicion of killing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s half brother was freed from custody today after Malaysian prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the murder charge against her.
Siti Aisyah cried and hugged her Vietnamese co-defendant, Doan Thi Huong, before leaving the courtroom and being ushered away in an embassy car. She told reporters that she had only learned this morning that she would be freed.
“I feel very happy,” she said later at a news conference at the Indonesian Embassy. “I didn’t expect that today will be my freedom day.”
The two young women were accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim Jong Nam’s face in an airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on 13 February 2017. They have said they thought they were taking part in a prank for a TV show.
They had been the only suspects in custody after four North Korean suspects fled the country the same morning Kim was killed.
The High Court judge discharged Aisyah without an acquittal after prosecutors applied to drop the murder charge against her. They did not give any reason.
The trial will resume Thursday, with prosecutors expected to reply to a request by Huong’s lawyers asking the government to similarly withdraw the charges against her.

Indonesia’s government said its continual high-level lobbying resulted in Aisyah’s release. The foreign ministry said in a statement that she was “deceived and did not realize at all that she was being manipulated by North Korean intelligence.”
It said Aisyah, a migrant worker, believed that she was part of a reality TV show and never had any intention of killing Kim.
The ministry said that over the past two years, Aisyah’s plight was raised in “every bilateral Indonesia-Malaysia meeting,” including at the president’s level, the vice president’s level and in regular meetings of the foreign minister and other ministers with their Malaysian counterparts.
Aisyah’s release comes just a month before Indonesia’s general election and is seen as a boost to President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election.

Aisyah thanked Widodo and his government for helping secure her release. Officials said she was expected to fly back to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, later today.
Wearing a red headscarf and a black flowery traditional dress, Aisyah was composed during the news conference. She said that she was well treated in prison and received plenty of encouragement, but that she was eager to meet her family again.
Prosecutor Iskandar Ahmad said that the discharge not amounting to acquittal means Aisyah can be recharged if there is fresh evidence, but that there are no such plans for now.
Meanwhile, Huong said she was shocked by the development.
“I am in shock. My mind is blank,” a distraught Huong told reporters through a translator after Aisyah left.
Huong’s lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik said Huong felt Aisyah’s discharge was unfair to her as the judge last year had found sufficient evidence to continue the murder trial against them.
“She is entitled to the same kind of consideration as Aisyah,” he said. “We are making representation to the attorney general for Doan to be taken equally … there must be justice.”

A High Court judge last August had found there was enough evidence to infer Aisyah, Huong and the four missing North Koreans had engaged in a “well-planned conspiracy” to kill Kim Jong Nam. The defence phase of the trial had been scheduled to start in January but was delayed until Monday.
Lawyers for the women have previously said that they were pawns in a political assassination with clear links to the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and that the prosecution failed to show the women had any intention to kill. Intent to kill is crucial to a murder charge under Malaysian law.
Malaysian officials have never officially accused North Korea and have made it clear they don’t want the trial politicized.
Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea’s ruling family. He had been living abroad for years but could have been seen as a threat to Kim Jong Un’s rule.

https://www.thejournal.ie/skull-st-michans-4526306-Mar2019/,"THE VICAR OF St Michan’s Church in Dublin has thanked gardaí for retrieving the stolen head of an 800-year-old mummy, but has said that he fears that it may be badly damaged.
Gardaí confirmed yesterday that they had recovered the head of an 800-year-old mummy known as ‘The Crusader’ after it was stolen from the crypts of St. Michan’s Church last week.
The discovery of the theft at the crypt of the church on Church Street was made shortly before lunchtime last Monday when a guide was preparing to open the church for visitors.
Speaking today on Morning Ireland, the Vicar of the Christ Church Cathedral Group of Parishes, of which St Michan’s is part, Archdeacon David Pierpoint, thanked the gardaí for recovering the head and the public for their support.
He said he was called by gardaí “just after lunch” yesterday to inform him that they had recovered the head.

“Just after lunch I received a phone call from the gardaí in the Bridewell to say that they had received a tip-off and they had recovered the head and the skull which were wrapped up and they brought them back to the Bridewell,” Pierpoint said.
“I immediately went down to the station and examined the skull and the head.
“Unfortunately they were quite saturated and damp and wet, so they’ve gone to the museum now to begin the process of trying to dry them out.
He said the church would “have to wait and see” and then they would “possibly have to re-coffin and re-intern them in the vaults”.
Pierpoint said that the skull of the Crusader had been “completely severed from the neck, the spine” and that it was “very unlikely that it could be reattached”.
“It’s very unlikely that it could be re-attached as such, but it could certainly be laid back in its proper place,” he said.
Pierpoint said he didn’t know where the skull had been discovered, as it was forming part of the garda investigation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-visit-4545974-Mar2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the US President Donald Trump could visit Ireland as early as June.
Speaking to reporters in Chicago, on the second leg of his St Patrick’s Day trip to the US, Varadkar said that Trump did not tell him any specific date in which he might visit.
However, he said Trump is due to visit Europe twice in the next year – in June and December – adding that it would make sense for Trump to tag a visit to Ireland at the end of one of those trips.
He added that no firm details had been discussed with Irish officials as of yet.
Trump is expected to attend the D-day commemorations in Normandy in June and the annual NATO summit in December.
Yesterday in the Oval Office, Trump has said that he hopes to visit Ireland this year.
Describing Ireland as a special place, Trump referenced his golf resort at Doonbeg in Co Clare.
“I have a very warm spot for Doonbeg, I will tell you that. And, it’s just a great place,” he said.
The US leader made similar comments during last year’s sit down in Washington DC.
Last November, Trump was due to visit Clare and Dublin.

In September, the status of the visit was the source ofmuch confusionwith the Irish government and the White House offering different answers as to whether it would go ahead.
Some clarity was finally provided when the White House informed the Irish ambassador in the US that the November trip had been cancelled for “scheduling reasons”.
The cancellation blindsided the government, which scrambled to find details from their US counterparts as to whether the trip was postponed or cancelled.
Yesterday, theTaoiseach made international headlineswhen he attended a breakfast meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence with his partner, Matt Barrett.
In his speech, he said as leader of Ireland, he is judged on his political record, and not his sexual orientation.
Pence has been criticised in the past for his stance on LGBT issues. During last year’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations, Pence extended the invite to Barrett for this year.
When asked this evening about whether Pence and Varadkar had discussed the speech, the Taoiseach said:
“We didn’t really discuss the speech but we had a good chat afterwards on different issues and I had the chance to meet him again in the White House.
“I met his brother who was recently elected to congress and his sister too.
“They are very nice people and certainly have made me feel welcome when I have been in DC. Obviously we have very different views on social policy but I think the best way to manage these things is to engage with people rather than boycotting them and that’s what I intend to do.”
Earlier today, First Lady Melania Trump tweeted out some photos from yesterday’s events, which included a photo with Trump, Varadkar and Barrett.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-the-catholic-church-has-revealed-that-they-are-still-covering-up-child-sex-abuse-on-the-grounds-that-it-is-a-pontifical-secret-4518968-Mar2019/,"FOR A WHILE, I thought Pope Francis was a good man.
I was quite moved when he comforted a child who had been told one of his parents was going to hell due to his atheism, telling him a loving God would never do such a thing.
He spoke openly about reforming the monolith the Roman Church has become, and I was delighted. Here, I thought, was the kind of leader the church needed in the 21st century.
But alas, the mask quickly began to slip.
During his visit to Ireland, be claimed to be hearing about the Magdalene Laundries and Mother and Baby Homes for the first time.
He asserted that the physical punishment of children is acceptable “as long as it is done with love”. As someone who was beaten regularly by priests during my education, I deeply question what kind of love was involved, and he has stated that people who continuously criticise the church are “friends of the devil”.
Pope Francis apologised for that final comment, protesting that he was simply referencing a passage in the Bible but how often have the religious used biblical interpretation to support their worst offences?
I grew up in an intensely religious family. My mother went to Mass daily, and we said prayers every evening after dinner. I loved the ritual and the colour and the majesty of the church, and I revelled in the stories.
I still use John’s Gospel as an example of one of the best opening lines ever written: “In the beginning was the Word.” As a writer, there is something enchanting in that idea.
Despite all this, I have come to believe wholeheartedly that the machine that is the Roman Catholic Church has had its day and must be shut down.
I want to be clear about what I am saying here: I have no argument with the religion itself – one of my core beliefs is that people should be free to follow whichever creed they feel helps them get through the day, so long as it does not impose on anyone else’s rights or freedoms.
What I want to see demolished is the human, financial and political mechanism which has, for centuries, been the institutional embodiment of Roman Catholicism, enforcing its will and influence on the world, often to the detriment and oppression of huge swathes of the populations it professes to serve.
And not just in the dim and distant past – it is still happening today.
A good example of this absurdity was witnessed in last week’s Vatican Summit on Clerical Abuse.
That it was the first gathering of its kind for an organisation that has been plagued by this most heinous of criminal actions for hundreds of years, (there is a piece of Brehon Law dating back to the 12th century which outlines how priests who have sex with pre-adolescent boys should be dealt with) is mind-boggling, but better late than never.
During the summit, we heard some remarkable things.
It was admitted that files relating to clerics who were known to be abusing children were either not created at all, or were destroyed to prevent them from falling into the hands of the public.
Advertisement
There was mention that the canon law protection of ‘pontifical secret’ had been applied to numerous clerical abuse cases, meaning it was considered a mortal sin to reveal these facts under any circumstances – the breaching of this would result in automatic excommunication.
The main proposal coming out of the summit was that a handbook is to be drawn up for bishops to aid them in their handling of clerical sexual abuse – meaning that such guidance currently does not exist.
Activist groups the world over declared the summit to be all sound and no action.
Francis Rocca, the Wall Street Journal’s Vatican correspondent, went so far as to tell RTE’s Drivetime programme that in his experience the Catholic Church globally does not see clerical abuse in the same way we do in Ireland, deeming it to be something that is “certainly a bad thing, but forgivable, even given a second chance”.
This was brought home to me in the wake of the summit when I was contacted by a member of a support group for survivors of clerical abuse.
He also told me that this particular person currently has seven different charges of abuse – some historical and some much more recent – pending against him.
Yet the church is still financially supporting him and has facilitated his remaining in a position where he has ready access to children and vulnerable adults.
I did my research, and discovered that every word of this was was true.
The police, when I called about it, told me they were well aware of this particular person’s presence in the area where he works and resides, and that he is being carefully watched.
I’m not sure how much of a comfort that is.
In light of everything I have just written, I have a proposal. It’s a simple one but I think it might be very effective.
We know that a vast portion of the church’s wealth in Ireland was earned off the back of women held against their will and forced to work as slaves, not to mention the trafficking of children out of the country to wealthy families abroad for vast sums of money in illegal adoptions.
I propose we hand the matter over to the Criminal Assets Bureau. They can freeze all church accounts, seize their assets and use the resultant funds to make appropriate recompense to the many, many people whose lives have been ruined through their callous and abusive treatment.
I do not believe this is an excessive stance. The argument that, as a society, we colluded with the church and therefore should share the blame holds no water.
We used to burn village midwives as witches – that doesn’t mean we should shrug and turn a blind eye if someone were to do so today.
As a culture and a community, we have moved on, while the institutional church has remained solidly entrenched.
The revelation that they are still covering up child sex abuse on the grounds that it is a pontifical secret should be the final straw.
That the Catholic Church continues to hold itself up as a moral guardian really beggars belief.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boeing-737-max-us-regulations-4548986-Mar2019/,"THERE WERE “CLEAR similarities” between this month’s crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane and a Lion Air plane crash last October, the French civil aviation investigation bureau has said.
An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 went down minutes into a flight to Nairobi in Kenya earlier this month, killing all 157 people on board, months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia killing 189.
This comes as Boeing said today that the flight stabilisation system under scrutiny following two deadly 737 MAX plane crashes met all US regulations.
“The 737 MAX was certified in accordance with the identical Federal Aviation Administration requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives,” Boeing said.
“The FAA considered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during MAX certification, and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements,” Boeing added.
Boeing and regulators are facing increased examination over the stall prevention system, MCAS, which authorities have said was likely a factor in deadly crashes in Indonesia in October, while the crash in Ethiopia earlier this month showed similarities.
The French civil aviation investigation bureau BEA has concluded there were “clear similarities” between the Ethiopian Airlines and the Lion Air crashes.
The French bureau said that black box data from the Ethiopian Airlines flight showed the links and will be used for further study.
Since the Ethiopian crash, questions have been raised not only about Boeing, but also the FAA and its close relationship with the company.
While it may take months for definitive conclusions, experts are asking why the MCAS was given the green light despite objections by American pilots who had voiced concerns with the system.

Investigations into the Lion Air crash in October implicated the MCAS, which can erroneously force the plane down when the autopilot is engaged if it detects the plane may be at risk of a stall.
Both crashes happened shortly after takeoff.

Complaints
American pilots had complained of the flaw.
However, Boeing has been working on a software upgrade to the system and issued new instructions about how to override the issue in the meantime.
The US Transportation Department’s inspector general is probing the FAA’s approval of the MCAS, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The newspaper also said the criminal division of the Justice Department was looking into the development of the plane.
The 737 MAX was certified as a variant of the 737 Next Generation, the plane it replaced, despite major differences in the engine and the MCAS, according to documents available on the FAA’s website.
But because of budget constraints, the FAA delegated aspects of the approval process to Boeing itself, according to sources.
Under a programme, known as the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA), employees of Boeing are accredited by the FAA to assist in approving the aircraft – including design, production, flight tests, maintenance and other systems – as well as signing off on the training procedures of pilots on new planes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/offbeat-donut-prague-new-stores-3-4554949-Mar2019/,"
OFFBEAT DONUT CO quietly opened its first overseas location in Prague at the end of last year and is planning more new outlets in the Czech city – as well as Ireland.
Speaking toFora, Offbeat founder Brian O’Casey said that the central European outlet is not only the chain’s first store outside is home country, it is also its first franchised outlet.
The doughnut company opened up in 2016 and is owned by O’Casey and his wife. Offbeat now employs some 100 people across seven directly owned stores and three kiosks around Dublin. Last year it recorded a turnover of €5 million.
Franchising was always Offbeat’s overarching plan, but O’Casey said he and his wife wanted to wait until the core business got off the ground.
“We’ve had a lot of enquiries about (franchising), but we declined them all, primarily because we didn’t think we knew enough,” O’Casey said.
“When you open a new outlet, if it’s full production, it’s going to cost about €250,000 or €300,000 (to set up), and if it’s a kiosk it’d be €100,000, so it’s a lot of investment for us over the last three years,” he said.
O’Casey said it has taken two years to get the brand to a stage where it was “good enough” to be licensed to other business owners.
“People have a very good idea of what a traditional doughnut is, and we work very hard to change that perception – it’s not just a doughnut, it’s really a treat and it’s going to surprise you.”
Why Prague?
The move to Prague was on the back of a request from a property investor friend of O’Casey’s, who asked “a good few times” if he could bring the concept to the Czech Republic.
“He felt he could bring locations and we would bring the business model,” said O’Casey.
The Czech location opened up in December and since then has been performing well, but “it’s more of a premium product (there) than it is in Ireland – because of the difference in wages and pay scale”, O’Casey noted.

“People would buy in smaller quantities in Prague than they would in the Irish market,” he said, adding that he’d “like a bit more volume” in terms of sales.
Even so, trade has been growing strong enough for O’Casey to start scouting for more locations in the city, “probably some in shopping malls and shopping centres”.
“We do a lot of deliveries with corporate and larger companies, and I think there are opportunities there. I think that’s something that would be new in Prague,” he said.
“We’re trying to grow with social media. We’ve only really started the social media in the last month or so in Prague, but it’s been very effective for us in Ireland.”
Brian O'CaseyOffbeatOffbeat
Other countries and counties
There are also plans afoot to expand further in Ireland, and while Offbeat may open one or two more stores in Dublin, the chain is heavily focused on breaking away from the capital.
“Really, we have to get outside of Dublin … We concentrated on Dublin because we were aware that Krispy Kreme were coming onto the marketplace, and it was important to secure good sites and build up a brand presence,” said O’Casey.
Right now, Offbeat isn’t actively pursuing other markets for franchise opportunities, “but it is something that we will be in the future”. High on the list are the Middle East, the US, the UK and Asia.
“The Americans have been very complimentary of the offer, so we’d like to go to America, but the UK is nearby, so we’d like to go to the UK first,” said O’Casey.
“I think franchising is quite well-developed in countries like America and many other countries. There hasn’t been a huge number of them that are from Ireland.”

https://www.the42.ie/liverpool-bayern-report-4540779-Mar2019/,"SADIO MANE SCORED twice to steer Liverpool into the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday after a 3-1 win at Bayern Munich dumped out the German champions.
Having missed the goalless first leg at Anfield three weeks ago through suspension, Virgil van Dijk’s long pass led to Mane’s superb first-half goal at the Allianz Arena.
Dutch centre-back Van Dijk then headed Liverpool into a 2-1 lead from a James Milner corner on 69 minutes after Joel Matip’s own goal had handed Bayern a first-half equaliser.
Mane made absolutely sure of Liverpool’s place in the quarter-final draw by nodded in six minutes from time.
Liverpool’s 3-1 aggregate victory means they join Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Manchester United in the quarter-finals, completing a clean sweep of English sides reaching the last eight for the first time since 2008/09.
It is a bleaker picture in Germany as Bayern’s exit leaves no Bundesliga club in the quarters for the first time since 2005/06, as Borussia Dortmund and Schalke also bowed out in the last 16 — to Tottenham and Man City respectively.

This is the first time since 2011 that Bayern have failed to make the quarter-finals.
Milner was preferred to Fabinho in Liverpool’s midfield, but Jurgen Klopp was forced into an early change when captain Jordan Henderson hobbled off on 12 minutes.
Brazilian Fabinho made an early entrance and Milner took the skipper’s armband.
Klopp had urged his side to “be brave on the ball” and it was that, combined with an amazing piece of skill by Mane, which gave them the lead.
Van Dijk’s pin-point pass over 40 metres found Mane in the Bayern box with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer off his line.
Mane spun away and looped his shot inside the far post to give the visitors a valuable away goal in the 26th minute.
The bravery Klopp wanted flowed through the Liverpool ranks and Milner, winning the midfield battle, set Firmino free in the box, but the Brazilian blasted his shot at Neuer.
However, the hosts drew level six minutes before the break when Serge Gnabry slipped his marker Andrew Robertson and hit a cross intended for Robert Lewandowski.

The ball went in off Matip, who was focused on marking the Polish striker, to the despair of the Liverpool centre-back and the delight of the home crowd.

The tempo of the game dropped sharply after the restart, but Bayern wasted a chance on the hour mark when Gnabry fired in a cross, only for Lewandowski to mistime his slide.

Liverpool were heading for the quarter-finals when Milner swung in the second of two corners in quick succession and Van Dijk powered a header past Neuer.
Mane scored his second when Mohamed Salah’s chip found him at the far post to head home as Liverpool’s travelling fans started singing “You’ll Never Walk Alone”, while the Bayern supporters began to slip away.

The announcement was made at the Clarence Hotel in Temple Bar this afternoon.
O’Kane said, “Getting to be a Grand Marshall in this year’s Parade has absolutely made my 2019! I’m a huge Parade fan and experiencing it from the heart of the spectacle will be an incredible honour.”

“As a child of 1980′s Dublin who went to the Parade every year,” says Byrne, “I’m amazed to be one of this year’s Grand Marshals.”
He added, “I’m also amazed that the Parade is now actually incredibly good, and whilst I’ll miss the floats of my era (a truck carrying Amercians followed by a fire brigade and a dog), I can’t wait to see this year’s mega floats as myself and Dee get to wave at our billions and billions of adoring fans.”
They’ll lead the traditional, large-scale parade on Sunday week, following the usual route from Parnell Square on the northside to Kevin St on the south of the city.
The Dublin St Patrick’s Festival gets under way next Thursday, 14 March, with events running until the Bank Holiday Monday on the 18th.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jair-bolsonaro-carnival-video-twitter-4528015-Mar2019/,"BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JAIR Bolsonaro has become embroiled in controversy after sharing footage of a man urinating to denounce the country’s Carnival festival.
Bolsonaro, who has been criticised for his remarks against women and homosexuals, posted the footage of a man urinating on another man’s head to argue against what he sees as moral degeneracy in the country.
In the 40-second clip, which Brazilian media said was filmed on Monday during the Carnival celebrations in Sao Paulo, three men are seen dancing on top of a bus stop.
One of the men is skimpily dressed and with his buttocks visible, and engages in a lewd act while one of his companions urinates on his head as a crowd watches on.
“I don’t feel comfortable showing it, but we have to expose the truth so the population can be aware and always set their priorities,” the president told his 3.4 million Twitter followers.
“This is what many street carnival groups have become in Brazil.”

The video quickly racked up 2.43 million views after the former army officer posted it, splitting opinions in an already divided population.
Some denounced the president for using an isolated scene to attack the country’s popular Carnival, which has been used this year as a platform to protest against Bolsonaro’s intolerance towards minorities.
Others argued that posting the footage was below the dignity of the president’s office, and had spread the video to a wider audience, including children.
“Bolsonaro, my six-year-old granddaughter saw this scene on Twitter, just like millions of other kids whose parents follow you on Twitter,” said TV journalist Fabio Pannunzio.
“I’d like to know how the president of the republic can explain to them what they have just seen,” he said.
Bolsonaro was elected last year, in large part due to the support of the powerful Evangelical community, and promised to crack down on the corruption that has decimated the country’s political and business elite.
But party-goers across the country have launched protests against the president during the first carnival under his administration, including a chanting crowd that formed outside his Rio home during street celebrations this week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-sunday-telegraph-article-50-withdrawal-deal-4547629-Mar2019/,"THERESA MAY HAS warned MPs that a failure to pass her EU withdrawal deal in a third ‘meaningful vote’ this week could see Brexit postponed indefinitely.
The British Prime Minister said that if her deal was not backed before a European Council summit on Thursday, the UK would “not leave the EU for many months, if ever”.
Writing in today’sSunday Telegraph, May claimed that a “short technical extension” of Article 50 would be required beyond March 29 Brexit to avoid a no-deal Brexit, a scenario thatMPs voted against in the House of Commonsthis week.
That extension is expected to be voted upon by the remaining 27 EU members at this week’s council meeting in Brussels.
“That is not an ideal outcome – we could and should have been leaving the EU on March 29,” she said.
“But it is something the British people would accept if it led swiftly to delivering Brexit. The alternative if Parliament cannot agree the deal by that time is much worse.”

May warned that if MPs did not pass her deal before that EU summit, it would mean having to negotiate another withdrawal deal, requiring a much longer extension of Article 50.
This would force the UK would to partake in European Parliament elections in May, three years after voting to leave the EU, something May said would be a symbol of the failure of British politics.
“The idea of the British people going to the polls to elect MEPs three years after voting to leave the EU hardly bears thinking about,” she said.
“There could be no more potent symbol of Parliament’s collective political failure.”
Appealing to MPs to back her deal, May acknowledged that she would have to do more to convince them if she was to secure a majority for it, which she said was “the only way through the current impasse”.
“All this makes the choice now facing MPs clearer than it has ever been,” she said.
“If Parliament can find a way to back the Brexit deal before European Council, the UK will leave the EU this spring, without having to take part in the European elections, and we can get on with building our future relationship with the EU.
“If it cannot, we will not leave the EU for many months, if ever.”

Speaking today, two of May’s top ministers warned that the Prime Minister might not even hold a third vote on her deal unless she secures support from within the Conservative Party.
“It would be difficult to justify having a vote if you knew you were going to lose it,” international trade secretary Liam Fox told Sky News.
“We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues… are prepared to support it so that we can get it through parliament,” finance minister Philip Hammond said on the BBC.
However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rubbished suggestions that his party would support the deal, calling it a “blindfold Brexit that… [would] do enormous damage” to the British economy.
Instead, Corbyn told Sky News that he might support a proposal from within his own party to have a second referendum on Brexit if it is postponed this week.
“It would obviously have to be a credible choice that’s real for those that wanted to vote leave, or did vote leave in 2016, as well as those that voted remain,” he said.

https://www.the42.ie/keith-oneill-interview-4554645-Mar2019/,"AS MICK MCCARTHY prepares for the first match of his second spell as Ireland boss against Gibraltar this evening, it’s worth nothing that the situation bears some similarities to his first spell.
Granted, there are differences too. McCarthy had far more Premier League stars to choose from then than he does now, while he had two world-class footballers coming into their prime in 1996 — Denis Irwin and Roy Keane.
But much like the current era, the McCarthy of 23 years ago was faced with the arduous task of rebuilding an ageing squad that had served the previous management very well for a period. Nevertheless, a successful run petered out badly and there was a sense of staleness amid a pitiful anti-climax that saw Jack Charlton’s side outclassed by an exuberant Dutch outfit at Anfield in a winner-takes-all Euro ’96 play-off.
And as is the case now, one of McCarthy’s biggest challenges back then was unearthing a top-class natural goalscorer. Of the four strikers picked in the manager’s first squad – Niall Quinn , John Aldridge, Tommy Coyne and Tony Cascarino — three were in their mid-30s and coming towards the end of their international careers. Quinn, who would be part of Ireland’s squad all the way up to the 2002 World Cup, was the exception, but it was obvious he needed help.
Damien Duff and Robbie Keane were still two years away from making their senior debuts, and so there was a void to be filled in the forward department. Two raw youngsters emerged who appeared to have the potential to fulfil this responsibility: David Connolly and Keith O’Neill.
O’Neill had made his Premier League debut for Norwich as an 18-year-old in November 1994 and caught the eye as a hugely promising left winger. McCarthy, however, perhaps partially on account of a dearth of alternative options in that department, chose to play him up front.
The Barnsley native’s reign as Ireland boss began inauspiciously. The first three friendly matches were all losses, against Russia (2-0), Czech Republic (2-0) and Portugal (1-0).
The lack of goals was a glaring issue. After being introduced off the bench late on for his debut in the Portuguese encounter, O’Neill was handed a start in a subsequent match against Croatia a few days later. An assured performance saw him score amid a 2-2 draw and his potential became increasingly evident during a superb run of four goals in five matches — including one in McCarthy’s first competitive match in charge, a 5-0 win away to a Liechtenstein side that held Charlton’s men to an infamous 0-0 draw just over a year previously.

On account of this early form from O’Neill, Ireland fans would have been forgiven for prematurely believing the answer to their goalscoring woes had arrived. Yet despite this initial promise, O’Neill would win just seven more caps and not score again for his country. Nonetheless, the Tolka Rovers and Home Farm youth product still savours the memories of this era.
“I was such a big [Ireland] fan,” he tellsThe42. “I used to mitch off school on a Wednesday to watch the games.
“When I first got involved, my dad called me when I was training for Norwich City. He heard on the news that I’d been called up.
“Obviously, you’re elated. It’s everything you’ve ever dreamed of. Getting to make my debut on my dad’s birthday — 29 May 1996, it was an unbelievably special day for the family.”
While many were no longer in their footballing prime, a number of the heroes of the Charlton days were still around when O’Neill came onboard, and the Dubliner admits to initially being somewhat “in awe” of his surroundings.
“I looked towards the back of the bus, Paul McGrath was there — his testimonial game was around the weekend where we had the initial friendlies. Paul’s quite a quiet man, but he really made an effort to make me feel okay and put me at ease. We used to stay at the airport hotel. I remember being at the dinner table, not really knowing where to sit. I just couldn’t believe my luck that I was having dinner with all my heroes.”
This dreamlike scenario got even better on a memorable June day in Lansdowne Road for O’Neill’s full debut, when he scored Ireland’s first goal of the McCarthy era.
“With the belief [Mick] had in me, you’re playing for your country, you’ve scored a few goals, your confidence is high.
“Mick, especially with young players, he made you believe in yourself. I’ll always be eternally grateful to him for giving me my debut and letting me express myself. When you move on in your life and you have different managers, people do try to put a style of football on you and that probably wasn’t my thing. I liked to just come out and do what comes natural.”

The 1996 US Cup tour consolidated O’Neill and Ireland’s confidence. After a disappointing opening loss to the hosts, they earned a creditable 2-2 draw with a tough Mexico side and a 3-0 win over a Bolivian team that had played in the World Cup just two years previously.
With other young players such as Shay Given, Ian Harte and Gary Breen gaining invaluable international experience during those months, it felt as if McCarthy was increasingly putting his own stamp on the team.
There were darker days ahead though. Perhaps the most memorable game from this period was the disastrous 3-2 defeat away to Macedonia.

That fixture served as a reminder to Ireland’s youngsters that they still had a long way to go in their attempts to emulate the glory days of the late ’80s and early ’90s.

“I was on the bench, I was injured,” O’Neill recalls of that Macedonia trip. “I’d done my ankle ligaments, but I was keen to play the game. I probably would have started, but they decided just to put me on the bench — I wasn’t fit. I came on when we were in a bit of trouble. The game got a bit nasty. Jason McAteer [was sent off].
“I remember the orange jerseys, which I don’t think we ever wore again.
Despite that setback, Ireland still did enough to get as far as the World Cup play-offs, before narrowly losing out to Belgium amid a 3-2 aggregate loss.
But more bad fortune was to come in the following campaign for both O’Neill and the team. The Euro 2000 qualifiers featured some hugely encouraging moments, with home victories over Croatia and Yugoslavia, who had reached the 1998 World Cup semi-finals and round of 16 respectively.
McCarthy’s side were seconds away from topping the group and qualifying automatically at the expense of their highly-rated rivals, but it was a familiar foe, Macedonia, who shattered this dream in the cruellest of circumstances.
With the Boys in Green leading 1-0 deep into second-half stoppage time, they just needed to defend one more corner successfully to secure a place at the upcoming tournament in Belgium and the Netherlands.
Unfortunately, Goran Stravrevski escaped the attentions of Tony Cascarino. O’Neill was supposed to be blocking the space he ran into, but slipped at the inopportune moment, and could only watch as his opponent’s bullet header found the back of the net.

That one goal left the Irish team distraught. O’Neill was as heartbroken as anyone. But there was palpable tension in the dressing room afterwards. In an interview withThe Sunday Times, three years after his retirement, he recalled how McCarthy blanked him after the match and the pair had not spoken since. The player was dropped from the subsequent squad for the play-off match against Turkey and O’Neill felt as if he was being made a scapegoat for the team’s shortcomings.
“I’ve said my piece about this back in the past. I think everyone’s had an opinion on it. I felt at the time I was the fall guy for the whole thing.
“After the game, it’s just raw disappointment. When I look back, it’s just sadness that we didn’t do it, because it was such a good performance that night and it was just one of them things.
“We were very unlucky in the play-offs against Turkey and it just [exacerbates] the agony really, because the group of players definitely deserved to be part of that tournament.
“I never once went out with the intention of letting my country down. Some things just happen and in the moment, things are said.
“It was a long flight home and we had a long wait in the seats around Skopje Airport.
“Everyone is thinking: ‘We should be celebrating here, but we’re in this position.’ But it’s stuff that makes you stronger. You look at [largely] the same group of players, what they did in 2002 [at the World Cup]. You need to shake yourself down and move on.
This ill-fated fixture was the last time O’Neill represented Ireland. Although the pair got on well at first, with McCarthy giving the young player the chance to make his international debut, after Macedonia, their relationship appeared to disintegrate. The ill-feeling was heightened by comments McCarthy made in a book on Ireland’s 2002 World Cup.
“Keith’s failure to make any further impact is down to Keith, not to anything that happened in Macedonia,” he said.
Reading this comment, O’Neill felt he was getting unfairly blamed for regularly being injured — a sensitive issue and one that the player struggled with throughout his career, having suffered from degenerative bone conditions in his spine since childhood.

Despite being out of favour, the accomplished attacker still had hopes of earning an Ireland recall. He continued to impress at club level. A series of noteworthy displays for Norwich saw him linked with clubs of the calibre of Leeds, Arsenal and Tottenham. Eventually, he joined Bryan Robson’s Middlesbrough aged 23 for £700,000 in March 1999, with stars such as Juninho, Christian Ziege and Paul Gascoigne among his team-mates there.
O’Neill started well in his new surroundings, helping the club climb into the top six at one point, before another serious injury struck and curtailed his hopes of getting back into the Ireland squad in the lead up to the 2002 World Cup.
“I was starting to do well for my club in 2001. Then I broke my tib fib and dislocated my ankle. I was out for about nine months.
“There were opportunities for me to be called back up, but I pulled out of [so many] Irish squads through injury. It was quite unbelievable.
“Not being able to answer the call through injury and knowing if you were fit, you could really add value to the squad, it does hurt, but it’s part of professional sport. When you retire, rather than thinking of these things as a negative, I had to turn it back and go: ‘Look, I was just lucky enough to play for Ireland. I was lucky enough to play Premier League football.’”
Time supposedly heals all wounds, and so it proved with McCarthy and O’Neill. The pair ultimately made their peace, having gone several years without speaking to one another.
“It’s a fantastic choice by the FAI [to appoint McCarthy for a second spell in charge]. He’s a man that really cares for our country, when he played and when he managed.”

Four years after his last international match, O’Neill hung up his boots at the age of just 27. Having left Boro for Coventry in 2001, an injury-ridden spell with the Sky Blues saw him make only 12 appearances over the course of two years.
O'Neill pictured during his Coventry days.EMPICS SportEMPICS Sport
With the benefit of hindsight, O’Neill has some regrets about how he managed his body, in addition to feeling he would be better placed to cope with such injury problems in the modern-day Premier League environment.
“Every case is different and ever player is different,” he says. “And nowadays, they treat it as so. For me particularly, because I had such issues with my back, if I didn’t release my pressure points around my glutes or transverses, it just didn’t allow me to run properly, I needed to be quite loose. It’s all changed now. When you play for your club, you get that specific treatment and they see your issues on a daily basis — in the early days, it’s probably fair to say that level of guidance was not there.
“When I was at Middlesbrough, I never played one reserve game. The minute I was fit, because we were in relegation battles and it was always a big game, I played. But because I never got any endurance in me, I’d only play three or four games, and then I’d be injured for three or four games.
“If I came back and I was fit, [I should have done] another couple of weeks, miss a few games and just really build core strength and endurance, rather than directly going into combat when your body is just recovering all the time. I would have definitely done that better, listened to my body more and given myself an opportunity to get really strong before I went back into action. That undoubtedly would have helped, but I was always too eager to please. I suppose it can be seen as a quality, but in the end, people remember you for the amount of games you missed rather than the effort you put in to play.”

Statistics have starkly illustratedjust how difficult it can be to adapt to life as a former Premier League footballer. And O’Neill admits it was far from plain sailing for him initially.
“The first six months weren’t bad. You just go and do the things you’ve never been able to do, like go on holidays when a season’s going on.
“Me and my now-wife went on loads of city breaks around Europe with pals. But then, after the fun wears off, in your head, you realise: ‘Where am I going to go now?’ Football was all I knew.
“I made the decision that I was young enough and talented enough in other areas that I didn’t want football to define my life. I just had to go out and start at the bottom somewhere else and make a career for myself, which is a very difficult thing to do for your ego at the start.
“It would have been quite easy to feel sorry for yourself and I know it sounds strange. [People might think:] ‘How can you feel sorry for yourself?’ But that is how you can feel at the time. I’m glad I made the effort and a lot of that’s to do with the foundation around you, and really good family and friends that support you, that’s something I had in abundance. Some players, past and present, don’t really have that foundation or opportunity.
“I did a bit of media work, but I always had it in my head that there would be more famous people than me retiring ahead of me. I wanted a bit of security. When I was doing media work, it was all very sporadic.
“The pool was getting smaller, so [I thought] ‘let’s do something different’. And that’s what I did.
“Structure is something, I didn’t realise, I quite miss when I don’t have. It’s quite important. I do quite like it. I never thought I’d say it, but it’s definitely true. I think a lot of footballers miss that.”
O’Neill is now based in Cornwall and has swapped football for a life in the business world, working for some of biggest food companies in Britain over the past number of years.
“We don’t just work hard, but we have great banter, good camaraderie and we’re a good team. And that’s another thing that you could say is similar to your days as a footballer. It’s one of the things I used to like [about football].
“I love watching all sport and just enjoying it as a fan more than anything else.”
Consequently, in carving out a life for himself outside of sport, O’Neill has succeeded where many others have struggled, in the process showing the same skill and resilience that served him well as a footballer.
“You need to believe in yourself,” he adds. “You need to surround yourself with the right people.
“There are a lot of agents and so many wrong people involved in the game. When you’re a young kid, you can be influenced by people that are not the right people. So trust in yourself, your family and your friends.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/direct-provision-centre-rooskey-4553521-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|21 Mar 2019
THE PLAN TO open a Direct Provision centre at a disused hotel in Rooskey, Co Leitrim, has been scrapped.
The Department of Justice said the decision is due to a leasing issue and not related to suspected arson attacks at the former hotel.
A spokesperson confirmed the decision and said the department “regrets that it is not in a position to proceed with plans to open an accommodation centre in the Shannon Key West Hotel”.
They said the decision was taken following legal advice sought from the Chief State Solicitor’s Office which “found difficulties with the lease agreement between the owners of the hotel, and the operator renting it, which made proceeding with the proposed centre unviable”.
The spokesperson said the department is “not party to these lease arrangements and these matters are outside our control”.
They added that the department remains “committed to sourcing suitable premises to meet the accommodation needs of people in the international protection process”.

A regional procurement process for new centres to house asylum seekers is currently under way and will continue throughout the year. Concerns have been raised about therural location, and related lack of services, of some current and planned DP centres.
Suspected arson attacks
The former hotel in Rooskey was subjected totwo suspected arson attacksin January and February.
The site of another planned DP centre, in Moville in Co Donegal, was also subjected to a suspected arson attack in November.
Both centres were due to open in January but the process was delayed after the fires.
The department’s spokesperson said the decision not to proceed with the Rooskey centre was taken “solely in relation to the difficulties with the lease”.
However, Leitrim And Roscommon United Against Racism believes the suspected arson attacks are linked to the move.
In a statement released today, the group said: “Nobody apart from the government thought it was a good idea to house 80 asylum seekers in Rooskey.

The group said the legal issues surrounding the use of the former hotel as a DP centre “should have been tested fully in court”.
The statement added that today’s announcement “may very well have a negative impact on the ability of the State to house asylum seekers elsewhere”.
Almost 6,300 people live in 38 Direct Provision centres across Ireland, most of which are privately run.
As of this month, 729 individuals have been granted protection status or permission to remain in Ireland – 206 people have refugee status; 441 people have permission-to-remain status and 82 people have subsidiary protection status.
Close to 450 people have been living in DP centres for over five years as they await a decision on their status or subsequent appeals.

https://www.thejournal.ie/national-childrens-hospital-3-4551204-Mar2019/,"THE PROJECT DIRECTOR for the National Children’s Hospital has resigned from his role – after over five years in the job.
Engineer John Pollock said he was “very proud” to have assumed the role on the board of the project in 2013 but felt it was an “opportune point” for him to move on. However, Pollock has said he will remain in the role until June.
Pollock is among the officials who have faced fierce questioning from politicians in Oireachtas Committees over the cost overrun at the National Children’s Hospital.
A figure of €983 million for the development was approved by government in 2017, but it has emerged in recent months that this has risen by €500 million in the space of a year.

The eventual cost of the hospital could even exceed that €1.4 billion figure, and a report commissioned by the government into the overrun – that is due next week – has been given the remit of identifying what caused the budget to spiral in such a way.
Pollock’s departure follows that of former chairperson of the board of the National Children’s Hospital Tom Costello,who left the post last month.

In a statement announcing his resignation, Pollock outlined the progress and achievements on the project, saying: “The construction of the new children’s hospital will be completed in 2022 and it will open its doors to staff, patients and children in 2023.
Reacting to Pollock’s resignation, interim chairperson Fred Barry said the board was disappointed but respect the decision.
“We are grateful to John for committing to staying until June 2019, this will ensure a smooth transition as we move to a new phase of this important infrastructural project and as the process commences to recruit a new project lead,” Barry said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/waiting-for-godot-brexit-4554905-Mar2019/,"LUXEMBOURG PRIME MINISTER Xavier Bettel perfectly encapsulated the mood in Brussels for the nail-biting European Council summit weekend by drawing comparisons with Irish playwright Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot.
The tragicomedy, which is considered a masterpiece of absurdist literature, covers the story of two characters who wait for Godot by a tree. They are told twice that he’s not arriving, and the play ends without him ever appearing.
“I sometimes have the feeling that I’m in the waiting room waiting for Godot, and Godot is never coming,” continued Bettel.
When asked if he was fed up, he let out a long, uncertain sigh before saying, “No, it’s the fact that we’re waiting for something which is never coming. It really is like Godot where we are waiting on the bench.”
As Brussels was mobbed by cameramen on the eve of the European Council summit (one roundabout had a different live television broadcast down each of its roads), every moment seemed interwoven by the absurdity of the situation, but also the seriousness of it.
On Wednesday night, massive army trucks had circled the three buildings hosting the EU event, and one of the main entrances had black barbed-wire fences lined up along it. In the morning, they were replaced on the roads by a bright blue bus with the slogan “Make Love, Not Brexit”.

As people began to gather for the arrival of EU leaders, a small group of Swedish demonstrators carried purple signs with the claim “I Will Marry A Brit To Save the EU” and handed out roses to passers by. On turning a corner, a massive statue of a migrant in tattered clothes – a symbol of one of the EU’s greatest challenges.
There were more direct moments of absurdity: the press conference scheduled for immediately after the European Council summit, where the delay to the Brexit date was meant to be announced, was itself delayed. And delayed some more. There was eventually white smoke just after 11.30pm (our time here in Brussels).
As journalists waited for the announcements, they mused at how the practicalities of granting the extension could be going – games like replacing “…if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed next week” with “…if pigs fly” were commonplace. Some walked in circles outside the press room trying to find out how long they would be waiting; broadcasters ran out to appear on news bulletins or reports and returned, glued to their phones, fishing for a leak or an announcement of the extension.
At around 9pm, the rumour was floated that there might not be a press conference at all… iterations of draft documents came along with those rumours.
A breach of trust
The summit was held as the European Union – politicians, advisors, and other officials – grows increasingly frustrated and fatigued by Brexit.
After two years of negotiations, the crafting of detailed proposals that cover everything from the rights of citizens, to food standards, to the massive €43 billion divorce bill to be paid by the UK, that all may amount to nothing.

“The lack of trust is a concern,” the first vice president of the European Parliament, Mairéad McGuinness said ahead of the summit.
Trust “has been stretched” between the two nations, which is part of the problem: “The UK want all these assurances that we will act in good faith, perhaps we should have been asking for the same… In my mind, where we are now shows that the backstop has been absolutely essential.”
The EU’s Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan also had strong words on the border (or lack thereof). Referencing the no-deal tariffs announced by the British government last week, he said that they had to be temporary, weren’t in compliance with WTO rules, and in his view, were “illegal”.
“It does give some indication of their thinking and their planning,” the former Fine Gael minister said.
When asked whether the EU would reciprocate a gesture from the UK not to place tariffs on goods going to the North from the Republic, Hogan was vague and emphatic: “This is going to be an external EU border.
“This will be the first time, it’s a unique set of circumstances where the UK suggests imposing a set of tariffs, and at the external border the border with a third country they won’t want to collect tariffs.”
Hogan was then asked whether this meant the EU wouldn’t place tariffs on Northern Irish goods in a no-deal Brexit:
McGuinness said that there is also a human element to the Brexit process that has been somewhat forgotten. When it was suggested to her that the UK could leave without a deal, and start negotiations from scratch again the next day, she said:
“If you walk away, slam the door and then we’re sitting in a room together the next day, how would you feel about that?”
Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK government would have to work out some sort of future relationship with the EU. So the solution to the Brexit riddle would still have to be solved.

In the end, the European Council did hold a press conference, and announced at it that they would give the UK an extension until 22 May on condition that the Withdrawal Agreement is passed next week; that new deadline date is two days before Ireland holds its European elections. This isn’t quite what May wanted, she’d requested an extension until 30 June in her letter to Donald Tusk earlier this week.

If the deal isn’t passed next week, an ‘unconditional’ extension will be given until 12 April (so May’s deal doesn’t need to be passed next week) which is the last date by which the UK can organise for European elections.
When asked to describe the atmosphere at the European Council, President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, who addressed the leaders briefly, said:
“We’re all waiting… to see what the British intend to do. We have to see what happens in response to Mrs May. We’re waiting… we are all concerned.
“There’s all these majorities for no but we’re waiting for them to say yes to something” – a moment that might never arrive. We’re off to find a tree.

A RACING PIGEON has been sold for a record price of more than €1.25 million.
The bird, Belgian’s best long-distance racer of all time, is called Armando and has been described as the Lionel Messi of the pigeon-racing world.
He was sold for €1,252,000 to a Chinese buyer via an online auction about one hour after he was put on the market.
Armando had been expected to break the previous record of €376,000, paid for a pigeon called Nadine in November 2018, but not by such a wide margin.
A spokesperson for auction housePigeon Paradise(Pipa) said it was “clear that Armando would be the most expensive pigeon ever sold in an online auction, however no one expected that the magical cap of a million euros would be pulverised”.
Pipa did not say who had bought the pigeon, but according to the Belgian news agency Belga it was a Chinese buyer who will likely use Armando to breed other champions.
Describing Armando, Nikolaas Gyselbrecht, founder and chief executive of Pipa, said: ”In football terms you have Messi and Ronaldo – it’s that level.”

Armando was just one of more than 100 birds put up for auction by respected Belgian breeder Joel Verschoot.
The bird has retired from racing, but buyers were interested in his breeding potential. Some of his offspring were sold for five-figure sums in the same auction.
Verschoot’s stable of pigeons is based in Ingelmunster in west Belgium, and the online auction has been open for several weeks. As of Sunday, the family had sold 178 pigeons for around €2 million.
Children and grandchildren
Homing pigeons are raced by releasing them, sometimes hundreds of kilometres from home, with the first one back home winning the race.
Racing them is a tradition in countries such as Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands, although it has been going into decline in recent years. However, interest in Asia is increasing.
Eugene Fitzgerald, President of The Irish Homing Union, toldRTÉ Radio 1′s Morning IrelandChina and Taiwan are the “two big up and coming” countries in terms of pigeon racing.
Speaking about its popularity, Fitzgerald said: “Very few sports you can do in your own back garden, racing pigeons is one of them.”
Fitzgerald said Armando was sold for such a high price as his children and grandchildren will also be “worth a lot of money”, noting: “After a while the fella who bought him could have 40 or 50 direct children and maybe 100 or 200 grandchildren.”

LOCAL RESIDENTS OF Skerries in north Dublin have said they are “absolutely shell-shocked” by the decision of Fingal County Council to grant planning permission for a two-storey fast food restaurant just 300m from a primary school.
Fingal County Council on Wednesday granted permission to an application to construct a two-storey restaurant with a drive through at Skerries Point shopping centre on Barnageeragh Road.
The application was submitted last summer by the company Marbleside Ltd, and was met with fierce local opposition.
Concerned Skerries residents banded together to form a committee in June of last year to object against the proposed development.
Locals are concerned about the proximity of the planned restaurant to the local Educate Together National School, as well as the fact that it is adjacent to the Kelly’s Bay Montessori School, and the impact that this could have on children’s health.

There are also objections to increased traffic the development will bring to the area, as a result of the drive-through, and the safety issues this could raise. The proposed development is less than 100 metres from a residential area.
Concerns have also been raised that a late night fast food restaurant could increase anti-social behaviour in the area, and an over-saturation of fast food restaurants already in the area.

Lodging objections
Fundraisers were held in order to raise money to hire a professional engineer and planner to help people lodge evidence-based objections to the application.
“There was a lot of anger and outrage at the time… it’s unprecedented the anger that went through the community,” said local resident Corrina Cunnane, who lives close to the site.
Cunnane was one of the original members of the community who came together to form the committee against the restaurant.
Local and national TDs were also lobbied for support, with Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell, Senator James Reilly, Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Neill and Independent TD Clare Daly among those who objected to the development.
Very disappointing to see a drive thru restaurant application in Skerries granted planning permission by Fingal. I do not believe it appropriate for fast food outlets to be situated near schools, particularly given the body of evidence provided to my Oireachtas Committee.— Alan Farrell (@AlanFarrell)March 6, 2019Alan Farrell TD/ Twitter
Very disappointing to see a drive thru restaurant application in Skerries granted planning permission by Fingal. I do not believe it appropriate for fast food outlets to be situated near schools, particularly given the body of evidence provided to my Oireachtas Committee.
In total, Cunnane said local residents lodged 156 objections to the planning application at a cost of €20 per submission.
Additional information
Fingal County Council planners then came back to Marbleside requesting that additional information on the application be submitted.
Among these pieces of additional information, the council required that Marbleside justify the selection of that site for a fast food restaurant, given its proximity to a primary school.
An objective contained in theFingal Development Plan 2017-2023requires that council planners:
Other additional information requested related to sewage and water drainage, access and parking, noise levels and signage, among other concerns.
Corr & Associates Spatial Planning – acting on behalf of Marbleside – submitted a report dealing with the issues raised by the council.
In relation to the proximity to the school, Corr pointed out that the planning officer notes that the fact that the closest school is a primary school (where children are not allowed leave for lunch) means that the planned restaurant does not contradict the above objective.

Corr said it agreed with the planning officer’s assessment, saying that ultimately students attending the primary school will not be able to leave during school hours.
The planning notice.Fintan ClarkeFintan Clarke
It said that outside school hours, the responsibility for access to the school should “fundamentally lie with parents and guardians”.
“It is therefore considered the proposed development will not present a risk to the public health of school students,” Corr concluded.
Following the additional information being given to the council on 8 February, a further 83 objections were submitted against the proposed restaurant, Cunnane said.
Residents argued that the closeness of the restaurant would put the health of children going to and from school at increased risk.
There were also concerns raised about the effect the marketing of the building’s signage would have on 300 school children passing every day.
As one submission from two residents notes:
“We are both secondary school teachers ourselves and are witness to the growing epidemic of childhood obesity, in addition to the concentration and behavioural problems that are developing as a result of poor nutritional choices in our children.
The council granted planning permission for the restaurant on Wednesday.
‘Shell-shocked’
Corinna Cunnane said that local residents were “shell-shocked” by the council’s decision.
“People are shell-shocked that they have gone ahead with [it]… they don’t feel [the planners] have read any of their objections,” she said.
Cunnane referenced the “no-fry zone” campaign, which advocates for banning fast food restaurants within a certain distance of schools.
She also pointed towards the recommendationlaid out in a recent Oireachtas Childrens Committee reportthat states that government should enhance planning powers to stop the opening of new fast food outlets “within a defined vicinity of schools”.

Cunnane made it clear that she and others have no objection to developments of other types on the land, such as a healthier restaurant or playground or other amenity.
A meeting of the committee in opposition to the restaurant was due to take place last night. Residents have four weeks to appeal the ruling to An Bord Pleanála, which Cunnane said they will certainly do.
Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly – who lives in Skerries – said that she was surprised that planning permission had been granted to the restaurant, considering the depth of public sentiment in opposition to it.
“It’s very close to a school and I think it’s a very poor move given that the country is supposed to have a policy of tackling childhood obesity and this will have the opposite effect,” she toldTheJournal.ie.
O’Reilly said her party would be assisting residents in their appeal, and called for local councils to work to introduce no-fry zones.
Council
In a statement, Fingal CoCo said that it granted permission to the development and that the council was restricted to considering all planning applications on the basis of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.
“An appeal may be made to An Bord Pleanála in relation to this decision by the 2 April 2019 and therefore any further comment by Fingal County Council on this application would be inappropriate at this time,” a spokesperson said.
The Skerries Point Shopping Centre was under the control of Nama before it was sold in 2017 to American investment company Grand Coast Capital for €3.4 million in 2017.
Grand Coast Capital CEO Jeff Carter is also a director of Marbleside Ltd, which lodged the application for the restaurant.

A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE discovered at the University of Glasgow this afternoon has been linked to three explosive devices found at three London transport centres yesterday, police have said.
Several buildings on the Scottish university’s campus, including the mailroom, were evacuated “as a precautionary measure” after the package was found this afternoon.
Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland has said “the package was not opened and no one was injured”.
Bomb-disposal experts later performed a controlled explosion on the item, police have said.
Commander Clarke Jarrett from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command has said that “due to similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow, we are treating it as being linked to the three packages we’re investigating in London”.
“We are working very closely with our colleagues from Police Scotland and both investigations are being run in tandem”.

“We continue to pursue a number of lines of enquiry and one such line is the possibility that the packages have come from Ireland. However, we are still keeping an open mind with regards who may be responsible and any possible motivation”.
Met police yesterday launched a terrorism investigation after three small explosive devices were reported at a building near Heathrow Airport, London City Aviation House and the mail room of Waterloo station in London city centre.
The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags – were assessed by specialist officers and found to be small improvised explosive devices.
The devices, at the early stage of the investigation, appeared capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened.
Gardaí confirmed toTheJournal.ieyesterday evening that they were helping the Met Police with their investigations.
Dean Haydon, Britain’s senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, has said that no sender had been identified and that no group had claimed responsibility.
“We are talking to our Irish counterparts but at the moment there’s nothing to indicate motivation of the sender or ideology, so I cannot confirm at the moment if it’s connected to any Ireland-related terrorist groups”.

NEWSTALK TODAY ANNOUNCED an overhaul of its weekend schedule, with new shows and new presenters set to feature when it takes effect from this Saturday.
Its Monday-to-Friday morning show Newstalk Breakfast has been extended to seven days, with Susan Keogh taking the reins between 8am and 9am on Saturday and Sunday.
Journalist and broadcaster Sinead Ryan will have a new Saturday slot called the Home Show, covering the property market and all things in the home between 9am and 10am.
These new shows are coming into slots which previously featured highlights from the week’s Pat Kenny show.
Taking Stock on Sunday mornings at 10am with Vincent Wall will take a look at the week’s big business stories and trends affecting the world economy.
Virgin Media News’ Gavan Reilly, formerly ofTheJournal.ie, meanwhile is the new host of On the Record on Sundays from 11am.

Newstalk managing editor Patricia Monahan said the schedule changes were a move towards creating a fuller weekend package for listeners.
She toldTheJournal.ietoday: “We’ve been working on it for months. It’s great we can finally tell everybody.
Reilly toldTheJournal.ieit was a “great privilege” to be asked to do the show, but said it would be a “juggling act” with his other role as political correspondent with Virgin Media News.
“[With this show] you get to peek behind the curtain, so instead of it being a traditional newspaper review where you sit around and wonder what’s going to happen next, you can scrutinise how it’s come to that point, what is the root cause that’s got us to that point,” he said.
He’s hosted the show on several occasions in recent months, which is broadcast at the same time as RTÉ’s Radio One Marian Finucane show on Sunday.
Reilly added: “The [latest radio figures] have shown there is an appetite for the show. The show itself has evolved quite a bit with the hosts it’s had over the years. I’m a bit reluctant to break the thing open and try to change it from the ground up.
Keogh, meanwhile, said she was delighted to be the host of the breakfast show at the weekends.
She said: “It’s a new departure for Irish radio. At the minute, there’s no live news programming at this time of a Saturday and Sunday morning.

A MAN WHOSE wife was killed in the Christchurch attack as she rushed back into a mosque to rescue him said he harbours no hatred toward the gunman, insisting forgiveness is the best path forward.
“I would say to him ‘I love him as a person’,” Farid Ahmad told AFP. “I could not accept what he did. What he did was a wrong thing.”
Asked if he forgave the 28-year-old white supremacist suspect, he said: “Of course. The best thing is forgiveness, generosity, loving and caring, positivity.”
Husna Ahmed (44) is among 50 people, and at least four women, killed in the attack on two mosques where worshippers had gone for prayers on Friday.
When the shooting started, she helped several people escape from the women’s and children’s hall.
“She was screaming ‘come this way, hurry up’, and she took many children and ladies towards a safe garden,” Ahmad said.
“Then she was coming back for checking about me, because I was in a wheelchair, and as she was approaching the gate she was shot. She was busy saving lives, forgetting about herself.”
Ahmad (59) who has been confined to a wheelchair since being hit by a drunk driver in 1998, believes he escaped the hail of bullets because the gunman was focused on other targets.

Ahmad did not see his wife when he left the mosque and only learned of her death after someone photographed her body.
“Her picture was out in the social media, so somebody showed me the picture and I identified quite easily.”

Ahmad on Sunday faced the difficult task of formally identifying his wife’s body and claiming her belongings.
If he were able to sit down with the suspected mass murderer, he said he would encourage him to rethink his outlook on life.
“I will tell him that inside him he has great potential to be a generous person, to be a kind person, to be a person who would save people, save humanity rather than destroy them,” he said.
“I want him to look for that positive attitude in him, and I hope and I pray for him he would be a great civilian one day. I don’t have any grudge.”
Manifesto
Australian suspect Brenton Tarrant has yet to enter a plea in the single murder charge so far brought against him.
The self-professed white supremacist made awhite power symbolwhen in court. His meandering “manifesto” is filled with racist vitriol, detailing two years of planning for the massacre.

In the 74-page screed, he says he first began considering an attack in April and May 2017 while travelling in France and elsewhere in western Europe.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her office received a copy of the manifesto minutes before the attack.
“I was one of more than 30 recipients of the manifesto that was mailed out nine minutes before the attack took place,” Ardern told reporters today.
“It did not include a location, it did not include specific details,” she said, adding that it was sent to security services within two minutes of receipt.
Ardern said she had read “elements” of the lengthy, conspiracy-filled far-right “manifesto”.
“The fact that there was an ideological manifesto with extreme views attached to this attack, of course, that is deeply disturbing,” she said.
Ardern said a small number of bodies would start being released to families today, and authorities hope to release all the bodies by Wednesday. Thirty-four people remain in hospital, including 12 in intensive care.

https://www.thejournal.ie/snapchat-fights-ashbourne-4540282-Mar2019/,"GARDAÍ BELIEVE A fight between two groups of teenagers – which left a boy with facial injuries – was arranged on social media after a number of so-called ‘call-out’ videos.
Officers are now in the process of liaising with secondary schools in Ashbourne, County Meath, as well as schools in Swords, north Dublin following the incident last Friday.
Last week, one innocent teenage boy was hospitalised after a gang of young people got off a bus and attacked him outside a fast food restaurant.
Images and videos from the attack were posted to social media site Snapchat. However, gardaí believe that a fight between two groups of youths had also been organised previously on the online platform.
Up to around 40 teenage boys had taken public transport to Ashbourne. Some claimed to have knives and other weapons in their possession prior to the assault.
Gardaí believe the attackers intended to meet a local group of teenage boys for a fight but instead approached a different group of young people who fled straight away when approached.
The boy who was attacked and later hospitalised was an innocent bystander in the incident.

Gardaí are now attempting to quell the violence by speaking to the schools directly.
A garda spokesman described the incident.
He said: “On the evening of Friday 8 March 2019 Gardai in Ashbourne observed a large group of teenagers get off a bus in the centre of the town. The group was observed entering a multi-story car park, where they approached a small group of local youths who immediately dispersed.
“The majority of the people involved appear to have travelled from Swords by public transport. As part of their investigation Gardaí in Ashbourne and Swords are also liaising with local schools.”
New phenomenon?
Organised fights are also a problem in theLimerick and Clare regions.
Last month, local Fianna Fáil councillor Cathal Crowe requested gardaí to investigate a Snapchat ‘fight club’ that is showcasing both organised fights between teenagers and random attacks on young people.
The Snapchat group allegedly features boys fighting girls, unsuspecting young people being attacked on the street by gangs of youths, as well as other violent incidents.
Crowe claimed that the videos show heads being kicked and jumped on.

https://www.thejournal.ie/national-broadband-plan-blackspots-4526657-Mar2019/,"HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE have complained about high-speed internet services that never materialised despite their areas being excluded from the State’s planned rural broadband scheme on the grounds they would be covered by private operators.
But the government says it is unable to tell commercial providers to follow through with their plans as households and businesses wait on the fate of the troubled broadband programme.
Under the National Broadband Plan, which was first unveiled in 2012, premises unable to get high-speed broadband from commercial providers would get taxpayer-subsidised services to their homes and businesses.
Its more recent iteration, from 2015, involved around 750,000 premises in rural and regional areas getting fibre connectionswith download speeds of at least 30Mbps by 2020.
The plan has since been hit by a string of setbacks, includingthe withdrawal of major broadband playersEir and Siro from the tender process leaving a sole bidder, US investment firm Granahan McCourt.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recently said the government was still decidingwhether to proceed with the bidas the plan – now covering around 500,000 sites, representing more than 20% of the country’s premises – would cost “many multiples” of the original estimates.

The subsidy for the scheme was first put at around €500 million, although a price tag as high as six times that figure has since been suggested. Industry sources have said it could take at least five years to complete the network once work begins.
However new figures provided toTheJournal.iesuggest that many homes and businesses left outside the scheme because of plans from commercial providers have also been struggling to get access to promised high-speed broadband connections.
The National Broadband Plan map. Yellow areas require State intervention.
The Department of Communications said that it had recorded around 1,000 queries since 2017 relating to premises in areas where private firms had said they planned to provide broadband services.
Up to 95% of these were from people who said they were unable to get any high-speed broadband access, it added.
No power to direct
A spokesman for the department said the government had no power to “direct or instruct telecommunications operators to provide high-speed services in areas previously identified as commercial” on the National Broadband Plan map.
“However, in the event commercial operators’ plans for these premises in areas currently identified as commercial do not materialise it may become necessary for the department to intervene,” he said.
Related Reads'It's fatally flawed': What the hell is going on with the shrinking National Broadband Plan?
“The procurement process allows for such premises to be included in the State intervention area.”
The National Broadband Plan map has been redrawn several times to include sites where planned private investments failed to materialise and new rollouts from commercial firms.
The largest of those additional rollouts, Eir’s agreement with the government in 2017 to reach 300,000 premises in rural and regional areas, was blamed with making the final tender for the remaining properties, often in the most isolated areas,less attractive.
The Eir rollout was due to be completed at the end of last year, however it pushed back the completion date to June after the company blamed Storm Ophelia for disrupting its schedule.
The department said it had also recorded about 400 queries relating to Eir’s promised rural fibre network, about 100 of which related to premises that had already been passed by the rollout but were “experiencing issues” getting connected. The majority of these had been resolved, it said.
Coverage areas vary wildly between different parts of the country, with less than 2% of premises in County Dublin requiring State intervention to get access to high-speed broadband compared to more than 50% in Leitrim.

Addressing a meeting of diplomats and foreign media in Pyongyang, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said the North was deeply disappointed by the failure of the two sides to reach any agreements at the Hanoi summit.
She said Pyongyang now has no intention of compromising or continuing talks unless the US takes measures that are commensurate to the changes it has taken — such as the 15-month moratorium on launches and tests — and changes its “political calculation”.
A nuclear summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, between Kim and Trump ended without agreement on 28 February.
Kim, Choe said, was puzzled by what she called the “eccentric” negotiation position of the US.
She suggested that while Trump was more willing to talk, an atmosphere of hostility and mistrust was created by the uncompromising demands of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton.
She said statements by senior Trump advisers since the summit have further worsened the climate.
Despite this, Choe said personal relations between the two leaders are still good and “the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful”.
‘Thrown away a golden opportunity’
Following the breakdown of talks, each side sought to blame the other for the deadlock, with Trump saying Pyongyang wanted the US to lift all sanctions imposed on it over its banned weapons programmes.
But in a late-night press conference after the summit ended, the North Korean foreign minister said that Kim only wanted some of the measures eased, and that its offer to close all nuclear production facilities at its Yongbyon complex was the best it could ever offer.

Choe has now questioned the claim by Trump that the North was seeking the lifting of all sanctions against it, and said it was seeking only the ones that are directed at its civilian economy.
Choe said it was the US that was being too demanding and inflexible and called the demand that denuclearisation come before sanctions are eased “an absurd sophism”.
She added that while South Korean President Moon Jae-in has tried to help bring the US and North Korea together to talk, the South is “a player, not an arbiter” because it is an ally of Washington.
She said even though the people, military and officials of the munitions industry have sent Kim thousands of petitions to never give up the nuclear program, he went to Hanoi to build trust and carry out mutually agreed commitments “one by try and step by step”.
“This time we understood very clearly that the United States has a very different calculation to ours,” she added.
‘We just had to walk’
Speaking after the Hanoi summit breakdown, Trump said “sometimes you have to walk”.
“We just left chairman Kim with a really, I think a very productive time. We thought and I thought and Secretary Pompeo felt that it wasn’t a good thing to be signing anything,” Trump said, speaking to the media shortly after leaving the summit.
“We spent pretty all day with Kim Jong Un who is… he’s quite a guy and quite a character and I think our relationship is very strong. At this time we had some options and at this time we decided not to do any of the options and we’ll see where that goes.
Choe refused to comment directly when asked by one of the ambassadors about news reports the North may be preparing for another missile launch or satellite launch.
“Whether to maintain this moratorium or not is the decision of our chairman of the state affairs commission,” she said, using one of Kim’s titles. “He will make his decision in a short period of time.”

The four-time All-Ireland senior inter-county camogie championship winner and Davy Fitzgerald’s hurling coach is under the spotlight at Liberty Insurance’sWomen in Sport: The Coaching Effectevent, alongside England Netball Coach Tracey Neville MBE andChelsea women’s manager Emma Hayes MBE.
D’Arcy, a two-time All-Star winning goalkeeper, is just off the back of a heartbreaking All-Ireland final loss with her club St Martin’s in Croke Park on Sunday, but is in high spirits against the odds.
“My journey isn’t as well developed as the girls in terms of coaching,” she says,12 months since she confirmed her addition to Fitzpatrick’s backroom team at the same event in 2018.
“I’m a complete rookie at this stage in my career. Over the last 13 to 14 months, I’ve really seen the value of creating an inner circle and surrounding yourself with the right people. I’m very lucky to have a very supportive partner who allows me to follow my passion.
“Creating the right environment is incredibly important to be able to harness those opportunities. To be in the right position in life to be able to take the opportunity once it comes. Maybe I’ve grown up a little bit since last year,” she smirks.
“Number two: role models. You don’t see yourself as a role model, you see yourself as someone going in and getting the job done. Step up and deliver what you have to do, look to be challenged at every turn.”
The 31-year-old has experienced absolutely no issues so far as afemalecoach — she sees herself as just a coach, plain and simple, exactly as her players and the rest of the backroom team do — and she was, in no way, forced to have a thicker skin from the get-go.

She had the confidence, and that was noted.
“My own confidence was backed by a gentleman who gave me an opportunity, and that man’s name is Davy Fitzgerald,” she smiles.
“I was given an opportunity to come in last year and link in with the head goalkeeping coach. To assist him and to bring new ideas — any ideas. It was a great learning curve for me to be involved. This year I’ve taken a wider, broader stance. I’m involved in outfield collective play as well. I do a lot of face-to-face with the player.”
With Chelsea Women’s Super League manager Hayes to her immediate right, D’Arcy alludes to her set-up, and her players in London.
“When you’re in the professional side of sport, you have more contact with players,” she continues. “There’s an opportunity to go in from nine to four each day and see the player, talk to the player, get to know the player.
“In GAA circles, you have three to four hours in the evenings. Players are coming in, stressed coming from work with stuff going on in their lives. They’re there to train.

“I’ve loved every minute of it. I have everything positive to say about my experience. The lads are great. Davy’s a mentor. The other coaches are mentors to me as well. I have a lot to learn still, I put my hands up there.”
Wexford hurling coach Mags D'Arcy.Donall Farmer / INPHODonall Farmer / INPHO / INPHO
While she says she puts them up, D’Arcy is taking that need to learn more into her own hands and using her initiative.
Valentine’s Day this year was an interesting one, — she again thanks her partner — spent in London, putting in a few valuable hours with the Arsenal Women’s Super League team.
Their manager, Joe Montemurro, welcomed her in with open arms to watch a training session. ‘This is just going to be everything beyond my expectation,’ D’Arcy thought to herself before watching Irish duo Katie McCabe and Louise Quinn run through their daily routine with their side.
“I was just looking at it going, ‘Isn’t it fantastic to be a player able to just rock in as professionally as you can under a great coaching staff, and to be looked after to the best of their ability.’ Everything they were doing, we do it back here in Ireland in the GAA.
“There was no differential in terms of what we’re trying to achieve: the game itself, the movement, the positioning of players, tactical work. We do it here but just on a lesser scale in terms of face-to-face time.
“We talk about gains in the game. Gains in the game in the GAA for me is getting to develop the player off the field so when they come to training, the team has the confidence to develop to a greater height.”
As she touched on earlier, being a role model is a big thing for D’Arcy.
She tells a story of how in Wexford Park a few weeks ago, she was walking towards the dressing rooms with two of the senior hurlers when she heard a voice.
Mags, we want your autograph…
It was the father of a young girl, with D’Arcy more than happy to oblige as the two Model men’s stars shuffled on towards their destination, slightly bemused.

“We do knock a bit of craic out of it — the way the men haven’t achieved anything in a while, the way the women have,” she laughs, before realising she may have stuck her foot in it.
The rescue attempt.
“Now, the landscape is very much changing.”
Too late.
Wexford camogie, is of course, going through a turbulent time at the minute. They were unable to field a team in an early round of the league and having lost their manager, there’s been plenty of backlash since.

MC Joanne Cantwell stalls her, prying for D’Arcy’s opinion or inside knowledge, but that’s to no avail.
“We’re here for a specific reason today,” the Wexford coach puts her foot down, before picking up where she was.
“In this game, once you are the same as everyone else, you’re pretty much a static commodity. You have to be evolving, your thinking has to be evolving. It has helped my general play as a current club player.
“Sunday didn’t go to the manner we had wished, but that’s a learning curve for me as a player and me as a wannabe coach in years to come.”
After a bit more chat and further questioning of Hayes and Neville, it’s back to D’Arcy for her parting shot.

Cantwell is straight in: does she see herself as the next Wexford camogie or hurling manager?
“I’m still at my learning phase, I’m not getting… you’re trying to take a headline there!” she responds, to more laughter and applause from the audience. “Davy is not under threat by anything.
“I couldn’t be in a better environment for it. I feel quite lucky to be in the environment I’m in. For Wexford hurling, it’s three years of a three-year plan. The guys are getting stronger, more conditioned, they’re faster. It’s going to be a very exciting summer for Wexford hopefully.
“We’ve utilised a lot of the panel in the league. We’re at a stage now where we have options off the bench, something every team are aspiring to have after Limerick’s state of play last year. It’s at the point now where we’re ready for silverware.”
Silverware in the league, is that a priority?
“Everything’s a priority, Joanne. Every game is a priority.”
“One game at a time, ok,” Cantwell concludes with a smile and her own warm reception from the crowd.

LONDON’S MET POLICE are now working with the gardaí here as investigations continue into yesterday’sdiscovery of a parcel bombat an An Post centre in Limerick.
The device, which did not go off, is believed to be the fifth of five parcel bombs sent to locations in London and Scotland and claimed by a group styling itself as the IRA.
Gardaí confirmed yesterday that the parcel appeared identical to the ones sent to London and Glasgow at the start of the month, while photos released by the force yesterday afternoon showed that even the same type of stamp was used.
Security analyst and former Defence Forces officer Tom Clonan said the devices found earlier this month were of a similar type to those used by the Provisional IRA at the height of the group’s operational capacity in the 1970s and 80s.
“I spoke to a former colleague of mine who is a really experienced bomb disposal officer and he would have had a lot of experience dealing with IEDs, improvised explosive devices, and in this case an improvised incendiary device (IID) during the Troubles.
“He said the type of device found in London matches that which was used by the IRA during the 7os and 80s. They would have had them in cigarette size packages and put them in shops and they would ignite and burn – they did millions of pounds worth of damage in Britain and in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.
Clonan said whoever dreamt up the parcel bomb scheme had carried out a “cack-handed, reckless and extremely dangerous” operation.

Police in the UK confirmedearlier this monththat they were investigating a claim made by a group styling itself as the IRA that it had been behind the four devices discovered in Britain, but that a total of five packages had been sent.
The unit where the parcel was found yesterday processes all national and international undeliverable parcels that originated in Ireland.
‘Charing Cross’ was given as the address on the package, but it was marked ‘Return to Sender’. The location of a vague return address marked on the package does not appear to exist.
The package, which the Defence Forces confirmed contained a viable improvised explosive device, would have had to travel to and from the UK either by air or sea.
An Post says huge volumes of mail travel between Ireland and the UK each day via roads, ferries and air. More than two million items of mail go through its postal centres here each day.
“Safety is our number one priority. Since images of the packages in question have become available, our sorting staff have been briefed on what to look out for and to be extra vigilant,” an An Post spokesperson said earlier this month.
The stamps used on the package found in Limerick and the others found in Britain come from the postal service’s Love & Wedding series and have been available across the country in booklets of ten since January of last year.
Met Police says it is now working with gardaí as their joint probe with Police Scotland continues.
Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said it was “a dreadful consequence of the uncertainties around Brexit where in the context of the heightened tensions in Northern Ireland, in the island of Ireland that people have taken it on themselves to send letter bombs”.
He called it an “absolutely despicable act” and “totally unacceptable” and added that he hoped those responsible could be brought to justice.

Updated 8.08am
AT LEAST 49 people have been killed in what police described as a “well planned” mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Dozens of people were also injured; there are reports of close to 50 people in hospital with gunshot wounds.
The two mosques which were targeted were filled with worshippers for Friday prayers.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the shootings as a terrorist attack, saying today is “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.
“This is absolutely tragic, there will be so many people affected,” the country’s police chief Mike Bush told reporters earlier.
One person, a man in his 20s, has been charged with murder and is due to appear in court tomorrow.
Four people in total are now in custody – three men and one woman – and a number of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) have been discovered around the city. The explosive devices were attached to vehicles belonging to the detained suspects. None had detonated and were subsequently made safe by the military.

The attacks took place during lunchtime at mosques on Deans Avenue and Linwood Avenue.

The city went into lockdown with police asking people to stay indoors in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Schools were also shut but that lockdown has now been lifted. However, mosques across the country remain closed and police advised Muslim worshippers to not visit for prayers.
“Clearly, what has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” Ardern told reporters.
She said many of those who will have been directly affected by the attacks may be migrants or refugees who “have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home”.
“The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.”

Ardern reiterated police advice for people in Christchurch to stay indoors.
“We are potentially still dealing with an evolving situation. And again, as I say, across multiple sites. Please be assured, though, the police are actively managing the situation. Christchurch Hospital is dedicated to treating those who are arriving at the hospital,” she said.

Police have also warned people against watching “distressing” social media footage of the attack. It is understood that one of the shootings was streamed live on Facebook.

The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, however, has said that one of the attackers was a “right-wing terrorist” with Australian citizenship.
“We stand here and condemn, absolutely the attack that occurred today by an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist,” an emotional Morrison told a press conference.
“We are not just allies, we are not just partners, we are family,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boeing-737-canada-suspension-flights-4540005-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Mar 2019
US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has announced he will issue an emergency order to ground Boeing 737 Max planes amid concerns over their safety.
Trump told reporters at the White House that all flight operations involving the plane will be suspended in the US, becoming the latest country to ground the aircraft.
Yesterday evening, the European Aviation Safety Agency also announced a Europe-wide suspension of flights involving the aircraft.
It follows the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Sunday, in which 157 people – including Irishman Michael Ryan – were killed, the second crash involving the Boeing 737 Max in six months.
That crash came four months after a Lion Air jet of the same model crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people.
“We’re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition regarding all flights of the 737 Max 8 and 737 Max 9,” Trump said.
Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg said he supported the US decision, but claimed the company continues to have “full confidence” in the safety of the plane.
He also said he recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration that the global fleet should be suspended “out of an abundance of caution”.
The company said it would continue in its efforts “to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again”.
Trump’s announcement comes after Canada ordered a halt to flight operations involving the aircraft earlier today, with a ban on the plane flying in its skies announced this afternoon.

That suspension hit the world’s third largest fleet of the aircraft, leaving 41 planes operated by three Canadian carriers on the ground.
“As a result of new data that we received this morning, and the chance to analyse, and on the advice of my experts and as a precautionary measure, I issued a safety notice,” Canada’s transport minister March Garneau said.
“This safety notice restricts commercial passenger flights from any operator of the Boeing 737 Max 8 or Max 9 variant aircraft, whether domestic or foreign, from arriving, departing or overflying Canadian air space.
“This safety notice is effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice.”
When asked about the grounding of aircraft today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that in doing so, the Irish Aviation Authority and the European Aviation Safety Agency are “putting safety considerations first”.
“We have a very good record of airline safety in the European Union, and I think you always need to put safety first, and it may only be the grounding of aircraft for a couple of days or weeks to make the necessary checks, but that is the correct thing to do, to put safety first.”
No problems with the 737 Max have yet been identified, but authorities and airlines across the world have moved to ground flights involving the aircraft amid safety concerns over the plane.
Around 350 of the planes are currently in service around the world, while Boeing has also taken more than 5,000 orders for different versions of the carrier.

https://www.the42.ie/u20-ireland-france-match-report-4530896-Mar2019/,"Ireland U20: 31
France U20: 29
Sean Farrell reports from Musgrave Park
IT WAS FAST, it was frantic and downright fantastic entertainment as the scoreboard tipped this way and that with brilliant attacking play in spades. So it was fitting that there was a trophy on offer at the finish.
A brace of tries from Corkman Josh Wycherley helped Ireland to a thrilling win over France. The result, coupled with Wales’ loss away to Scotland tonight, means Ireland are the U20 Six Nations Champions for the first time since 2010.
Beginning the night four points behind Ireland in second place, the world champions were always going to be formidable foe for Ireland to take down on a dry night on this fast 4G track. But the task was made even trickier with the loss to injury of captain David Hawkshaw and out-half Harry Byrne during the week.
However, the replacement 10-12 axis of Ben Healy and Sean French were at the heart of Ireland’s success here as they ensured the hosts, just as they did on opening night against England, maintained a viciously high tempo and intensity in every act from Craig Casey’s electric bursts for a gap, to John Hodnett’s hard yards.

Ireland brought the crowd to their feet with a thrilling breakthrough try on 12 minutes after the 10-12 axis first combined to great effect.
Healy slipped French through the gap and the centre returned the favour with a flick back inside to the playmaker on his shoulder. French deftly stepped a tackle and was not felled until five metres out. From that base, Ireland recycled well and Corkman Josh Wycherley bullied his way over the try-line.
France hit back almost immediately. Jordan Joseph broke into the Ireland 22, and though French got a solid ankle-tap to bring the Racing star down, the number 8 reacted with a brilliant offload to Jean Baptiste Gros.

The errors which cut short the visitors early forays into scoring territory ominously began to fall away and they mounted concerted pressure on McNamara’s men. With each passing attack set they grew in confidence and stature as they hit a rhythm and they hit the front in the 26th minute, Louis Carbonel playing a tidy one-two cut-out with fullback Alexandre de Nardi and the number 10 ran in behind the posts to give himself an easier conversion.
The same pair very nearly added seven more to the arrears for Ireland before half-time, after Healy notched his second penalty, but it remained 13-14 through the interval because De Nardi fluffed the finish after a sublime grubber from Carbonel.
Tempers flare between the sides.Oisin Keniry / INPHOOisin Keniry / INPHO / INPHO
Ireland flew out of the traps in the second half and mounted an onslaught of forward pressure. Three times arms went up in hope off convincing  the officials a try had been scored, but a fierce French resistance on the try-line kept them agonisingly short. The visitors were content enough to get back to halfway with just Healy’s third penalty of the night conceded.
Though Carbonel immediately cancelled that effort out, the boundless energy of  Casey ensured momentum was kept in Ireland’s favour through the hour mark. His electric break over halfway left props flat-footed and tacklers unable to hold him as he bounced back up for a second run. Liam Turner hit a fine angle to race at the posts. Though he was grounded, there was another penalty in store for Healy.
Healy makes a break.Oisin Keniry / INPHOOisin Keniry / INPHO / INPHO
19-17 to the good, Ireland forced a lead that would have looked decisive against a side other than the reigning world champions. This time the forward-driven onslaught yielded a reward as Wycherley bullied his way over for his second try.
The tide threatened to turn yet again when Carbonel showed his searing pace to inflict the most severe punishment for an Ireland turnover in attack. But McNamara’s men stayed the course and while Wycherley was withdrawn, replacement loosehead Callum Reid pushed over the whitewash to give Ireland a third try.
Les Bleus showed their attacking teeth again before the night was out, but it was too late to do anything about Ireland’s lead on the Musgrave Park scoreboard or the Championship table.

https://www.thejournal.ie/california-death-row-4538562-Mar2019/,"
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN Newsom will today impose a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty in the US state, granting temporary reprieve to the 737 inmates on death row – the largest such group in the country.
Newsom is a Democrat who took office in January and a long-standing opponent of the death penalty, which was last carried out in California in 2006.
“The death penalty is inconsistent with our bedrock values and strikes at the very heart of what it means to be a Californian,” Newsom will say, according to prepared remarks from his office.
“The intentional killing of another person is wrong. And as Governor, I will not oversee the execution of any individual,” he will say.
The governor plans to sign an executive order to block the death penalty in his state. It will also withdraw California’s lethal injection protocol and close the execution chamber at San Quentin prison, his office said.

It does not provide for the release of any death row inmates from prison.
A quarter of all those on death row in the United States are in California, according to the governor’s office. Twenty-five people on California’s death row have exhausted all of their appeals.
Human Rights Watch said that with the governor’s decision, California continues a trend in the United States away from putting people to death.
The state joins Colorado, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, which have similar bans, and 20 states that have abolished the death penalty, it said.
“Governor Newsom has demonstrated great courage and leadership in ending the cruel, costly, and unfair practice of executing prisoners,” said Alison Parker, US managing director at Human Rights Watch.
“Californians should be proud their state has taken a stand to end state-sanctioned killing and uphold the human rights of all people.”

GARDAÍ IN DUBLIN have recovered the head of an 800-year-old mummy known as ‘The Crusader’ after it was stolen from the crypts of St. Michan’s Church last week.
The discovery of the theft at the crypt of the church on Church Street was made shortly before lunchtime last Monday when a guide was preparing to open the church for visitors.
The Church of Ireland said the crypt had been “badly damaged” and several of the mummies inside, including the 400-year-old remains of a nun, had been desecrated. The Crusader’s body was turned over and his head had been removed.

The items were stolen over the weekend of the 23rd-25th February, gardaí have said. Gardaí have also recovered another skull which was stolen during the theft.
Last week, the Archbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson said he was “shocked that someone would target this ancient burial place and desecrate the remains of those lying within it”.
The items were recovered as a result of information given to investigating gardaí.
The National Museum of Ireland is acting in an advisory capacity in the case.
Archbishop Jackson welcomed today’s recovery saying that “the emphasis will now be able to turn to consideration of future security and display of the remains in the crypt of St Michan’s”.
“Renewed thanks go to all who have shown interest and concern for the mummies. They are a priceless part of the heritage of the city of Dublin and its citizens”.

THERESA MAY’S WEEK isn’t going to plan.
That’s pretty much par for the course. Her year so far hasn’t been smooth sailing either.
But a surprise move from the speaker of the Commons and threats of revolt within her cabinet in the last few days meant the British prime minister had to radically alter her intended schedule for this week.
That led toangry scenes in parliamentthis afternoon as May told MPs she intended to ask for an extension of the UK’s exit time from the EU by three months and appeared to take any longer delay off the table entirely.
So what led to today’s change of tack?
Where does that leave us ahead of tomorrow’s meeting of EU leaders in Brussels?
And what are the scenarios that could play out in the coming weeks?
Theresa May wrote a letter to the EU seeking a brief delay to Brexit.
Shetold the House of Commonsshe had written to European Council President Donald Tusk “informing him that the UK seeks an extension … to June 30″.
The European Commission, meanwhile, had advised EU leaders that a shorter delay until 23 May (the date of the European elections) or a much longer one until at least the end of 2019 would be preferable.
May’s under pressure from all sides in Westminster over her latest position on an extension: some Brexiteers want her to stick to 29 March, while others, including Remainers, would prefer a longer period to allow time to figure out a different strategy.
Stuck as she is between several rocks and numerous hard places, May indicated in strong terms today that she would quit as prime minister if the exit date was pushed out beyond 30 June, telling the Commons:

PM@Theresa_Mayhas written to@eucopresidentDonald Tusk on Brexithttps://t.co/2rrQwf8cYGpic.twitter.com/WjutyC507d
The way thingswere stacking up last week, indications were that May would make a third attempt to get the EU withdrawal agreement through the Commons in time for the EU summit getting underway tomorrow.
In the wake of the votes to reject a no-deal exit (last Wednesday) and extend Article 50 (Thursday last) efforts were already under way to get Tory Eurosceptics in the ERG and the ten DUP MPs on board.
The hope was that if the DUP could be convinced to back the twice-rejected deal it was unlikely Jacob Rees-Mogg and his group would out-unionist the unionists and might finally move on their position.
If the deal had been passed by this evening, May could have headed to Brussels seeking her short, technical extension and in all likelihood EU leaders would have acceded.
If it had been rejected, the implication given by May last week was that a much longer extension would be needed. She said last Wednesday:

However, to sum up the series of unfortunate events of the last seven days:
Hence the message to the EU from May today: We need a short extension so I can get this withdrawal agreement through at the third time of asking and if you force us into a longer extension I’ll probably quit.
May was thrown a lifeline by Tusk this afternoon when he told reporters a short extension would be possible but that it would be conditional on a positive result when the withdrawal agreement goes back to the Commons.
“In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days, I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons,”Tusk said.
He sounded reasonably positive about the 30 June date saying it “has its merits” but created “a series of questions of a legal and political nature”. He wouldn’t hesitate, he said, to call an emergency EU summit next week if the meaningful vote did not pass.
Tusk was also speaking by phone to Leo Varadkar today, and in Dublin the Taoiseach told reporters that the proposed length of the extension would be discussed in detail at tomorrow’s summit.

Varadkar said it was time to cut the UK “some slack” on the extension time as there was a real risk of a no-deal happening by accident.
The soundings from elsewhere in Europe are less positive for May, however.
Earlier a spokesperson for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he had warned May in a phonecall that Brexit needed to be complete by 23 May if the UK wanted to avoid having to take part in EU elections.
France’s foreign minister meanwhile warned the country was prepared to veto an extension unless May presented a credible strategy at the summit.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
There are various scenarios that could play out over the coming days, weeks and months.
Deal:May gets her deal through next week after returning from Brussels, arguing in the Commons that she’s secured further reassurances from Europe and that the proposition is now substantially different. The UK exits after a short extension.
No deal:Given that we have only nine days to go and the fact that EU leaders need to agree unanimously to extending Article 50, a no-deal could still happen either by the summer or by 29 March (Friday week).
A long extension:The emergency summit Tusk mooted in his comments today could result in an offer of a longer delay from the EU. As this would mean taking part in EU elections, May is extremely unlikely to accept thisandmanage to stay in office. But, those factors aside, a longer extension could pave the way for a rethink by MPs and a possible softer Brexit (or possibly no Brexit at all) – perhaps in the wake of a general election, second referendum or both.
Revoke Article 50:Both sides need to agree to extending the mechanism the UK is using to leave the EU, but the European Court of Justice ruled in December that London can unilaterally halt the process. May has dismissed this option and it’s one of the more unlikely scenarios.
May could quit:Going by her remarks in the Commons today, the implication is clear that she is threatening to resign if forced into a corner by the EU requiring a longer extension.
She could be forced out:At the moment she can’t be shown the door by her own party under the official process after a bid to unseat her failed last December. The way things are going, however, she may be vulnerable if Jeremy Corbyn tables a no-confidence motion.
Neither of the latter scenarios would necessarily solve anything at all and would result in a divisive Tory leadership campaign, a possible split in the party and a possible general election.
There’s a chance a no-deal Brexit could still have happened by accident somewhere in the middle of all that.

https://www.the42.ie/warren-gatland-wales-jealousy-ireland-4534138-Mar2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Mar 2019
WARREN GATLAND AND Wales will bid for Grand Slam glory against Ireland on Saturday with the New Zealander admitting his team are jealous of the success of the men in green.
Gatland saw Wales seal an 18-11 win over Scotland to record their 13th straight success and they are now just a game away from what would be a first Six Nations clean sweep since 2012.
Gatland's men are going for a Grand Slam.Ryan Byrne / INPHORyan Byrne / INPHO / INPHO
Standing in Gatland’s way is his former team, Ireland. Joe Schmidt’s side sealed a Grand Slam of their own in 2018 and also claimed a famous November win over world champions New Zealand.
The Wales boss believes those victories – plus Leinster’s Guinness PRO14 and European Champions Cup double last season – are achievements his players want a taste of.
“I think the added spice is that with the PRO14 the players know each other. We respect Ireland hugely for what they have achieved,” Gatland said.
“They are No 2 in the world and their provinces have had a lot of success in the PRO14 and in Europe and sometimes it can breed a jealousy. You respect them, but you are desperate to beat them.
“That sometimes creates the edge. A lot of it stems from that. They have been incredibly successful and I take my hat off to their provincial rugby, what they have achieved in Europe, and what the national team has done. We have got to strive to do that.

“That creates competition. It is almost like a derby-type feeling. I know our group of players get incredibly motivated to play against Ireland. They want to beat them because a lot of them have been on the losing end on a number of occasions, particularly to their provincial teams.”
Wales are on a remarkable run of form while Ireland haven’t hit their heights of 2018 this year, not so far at least. Gatland’s men are still wary of them and they are right to be so.
An 80-minute performance has remained elusive for Wales in the Six Nations to date and against Scotland they produced an archetypal game of two halves.
In the first they were dominant as they scored two fine tries through Josh Adams and Jonathan Davies. After the break concentration levels dropped and only a monumental defensive effort – in which Wales made a total of 194 tackles – saw them come out on top.
Chaos awaits in Cardiff.Tommy Dickson / INPHOTommy Dickson / INPHO / INPHO
Cardiff is now preparing for an Irish invasion and what Wales hope will be a Grand Slam party.
“It is going to be chaotic. We get the chance to play at home and there won’t be any lack of motivation for these players because they get to do something special,” Gatland said.
“There is no doubt against England we were right on top of our game mentally and we need to be like that this week.
“The challenge for Ireland is they have a team with some older and experienced players. They are often the most dangerous because there is always a big match in an experienced team. You don’t always get as much consistency, but when it really matters they can turn on that big performance.”
Victory for Wales on Saturday would make Gatland the first Six Nations coach to win three Grand Slams and his team have been boosted by a positive injury update on full-back Liam Williams.

“It would be my last Grand Slam with Wales and if we do that it would be unbelievable,” said Gatland, who will depart his role after this year’s World Cup in Japan.
“I have loved my time in Wales. I never thought I would be here for so long. It will almost be 12 years by the time I finish. When someone presents you with an opportunity to win a Grand Slam you want to take it with both hands. We are excited about next week and about being at home in front of our crowd who were unbelievable in terms of the atmosphere they created and the drive they gave us against England. If they can produce that next week it will be a special night in Cardiff.”
Wales’ Grand Slam bid remains on course despite off-the-field political chaos following the abandonment of a proposed merger between the country’s two best sides – Ospreys and Scarlets.
The Welsh have won 13 in a row.Tommy Dickson / INPHOTommy Dickson / INPHO / INPHO
That it was defied at BT Murrayfield is to the credit of Gatland and his players, especially lock totem and captain Alun Wyn Jones.
Wales wing George North added: “Ireland are a quality team who have come to Cardiff before and done a job on us. We will debrief the Scotland game and we have only got a short turnaround so it’s full steam ahead for Saturday now.
“Ireland have had a similar sort of tournament to us. They’ve shown great glimpses, but also not had consistency. They are still dogging it out. It makes the last game very interesting.”

THE HOUSE OF Commons has voted against a no-deal Brexit with321MPs rejecting leaving the European Union without an agreement at any time.
After a chaotic evening in Westminster,278voted against the motion which aims to rule out a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances.
The Prime Minister’s motion had an amendment attached to it because of an earlier vote in the house. The initial motion read:
However, during tonight’s events, MPs also voted for a ‘no no-deal ever’ amendment as put down by Caroline Spelman. Its aim was to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time rather than just up until 29 March, as Theresa May had proposed.
A total of312voted for it – ie to entirely reject a no-deal at any time now or in the future – while308voted against the amendment.
That vote was essentially repeated as May’s main motion was altered to reflect the Spelman amendment. To add to the confusion of the evening, Spelman tried to pull her amendment but other signatories to it wanted it to be pushed and voted on.
She said she wanted to stop the vote after it was clear the two main parties would “put their weight behind a no to ‘no deal’ amendment – the government motion”.
She told BBC News that it would send “a very strong signal of the parties coming together in the national interest to make a clear statement that we do not want to crash out without a deal”.
In the end, it was voted on and MPs did completely reject a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances. It was not the way that May intended the evening to play out.
Taking ‘no deal’ off the table entirely (politically, even if it can’t be take off the table in actuality) was not part of the UK’s negotiating plan.
In the end, it is understood the Prime Minister voted against her own motion because of that amendment and there was some confusion over who in her party was whipped, and in what way. A number of Cabinet ministers are said to have abstained.

The government had tried to whip its members but the final numbers show that a  significant cohort of 17 Tory MPs would have voted against the wishes of their party.

A third vote
The so-called Malthouse B Compromise was also voted on but roundly rejected – with164politicians voting for it and374against.
The motion asked for a delay until 22 May to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. The amendment detailed how the British government should ask the EU for a ‘standstill pay-as-you-go’ arrangement until end-2021 at the latest, during which a future relationship would be carved out.
So what happens now?
Tomorrow, the House of Commons will hold another vote. MPs will be asked whether they want to vote to request an extension to Article 50 from the European Union which would see Brexit delayed.
If passed, the UK would not leave the EU on the 29 March but May said the motion will ask politicians to vote on a ‘short, limited, technical’ extension to Article 50.
However, it would have to ask the EU if it could do so. The EU has said it would be amenable to such a move – but it would need to know what the UK’s plan would be.

The motion proposes an extension until 30 June, a day before the new EU parliament will sit.
May said that to get such an extension, there would have to be a deal in place, and that the only deal on offer is the current Withdrawal Agreement.
The Prime Minister said that parliament needs to accept that the only other option open to them if that motion is rejected is to opt for a much longer extension.
As noted today by chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, one of the current risks is an ‘accidental no-deal Brexit’.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pac-robert-watt-4528153-Mar2019/,"SECRETARY GENERAL OF Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DEPR), Robert Watt, has said he did not mean to cause offence to committee members by referring to them as a “mob”.
Members of the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee (PAC) were not happy today when reports filtered through from a journalist’s tweet that Watt, who was due to appear before the committee, said the chairperson “has to control the mob”.
Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane referred to the tweet before Watt took his seat at the committee today, stating that it was “unacceptable”.
“I think that is outrageous,” he said.
@Ocionnaith@Ocionnaith
When Watt took his seat, he was questioned about his remarks outside the committee room, and asked if he did say the above remark.
Watt hesitated and said “if anyone takes offence to what I said I apologise”. He was asked whether he did say the comment a few minutes prior outside the committee room.
Watt replied: “I don’t recall saying it… I don’t recollect to be honest.”

He then added: “It is a colloquial expression… if I said something to offend, it was not meant to offend.”
Fine Gael’s Alan Farrell said he was disappointed with Watt’s comments outside the committee room, stating:
“I don’t consider a colloquial expression like that to be helpful and it is unbecoming of your office.”
Watt sighed openly when Independent TD Catherine Connolly questioned the secretary general over the comment again, asking if he said it or not, and whether he will speak to the journalist who tweeted the remark if it is not true.
“If I said it I apologise for that and that was not meant to be offensive in any way,” he said, adding again that he did not have “any recollection” of what he said 45 minutes previous.
Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said she did not want to labour the point, but added that the remark “didn’t get this meeting off to a good start”.

Today’s meeting got off to a bumpy start today, after members were only told last night that the Chief Procurement Officer Paul Quinn would not be appearing before them.
Quinn was due to face questioning over his role and oversight of the National Children#’s Hospital  (NCH). He sat on the hospital board, though Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has stated that he did so on a personal capacity.

This has been widely disputed by the opposition, who state that a department circular states that Quinn was obliged to report back to his line minister about any concerns relating to the project.
Members of the committee were outraged today when the committee chair Sean Fleming said Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, informed him that Quinn would not be attending today.
Fleming said that Watt is the accounting officer, and therefore he is the only one accountable to the committee. He said the decision for Quinn not to attend is at Watt’s behest.
Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane said there is a level of contempt being shown to Oireachtas committees, while Fianna Fáil’s Marc McSharry said “two fingers” were being given to the committee, along with a message of “we’ll do what we want, when we want”.
He added that they were living in a “virtual dictatorship” where there is no accountability to the public about the waste of taxpayers’ money.
Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy, who originally sought the attendance of Quinn, said that it is entirely within the committee’s remit to question processes and the failure of processes, in this case, the NCH.
Fleming said, that as far as he can recall, there has never been an incidence of an official refusing to attend the committee, who added that he felt it was disrespectful that the committee only heard last night that Quinn would not be attending.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tunisia-health-minister-4533090-Mar2019/,"
TUNISIA’S HEALTH MINISTER has resigned after the sudden deaths of 11 newborn babies at a state maternity hospital sparked an outcry in the country, the government said.
Prime Minister Youssef Chahed accepted Abderraouf Cherif’s resignation, the premier’s office said on Facebook late last night.
“Those responsible for any negligence will face legal proceedings,” the prime minister said at the maternity hospital in the capital late Saturday, according to a video released by his office.
Leading newspaper Essafa today cried foul and compared the deaths of the babies to a “state crime”.
A medical association said the sudden deaths could have been caused by a food product that had gone bad.
The babies died on Thursday and Friday at the Rabta clinic in Tunis, which is part of a large medical centre in the capital.

Since then authorities have launched several investigations, including medical and hygiene checks by the health ministry, which was also probing the management of the hospital pharmacy.
Prosecutors said they had opened a judicial inquiry into the deaths.
The Tunisian pediatrics society wrote in a statement on Facebook that “elements of the ongoing investigation” pointed to an infection caused by a food product given by gastric tube.
The association called on the authorities to “shed light” on the situation and recalled the “precarious conditions in which health professionals work”.
The health ministry said in a statement that “preventive measures and treatment have been taken to avoid other victims and to ensure the health of other babies in the maternity ward”.
The independent Tunisian Forum of Economic and Social Rights had called on the health minister to resign over the deaths.
The public health system, once a source of pride in Tunisia, has been hit by management and financial problems that lowered standards and caused drug shortages.

“It feels clearly the only choice to make,” the show’s executive producer James L Brooks told The Wall Street Journal.

The decision comes after RTÉ yesterday confirmed that it won’t be adding Jackson to its playlists in order not to offend listeners.

RTÉ 1 presenter Ryan Tubridy had already said that hedoes not intend on playingJackson’s music on his show going forward.
New Zealand’s public broadcaster RNZ will not be playlisting Jackson, and the Canadian stations CKOI, Rythme and The Beat are following suit.
The BBC, however,denied claimsthat it had “banned” Jackson’s music.
Allegations about the late singer havesurfaced in the documentary Leaving Neverland, where two men, Wade Robson (36) and James Safechuck (41), outline the abuse they say they were subjected to.
The four-hour film was directed by British man Dan Reed, and the first part aired on Channel 4 on Wednesday. The second part aired last night.
Both Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson abused them, gaining their families’ trust and manipulating them into keeping their sexual relations secret.

A FAR-RIGHT Australian senator had to be restrained by security officials after punching a young man who egged him over comments he made about the terror attack in New Zealand.
Queensland Senator Fraser Anning drew international condemnation for blaming the mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques on immigration.
Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured in the attack yesterday.
Australian-born Brenton Tarrant (28) filmed himself carrying out the horrific attack. He made awhite power gestureas he appeared in court today charged with murder.
An unnamed young man threw an egg at Anning during a press conference in Melbourne today, prompting the senator to hit him in the face before being stopped by what appeared to be a security guard.
In a statement issued yesterday, Anning said the terror attack was the result of Muslim immigration into New Zealand.

“As always, left-wing politicians and the media will rush to claim that the causes of today’s shootings lie with gun laws or those who hold nationalist views, but this is all cliched nonsense,” Anning said.
He added that “the real cause of bloodshed” is the country’s immigration programme.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described Anning’s comments as “disgusting” and announced that a bipartisan motion of censure would be launched.
“Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian parliament,” Morrison said.
Anning was elected in 2017 by a fluke of Australia’s proportional voting system, having received only 19 first preference votes. He is unlikely to be reelected when Australians go to the polls in a vote expected this May.
Anonline petitioncalling for Anning’s expulsion from parliament had received more than 400,000 signatures at the time of publication.

https://www.the42.ie/joe-schmidt-ireland-wales-tick-it-off-4536215-Mar2019/,"IT’S FAIR TO say that the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, formerly known as the Millennium Stadium, hasn’t been the happiest of hunting grounds for Joe Schmidt in his time with Ireland.
Ireland have lost both of their Six Nations games against Wales in the city centre venue since Schmidt took over in 2013, coming up short on a 23-16 scoreline in 2015 and then being beaten 22-9 two years ago.
Ireland were beaten in Cardiff in 2017.Dan Sheridan / INPHODan Sheridan / INPHO / INPHO
There was a victory over the Welsh in Cardiff in a 2015 World Cup warm-up game, but that friendly fixture certainly won’t be among Schmidt’s fond memories when he departs the Ireland job later this year.
In fact, perhaps Schmidt’s most painful day as Ireland boss came at the Principality Stadium, where Ireland exited the 2015 World Cup at the hands of Argentina.
So, as Schmidt faces into his final Six Nations game as Ireland head coach, it feels like he has unfinished business to account for on Saturday against Warren Gatland’s side in Cardiff.
‘Yeah, it would be nice to tick it off,” said Schmidt. “It’s not so much the venue, I know that the home crowd get right behind the Welsh team there. I also know that we’ll have lots of travelling support and that they’ll be very vocal so we look forward to getting that support.

“I know last year that we kind of had a performance that was very up and down against Wales [in Dublin]. When it was up, I thought it was super and when it was down they get some tries that were frustrating and were well earned by them but it was frustrating in that we didn’t cut them off.”
The Welsh, of course, are bidding for a Grand Slam on Saturday in Cardiff, where the atmosphere is guaranteed to be wild.
Among the positive omens ahead of this game is the fact that Ireland have never lost the final game of a Six Nations under Schmidt, tending to finish their campaigns strongly.
And there is real belief in the squad that the same will apply again on Saturday after Ireland’s comprehensive performance against France last weekend, even if the closing minutes were frustrating.

“That was certainly our most dominant first 40, probably 50, minutes until Keith [Earls] got the try, even though I know there were some missed opportunities. Some of them were incredibly narrow – Cian [Healy] and Garry [Ringrose] particularly – but at the same time, the fact that as soon as they got a little bit of breathing space, they were back under real pressure.
“To do that is pretty difficult when you’re playing the quality of player they have so that was certainly right up there in terms of Six Nations games that we’ve played here.
“I don’t think 50 minutes will win in Cardiff, full stop. I think you’ve got to put 80 minutes together in Cardiff. We have to extend that high-performance period right through the game.”
While it seems highly unlikely that England will lose to Scotland on Saturday, which would open the door for Ireland to win the championship, a victory in Cardiff would see Schmidt’s men finish second in the table – handing England the title if they beat Scotland.

It would be a fine return for Ireland given that the World Cup is the clear priority this year, and given that Schmidt – due to injuries and a few selection decisions – has been able to test his squad’s depth a little further in recent weeks.
“It’s never where you want it to be, you always want to have more depth,” said Schmidt.  “One of the things I said on Thursday was, you have to take three hookers to the World Cup.
“You have to have four hookers. As soon as you have four and one gets injured, you are already one short. You want to actually have five hookers, three tighthead props and three loosehead props.
“You want to make sure you are, at least, double injury covered. At the start of the Championship, we picked five second rows and one we didn’t pick [Quinn Roux] started and called the lineout in two of the first three games.
“That’s how quickly it can spin. Therefore, you’d always like to have a little more than you’ve got. We’d like to have a few more points in the championship than we’ve got.
“I wouldn’t say I’m greedy, but you can’t be successful if you’re not greedy for that depth and those points. Hopefully, we can go and get some points this week. But we know how tough it is going to be.”

Nine games to go. There are just nine more games remaining in this year’s intriguing, pulsating title race.
Pep Guardiola’s men can stretch their lead at the top of the table to four points with a win against Watford today, applying pressure on Liverpool who take on Burnley at Anfield tomorrow.
There has been a decisive swing in the race for the title over the last month, with Jurgen Klopp’s side dropping points to all of Leicester, West Ham, Manchester United and Everton since the end of January giving City a one-point advantage.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-barnier-backstop-deal-4524009-Mar2019/,"FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has set out plans to overhaul the EU in following the UK’s decision to leave the bloc.
In an opinion piece published inThe Guardianand 27 other newspapers, Macron outlined his vision for Europe’s future, urging reform of its passport-free Schengen area and setting up a new agency “for the protection of democracies” against cyber-attacks and fake news.
It comes just weeks before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.
“Never since the Second World War has Europe been so necessary. And yet never has Europe been in such a danger,” Macron wrote.
In January, Macron had suggested that the Brexit campaign – which saw Britain vote to leave the EU – was “manipulated from the exterior by a lot of what we call fake news”.
Writing in his opinion piece, Macron said: “Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoples’ need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world. It also symbolises the European trap. The trap lies not in being part of the European Union; the trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it.
Macron, who has made no secret of his plans to form a centrist, pro-Europe alliance to stave off populist and nationalist movements which have been gaining ground across the continent, also suggested reforming the 26-member Schengen area which allows free movement between members.
All those who want to belong to Schengen should accept both stricter controls on outer borders and a common asylum policy for migrants, he said.
He also suggested Europe should also share a common border force, along with a joint office for dealing with asylum demands.
Crunch talks
Macron’s letter comes as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is to meet with Britain negotiating team for further talks on the Irish backstop, as the clock continues to tick down the divorce deadline.
The meeting comes after Barniersaid on Saturdaythat the EU is prepared to give Britain further Brexit guarantees to help a divorce deal through the British parliament.

Barnier also suggested European leaders would be open to a short “technical” delay in Britain’s departure from the EU, scheduled for 29 March, to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final deal.

The British parliament rejected the original Brexit deal hammered out by Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders.
His statement has raised some hope that both sides can finally reach a solution, including the Irish backstop -the biggest obstacle to agreement in parliament.
In his comments, Barnier said there was “misunderstanding” over the proposed backstop deal.
“Limiting it in time or introducing a unilateral exit clause would call into question its credibility,” Barnier said.
The backstop “will end either when we have a global agreement on the future relationship, or a specific agreement with Ireland,” he said, assuring it “was never the wish” to bind Britain to European trade rules indefinitely.
Barnier is today due to meet with Britain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit minister Stephen Barclay for talks at 4pm today.
“We’re now at a particularly critical stage in these negotiations,” a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May said yesterday.

‘Running the show’
Cox’s presence today is seen as central to the meeting. This is because he will ultimately offer a legal opinion on the Brexit deal and the backstop that could determine whether key MPs in the UK parliament will approve the accord.
Earlier disfavourable advice by Cox was viewed as a contributing factor in the defeat of May’s deal by MPs in January.
“Cox is running the show,” a senior EU source told AFP.
Despite the defeat in January, EU leaders have continuously insisted that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Talks in Brussels are focused on drafting a separate document to calm doubters in London.
Also raising hopes are the softening positions of several hardline Brexit supports in May’s Conservative party who have dropped their remand that changes to the backstop be made to the withdrawal treaty itself.
However, most of them are continuing to push for a time limit or exit clause to the backstop, and have set up a team of lawyers to scrutinise anything that Cox brings back from Brussels.

At around 10pm last night, a man was assaulted by a gang of six masked men.  It is believed they used bats and hammers during this assault.  This incident was confined to the front door area of the flat.
He was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries, which are not believed to be life threatening.

The second incident occurred at 2am when two masked men armed with what is believed to be hammers, entered a house in Bawnmore Park and assaulted a man as he lay in his bed.
The two incidents are not believed to be linked.
The District Commander for Antrim & Newtownabbey, Superintendent Sue Steen, said
“We are currently treating both these incidents as paramilitary style attacks.
“These two brutal assaults left both victims with a number of injuries requiring hospital treatment.  A person’s home should be a place where they feel safe, not a place where thugs feel they can freely enter and reign their terror down on their victims. There is no place for this vicious behaviour in a civilised society.  “

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-armed-unit-cavan-4525095-Mar2019/,"AN ARMED SUPPORT unit will shortly be operational along the border regions, under new plans being rolled out by the Garda Commissioner, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
The Taoiseach was asked about the new unit being set up in light of Brexit, and the possibility of a no-deal.
The Irish Independent reports today that there are plans to deploy armed support units on a round-the-clock basis to deal with the possible Brexit fallout.
However, Varadkar said the additional garda unit would be “happening Brexit or no Brexit”, adding that additional resources are being ramped up nationwide.
Earlier this year, Garda Commissioner Drew Harrisdismissed a reportthat he had discussed a proposal to move 600 gardaí to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Varadkar confirmed today that a third unit is to be located in Cavan.
He said it is being set up following joint work between PSNI and the Gardaí, which finds that 43% of organised crime has a cross-border aspect.
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett asked the Taoiseach if it is just coincidence that a new unit is being established near the border.
“The position is we are improving garda resources all over the country,” stating that it should be a surprise to no one that the norther regions would also receive additional resources.
Responding to the news, James Morrisroe, GRA representative for the Cavan Monaghan Division stated:
“At the GRA conference as far back as 2016 delegates based in the border divisions called for the lack of 24 hr Armed support units in those divisions to be addressed immediately and indeed at the GRA conference in 2018 we called for an effective geographical spread of such units in the border region.
“One would hope that the armed unit in Cavan is set up without delay and training commenced as soon as possible given the current Brexit impasse.”
Previously, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said that in the circumstances of a no-deal Brexit, hard conversations with the European Commission about the border would have to take place.
No discussions about the border
Speaking to reporters today, he said those discussions with the EC haven’t taken place yet, adding that those discussions won’t be happening until a no-deal becomes a certainty.

“If Britain crashes out in an unmanaged way, I think Britain too has said that there will need to be a serious negotiations about how to avoid physical infrastructure on the border and retain peace on the island,” he added.

Varadkar later said in the Dáil that in a no-deal, discussions would be needed with the European Commission on how to maintain open borders and protect the single market.
“People talk about alternative arrangements but the only thing written down that works in law and reality is what’s contained in the backstop,” he said.
Contingency planning continues
The Cabinet today received a further update on the contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit scenario.
Coveney said the government is committed to maintaining the Common Travel Area, and today it finalised the remaining domestic decisions necessary to conclude the Common Travel Area arrangements.
He added that the Irish government is now ready to sign a full memorandum with UK to safeguard all elements of the CTA.
Updates were also provided around preparations for ports and airports, with the Tánaiste stating that work on temporary infrastructure at Dublin and Rosslare ports is well underway.
By the end of March, Revenue will have over 400 additional staff trained and in place, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have over 200 additional staff trained and in place.
The Department of Health will have at least 59 additional staff trained and in place
“Everyone is looking to next week where a vote will be held in Westminster and a deal will be ratified.
“Worst-case scenario of a crash-out Brexit, we will do everything we can to support Irish people and the economy,” said Coveney.
He added that some of the EC-based no-deal preparations progressed today. This includes a six-month grace period for airlines being put in place in the case of a no-deal scenario, which will allow airline owners make any necessary changes to its shareholder arrangements.

https://www.thejournal.ie/short-term-lets-2-4555639-Mar2019/,"AN IRISH HOSPITALITY firm has failed in its appeal to allow it to run eight residential apartments as short-term lets in Dublin city without planning permission.
Irish company The Key Collections is one of the largest providers of short-term holiday rentals in the capital, operating apartments across eight complexes in the city.
Last year,it was revealed byFora.iethat Dublin City Council had served the company with warning letters in relation to its operation of eight short-term let apartments in Dublin 7.
DCC had received complaints about the company allegedly leasing eight residential properties on a short-term basis in an apartment complex, called Chancery Hall, without proper planning approval.
The eight apartments are all owned by the company Sacreto Limited. Sacreto is fully owned by Roomyield Hospitality Ltd, which trades as The Key Collections.
Sacreto had sought permission to lease the apartments on a short-term basis last year.
The company argued that if the properties were being let on a short-term basis, “no change of use has taken place and the subject unit remains in residential use”.
The council ruled in October that they had no permission to let the apartments on a short-term basis, and that full planning permission for a change of use was needed.
The council ruled that the eight apartments were intended for private residential use and not for use as a short-term lets.
Sacreto appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanála on 24 October. ABP last week upheld the council’s decision, ruling that changing the use of the apartments to short-term lets represented a development, and so full planning permission was required.
Planning decisions
In its decision last year, DCC referenced a government memo issued to it in 2017, which said it should consider “protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand” when ruling on planning applications for short-term lets.
It also pointed to a report that noted the impact that short-term lettings have on the country’s housing market and the negative impact a high concentration of short-term lettings can have on local communities.

Among the issues raised in its appeal, Sacreto argued that no work had been carried out on the apartments, and that the use of apartments for a short stay is acceptable under zoning objectives for the area.
The planning inspector rejected these reasons. They found that the use of the building as short-term holiday accommodation raised issues which made it different from private rented apartments.
The planner concluded that the use of the building as a short-term let, rather than as a private rented apartment, constituted a “material change of use” and that this fell under Section 3 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.
In their assessment, the inspector stated:
ABP found that changing the use of the apartment constituted development and that that development was not exempt from having to apply for permission.
Short-term lets
Short-term holiday rentals have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as the number of properties available for rent in Dublin declines and rents continue to rise.
The latest Daft rental reportfound that average rents in Dublin for properties available on the website were €1,982 in Q4 of last year, up 8.8% on the same quarter in 2017.
New short-term let regulations are due to kick in on 1 June of this year, which aim to reduce the number of full properties being rented out on a short-term basis.
Key Collection currently operates eight short-term let complexes across the city. One complex – the Ellis Quay Aparthotel – is located next to Chancery Hall.
Chancery Hall is currently not listed on the Key Collection website.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie,a spokesperson for Dublin City Council said it not discuss “companies or individuals who may or may not be subject to Planning Enforcement”.
TheJournal.iecontacted Key Collection, but no response was received at the time of publication.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-business-fears-4538704-Mar2019/,"TENS OF THOUSANDS of Irish businesses have been told they haven’t registered to move goods to and from the UK after Brexit, with uncertainty continuing on what the landscape will look like once our closest neighbour eventually leaves the EU.
Although we now know it’s more likely that the UKwon’tbe leaving the EU as originally set out on 29 March, this persistent uncertainty has forced many companies to trigger expensive contingency plans, business groups say.
The no-deal tariff planspublished by the British government was just the latest in a string of announcements that caused alarm in Ireland earlier this week, but Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in Washington that a package of measures to support Irish businesses will be approved by Cabinet next week.
The Taoiseach told businesses that the government “has your back on Brexit” but firms have also been warned to step up their preparations with Brexit remaining a major threat for many.
EORI
An Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) is something that businesses must register for if wish to move goods to, from or through a non-EU country.
When the UK leaves the EU, businesses will need an EORI to move goods to, from or through the UK. As of the beginning of this month, however, over 60,000 businesses who may need one hadn’t got an EORI.
If the UK was to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March – which was ruled out by MPs earlier this week – it would have meant uncertainty for businesses that don’t have an EORI.
It is clear from the statistics that businesses were becoming increasingly aware of the need to step up their Brexit plans since the start of this year.
In the whole of 2018, there were 2,976 registrations for an EORI. In January and February 2019, there 2,617.
Last month, Revenue advised that there were around 100 applications per day, with applications in February up 330% on January.

And, since January, Revenue has written to around 84,000 businesses – who from its records show they recently had at least some level of trade with the UK – and encouraged them to do a Brexit impact assessment for their business.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, in responding to a parliamentary question, also released a breakdown of the amount of businesses which don’t have an EORI written to by Revenue by county.
Dublin had by far the most with over 14,000 businesses. Next was Cork with 6,183. Donegal and Galway had over 3,000 businesses contacted by Revenue.
Only Carlow, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly and Roscommon had less than 1,000 businesses without an EORI.


‘Worrying’
The Irish Small-Medium-sized Enterprise Association (Isme) has said it is “worried at the low uptake of EORI numbers”, adding that they are “very east to get”.
“There’s also low take-up of the start-to-plan vouchers, which we understand from InterTrade Ireland is in the high hundreds only,” a spokesperson said.
In a survey carried out by Isme of its members for the first quarter of this year, 68% of firms said they had not yet completed a Brexit readiness plan.
Meanwhile, customs arrangements are the biggest cause of concern for SMEs, with over 60% saying it was a major worry when the UK leaves the EU.
Business group Ibec, meanwhile, has said that no matter what Brexit scenario Ireland is ultimately faced with, it is important to have the appropriate preparations in place.
Arnold Dillon, Ibec Head of Strategic Campaigns, toldTheJournal.ie: “Brexit uncertainty has now forced many companies to trigger expensive contingency plans. Taking a ‘no deal’ cliff edge off the table is the priority, but business also needs clarity on how a ‘no deal’ outcome would be managed on the ground, from day one.
Related ReadsSky News poll shows Brexit has damaged UK's reputation for majority of Irish people
Dillon added that it was urgent that the Irish government make provisions to introduce State aid measures for businesses most impacted by Brexit.
“A ‘no deal’ Brexit would present an unprecedented economic challenge that would demand immediate state aid intervention to save businesses and protect jobs in certain sectors and business that are particularly exposed,” he said.
Leo Varadkar’s government has already signalled it would aim to secure EU backing to support businesses at risk financially.
In January, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys met with European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
“The focus of our meeting centred on the severe challenges Irish businesses, especially SMEs, would face when the United Kingdom left the European Union,” she said. “The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stood ready to act urgently to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish firms.”
The European Commission has already given State aid approval for national investment in Irish cheese producers the Carbery Group to the tune of €65 million.
“This test case demonstrates what we want to do for the food sector,” Humphreys said.
Speaking yesterday in London, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said Ireland will wish to avoid a series of “rolling cliff edges” if the UK requests a delay
“I believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges… particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability, we need to be aware of that,” he said.
Uncertainty may remain, but Irish businesses now have some time to put the necessary provisions in place while the government takes its own steps to offer support until the UK finally leaves the EU.

On sleepovers in Jackson’s home, Taj Jackson expanded on the phrase used was “shared a bed”.
Meanwhile, protesters gathered outside Channel 4 offices to protest against the documentary being aired and to show their support for the pop icon.

About the documentary
The first part of Leaving Neverland, a four-hour film by British director Dan Reed, will air tonight on Channel 4 at 9pm; the second part will air tomorrow at the same time. US cable network HBO will air it in two parts, starting Sunday.
The testimonies by the two men is reported to be quite harrowing and detailed, so much so that counseling was made available at its Sundance Film Festival premiere in January.
Both allege that Jackson wooed them: claiming he invited them into his “fairytale existence”, gained their families’ trust and manipulated them into keeping their sexual relations secret.
Reed said he tried to include “sexual detail in a very measured way, so it wasn’t done for shock value.”
“We tried to make it graphic enough to be eye-opening and for people to be confronted with what it means for a little child to be seduced and raped by an adult pedophile,” Reed told AFP.
“Of course it’s shocking. It’s a very serious crime. And it shouldn’t be glossed over.”
It’s not the first public airing of abuse claims against Jackson but the release marks the scandal’s first major explosion since his fatal overdose at age 50, almost 10 years ago.

THOUSANDS OF SECOND-level students swapped the classroom for the streets today as they engaged in strikes to demonstrate against government inaction on climate change.
The marches in Dublin and Cork this afternoon form part of a global movement initiated by 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, who began protesting outside Swedish Parliament last August.
There are over 1,000 similar marches taking place worldwide today.

Minister Richard Bruton admitted late last year that the country is “far off course” and “way off target”, and it required a “huge step up” from government is required if Ireland is to play its part in cutting emissions.

The movement has been supported by a number of organisations and political parties.
An Taisce’s climate change committee spokesperson said: “Today’s children and teenagers are the young voters of tomorrow, and they will, in their tens of thousands, sweep politicians from power who continue to bend the knees to vested interests and look the other way as environmental destruction continues unchecked.”

Siptu also backed the strike, with its head of equality and policy Marie Sherlock saying it’s “tremendous to witness the rise of a grassroots movement of young people” working to ensure effective action is taken on climate change.
Commenting on today’s protests, Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley said: “here needs to be many different polices put in place to create the change we need to protect our environment and protect future generations.

The students also received the backing of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
He told the Dáil earlier this month: “The fact that young people are taking action, protesting and are going to strike and take a break from school on 15 March is good.
“They are children, pupils and students telling all the adults in all parties to get our act together and to do more about climate change because it is their future that is in jeopardy.”

https://www.the42.ie/katie-taylor-35-4546033-Mar2019/,"Gavan Casey reports from Liacouras Center, Philadelphia
KATIE TAYLOR has become the first-ever Irish fighter in the four-belt era to hold three major titles simultaneously after stopping Rose Volante in the ninth round of a career-toughest test in Philadelphia.
In a gruelling affair, Taylor took her fair share of punishment — particularly early doors — before turning the screw and battering the teak-tough ‘Queen Rose’ into submission.
Volante, who during Thursday’s staredown warned Taylor, ‘I’m here’, wasn’t lying. She played her part in a thrilling exhibition of boxing before being spared by referee Benjy Estevez after nine rounds of physical torture, her face bloodied and bruised by the scintillating Irish icon.

Taylor entered the ring to a mash-up of James Brown’s ‘It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World’ and U2′s ‘Vertigo’, and would later inflict upon Volante a sensation of spinning dizziness as well as a first career defeat.
But it was Volante who began with the intention of delivering some pain, marching Taylor backwards and landing a couple of noteworthy overhand rights.
Taylor then buzzed the Brazilian with a right of her own before detonating her first proper combination and catching Volante on the top of her head with the left forearm, decking the 36-year-old with about a minute to go in the first.
Volante, though, beat the count handily and saw out the round with minimal fuss.

They exchanged big right hands to start the second, Volante’s the more thudding and budging Taylor backwards.
Taylor controlled most of the sophomore stanza with better head movement and timing, but drew gasps from a partisan crowd seconds before the bell as she lost her footing slightly and took three to the midriff for her troubles.

The Irish champion was more tentative in the third, moving with caution — mostly backwards — and getting off a nice left hook in the clinch as a riposte to fleeting Volante success.
Volante was a menace on the counter throughout and kept her chin tucked behind a tight guard.
Taylor had to get creative in order to find skin. She did, loosening up slightly in the middle rounds and finding a home for two- and three- punch combos.

Volante remained dangerous but Taylor stepped on the gas in the fifth, ripping the older woman to the body. Volante winced in pain on more than one occasion as Taylor’s left hook landed bullet-like below her rib cage, forcing the WBO champion’s right hand downwards in an instinctive bid to protect her side.
Taylor, by this stage sitting down on her punches and firing off with venom, then moved upstairs and landed a series of crisp shots, forcing the heavy-breathing Sao Paulo resident to dig deep.
Taylor eased off in quieter sixth and seventh rounds, pot-shotting those into the bank.
She exploded into action to start the eighth, however, tearing into her foe with a searing seven- or eight-shot fusillade to both decks. Volante was on the brink but stood tough, gasping for air but crucially grasping Taylor in a round-saving clinch.

Taylor again brought the hurt at the tail-end of that verse, walking the tired South American down with a four-punch assault to the head. She had seen off Volante’s best efforts and had found her own groove.
Volante, meanwhile, was beginning to throw the odd glance towards her corner, perhaps hinting that they might do her a favour.
Taylor began to blast the brave Brazilian in the final few rounds.Tom Hogan / INPHOTom Hogan / INPHO / INPHO
The stoppage was taken out of their hands soon afterwards, in the ninth. It was sudden, and Volante was probably in no more trouble than she had been a round previously, but her face was in bits. Despondent, she turned away from the action and neither she nor her corner complained when referee Benjy Esteves came to her aid.
Volante slumped onto her stool, destroyed. Taylor stood proudly at centre-ring, thumping her chest and roaring to a crowd which rose to meet her.
As the Bray woman was confirmed by MC Michael Buffer as still the holder of the IBF and WBA titles, and the new owner of the WBO strap, Volante burst into tears, hugging each member of her four-man corner for a prolonged spell each.
For the now-former champion, a worthy opponent, it’s back to the drawing board. On tonight’s evidence, she’ll win more world-title fights than she loses.
For the history-making Taylor, it’s onwards and upwards towards a clash with WBC queen Delfine Persoon for the undisputed lightweight world title, likely at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 June.","3.08am, 16 Mar 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/man-city-sex-abuse-4536129-Mar2019/,"ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE football club Manchester City has announced the launch of a redress scheme for survivors of historic child sex abuse at the club.
It comes on the back of an ongoing review commissioned by Man City into whether the club was usedby convicted child sex abuser Barry Bennellor any other individual to facilitate the alleged sexual abuse of children from 1964.
In launching the redress scheme, the club extended its “heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences that they endured”.
Bennell was sentenced to 30 years in prison for abusing 12 boys he coached between 1979 and 1991, with the judge branding him “sheer evil”.

“You were the devil incarnate. You stole their childhoods and their innocence to satisfy your own perversion,” Judge Clement Goldstone said as he read out the sentence in a court in Liverpool, northwest England in February 2018.
Bennell had been a youth team coach at Man City and Crewe Alexandra, and faced accusations he had abused boys at both teams.
The review commissioned by City also uncovered serious allegations of child sex abuse relating to another individual, John Broome.
The redress scheme will mean survivors of abuse can apply for compensation for general damages, potential loss of earnings if their careers were affected, therapy fees and legal costs,the BBC reported.
“All victims were entitled to expect full protection from the kind of harm they suffered as a result of their sexual abuse as children,” Man City said.
The club remains keen,it said, to speak to any survivor or witness to sexual abuse that may be connected to Man City in any way.

https://www.thejournal.ie/r-kelly-custody-child-support-4528136-Mar2019/,"R&B STAR R KELLY has been taken into custody again for failing to pay child support, just weeks after he was detained on sex abuse charges.
The singer was unable to come up with the $161,000 (€142,344) he owes in payments to his ex-wife and their three children.
Subsequently, a judge in Chicago, where Kelly lives, ordered him to be arrested.
This is the latest legal setback for 52-year-old Kelly.
On 25 February, he pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse against four victims, three of them minors.
Kelly’s representatives say he is having financial difficulties at the moment.
Over the past number of month, he has also been the target of a boycott campaign amid mounting allegations of sexual abuse.
Kelly was prepared yesterday to pay $50,000 to $60,000 of what he owed, according to his publicist.
However, the judge required the full amount.
“We were coming expecting that he was gonna come and make an arrangement, but they wanted the entire amount,” his publicist told reporters at the courthouse.
Kelly was “expecting to leave”, he said.
Instead, he was taken into custody and escorted from the courtroom by a police officer.
It is expected he will remain in jail until his next court hearing next Wednesday, 13 March.

“The reason he can’t pay, as you know, he hadn’t worked in a long time. He can’t book shows he can’t do anything,” Johnson said.
Kelly spent three nights in jail last month after being arrested on the criminal sex abuse charges.
He initially was unable to arrange payment of a $100,000 (€88,396) bail.
At the time, his lawyer said that Kelly’s finances were “a mess”.
‘This not me’
Hours before yesterday’s hearing, CBS aired an interview with the musician – his first public comments since being indicted last month on the sex assault charges.
During the interview, Kelly denied allegations that he sexually abused women and girls.
The sex acts in the criminal case are alleged to have occurred between May 1998 and January 2010.
CBS Evening News/ YouTube
“I didn’t do this stuff. This isn’t me,” Kelly told CBS This Morning, saying he was “fighting” for his life.
“Whether they’re old rumours, new rumours, future rumours, not true,” said Kelly.
He became upset at times during the interview.
In January, a six-part documentary called Surviving R Kelly was released. It claimed he had engaged in sexual, mental and physical abuse of girls and women.

POLICE IN THE Netherlands have arrested a suspect following a shooting in the city of Utrecht this morning, according to the Utrecht police chief.
Three people died and five people were injured in the incident.
The incident occurred on a tram at 24 Octoberplein, and the alarm was raised at 10.45am local time (9.45am Irish time).
Utrecht Police confirmed this afternoon that five people have been injured, after earlier reports than nine people had been injured.
Police have now confirmed that a man has been detained.
“We have just been informed that the suspect has been arrested,” Utrecht police chief Rob van Bree told a news conference.
The head of the Dutch national counter-terrorism service, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, confirmed “the arrest of the main suspect for the shooting”.
He said authorities had lowered the threat level in Utrecht from the maximum level five as a result of the arrest.
Police earlier released an image of a man they were searching for in connection with the incident.
“The police are asking you to look out for the 37-year-old Gokmen Tanis (born in Turkey) in connection with the incident this morning,” they tweeted.
People had been urged not to approach the man.
A square near a tram station had been cordoned off by police following the shooting.

Investigations are underway into the circumstances behind the incident.
Dutch authorities said they were still investigating a likely terrorist motive for the attack but said they “cannot exclude” other motives, including a family dispute.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the theory that it was a terror attack “could not be excluded”, vowing that the Netherlands would “never give way to intolerance”.
High alert
The Netherlands has now boosted security at airports and other key buildings in response to the incident.
“In connection with the situation in Utrecht, the Royal Military Police is on high alert at the airports and at other vital buildings in The Netherlands,” the force said on Twitter.

They said the federal police were in close contact with authorities in the Netherlands and had a description of the suspect.
In a statement, the mayor of Utrecht said his thoughts are with the victims of this attack and their loved ones.
Mayor Jan van Zanen said he was in close contact with police and the public prosecutor, who are working to apprehend the person responsible for the shooting.
Transport authorities suspended all tram services in the city after the incident.

https://www.thejournal.ie/great-escape-veteran-jack-lyon-dies-4538451-Mar2019/,"WORLD WAR TWO veteran Jack Lyon, one of the last veterans of the famous ‘Great Escape’, has died at the age of 101.
The former RAF navigator passed away at his home in Bexhill-on-Sea on Friday,according to the BBC.

Lyon was the lookout during the breakout attempt from the Stalag Luft III POW camp in 1944, which was later made into a film starring Steve McQueen in 1963.
However, the escape tunnel was uncovered before Lyon had a chance to escape the camp himself, which he said was likely to have saved his life.
50 of the 76 prisoners who escaped from the camp were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler.
“Had I got out, I probably wouldn’t be talking to you because my chances of getting home were virtually nil. I was under no illusions about that,” Lyon told the BBC on his 100th birthday in 2017.
He also described the Hollywood portrayal of events as “absolute rubbish”, saying “not one American” took part in the escape and that the motorbike used by Steve McQueen in the film “never existed”.
RAFBF chief executive Air Vice Marshal David Murray also told BBC that Lyon “belonged to a generation of servicemen” that were sadly being lost as time went on.
“His legacy and those of his brave comrades who planned and took part in the audacious Great Escape breakout, are the freedoms we enjoy today,” Murray said.
“To truly pay tribute to his memory and all this who have gone before him, we must never forget.”
