NO DEAL HAS been reached on the question of the Irish border during Brexit negotiations today.
Adeal to avoid a hard border was expected to be announcedthis afternoon. The UK was expected to concede that there would be no “regulatory divergence” on the island of Ireland in relation to the single market and customs union.
However, the DUP said it wouldn’t accept Northern Ireland having a different deal to the rest of the UK.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he is “surprised and disappointed that the British Government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier”.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has been in Brussels for scheduled meetings with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and EU president Donald Tusk.
Speaking after the meeting with May, Juncker told reporters, “We had a friendly and constructive meeting today.
He added, “We will resume negotiations later this week, I’m still confident we can make sufficient progress before the European Council on 15 December.”

Both May and Tusk echoed that agreement is still possible. In a tweet Tusk said, “I was ready to present draft EU27 guidelines tomorrow for Brexit talks on transition and future but the UK and Commission asked for more time.

The British Prime Minister said the negotiations would reconvene before the end of the week: “I am also confident we will reach an agreement”.
There is speculation that a call between May and DUP leader Arlene Foster may have contributed to the delay.

In a statement today Foster said there can’t be any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
“The Prime Minister has been clear that the UK is leaving the European Union as a whole and the territorial and economic integrity of the United Kingdom will be protected.
“We want to see a sensible Brexit where the Common Travel Area is continued, we meet our financial obligations, have a strictly time limited implementation period and where the contribution of EU migrants to our economy is recognised in a practical manner.
“The Republic of Ireland claim to be guarantors of the Belfast Agreement but they are clearly seeking to unilaterally change the Belfast Agreement without our input or consent.”

The EU had set today as the last deadline for Britain to make sufficient progress on three key Brexit divorce issues – the Irish border, its exit bill and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain – in order to move on to trade talks at a summit next week.
Speaking this evening Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said, “We do not want a border in the Irish Sea anymore than we want a border between Newry and Dundalk or Letterkenny and Derry.”

He said that earlier today the Irish negotiating team received confirmation from the British government that “the UK had agreed a text on the border that met our concerns”.
He said he confirmed Ireland’s agreement to that text to both Juncker and Tusk.
“I accept that the Prime Minister has requested more time. I know that she faces many challenges and I acknowledge that she is negotiating in good faith.

Taoiseach says he thinks it's important we listen to the DUP - but it's important to bear in mind they are just one party in Northern Ireland.
“Ireland wants to proceed to phase two, it’s very much in our interests to do so. However we cannot agree to do this unless we have firm guarantees that there will not be a hard border in Ireland under any circumstances.”
He said it wasn’t easy to come to the agreement they came to today and that he doesn’t see “any reason to change the text”.
The Taoiseach also said that Jean-Claude Juncker confirmed to him that “Ireland’s position is Europe’s position” on the issue.
Varadkar’s statement on the Brexit negotiations was due to take place at 2.30pm this afternoon but was postponed until this evening when no deal was reached.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ian-paisley-jr-telegraph-defamatory-3587636-Sep2017/,"NORTH ANTRIM DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr is to refer himself to the standards office for MPs in Westminster following a newspaper article which he claims is defamatory.
The Daily Telegraph published a story based on documents which it said showed that the MP did not declare gifts received from the government of Sri Lanka.
Paisley said that the article is “devoid of fact or logic” and that he has referred it to his lawyer.
The article also says that Paisley recently met Sri Lankan officials to discuss possible post-Brexit trade deals with the country.
The newspaper claims that the gifts were never disclosed in the House of Commons register of interests.

However, in a Twitter post last night, Paisley said that he will refer himself the Parliamentary Commissioner of Standards Office.
The Commissioner oversees the operation of the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, amongst other registers.
The financial register exists for MPs to declare income, gifts or affiliations that could be viewed as a potential conflict of interest.

https://www.thejournal.ie/juncker-ireland-3901318-Mar2018/,"THE PRESIDENT OF the European Commission has said that there should be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland that the Good Friday Agreement should be “preserved in all its dimensions” following Brexit.
Speaking this morning in the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker said that the European Union stood “firm and united” when it came to Ireland.
The border between Northern Ireland and the south has become one of the key issues of Brexit, with both the UK and the EU professing that they do not want a return to a hard border.
Despite this, the UK has been unable to come up with concrete proposals that would manage to help avoid this outcome after they leave the EU.
Speaking today, Juncker said that just a year remained before the deadline for the UK to officially leave the EU, and that much still needed to be decided.

“As the clock counts down with one year to go it is now time to translate speeches into treaties,” Juncker said.
“To turn commitments into agreements. Broad suggestions and wishes on the future relationship to specific workable solutions.
Juncker said that it had already been agreed that there “should be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.
“The Good Friday Agreement must be preserved in all its dimensions and life for citizens on both sides of the border should be the same as it is today,” he said.
He said that there were options on the table to do this and that these needed to be worked through.
“The European Union, the south, the 27 member states stand firm and united when it comes to Ireland,” Juncker said.
Last weekat a joint press conference with Leo Varadkar, the president of the European Council Donald Tusk said that he had spoken to all 27 EU leaders and each one told him their priorities regarding Brexit are “protecting the peace process and avoiding the hard border”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/post-brexit-border-unique-solution-3646765-Oct2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR says that Ireland and Northern Ireland could have a “unique” solution in the result of a hard Brexit.
Speaking to a group of business leaders in Derry last night, the Taoiseach said that the issue of the border continues to be a vexing one, but says that a solution is needed.
Earlier this week, Varadkar was accused by Fianna Fáil’s Micheal Martin of suppressinga Revenue report that details the effectsof Brexit on trade with the UK.

The report was drafted before the Brexit referendum and finds that an open customs border would be impossible from a customs perspective, and would lead to a vast increase in workloads at ports and airports.
“We…hope that the ultimate outcome of the negotiations will be the closest possible trade and customs relationship between the UK and the EU.
“So, if this is ultimately not attainable, then we will seek a unique solution for Northern Ireland, reflecting its unique history and geography.
“From Berlin to Brussels, they understand that Northern Ireland is unique, that the peace is young and still fragile, and are willing to make exceptions for Northern Ireland that would not be made for others.
Varadkar has previously stated Ireland will not be helping the UK devise a border that “we don’t want”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-border-3718681-Nov2017/,"A UK LABOUR MP has said that Ireland would have to pay for any hard border infrastructure between the north and south of the island, and that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if Ireland left the EU in the next few years.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 this morning about Brexit and the current impasse over border solutions for the north and south of Ireland, Kate Hoey said that Ireland needed to be more positive about Brexit.
She was taking issue with the Irish government position that a practical solution around how a physical border (or lack of border) needed to be reached before the Brexit talks could progress to the next stage.
Ireland and the EU want further clarification and assurances from the UK over the border issue, before tense negotiations progress to issues of trade. The UK, meanwhile, wants to move onto trade matters, saying that border solutions will be ironed out in this process.
Hoey said that the negotiations had “seen a lot of negativity from the Irish government”.
“Putting up barriers when perhaps they aren’t there. And you’re wondering why they’re actually doing that when actually it is in their interest to make this work,” she said.
Hoey said that there was “absolutely no way” that the UK would leave the EU but somehow keep Northern Ireland separate.
“So, obviously we want to not have a hard border,” she said.
She said that she “resented the idea” that Brexit would threaten the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Threatened
Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond also spoke on the programme. He said that both the gardaí and the PSNI have warned that the peace process in Northern Ireland is under threat from loyalist and republican paramilitary groups.
“To flippantly say there is no threat. There is a threat. Both the PSNI and An Garda Síochána have said there is viable paramilitary threat to the peace process,” he said.

Hoey again called for Ireland to “be more positive” and said that the UK would not be paying for any hard border.
“We’re not the ones who are going to be putting up the physical border. At the end if this ends up with a no deal we won’t be putting up the border, they’ll have to pay for it,” she said.
Hoey went on to say that there was “a lot of politics going on” on the Irish side and that Fine Gael were “worried about Sinn Féin”. Richmond flatly rejected this.
She also said that Ireland would consider leaving the EU in a few years after the country sees how successful the UK has been.
Greater clarity
Speaking this morning on RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that Ireland has been asking for more clarity around the parameters by which the UK plans to solve the border issues.
He acknowledged that some of this will be dealt with in phase two.
He said it is “not credible” for the UK to say there will be a frictionless border, and maintain they will leave the Customs Union and the single market, and not give any assurances of regulatory divergence.
If there are diverging regulations both north and south of the border, there will have to be customs checks, he said.
Coveney said if there are diverging regulatory regimes in areas such as agriculture, environment and so many other areas, it would be “impossible” to avoid a checking system and “some sort of a hard border”.
The minister said it is not unreasonable for Ireland to seek such clarity. He said he met with Michel Barnier, as well as Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday, and Coveney was told they fully support Ireland’s position.
On the issue of the veto, he said Ireland does not need to use it as Ireland has the full support of all the other member states.
“We will not be moving on to phase two in December” if the border issue is not addressed, said the minister.

On Thursday, President of the European Council Donald Tusk reaffirmed the EU’s support for Ireland’s position on Brexit.
Speaking in Dublin alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tusk said: “The EU stands by Ireland. This is a matter between the EU 27 and the UK, not Ireland and the UK.”
The future of the Irish border post-Brexit was always going to be a central plank of negotiations but it has only really becomethedominant sticking point since late last year.
In December, a deal between the EU and the UK agreed that UK would maintain regulatory alignment with the EU’s customs union if the UK could not come up with a solution for Northern Ireland that avoided a hard border.
The commitment was seen as a major win for the Irish government which had placed avoiding a hard border as its major priority.
But the Irish government’s stance has been criticised by some with the DUP labelling it as “cynical, aggressive and green”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-customs-3503409-Jul2017/,"WHAT WILL BREXIT mean to your pocket? That was one of the questions addressed at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Donegal this morning.
Speaking to a packed room, Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty said it will ultimately result in everyone paying custom tax with VAT on top of that.
There are people behind the hundreds of discussions about Brexit, he reminded the audience.
“Let’s not forgot that behind all this data around cross-border trade, there are real people, real jobs, real wages and real livelihoods at risk. It’s trade by which it’s estimated some 200,000 people are employed directly and depend upon,” he said.
Tax implications
Should the “Tory/DUP vision for Brexit” come to pass, we will have to contend with customs obligations, said Doherty.
During the recession, countless shoppers drove north of the border to avail of cheaper prices.
That will be a story of the past, with Paul MacFlynn, Senior Economist at the Nevin Economic Research Institute, stating that the absence of tariffs on goods cannot be underestimated.
MacFlynn said exiting the customs union would be detrimental to people north and south of the border, adding that the UK and Europe must agree to frictionless customs arrangements to facilitate trade across the border.

Custom posts
Doherty said customs posts along the border could become a reality, but he welcomed Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney’s recent intervention.
This week, the minister ruled out theuse of electronic tagging alongthe border after Brexit.

Seats at Westminster
The discussion soon turned to the influence that Sinn Féin could have on Brexit from Westminster, with one audience member asking Doherty why his party was sticking to its abstentionist policy.
She understood it would be difficult, but put forward the idea that Sinn Féin MPs could take their seats in London “just this once”.
To take seats in Westminster, successful Irish MPs would have to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen. Because of this, elected Sinn Féin MPs do not take their parliament seats.
Since the UK election, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams has staunchly defended his party’s abstentionist policy.
Doherty said Sinn Féin was using its influence on matters relating to Brexit.
He said some people would like to see Sinn Féin MPs pledge allegiance to the Queen – but they won’t be doing that.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-post-brexit-relationship-3880887-Mar2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will today outline what she wants to see from the future economic partnership between the UK and EU post-Brexit.
She will set out five tests that will guide the UK throughout the negotiations, and will pledge to deliver the real change the country voted for in June 2016, while also stating that she aims to protect jobs and security
In a much-anticipated major speech, just weeks before trade talks with the European Union are due to begin, May will set out that she wants the “broadest and deepest possible agreement”, aiming to cover more sectors and co-operating more fully than any free trade agreement anywhere in the world today.
She will say this is “achievable” and in the interests of the EU and Britain because of how closely they are currently aligned.
EU leaders have been pressing the prime minister to clarify what she wants before they agree their position on the future economic partnership at a summit later this month.
Brussels raised the pressure this week with a draft treaty suggesting Northern Ireland could stay in a customs union with the EU while the rest of Britain remained outside.
The proposal was offered as a fall-back option if London failed to come up with a better solution to avoid new customs checks between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, where some fear a hard border could upset the peace process.
But it prompted outrage in Westminster, where May warned it threatened the integrity of her country and was something that “no UK prime minister could ever agree to”.
‘Strengthening the union’
In her speech, which has been relocated to the London’s Mansion House due to the severe weather sweeping Britain, May will stress that any Brexit deal “must strengthen our union of nations”.
She is expected to return to the words she delivered on the steps of 10 Downing Street in July 2016, when she pledged to “forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world and…make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us”.
She is also expected to say:
May is also expected to say that any new agreement reached with the EU must endure.
“After Brexit both the UK and the EU want to forge ahead with building a better future for our people, not find ourselves back at the negotiating table because things have broken down,”she will say.
The UK prime minister will also state that while the UK will have a different relationship with Europe, “shared goals” will remain the same.

She is also expected to say:
The speech, which is titled “Our Future Partnership”, will set out an ambitious but credible vision for the future and say the UK and EU have a ‘shared interest’ in getting this right.
May says Britain will leave the EU’s single market and customs union after Brexit, in a bid to end mass migration and ensure it no longer has to follow the bloc’s rules.
No severing of ties but keeping the benefits
The EU leaders has warned Britain cannot expect to sever formal ties with its closest trading partner and still reap the same benefits.
EU President Donald Tusk repeated this yesterday when he also visited May in Downing Street, saying: “There can be no frictionless trade outside of the customs union and the single market.”
British eurosceptics warn that staying within those institutions is akin to not leaving the EU at all.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested this week that the row over Northern Ireland’s status was a political ploy to force the government into changing course.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading eurosceptic lawmaker in May’s Conservative party, has said there were “technological solutions” to avoiding a hard Irish border.
He said that for Britain to stay in a customs union, forced to follow EU rules while losing its seat at the table as an EU member, would be “fatal for Brexit”.
However, the main opposition Labour party on Monday came out in favour of the idea, which is already backed by the main business lobby groups.
Their change in stance raises the stakes in parliament, which will vote on the final exit deal and where May has only a slim majority.
Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer critcised May’s speech before she had even delivered it.
“What we need are concrete proposals… her ‘red lines but no plan’ strategy has run out of road,” he tweeted last night.
Former prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair this week publicly criticised the government’s hopes of continued frictionless trade outside EU institutions.
“It’s not a question of a tough negotiation or a weak negotiation, it literally is not going to happen,” Blair told BBC radio.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-frances-fitzgerald-highs-and-lows-3769098-Dec2017/,"AS MANY OF us tend to do at this time of year, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is reflecting on his high and low points of 2017.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, he’s said that the resignation of his close colleague Frances Fitzgerald from her position as Tánaiste and Minister for Business as the low point of his year.
“She is a good woman who has done a lot for this country,” he told The Sunday Independent.
Fitzgerald resigned in November of this year after coming under increased pressure over revelations relating to the Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe saga. Fitzgerald was accused of doing nothing about the legal strategy taken against McCabe by the then-Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan during Fitzgerald’s time as Minister for Justice.
Fitzgerald has maintained that she was advised against taking action, and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, as well as other Ministers including Simon Coveney, Eoghan Murphy and Simon Harris have all defended Fitzgerald’s actions (or inaction).
Varadkar also told The Sunday Independent that his high point of the year was striking a last-minute deal during Brexit negotiations over the future of the border on the island of Ireland.
“It was probably the positive outcome of the first phase in the Brexit negotiations. it was a good result for Ireland but we have more to do in the new year ahead to secure it.”

Although the deal was hailed as a major victory for Varadkar and his new Tánaiste Coveney, relations became tense after the deal was announced – with the UK government claiming that the deal wasn’t legally binding, comments which both Varadkar and Coveney dismissed.

Varadkar was taking part in the newspaper’s annual Living Christmas party, which invites a number of celebrities to reflect and review the year they’ve had.
Among those who were present were RTÉ’s presenters Joe Duffy and Marty Whelan, former Miss World Rosanna Davison, Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham, singer Frances Black, Met Éireann’s Nuala Carey, and Minister of State Mary Mitchell-O’Connor.
Some of the guests were asked about how Varadkar is faring in the premier role so far – many answered to praise his handling of the Brexit negotiations, but said more work needed to be done to alleviate the housing crisis and help the homeless.
“The very ‘Good Friday’ Brexit agreement on 8 December projected a very powerful image worldwide of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste towering over their hapless British counterparts,” Joe Duffy said. “A good day’s work for Ireland. Sock it to them.”
While Frances Black, who’s an independent senator, agreed on his performance during Brexit negotiations, she said that “he needs to do more on the homelessness issue.”
When asked to review other aspects of the year, Varadkar said that Harvey Weinstein was the “villain” of 2017; and said that he does miss TV3 presenter Vincent Browne, who retired from his television show this year. “He’s irreplaceable,” he said.

JEREMY CORBYN LAMBASTED Theresa May over the collapse of Brexit negotiations as the British Prime Minister took questions in the Commons this afternoon.
The Labour leader, at one point, referred to May and her ministers as a “bunch of jellyfish masquerading as a cabinet,” paraphrasing a line of criticism this weekfrom a well-known Tory donor.
Corbyn failed to deliver any killer blows, however. May gave assurances that all sides were still talking to each other, and that progress had been made. She conceded at one point (to laughs) that there were “still a couple of things we are negotiating on”.
May finally spoke to the DUP’s Arlene Foster today too – the pair spoke by phone in advance of Prime Minister’s Questions. There were no major breakthroughs during the call, however.

Question time
May insisted that current Brexit discussions were focusing on maintaining continued cross-border trade while ensuring the constitutional integrity of the UK.
“We will ensure that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,” she said.
“We will do that while we respect the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and we will be able to do that while we respect the internal market of the United Kingdom.”
After shouts of “how” erupted from the opposition benches, May replied that that was the entire point of phase two of the talks.

How did we get here?
The DUP pulled the plug on a deal that would allow EU-UK talks to move onto the next phase, focusing on trade, on Monday after reports emerged that London and Dublin were ready to sign off on a deal committing to “continued regulatory alignment” between the North and the Republic.
The wording was seen as an artful fudge that would allow both sides to move on with the talks. A press conference scheduled for Government Buildings, at which a breakthrough was expected to be announced, was postponed for hours – with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar later telling reporters he was “surprised and disappointed that the British Government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier”.
Speaking at Leaders’ Questions today in the Dáil, Varadkar told Green Party leader Eamon Ryan that he would be talking to May in the coming days and would meet the Prime Minister of the Netherlands tonight.
“It is the role of the UK to come back to us … there are different views in her own party and she also has to manage the confidence and supply agreement,” he added, referring to the Conservative-DUP pact signed after this year’s UK election.
He reiterated that Ireland wanted to move on to phase two. If not possible “we can pick it up in the new year”, he added.
However Arlene Foster has said the two sides “need to look at the text, make it clear what we cannot agree with and try to work through all of that”.

Liveblog: Still no sign-off on Brexit deal as Leo stands firm that agreement standshttps://t.co/CYn4qtyjxa
The EU has said Britain must make “sufficient progress” in negotiations on the Irish border, the future status of EU citizens and a financial agreement to unlock negotiations on post-Brexit trade arrangements.
European leaders have given May a deadline of the end of this week to resolve outstanding issues in order to draft an agenda in time for a crucial EU summit next Thursday and Friday and open this second phase of talks.
‘Upcoming presidential election’
Last night, in another baffling take on Irish politics, former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith reaffirmed his opinion that Ireland’s harsh Brexit stance was due to the potential for an upcoming presidential election.
He told the BBC: “You know this Irish stuff was not at this state some months ago. Now it’s suddenly become an issue because the Irish, for political reasons internally, presidential elections, disputes between the two elements of the same party, they suddenly laid this on.”
Duncan Smith added that the UK should walk away from the Brexit negotiations if the European Union does not change its position.
“You need to change this process, and back off, or we get on with other arrangements… we would rather have the trade deal, but not at any price,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-brexit-ireland-3907435-Mar2018/,"THERE IS AS yet “no evidence” to suggest that an invisible border on the island of Ireland will be possible after Brexit, a group of MPs has warned.
The warning came from the House of Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committee which also said that the UK government “will not have the time” to implement anything substantial before the planned withdrawal date.
The planned withdrawal date is 29 March 2019 but the UK government has suggested a two-year implementation period thereafter.
The committee is made up of MPsfrom the Conservatives, Labour and the DUP.
In a report on theborder issue published today, the committee welcomed the proposal for a phased implementation period but pointed to other concerns.

Among them, the concern that no technological solution that would eliminate the need for customs posts has been presented.
“We have, however, had no visibility of any technical solutions, anywhere in the world, beyond the aspirational, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border,” the report stated.
The report went on to say that it has “seen no evidence to suggest that, right now, an invisible border is possible.”
“The government’s proposals for technical solutions represent blue sky thinking but it will not have the time to implement anything substantial before withdrawal day,” the report added.
Last month, the European Commission published a draft text of an agreement that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the EU customs union if the UK did not devise a solution for the border.
The UK government has consistently stated it is also opposed to a hard border and does not plan to erect customs posts between the North and the Republic.
Earlier this month, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected a suggested by British Prime Minister Theresa May that the US/Canada border could provide a template for the border on the island of Ireland.

“Maybe, just maybe, we should have a second referendum on EU membership. It would kill off the issue for a generation once and for all,”he said on Twitter.
Yesterday, responding to the recent suggestions that the UK should hold a second Brexit referendum, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that while it’s not up to him make any calls, it “wouldn’t be anti-democratic” for the UK to take to the polls again on the matter.
Varadkar addressed the EU parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, where he shared his visions for Europe. Hitting back at the Taoiseach’s speech, Farage branded Varadkar a “European unionist”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/paschal-donohoe-glenties-left-wing-politics-3503087-Jul2017/,"WITH THE DÁIL in recess, politicians, academics and commentators from across Irish society found themselves at a bit of a loose end this week.
With a need to still talk about the world’s big issues – and some of the smaller ones too – they ended up in the picturesque village of Glenties in Co Donegal to attend the annual MacGill Summer School.
For the past 37 years, organiser Joe Mulholland has attracted the big names – including the new Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, who spoke tonight about topics ranging from his love of U2 (in the context of Brexit, of course) to his disdain for left-wing politics.
In a speech, the Fine Gael minister strongly criticised left-wing politics, which, he said, would “break this country”.
He said that a ‘social disorder’ has prevailed since the 2008 economic collapse, and that centrist politics were now vitally important.
Letting someone else pay
“The policies of the far left – profligate spending, higher taxes on businesses, ‘let someone else pay for it’ – would all break this country,” he told the audience.
Donohoe, who said he will be attending U2′s Croke Park gig this Saturday, quoted track six of the Joshua Tree album to a packed-out room in the Highland Hotel in Glenties, Donegal, which he said illustrated his point.

Red Hill Mining Town is rarely played live, but the minister said it tells the story of the closure of the coal mines in mid-1980s Britain.

The song is steeped in a sense of abandonment, said Donohoe, who added that it is that feeling of abandonment that is now one that is familiar to many in the US and the UK who voted for Donald Trump and Brexit respectively last year.
“Because when Bono sings, ‘You’re all that’s left to hold on to’, we have to acknowledge that a growing number of voters are asking what is there to hold on to in a world moving so quickly, and who have examined and rejected the existing political and economic frameworks which many would claim have served us well.”

The minister told the crowd in Donegal that Ireland has many problems, some of which are deeply ingrained in communities.
“In politics, it is easy to blame globalisation for these problems.
“The answer as to why the populists attack trade is this: it is the attraction of simple rhetoric and simplistic answers to complex problems,” he said, adding:
Ireland is best placed to have this debate, said the minister, highlighting that as a small country, we are open to globalisation and we “reach out to the world” exporting “everything from Botox to TicTacs”.
Changes
Talking about the double whammy of the election of Trump and the Brexit vote may present challenges to Ireland’s economy, Donohoe said he remembers the day he heard about the UK’s vote to leave to European Union.
Finishing how he began, he concluded by quoting two more songs – this time, from the late, great Johnny Cash.
“Not bad advice,” concluded Donohoe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/senator-neale-richmond-ireland-should-ask-for-a-second-brexit-referendum-3526563-Aug2017/,"WHEN THE PEOPLE of the United Kingdom went to the polls last year, they were faced with one clear option and one extremely unclear option. The clear option was the status quo: The UK would remain as a member of the European Union. The second option was to leave the EU.
What exactly that meant was at that time, and indeed still is, a complete mystery. Many on the Leave side painted Utopian visions of the UK being restored as a global power with the resurgence of the Empire and the ability to be free from the shackles of European bureaucracy, that has supposedly been holding the UK back since 1973.
Unclear what Brexit will look like
A year on from the Referendum and following two rounds of detailed negotiations, it is far from clear what Brexit will look like, be it soft, hard or red white and blue. It is becoming apparent that the desires of the hard line Brexiteers will certainly not be met. The UK will have to meet its financial commitments in the form of a divorce bill and the UK will also need to compromise on a range of other areas.
In addition, the tidal wave of new trade deals has not been forthcoming. In the period that the EU has signed new trade deals with Canada and Japan, the UK has been abruptly told by countries such as Australia that any trade deal will only come after a deal with the EU is signed.
Even though Brexit has yet to actually occur, the UK’s economy has suffered with tepid growth rates according to the IMF, declines in household savings and growth while sterling is 11% down against the dollar and 18% down against the euro.
At this stage, there is only one mainstream party advocating for an exit from Brexit in the form of the traditional pro-European voices in the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister Theresa May was a reluctant Remainer as Home Secretary. Now she leads a government whose Brexit position seems to be increasingly driven by the big four Eurosceptic beasts, in the form of David Davis, Liam Fox, Michael Gove and Boris Johnston, with sensible politicians like Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond being constantly undermined.

A clear vacuum in the Brexit debate
Buoyed by a credible result in the General Election campaign, Jeremy Corbyn remains as leader of the opposition and leader of the supposedly pro-European Labour Party. This is a complex position as prior to becoming leader and prior to the referendum campaign, Jeremy Corbyn was a determined Eurosceptic.
After a terrible effort in the referendum campaign itself, Corbyn has begun to reveal his true colours advocating a hard Brexit.
Within Scotland, the SNP is more focused on running its own referendum, a second Independence Referendum. In Northern Ireland, the continuing stand-off in Stormont means Northern Ireland’s voice is solely being communicated by the pro Brexit DUP MPs currently propping up the Conservative government.
This means that there is a clear vacuum in the Brexit debate in the UK, with no one materially pushing for a second referendum or a de-triggering of Article 50. A few well-intentioned, but realistically toothless, interventions from former leading politicians simply do not have any material bearing over the debate.
A second referendum
Given the fact that just 52% of people in the UK voted to leave in the EU in the first place and given that only one outcome was ever demonstrated clearly, it would seem eminently sensible to me that following the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, before the great repeal Act is passed by the Houses of Parliament, that perhaps the people of the UK should be consulted once again in the form of a second referendum.
A second referendum campaign could be run with the electorate given two very clear options. Remain within the EU or leave based on the terms of the Brexit negotiations.It is here that I believe that Ireland, as the EU member state that will most be impacted by Brexit, could intervene in this process by proposing an amendment to the negotiation terms requiring that any deal is put before the people in the form of a referendum.
It would be a risky move but it could focus the minds of the UK government to take the negotiations a bit more seriously and if it were to come to pass it would prove a welcome opportunity for the people of the UK to have a genuine and open debate about two substantive options before voting accordingly.

THE DUP HAS accused the Irish government of ‘flexing its muscles in a reckless and dangerous way’ in relation to Brexit.
Referencing the change of Taoiseach, the party’s leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds noted that there had been a shift in the ‘tone and aggression’ being seen from Dublin, claiming it has put Anglo-Irish relations at risk.
Speaking at a press conference in London this afternoon, the MP for Belfast North called for a ‘sensible Brexit’ where the UK leaves the European Union as one nation.
Dodds told reporters that his party did not see the proposed text of the agreement until ”very late yesterday morning” and that it “did not translate” with what they were told was in it. He described it as “unacceptable” to his party.
He claimed there was “far too much ambiguity” and that it did not ‘nail down what needed to be nailed down’.
He also told the gathered media that it is the EU causing the problems of the hard border – not the DUP or the British government.
He believes there are “sensible ways” to explore the issue of the border and said he does not want talks to fail.
Conceding that there are areas where regulatory alignment makes sense on the island of Ireland, Dodds cited the single electricity market. However, he repeated the line that his party will not accept general regulatory alignment.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil this afternoonthat the government wants to move to phase two of the talks but said it must “stand firm” on its position that reassurances are needed on the border issue.
“The ball is in London’s court,” said Varadkar, adding that he is happy to give UK Prime Minister Theresa May more time.
“There is time to put this agreement back on track,” he said.
He said May is handling the “difficulties” on her end and the Irish government await to hear about the progress made.
Speaking about the DUP, Varadkar said:
“Having asked us for many months now to start engaging in options about avoiding a hard border… they’ve now decided they don’t want to have that conversation.”
He told the Dáil that Irish-British relations had been “strained” over recent years, pointing out that they were probably at their best during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Ireland.
Earlier, the Irish government defended yesterday’s deal which it saw as a way of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland following Brexit, which was scuppered when the DUP said it would not support it.
For a few hours yesterday, it appeared that a long-awaited deal was in sight.
After weeks ofstrong rhetoric from the Irish government, and criticism from UKmediaandpoliticians, it finally seemed like an agreement could be reached.
Those hopes were dashed, however, when the DUP said it would not support any such deal. The party said it would not accept any different treatment separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
That line has been repeated by the UK’s Brexit Minister David Davis today who said that no part of the UK will remain in the customs union.

The DUP’s hold
As the DUP is keeping the Conservatives in a House of Commons majority, this has put Theresa May in a very difficult position.
Irish government officials have since showed their frustration, and have defended the proposed deal. An Taoiseach Leo Varadkaryesterday expressedhis “surprise and disappointment”.
Though Theresa May is due to head back to Brussels tomorrow to try to finalise the agreement, DUP leader Arlene Foster will not be flying to London today to meet the British PM. There are plans for the pair to talk by phone.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that Ireland recognised that there were “difficult political issues to manage for the British prime minister”.
“And we want to give the time and space to try to do that,” he said.
Also speaking on Morning Ireland, Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that the proposed deal was not a “backdoor attempt to a united Ireland”.
“The document yesterday very much upheld the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement,” she said.
She said that parts of the agreement could be further clarified for the DUP, but that the Irish position would not change.
“What we’re talking about is an alignment, we’re talking about upholding the Good Friday Agreement, we’re talking about ensuring that we can continue to have free movement of people and goods north and south,” she said.
McEntee said that she could not “speak for the DUP” around how they could accept such a deal.
She said the text of the deal was “comprehensive” and that it covered many issues in relation to Northern Ireland.
Respectful
Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson, Stephen Donnelly said the substance of the deal agreed to yesterday is in interests of entire island. He said he hopes the DUP’s reaction yesterday was motivated by tone and not substance – but added that their position needs to be respected, as does their political identity.
He observed that a deal appeared to be done yesterday, however then the wording of the document was leaked to the media.
“That leak was not helpful yesterday… when the dust has settled we may need to look at how this happened… there may be more crunch points in the future,” he said, pointing out that up until that point there appeared to be an agreement on all sides.

Donnelly said his party’s meeting with the Taoiseach went well, but said the issue of whether the DUP had been squared off was not raised. It was only after their briefing did the problems appear to arise, he said.
He said the Irish government, and Fianna Fáil should be available to play any role necessary in terms of getting the DUP on side. “Now is a time for cool heads and conciliatory language,” he said, adding that there should be no back-slapping about deals being done due the sensitivity of such an issue.
Poll
With such argumentative back-and-forth between the parties involved in recent weeks, a lot of people in Ireland feel that the whole Brexit process is damaging our relationship with Britain.
In a poll forRTÉ’s Claire Byrne Liveby Ámarach Research, over two-thirds of people (66%) said they felt that the Brexit process is negatively affecting our relationship with the UK.
Just under one fifth (19%) said they didn’t feel it was damaging Anglo-Irish relations, while 13% of people said that they didn’t know.
Time is now against Theresa May’s government with further talks set to take place between the UK and the EU at the end of next week. Without a deal on the Irish border, and other issues, talks may move on without a deal which increases the possibility of a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland.

Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, by 52% to 48%.
The Liberal Democrats and some other pro-EU opposition politicians have called for a second referendum, arguing that Britons did not know the full implications of leaving the EU when they voted. But Prime Minister Theresa May has previously ruled out a second vote, saying “Brexit means Brexit”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/farage-accuses-eu-of-being-only-barrier-to-open-border-with-northern-ireland-3574414-Aug2017/,"
FOUNDER AND FORMER leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, has blamed the European Commission for the uncertain future status of Northern Ireland, claiming the commission is the “only barrier” to a frictionless border.
Farage said that while political opinion in both Ireland and the UK was unified in wanting no hard border between Ireland and the UK, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator is “putting a barrier up” to this goal by saying that customs controls are part of the EU’s management of its borders.
The comments are the latest in what has been an ongoing back and forth between the UK and Brussels about the status of the border, with EU and Irish officials often critical of Britain on the issue – because they decided to leave the EU.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar hasput the responsibilityfor resolving the border issue onto Britain. “It’s the United Kingdom, it’s Britain that has decided to leave and if they want to put forward smart solutions, technological solutions for borders of the future and all of that that’s up to them,”he said to much reaction last month.
Former Taoiseach John Bruton hasalso criticised Britainfor failing to “come forward with their own ideas” on resolving the issue.
Seamless border
The Irish government reaffirmed its commitment to a “seamless and frictionless” border, with Varadkar this week saying that he is “very confident” there will be no need for passport controls as “nobody is looking for them”.
Despite this consensus, the issue has become one of the most heated as Brexit negotiations continue, with the UK government’s position paper criticised by officials in Ireland and the EU when it was released earlier this month.

It stated that the UK planned to leave the customs union but called for a borderless trade relationship with Ireland, similar to the one already in place.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneysaid these proposalswere “totally unworkable”, while a key EU negotiator dismissed them as “fantasy”.
EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier said today that although there had been little progress in Brexit talks, discussions on the fate of  the border were “fruitful” with “substantial progress” achieved.
UK position
Farage was speaking onRTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, where he was challenged on what appears to be a weakening position by the British government in Brexit negotiations.
When asked about what appears to be a “softened” position from British Prime Minister Theresa May, as well as Labour’smajor policy shiftthat calls for a longer transition period, Farage said he thought the government had “softened significantly”.
He warned, however, of public reaction over potential outcomes of these changes.
He further criticised the EU for creating “barriers and obstructions” to the UK’s exit in a bid to make leaving the EU look less tempting to other countries: “I’m certainly concerned about the way the European union are behaving. They’re not applying any logic at all.”
In contrast, he said that the UK government is being “reasonable”.

MULTINATIONAL BANKING GIANT Bank of America has confirmed that it will set up its new EU hub in Dublin after Brexit.
The company said that it would move some roles from London to Dublin following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. It did not specify how many people it may move to, or hire in, the Irish capital.
Bank of America already employs about 700 people in Ireland.
In a statement, the firm said: “Bank of America confirms that it has chosen Dublin as the preferred location for its principal EU legal entities following the UK’s departure from the EU”.
Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chairman and CEO, said that Dublin “is the home of more of our employees than any other European city outside of the UK”.
“We already have a fully licenced and operational Irish-domiciled bank which, combined with Ireland’s strong commitment to business and economic growth, makes Dublin the natural location to consolidate our legal entities as we transition,” he said.

He added: “While we await further clarity around the Brexit negotiations, we are making all necessary preparations to serve our clients however those discussions conclude.”
Post-Brexit hubs
Many financial companies with bases in London have been looking to set up new EU subsidiaries to ensure they can continue to serve clients in case their UK bases lose the ability to easily operate with the rest of the EU post-Brexit.
Frankfurt and Paris have attracted the majority of the companies moving abroad so far, although several, such as Barclays,are still weighing a bigger presence in Dublin.
However analysts have said the Irish capitalis most likely to attract ‘middle office’ jobsfrom the major firms while their large-scale operations go to Germany and France.

NOT ONLY COULD Brexit force UK-bound travellers‘back on boats’- it poses a “unique problem” for air traffic controllers as well.
That’s according to a briefing document prepared by government officials for Transport Minister Shane Ross.
The white paper explains that Ireland and the UK share a ‘functional airspace block’ as part of an EU-ratified agreement.

That means that air traffic controllers on both sides of the Irish Sea work together to manage flights entering and leaving Irish and British airspace.
However, it is not clear yet whether Britain will continue to participate in this agreement when it leaves the EU in 2019, according to the Department of Transport note.
“Ireland has worked very closely with in the UK in relation to (air traffic management) for many years, it is hoped that this close cooperation can continue in the post-Brexit aviation market,” it said.

FABs
The UK-Ireland functional airspace block, or FAB, has been in place since 2008.
According to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), FABs are “one of the cornerstones” of the EU’s ‘Single European Sky’ that was brought in to homogenise air travel standards across the trade bloc.
There are nine FABs under development in Europe, but only two have been formally recognised by the European Commission: the UK-Ireland FAB and the FAB between Denmark and Sweden.

The briefing note prepared for minister Shane Ross also echoed the warnings of Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary, who has claimed that air travellers could be back “chasing the boats” if there is no agreement on air travel rules for when Britain exits the UK.
Aspreviously explained byFora, O’Leary has highlighted the fact that aviation has been missing from much of the Brexit negotiations. On several occasions, he has threatened tore-house many of the airline’s 85 UK-based aircraftto other European airports.
Allies
The ministerial note said that if the UK leaves Europe’s single aviation market it will have to sign off an alternative agreement with the remaining 27 member states.
“In the absence of such an agreement, existing traffic rights could be negatively impacted,” it said.
It stressed that Ireland’s position in relation to aviation is to “protect a fully liberalised or deregulated market in order to ensure no erosion of our connectivity or disruption to airlines, airports, business, tourism and personal travel”.
“The loss of the UK as a key ally in the EU will require Ireland to align itself with member states with similarly minded aviation interest,” it said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-travellers-3732629-Dec2017/,"THE IRISH TRAVELLER community in Britain has expressed concern about the impact Brexit will have on their rights.
Areport this monthauthored by barrister Simon Cox and the Traveller Movement said the government in the UK has so far failed to guarantee the rights of Irish citizens post-Brexit.
It highlighted a number of areas that the organisation believes Irish people – and Travellers in particular – could be impacted, including immigration status, access to healthcare and tenancy rights.
“Irish Travellers are a distinct ethnic minority and while there is no accurate data as to the actual number, the Traveller Movement estimates around 100,000 are resident in the UK,” the report said.
The report focuses on a piece of legislation called the Ireland Act 1949 which should protect the rights of Irish citizens in Britain. However, it claims the British government and local authorities do not, in practice, recognise the act as conferring any rights to them.
“All Irish citizens have to depend on their status as EU citizens or specific British legal provisions which make no reference to the 1949 Act,” it notes.
“Many of the protections and rights currently enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK, such as the exemptions from prohibitions on employment of foreigners, exist only because they are EU citizens and not because they are Irish citizens.”
House of Lords member David Alton is quoted in the report as saying the Irish Traveller community has “long faced significant prejudice in Britain”.

“The Traveller Movement’s research – ‘Last acceptable form of racism?’ – recently found that service providers and healthcare providers routinely refuse access to Irish Travellers,” he said.
“A lack of legal and policy clarity in a post-Brexit UK would lead to those officials and private sector staff with prejudice to discriminate – consciously or unconsciously – against Irish Travellers who hold Irish citizenship.”
Alton said the issue that is most concerning is “the lack of clarity around the powers to deport Irish citizens; a power the Irish government has renounced for British citizens”.
Overcrowded accommodation
A number of reports have found that landlords – as part of the Right to Rent scheme in the UK – are less likely to rent to potential tenants who do not hold a British passport, but who have the right to live in the UK.
The report gave a case study example to illustrate how this could impact on Irish Traveller families:
Yvonne MacNamara, chief executive of the Traveller Movement, said there are certain groups, such as Irish Travellers, who are much more vulnerable than others if laws are unclear and left to the interpretation of employers, landlords and officials.
“Unless the government acts to clarify and guarantee the rights of Irish citizens, it is not hard to imagine how Irish Travellers could be subject to greater levels of prejudice and discrimination than they already face,” she said.
The report recommended the introduction of a general law that Irish citizens be treated equally with British citizens or to include an exemption for Irish people to immigration control in primary legislation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-9-vat-rate-under-consideration-after-playing-its-role-during-the-recession-3618793-Sep2017/,"PRESSURE IS MOUNTING on the government to increase the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector.
With money for tax cuts and fresh spending amounting to just €300 million, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure has limited funds to play with.
Just two weeks out from the Budget, Paschal Donohoe was before the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee yesterday.
While he said he would not be revealing any specific details relating to the budget, he did rule out any big surprises on 10 October.
While some trade unions have urged the government to abolish the special 9% VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors, those in the industry are understood to have expressed deep concern about any potential increase.
However, the minister admitted to the committee yesterday that the VAT rate is under consideration, adding that the rate had served its purpose during the recession.
Not issue in confidence and supply agreement
It’s understood that Fianna Fáil has not put up any roadblocks to an increase, with one source explaining it is not a measure contained in the confidence and supply agreement and if Fine Gael wants to push on with tax cuts, it will need to find additional expenditure from somewhere.
One Fine Gael TD said an increase is on the cards in this year’s Budget as hotels are “back booming”.
“They don’t have a case to make. Hotels are almost at 100% capacity, they are making money, and I do not for one minute believe an increase will result in job losses,” said another TD.
The VAT rate was reduced during the economic downturn from 13.5% to 9% in a bid to boost the tourist sector and retain jobs in the industry.
Jobs at risk
There’s speculation that the government won’t return to the 13.5% but will perhaps increase the rate nominally to 10%. However, the Restaurant Association of Ireland said a 1% increase could put 6,000 jobs at risk.
Donohoe said he believed the rate reduction has worked well over the years.
“I believe it played a valuable role, at a point in time, in relation to the creation and retention of jobs,” he told Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart.

“At a point in time?” asked Lahart pointedly.
“At a point in time,” replied the minister.
“It is a matter under consideration by me and others and I have made no decision in relation to it and I will announce what we are going to do on Budget day,” said Donohoe, who added that it was a measure of “where we were in the economic cycle and played a positive role in the creation and retention of jobs”.
“And what I will be doing now is looking at the economic evidence in relation to that tax rate, as I will with every other rate,” he said.
Price gouging
Lahart also asked the minister if his department had evidence of price gouging by the hotel industry, particularly at times of big events.
The minister said any changes in hotel price rates send out a signal about Ireland’s competitiveness and send out a signal regarding the “ability of people to come and visit us”.
“When I was Minister for Tourism I made the point that if trends that we had then continued, it would cause a difficulty for us in the future,” he said, adding:
The minister said that the hotel sector in Dublin is not necessarily reflective of the industry nationwide. He explained that he would not make any decision on the tax rate based on one city, “even if it is our capital”.
“I know from going to other parts of the country that they continue to experience difficulties in relation to the development of tourism and getting people to stay. I will be looking at the national performance of that tax and not just in our capital city,” he concluded.
Other Budget measures
In addition to discussions on VAT, the minister hinted the government may seek to divert funding for various rental support schemes, such as the Housing Assistance Payment (Hap), to local authorities for the building of social housing.
He also confirmed that there would be another Christmas bonus this year, though he would only make the details known on Budget day.
Donohoe also confirmed that there will be a “Brexit package” in this year’s Budget.
During an unusual line of questioning, where the minister was asked if he would be a “Coca-Cola” “Coke Light” or “Coke Zero” drinker, Donohoe said he enjoyed many forms of fizzy drinks.
He said the introduction of a sugar tax in 2018 had been well-flagged and said the tax would be applied to sweetened drinks which have sugar in them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-close-to-sealing-a-deal-3724204-Nov2017/,"
BRITAIN IS “VERY close” to an agreement on its Brexit bill, Ireland’s EU commissioner Phil Hogan said today – but reports that the divorce settlement could be up to €55 billion have angered both Brexiteers and europhiles.
In the past hour,the Guardianhas reported that sources have indicated a deal on the Irish border in particular is imminent and that the potential draft wording of a border solution is being circulated, though the “magic formula of words has yet to materialise”.
Brussels said it wanted more progress on the Irish border issue and the rights of European expats in Britain before moving on to trade talks at a summit in December.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier – who met German Chancellor Angela Merkel for Brexit talks – warned that “we are not there yet” but added that he “hopes very quickly, next week, to see that we have found an agreement”.
These first signs of a breakthrough have emerged days before British Prime Minister Theresa May is to meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Monday, in what the EU says is the “absolute deadline” for an agreement in principle.
London and Brussels have agreed that Britain will up its offer to €45-55 billion, with space for both sides to announce their own final figures, according tothe Telegraph.

May said there was no agreement on how much Britain would be on the hook for.
“We’re still in negotiations with the European Union,” she told the BBC while on a surprise visit to Iraq. “I want a deep and special partnership with the EU in the future.”
‘Utterly unacceptable’
However, Ireland’s EU commissioner Phil Hogan said that “the United Kingdom has brought forward proposals that go very close towards meeting the requirements of the EU 27 member states.”
“I expect that we will see movement (on Ireland) in the next few days as well,” he added.

But there’s still work to do. The European Parliament warning, unlike most other parties in the talks who see the matter as closed, that on citizens rights negotiations are “stalled, and even some progress reversed”.

Pro-Brexit supporters reacted with anger to divorce bill reports, with leading campaigner Nigel Farage calling the figure “utterly unacceptable”.
“For a sum of this magnitude to be agreed in return for nothing more than a promise of a decent settlement on trade represents a complete and total sellout,” he wrote in the Telegraph.
Meanwhile, pro-EU Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna said the government’s apparent climbdown was a “whopping great symbol for the impossibility on delivering Brexit on the terms it was sold to the British people.”
Investors were more optimistic that the reports heralded a breakthrough, sending the pound 0.4% higher against the dollar, a two-month high.
Foreign Secretary and Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson – who once said the EU could “go whistle” if it demanded a large settlement – today appeared to accept the deal if it unlocked the next phase of the talks.

“Now is the moment to get the whole ship off the rocks,” he told the BBC during an EU-Africa summit in the Ivory Coast.
Irish issue
An agreement would be a major breakthrough as Britain prepares for an EU summit in December where it is hoping to get the go-ahead to start the next phase of talks on a post-Brexit transition period and future trade ties.
The new British offer comes in two parts. The first concerns May’s commitment made in a speech in September that will cover Britain’s contributions to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, even after leaving the bloc.
The second concerns her promise, made in the same speech in Florence, to “honour commitments” made during Britain’s four-decade membership, and after going through this line by line, the two sides have reached agreement on the detail.
So far both sides have avoided publicly declaring a clear-cut number for what Britain owes the rest of the EU, but reports and think-tanks put the first part at around €20 billion and the second at €35 billion.
Ministers agreed to boost the offer at a meeting last week.
The final issue is that of the Irish border: the Irish government and the EU is asking that the frontier remains open to people and trade – with some going further than that to say that the North should remain as part of the customs union in order to preserve the current free-flowing border.
Hogan echoed Leo Varadkar’s position that Britain must make a clear commitment on the “difficult” issue of avoiding a hard border, adding that “we don’t hear much detail in relation to how that’s going to be achieved”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/the-dups-hardline-policies-could-be-the-quickest-road-to-a-united-ireland-3734575-Dec2017/,"ON MONDAY, A deal between the EU and UK on the Irish border was scrapped because any kind of distinction between Northern Ireland and the UK was unacceptable to the DUP.
Arlene Foster insisted that there could be no “divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the UK”. Hardline Brexiters like Jacob Rees-Mogg supported this stance, saying that any “distinctions” between Britain and Northern Ireland would be “completely intolerable”.
But what is this “constitutional integrity” of which they speak? The term suggests that there is an unbroken political uniformity across the United Kingdom. But there are already considerable legal and administrative differences between the constituent parts of the British State. And there always have been.
Considerable regional divergence
This was evident in the political union between England and Scotland that created Britain in 1707. Scotland had been an independent nation with its own monarchy for centuries.
The negotiations to unite the two countries under one government took place between two sovereign parliaments, and as such, complete political uniformity was never going to happen. From the very moment it came into existence then, Britain has had considerable regional divergence in legal and political affairs.
The first difference was in the relationship between Church and State. The Church of England (Anglican) and Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) became the national churches of both countries respectively. To this day, Britain still has two separate state churches.
There is a great deal of irony in the fact that the Presbyterians of Ulster have always had considerable contempt for Anglicanism, yet express deep devotion to the monarch who is the supreme head of the Anglican Church.
A separate legal system
More importantly, the Act of Union allowed Scotland to preserve a separate legal system from England, which remains in place today.
Some of these differences include the age at which one can be tried as an adult, how many people sit in a jury, how many jury members need to agree on a person’s guilt in order to convict them, and how many verdicts a jury can choose from. There are considerable points of difference between England and Scottish law, both civil and criminal.
Ireland was officially incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801. There are some people who argue that after this union, Ireland was no longer a colony because it was an integral part of the British State.
The problem with this interpretation is that Ireland was governed differently from other parts of the UK. Ireland continued to have a Lord-Lieutenant, a Chief Secretary, and Under-Secretary, which other parts of the UK did not have, and a sizeable military presence was maintained in Ireland up until 1922.
The famine was an Irish problem
The Great Famine only served to further accentuate the sense of difference between Ireland and the rest of the UK. At the height of the catastrophe in 1847, the government in Westminster transferred all responsibility for relief efforts to Irish taxpayers, with predictable and disastrous results.
Advertisement
That same year, 15,000 famine refugees were deported from England back to Ireland, with thousands more being forcibly returned in the years that followed. In other words, from a political point of view, the famine was an Irish, not British, problem.
In 1920, a new administrative wrinkle appeared in the United Kingdom, with the creation of Northern Ireland. There certainly was something odd in the fact that the people who had campaigned vociferously against Irish home rule and championed an inviolable British union then turned around and accepted their own autonomous parliament.
But the logic was simple. Unionists have always feared that London would let them down in their hour of need, and a Belfast parliament would guarantee that they could not be forced into a united Ireland against their will.
Three separate legal systems
This meant that the UK now had three separate legal systems operating within its borders. And unionists were certainly content to allow differences on points of law between Northern Ireland and Britain to emerge.
In 1922, Stormont introduced the Special Powers Act, which gave the Northern Irish government enormous power to suppress dissent in the name of public safety. This included internment without trial, banning political publications, meetings, and parades, implementing curfews and removing “troublesome” flags.
Although introduced to tackle widespread violence in Belfast in 1922, the Act remained in force until 1973, and was used almost exclusively against members of the nationalist community. Such extensive restrictions on civil liberties did not exist anywhere else in the UK.
Meanwhile, in 1948, Westminster abolished laws that (1) only allowed ratepayers to vote in local elections, (2) gave some people multiple votes through company votes. But such laws were vital to maintaining unionist control of local government in Northern Ireland, so they remained in force there.
Considerable differences exist today
It is not surprising (although certainly ironic) that when Westminster introduced direct rule in 1972, this was met with furious unionist protests.
Even today, there are still considerable differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain. Firstly, Northern Irish banknotes, although legal currency, are generally not accepted across the Irish Sea. Gay marriage and abortions are legal in Britain, but not so in Northern Ireland.
Everyone born in Northern Ireland (unlike the rest of the UK) is entitled to claim citizenship in another country as well (ie Ireland). It is difficult to conceive of a more dramatic constitutional difference between two different parts of the same State than that.
The DUP don’t want Northern Ireland to remain in a customs union with the rest of Ireland because they fear it is a slippery slope to a united Ireland. And it might be, although one could argue that the DUP’s own hardline policies could end up being the quickest road to their nightmare scenario.
But trying to hide behind the mythical “constitutional integrity” of the United Kingdom is frankly embarrassing. It is a figment of their imagination. The United Kingdom has been built on constitutional divergence.
Adding another one to the arrangement is far more likely to preserve, rather than undermine, Northern Ireland’s place in the union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-bbc-3730029-Dec2017/,"A SENIOR CONSERVATIVE MP has said that Ireland’s Brexit strategy is down to the recent no-confidence motion in former Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.
Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Ireland’s current position on Brexit is because of “a no confidence motion in the deputy prime minister, an election and the threat of Sinn Fein”.
However, Brexit was not a relevant issue in the recent political controversy, which centered on Frances Fitzgerald, the Department of Justice and the handling of information related to the Garda Commissioner’s legal strategy to smear Maurice McCabe at the O’Higgins Commission.
An election had been on the cards last week, but that was avoided with Fitzgerald’s resignation. He also appeared to be unaware that the no-confidence motion was never actually voted upon, and that Ireland already had a new Tánaiste.
There have been claims that Ireland has threatened to “veto” the Brexit talks moving on between the UK and EU, even though no such direct threat has been made. Besides, it’s not likely any “veto” would even be required with the EU on Ireland’s side anyway.
Rees-Mogg also said that it’s really important that the UK doesn’t hand over a “great deal of money” to the EU unless they have an agreement on trade.
Sam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
Also speaking onBBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Tánaiste, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney said that the Irish government “certainly don’t want to be vetoing anything” when it comes to Brexit talks between Britain and the EU.

The Cork South-Central TD said that the Irish government, “just like the British government”, wants the Brexit process move on to phase two.
He also said the government needed “more credible answers” from the UK before negotiations progress.
During a press conference in Dublin on Friday, European Council President Donald Tusk said Ireland will be consulted on any offer put forward by the UK to deal with phase one issues – which include citizen’s rights, the Brexit bill and the border with Northern Ireland.
The possibility of a hard border has been a major sticking point in negotiations for some time, but after areported deal on Britain’s divorce billit’s nowthe sticking point.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has repeatedly said that the onus is on Theresa May’s government to come up with a workable and practical solution to avoid a hard border.
May, however, is coming under pressure from Brexiteers to walk away from negotiations if EU leaders refuse to sanction the start of phase two talks later this month.
In a letter from a series of prominent Tory MPs printed in the Daily Telegraph today, May is urged to refuse to settle the UK’s “divorce bill” with the EU unless the latter agrees to a free trade agreement ensuring Britain leaves the single market and customs union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-may-vote-3749489-Dec2017/,"
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May suffered a damaging parliamentary defeat over Brexit today, after her own MPs rebelled to demand parliament have the final say on the divorce deal with Brussels.
Members of May’s Conservative party joined with opposition lawmakers to inflict the government’s first defeat over the flagship EU (Withdrawal) Bill, sparking huge cheers in the House of Commons.
Ministers had sought to buy off the rebels with a last-minute promise of a parliamentary vote on the separation agreement, but their leader, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, warned: “It’s too late.”
His amendment demanding a statutory vote on the deal before Britain leaves the EU in March 2019 passed by 309 votes to 305.
The Brexit ministry said it was “disappointed”.
“We will now determine whether further changes are needed to the bill to ensure it fulfils its vital purpose,” the ministry said in a statement.
It is a blow to May on the eve of a crucial summit in Brussels, where EU leaders are expected to approve the terms of the interim Brexit deal agreed last week after months of tortuous negotiations.
Gina Miller, a leading pro-EU campaigner, reacted saying:
But Nigel Farage, a key driving force behind the Brexit campaign, said:
Hampering ‘smooth’ Brexit
The EU (Withdrawal) Bill is intended to formally end Britain’s membership of the EU, as well as smooth its exit by transferring thousands of pieces of European legislation onto the UK statute books.
It also gives ministers powers to amend the laws as they move across, to address any technical glitches.
But MPs objected to the fact that these so-called “Henry VIII” powers also extend to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement with the EU.
Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, a hardline Brexiteer, had accused Grieve of “looking for ways to derail the bill”, saying his amendment would “tie the government’s hands” in negotiations with the EU.
But one Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, had warned:

“The government is presiding over a monumental task of immense importance for the future of this country.
In a written statement to parliament earlier today, Brexit Secretary David Davis promised that no withdrawal agreement would be implemented until a vote in both Houses of Parliament.
Parliament would then be asked to approve a further piece of legislation to implement the deal.
But ministers wanted to preserve their special powers in the event that this law is not passed in time.
“That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings, which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have,” May told MPs earlier.
‘Blank cheque’
After months of wrangling, May secured a deal last week on three priorities of the separation – Britain’s financial settlement, the Irish border and the rights of expatriates.
The fate of the Irish border had been a crucial issue, with the Irish government insisting that the UK provide certain guarantees before negotiations could progress.
A dealwas finally reachedlast Friday.
It was a rare moment of triumph for May, who has been struggling to assert her authority since losing her parliamentary majority in a disastrous election in June.
The European Parliament today gave its backing to the deal, and EU leaders meeting in Brussels tomorrow and Friday are expected to give the green light to move the Brexit negotiations on to trade.
However, the sense of victory has been tempered by a dispute with Brussels over comments made by Davis at the weekend, suggesting Britain was not fully committed to the agreement.
Davisclarified his remarkson Monday
Today’s vote spells further domestic trouble ahead for May, as parliament and her party are divided about Britain’s future relationship with the EU.
Ahead of today’s vote, Grieve warned that ministers were asking for “a blank cheque to the government to achieve something that, at the moment, we don’t know what it is”.

A PENSIONER REWARDED for bravery after trying to save a British MP murdered last year by a Nazi-inspired attacker has died, his family said on Monday.
Bernard Carter-Kenny was seriously injured when he went to the aid of lawmaker Jo Cox as she was attacked by Thomas Mair, a far-right extremist who responded by stabbing him.
The pensioner’s son Phil Kenny confirmed that his father died on Monday morning, aged 79.
The murder of Cox in the village of Birstall, northern England, shocked the country and led to a three-day suspension in campaigning ahead of the Brexit referendum.
Carter-Kenny was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with a George Medal for bravery, awarded this June, which recognised his heroic actions outside Birstall library where he had been waiting for his wife.

In his police statement following the attack, the pensioner said he thought he would be able to jump on Mair’s back and initially did not realise the assailant was armed.
“The blood started pouring out between my fingers. I saw the blood and I thought ‘Oh my God’,” the former miner told police.
MP Tracy Brabin, who was elected to represent Cox’s constituency following her death, said Carter-Kenny will “forever be remembered as a true hero”.
Cox, who defended immigration and campaigned to stay in the EU, was stabbed 15 times by Mair who also fired three shots at the lawmaker.
The neo-Nazi is currently serving a rare “whole life term” punishment for murdering Cox, injuring Carter-Kenny, and possession of a gun and dagger.","3.26pm, 15 Aug 2017",

The outspoken CEO made the comments during an interview onBBC Newsnightahead of a meeting today with UK transport secretary Chris Grayling.
O’Leary began the interview by noting that if the UK leaves the European Union it must automatically leave the “open skies” treaty, which removes restrictions on EU-based airlines flying throughout the union.
“Therefore as things stand there is no flight rights between the UK and Europe and vice versa. And it is a guillotine. It happens at the end of March.
“Remember, what’s key about aviation is, aviation comes up six months before March 2019. We’re filing our schedules for summer 2019 in September 2018 and if we don’t have the right to fly we will be cancelling those flights,” he said.

When presenter Kristy Wark interjected to say that it is in everyone’s interests to get a deal done the Ryanair boss completely rejected the idea.
“That is the misunderstanding here in the UK, ‘it’s in everybody’s interests’. It is not in everybody’s interests. It’s in the European interest, certainly the European airlines, who are actively lobbying against this, to not have an agreement.
Ryanair carries more than 30 million British passengers every year. During his meeting with Grayling today O’Leary again expressed his concerns about the impact of Brexit on aviation.
Speaking after the meeting he again repeated his pessimism about a deal being done.
Accordingto Reuters he told journalists: “It’s odds against a deal being done in advance of Christmas 2018, because it is in the Europeans’ interest to not have a deal done… and all hell will be kicking off over here in the UK.”
Grayling previously dismissed O’Leary’s fears. “It’s inconceivable that anyone on either side would want to stop planes flying,” hesaidin late July, Bloomberg reported.
“The implications for the tourist industries of parts of the EU of not having the aviation links that they have at the moment are deep and profound. Everyone benefits from having good aviation links and I haven’t the slightest doubt that post-2019 we will retain them.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-coveney-repair-relationship-3755178-Dec2017/,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER and Tánaiste Simon Coveney says that the government needs to “repair” its relationship with the DUP.
Relations between Dublin and the North’s largest party have been strained since contentious Brexit talks a week ago. The rancour led to DUP MP Sammy Wilson referring to Coveney and Varadkar as “cynical, aggressive and green”.
A deal on the border post-Brexit had appeared to be reached last Monday but this was scuppered at the last-minute by the concerns of the unionist party. That led to a week of tense talks amid an undercurrent of disagreements between the Taoiseach and the DUP.
Varadkar went on to say that the DUP doesnot speak for everyone in Northern Ireland.
However, speaking to RTÉ’s The Week In Politics today, Coveney said that the relationship must be mended.

“Because of the tension around trying to get the deal we felt was needed for everyone on this island, yes, of course there is repair work to do.
“I hope to be at the forefront in being involved in that and am already seeking a meeting with the DUP before the end of the year.
“If not, then I assume it will be early in the new year.”
Coveney said that the lack of a Stormont Assembly was a symptom of the UK’s decision to leave the EU and said that all sides may have to revisit the Good Friday Agreement to see what happens next in Northern Ireland. The assembly has been empty since elections in March.
“There is the prospect of a whole series of choices – from another election, to the triggering of Intergovernmental Conferences to make decisions on Northern Ireland.
“That is not where we want to be. That will cause tension. It will be a very frosty environment to make decisions in, so we all have a responsibility to find a way forward.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/grant-shapps-theresa-may-3634419-Oct2017/,"FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY chairman Grant Shapps has called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to step down as party leader, revealing that 30 MPs and a number of cabinet ministers agree.
Speaking to a number of news outlets today, Shapps compared May’s current position to that of the end of Gordon Brown and John Major’s. His remarks come after a faltering performance at the party’s conference this week and cabinet infighting over Brexit.
“It’s about feeling that having fought and not won that election and then not really having the relaunch that was wanted this far down the line, three or four months later, perhaps it is time to do something else and I think that means changing the leaders,” Shapps toldSky News.
Shapps declined to reveal that names of the party members who want May to resign, but said “it does include five former cabinet ministers.”https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/916200073112936448
Speaking toBBC Newstoday, he said:
“If you look at previous elections and previous cycles you will see that Gordon Brown tried to struggle on through. You saw the same thing happen with John Major and in the end, it doesn’t end well,” he said.
“We don’t think it’s the way to do this and that actually it would be better to enable us to move on as a party by having a full leadership election now.”
May’s leadership has also been strained in recent weeks by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who publicly undermined efforts to present a united front over Brexit with several newspaper columns and interviews setting out his own stance on the issue.
The latest round of political uncertainty surrounding May pushed down the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar on currency markets.https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/916196609733439488
May’s reaction
Reacting to the revelations today, Theresa May said she enjoyed the “full support” of her cabinet.
“What the country needs is calm leadership and that’s what I’m providing with the full support of my cabinet,” May told reporters in her constituency in Maidenhead, west of London.

However, when questioned today Shapps disagreed with May’s comments.
“Are there cabinet members aware? Yes. Do some support it? Yes,” he said.
Brexit strategy divisions
Speculation around May’s position has intensified in recent days after a chaotic address to the party’s annual conference on Wednesday marred by coughing fits, a falling set and a prankster’s interruption.
The Conservatives have 316 MPs in parliament. Under the party’s rules, a leadership race can be triggered if at least 48 of those MPs express their support.
But leading figures in the Conservative Party disagreed with Shapps.
“I really think this is now just going to fizzle out,” said Charles Walker, deputy head of the party’s powerful 1922 Committee, which would initiate any leadership contest.
Veteran backbencher Michael Fabricant said of Shapps: “I wouldn’t buy a used car from one embittered colleague – let alone take advice from him about who should be PM.”
And former minister Rob Halfon, sacked by May, said the plot brought the Labour opposition leader closer to taking over the prime minister’s Downing Street office.
“This knucklehead behaviour makes our party weaker and it allows Jeremy Corbyn one step closer to Number 10,” he toldChannel 4.
A former interior minister, May came to power last year after her predecessor David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the Brexit referendum in which he had campaigned for Britain to stay in the European Union.
Her position was badly weakened in this year’s general election.
She called the snap vote but ended up losing her parliamentary majority and her cabinet has been riven with divisions over Brexit strategy in recent weeks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-3537035-Aug2017/,"THE NUMBER OF tourists visiting Ireland from North America grew in the first half of this year, while numbers coming from Britain declined, according to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).
The figures confirm overall growth of 4.2% in overseas visitors to Ireland compared to the first half of last year. This growth has come from North America (up 21.6%), mainland Europe and developing markets.
Tourism Ireland said today that increased air access to Ireland contributed to the overall growth. Air access was up 4% this summer due to the introduction of a number of new routes from the country’s main markets.
The decline in the value of sterling has impacted on the number of British visitors to Ireland, which was down 6.4% in the first half of the year.

“It is a concern, but not a surprise, that the number of visits from Britain has fallen in the early part of the year as a result of the sterling depreciation following the Brexit referendum. There is no doubt that competitiveness in our tourism industry is vital at this time,” Minister for Transport and Tourism Shane Ross said today.
Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said the decline in the value of sterling has made holidays and short breaks here more expensive.
“Therefore, competitiveness and the value for money message are more important than ever in Britain right now. Tourism Ireland is placing a greater focus on our ‘culturally curious’ audience, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations. We are also undertaking an expanded partnership programme with airlines, ferry operators and tour operators, communicating a strong price-led message,” he said.
However Gibbons pointed out that Ireland now welcomes 10% of all American visitors to Europe, describing this as “particularly noteworthy given the intense competition from other destinations”.
“It has also been the best ever first-half performance from mainland Europe (up almost 6%), with important markets like Spain, Germany, France and the Nordic Region all recording really good growth. I am also really pleased to see visitor numbers from Australia and developing markets increase by 20.6% for the first half of 2017,” he said.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR spoke to the British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of her landmark Brexit speech in Italy today.
May that is expected to spell out key positions on Brexit after wrangling and tension in her own government.
It’s understood the prime minister was keen to discuss and outline the key points of her speech with Varadkar ahead of delivering it in Florence today. The Taoiseach is due to meet with the prime minister in London on Monday.
With the clock ticking towards Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March 2019, May’s address today seeks to break a deadlock in negotiations whose fourth round starts next week.
Among the many issues dividing the two sides, money dominates.
Britain has yet to agree on – or even say – how much it will pay the European Union on departure, a position that for Brussels blocks any talks on a potential future trade deal.
On the eve of her speech, May met with cabinet ministers for more than two hours to finalise Britain’s position.
Ministers have been at odds over crucial issues such as a potential transition deal and future access to the EU single market as well as the Brexit bill.
The tensions exploded into public view last week when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson laid out his own vision for life outside the EU.

He argued for a sharp break with the bloc, a stance that dismays moderates who fear this will wreck Britain’s relations with the world’s biggest trade bloc.
In doing so, he was accused of trying to tie the hands of May, whose hold on power remains fragile since losing her parliamentary majority in the June election.
Divorce bill
Six months after May began the two-year countdown to Britain’s withdrawal, EU leaders are still waiting for details on what she wants from the divorce.

Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, ramped up the pressure yesterday, saying:
Reports suggest May will include an offer on Britain’s financial obligations and a proposal for a two-year transition into a new deal with the EU.
Barnier said such a period would begin on 30 March 2019 but pointed to the detailed deal-making effort needed to make it happen.

Downing Street said the speech would “also discuss a vision for a bold new economic and security partnership and set out the prime minister’s plan for a time-limited implementation period”.
The divorce bill will be a key issue in upcoming talks.
British media reports say May would accept a €20 billion payment during the transition in return for access to the single market.
The EU, though, is demanding Britain pay for budget commitments made but not yet paid, including contributions for infrastructure projects in poorer member states and pensions for EU officials.
May was expected to say that a deal would ensure that “when this chapter of our European history is written, it will be remembered not for the differences we faced, but for the vision we showed”.
According to extracts released from her Downing Street office, she will say:
The prime minister’s upcoming speech was trailed as “May’s vision for Brexit victory” by the Daily Express, an anti-EU newspaper, while the Daily Mail front page read: “PM’s bold bid to end Brexit deadlock”.
‘Crunch time’
EU officials will scrutinise the May speech for any signs of progress on other potential deal-breakers – the rights of European citizens in Britain, and how Britain will settle the question of the Northern Ireland border.
Business leaders will be vetting details on the transitional deal, which would bridge the gap between Britain’s exit and the implementation of new trading arrangements with the EU.
Miles Celic, chief executive of The City UK, the lobby group for the financial sector, said it was “crunch time”.

Davis’ made the comments address Austrian business leaders today as he embarked on a series of speeches being described as the “road to Brexit” by the UK government as he spells out the British vision for a future partnership with the EU.

Despite a desire to leave the single market and customs’ union, the UK wants to have as smooth trade as possible with the EU after March 2019.

Davis said that the UK is leaving the EU because it wants to ensure that decisions affecting it are taken within the UK – not because of a desire to undermine the EU.
Davis rebuked critics of his government and its approach, invoking the post-apocalyptic Mad Max film series starring Mel Gibson and Tom Hardy as the titular protagonists.
He said: “They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom.
He also spoke about inventions and Britain, describing initiatives to develop drone technology in the North East of England.
The British desire to leave the single market and customs’ union but retain easy trade links has not been well received on the EU side of the negotiations.
Chief negotiator Michel Barnier recently put pressure on the UK to provide the exact details of how it could solve these problems, including that of Northern Ireland.
“The time has come to make choices, and we await with great interest the choices,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-reaction-brexit-deal-3738926-Dec2017/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S DUP party pulled the rug on the first Brexit deal put on the table on Monday, but today the party’s leader has said she is “pleased” with the new deal.
A deal to avoid a hard border was initially expected to be announced on Monday afternoon.
The UK was expected to concede that there will be no “regulatory divergence” on the island of Ireland in relation to the single market and customs union. However, the DUP said it wouldn’t accept Northern Ireland having a different deal to the rest of the UK.
A breakthrough came following a tense week of negotiations as DUP leader Arlene Foster engaged in all-night talks with the UK and EU before British Prime Minister Theresa May headed for Brussels to meet EU chiefs to formally agree on the arrangement.
Foster told Sky News this morning that, following her talks with May, “there is no red line down the Irish Sea and clear confirmation that the entirety of the UK is leaving the European Union, the single market and the customs union”.
However, Foster was also firm in outlining that the DUP believe more work still needs to be done to improve the paper.
She said more focus is needed on the areas of potential future alignment with Ireland and how that could be achieved without staying in the single market and customs union.
“We do however welcome the assurance given by the Prime Minister and Brexit Secretary in Parliament that any alignment will be done on a UK wide basis, ensuring that there would be no barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and our most important market in the rest of the UK,” Foster said in a statement.https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/939045797353504769
Foster raised concerns that the paper could have “pre-judged” the outcome of the ongoing debate within the UK in relation to the nature of any regulatory alignment with the EU that may be required post-Brexit.

“We cautioned the Prime Minister about proceeding with this agreement in its present form given the issues which still need to be resolved and the views expressed to be by many of her own party colleagues,” Foster said.
“However, it was ultimately a matter for the Prime Minister to decided how she chose to proceed.
Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, called it a positive day for the Union.
“Fundamentals in all of this… Northern Ireland will not be separated in anyway from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Unfettered across the UK market. No borders in the Irish Sea. Positive day for the Union. Now to the next stage and getting the best UK/EU trade deal,” Dodds said on Twitter.https://twitter.com/NigelDoddsDUP/status/939053486532161536
It seems that there are contrasting interpretations of today’s deal coming from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
In her statement this morning, Foster said that “as a consequence” of the engagement between the government and the DUP, the new text now provides clear commitments to a number of issues.
One of the issues being “there will be no so-called ‘special status’ for Northern Ireland as demanded by Sinn Féin”.
However, in a speech this morning Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there will be “a special relationship” for Northern Ireland to ensure no barriers to trade in the absence of a trade agreement.
Despite causing a major hiccup to negotiations earlier this week, Foster said today that the DUP’s “guiding principle” throughout the crunch talks has been to “act in the national interest to ensure the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom is not compromised as we leave the European Union”.
“The Democratic Unionist Party has always been clear that the Union that matters most to Northern Ireland is that of the Union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”

ACCUSATIONS THAT THE government suppressed a Brexit document by the Revenue Commissioners resulted in a war of words breaking out between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on Twitter today.
The leaked report, whichRTÉ has seen, finds an open customs border would be impossible after Brexit.
The report, which remains unpublished, was drafted by a small unit set up within Revenue a year before the Brexit referendum.
TheJournal.iereported in June last year, prior to the British referendum, that Revenue was exploring the impacts on Ireland’s customs arrangements with the UK post-Brexit.
Following the referendum result, the team worked to find possible technological solutions to the border problem.
This was referred to by the former Finance Minister Michael Noonan, who outlined that Revenue was investigating how border crossings could be “frictionless”. The agency, he said, was looking at how some other countries, such as Norway, controlled border crossings.
However, it’s reported that work stopped abruptly when the government told Revenue to halt their investigations for fear that by carrying out such due diligence Ireland was doing the work for the British.
Fianna Fáil Brexit spokesperson Stephen Donnelly.Sam Boal / rollingnews.ieSam Boal / rollingnews.ie / rollingnews.ie
Today, Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Brexit Stephen Donnelly said the leaked report had shown that there are elements within the government more interested in playing party politics than in working on a cross-party basis to prepare Ireland for Brexit.
“The leaking of this report today shows that there are some within government who are unwilling to share critical pieces of analyses with the Oireachtas at a time when the risks to our country’s future economic prosperity have never been so grave.
“My colleagues and I have consistently requested, from a variety of government departments, to see reports of this nature, and we have been stonewalled.”

Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Donnelly said the report is “the most important part” of analysis by the State on Brexit.
“It turns out that the government has been suppressing what I believe is the most important part of analysis by the State that we’ve seen. And I think it is being very cavalier with the futures of the men and women who work in those 91,000 companies [who trade with the UK].
“The government needs to publish this report immediately,” said Donnelly. Labour leader Brendan Howlin and Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane have also called for the publication of the report.
Donnelly’s radio appearance resulted in the Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney hitting back at Donnelly on Twitter, accusing him of trying to make the Brexit negotiations “party political”.

Says the government caught red handed suppressing essential analysis, after asking others to work openly with them. You've some nerve.
Replying to the minister, Donnelly said the government had been caught “red-handed” suppressing essential analysis. He said this was particularly disappointing due to the government calling on all parties to “work openly with them”.
He concluded his tweet: “You’ve some nerve.”
Interestingly in the same thread, the former spokesperson and press secretary for Tony Blair Alastair Campbell asked Coveney to follow him so he could send him a direct message. What he had to say to the minister is unknown.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also weighed in on the issue today, reiterating his point that a customs border with the North would be a barrier to trade and peace.
A customs border would be expensive, a barrier to trade & an obstacle to peace. That's why we are working to prevent it, with support of EU.— Leo Varadkar (@LeoVaradkar)October 9, 2017Leo Varadkar/ Twitter
A customs border would be expensive, a barrier to trade & an obstacle to peace. That's why we are working to prevent it, with support of EU.
Criticising Varadkar’s decision to stop the work of the Revenue Commissioners, Donnelly said:
“It’s clear, on the basis of this report, that the Taoiseach’s political decision upon assuming office to instruct the Revenue Commissioners to desist from any customs’ contingency planning in the event of a hard Brexit was short-sighted and potentially highly detrimental to Irish interests, both North and South.”
Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond called Donnelly’s “faux outrage” on the issue an attempt “to make something more” of the report, adding that his behaviour is “counterproductive and unwise”.

A HARD BREXIT, that is one with no deal agreed, would cost the UK economy an enormous £80 billion (€91 billion), a leaked analysis claims.
The British government’s own secret economic analysis of the potential fallout suggests that a no-deal exit would see the UK having to borrow an additional £120 billion over the next 15 years,the Guardian reports.
That £120 billion is mitigated slightly by an alleged £40 billion gain to be made on the back of Britain leaving the EU – including £11 billion in payments to the bloc which would no longer fall due.
Worst affected by the potential economic fallout would be the Brexit heartlands of the north-east and West Midlands – which would see 16% and 13% hits to their economic growth respectively.
Advertisement
Perhaps even more stark are the effect a no-deal exit would have on retail prices – with the secret analysis suggesting overall high street prices to rise by 21%, and, crucially, food and drink costs to rise by 17%.
The new in-depth analyses are based on the initial leak of the original reportto Buzzfeed News last week, which had broadly suggested that Brexit would see the UK as being worse off in every conceivable scenario.
The news comes at a particularly precarious time for the British government of Theresa May.
With Phase Two of the Brexit talks on the horizon, May and her cabinet were locked in talks of their own yesterday, discussions which will continue today, regarding the Northern Irish border situation and the problem of what sort of relationship the UK will actually have with the EU post-Brexit.
The Northern Irish talks have proven particularly troublesome – the true legislative nature of the slightly opaque agreement reached last December, which saw both sides of the Irish border emerge with their pride intact, will shortly have to be fully realised.
Given May’s government is wholly dependent on the unionist MPs of the DUP, the Prime Minister is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place.
Northern Ireland would be the third-worst affected of the UK’s regions by a no-deal Brexit – however the secret analysis, which is currently viewable to all MPs only in a confidential reading room in Westminster, does not model the impact of a hard border between the North and the Republic.

IN A GESTURE OF abiding friendship, or perhaps a subtle warning, French President Emmanuel Macron will offer Britain a loan of the famed Bayeux Tapestry – which depicts the French conquest of England.
The 40-year-old French leader is due to visit the UK today to sign a treaty with British Prime Minister Theresa May on policing the port of Calais, which links the two countries; as well as discuss European security measures.
Since his election last year, Macron’s developed a name for himself for symbolic moves and gifts to other world leaders, as he sets about establishing new French diplomatic ties following political uncertainty in the UK and US.
On a trip to Beijing, he offered the Chinese president a French stallion, while Russian leader Vladimir Putin was given a tour around an exhibition at the Versailles Palace last year that marked 300 years of Franco-Russian friendship.

Transporting the 70-metre-long Bayeux Tapestry to Britain for the first time will be a technically difficult journey for the priceless thousand-year-old artwork.
“It will not be before 2020 because it’s an extremely fragile cultural treasure which will be subject to major restoration work before being transported anywhere,” an official in Macron’s office said yesterday.
What is the Bayeux Tapestry?
Jorisvo via ShutterstockJorisvo via Shutterstock
The tapestry, which dates from around 1077, depicts the famed Battle of Hastings when William the Conqueror from France defeated English forces in southern England.
The story of the 1066 military defeat, in which the English King Harold famously died after taking a French arrow in the eye, is still taught to British school children and is a founding moment in the long and bloody history of Anglo-French rivalry.
“It is very significant that the Bayeux Tapestry is going to be coming to the UK and that people are going to be able to see this,” Theresa May said in response to the offer.
Gallic joke?
Many historians and politicians have welcomed the gesture as a friendly move that underlined the two countries’ shared history and intermingled blood at a time when Britain is leaving the European Union.
“It’s an absolutely fantastic opportunity for British people from around the country to come, I hope to the British Museum, and see it in all its glory,” said Tom Tugendhat, chairman of a foreign affairs committee at the British parliament.
“This is a real demonstration on how diplomacy is done,” he told BBC radio.

But other commentators wondered exactly what Macron was trying to say by focusing on an inglorious moment in British military history.
The Times newspaper published a cartoon showing Macron in Middle Ages military garb skewering British Prime Minister Theresa May: “Emmanuel The Conqueror: It’s One In The Eye for Theresa Regina.”

Writing on Twitter, broadcast journalist Robert Peston commented that “lending the UK a magnificent depiction of the last time this country was invaded and subjugated is a wonderful Gallic joke by Emmanuel Macron”.

Jockeying over who would display the work is already underway, with the British Museum’s director Hartwig Fischer saying he would be “delighted” to show the work.
Lawmakers representing the seaside town of Hastings, as well as the village of Battle, where the historic clash took place, are also hoping for the honour.
“I’m sure we will be looking very carefully to ensure the maximum number of people can take benefit from seeing this tapestry,” May said.
Argument over origins
The loan might also reopen an unsettled argument about the creators of the tapestry, which has rarely moved from its home in a museum in Bayeux in France.

It was displayed in Paris in 1804 and again briefly at the Louvre Museum in 1945.
“There is a reasonable case that it could have been made in Canterbury” in southern England, British historian David Musgrove, who authored a book on the subject, told the BBC.
Other theories are that it was made in Bayeux itself or perhaps in an abbey in the Loire region of central France.
French historian Pierre Bouet said the tapestry should be seen by Britons as evidence of the role of France in the country’s history.
The tapestry “is a reminder of the military exploit of the founder of the current royal dynasty,” Bouet told AFP.
The British royal family still has the French words “Dieu Et Mon Droit” (God and my Right) on its coat of arms.
Macron will hold talks with May at Sandhurst, a British military academy outside London, later today.

UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson has called for Britain to completely throw off EU rules and to view Brexit as an opportunity, while refusing to deny he might quit if the government chose a different path.
Johnson, a leading campaigner behind Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, used a speech in London to try to reassure the millions of Britons who wanted to stay by offering a positive vision of Brexit.
He said the project’s success “will depend on what we make of it” – and said it would be “absurd” if Britain left the bloc only to align itself with all its rules in future, without having any say in them.
“We would be mad to go through this process of extrication from the EU and not to take advantage of the economic freedom it will bring,” he said in a highly-anticipated speech at a think tank in London.
“In a global marketplace… it seems extraordinary that the UK should remain lashed to the minute prescriptions of a regional trade bloc comprising only six percent of humanity,” he added.
His call for a clean break with Brussels puts Johnson at odds with other members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet, not least her finance minister Philip Hammond, who wants Britain’s economy to diverge only “modestly” from the EU.
Johnson dodged a question about whether he might resign if he disagrees with any deal struck with Brussels later this year, saying only: “We’re all lucky to serve.”
His speech was the first of series of high-profile ministerial addresses on Brexit, as May’s divided government prepares for crucial talks with Brussels on the future trading relationship starting from April.
‘Overarching European state’
Johnson, viewed as a potential successor to May, has challenged her authority over Brexit several times, and admitted today that he risked causing some “irritation” with his latest speech.
But said he felt the need to “reach out to those who still have anxieties” about the 2016 vote to end four decades of EU membership.

He stressed that Britain had not turned in on itself, saying with typical flourish: “It’s not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover.”
He said the vote was driven by a “legitimate and natural desire for self-government”, which was at odds with what he said was the EU’s main goal of creating “an overarching European state”.
Johnson’s comments prompted a swift response from European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, who said the idea of a European superstate was “total nonsense”.
He also risked antagonising some of those he aimed to reassure by falling back on phrases used by the anti-Brexit side, saying that trying to stop the process would “frustrate the will of the people” and lead to “ineradicable feelings of betrayal”.
Johnson also firmly rejected the idea of a second referendum, saying it would lead to “another year of turmoil and wrangling and feuding, in which the whole country would lose”.
‘Project Fantasy’
Today’s speech kicks off a series of coordinated ministerial addresses, which will include one by May on security issues in Munich on Saturday.
Three other key cabinet ministers will follow over the subsequent two weeks, after which May will make a second address to the nation.
Emphasising the benefits of leaving the EU, Johnson repeated a highly contested claim from the referendum campaign that Britain could use some funds currently sent to Brussels to pay for its state-run health service.
Britons could also “fish our own fish”, cut sales-tax on domestic fuel and develop new regulations on stem cell technology, he said.
However, he was accused of failing to be honest with the public about any economic consequences of leaving the EU’s single market and customs union.
“The scaremongering, mistruths, lack of detail and utter disregard for the economic realities of Brexit were an alarming throwback to the referendum campaign,” said opposition Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna.
“More than 18 months since the referendum, this was simply more of the same Project Fantasy.”

LEADING BREXIT CAMPAIGNER Nigel Farage has accused top EU negotiator Michel Barnier of failing to understand why Britain voted to leave the European Union after the two men held their first official meeting today.
Farage also urged the former French minister to compromise, including on financial services in any future EU-UK trade deal, saying Britain had already given enough in negotiations.
“Mr Barnier clearly did not understand why Brexit happened,” Farage, the former head of the UK Independence Party (Ukip) and current member of the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter.
TwitterTwitter
Britain voted to leave the EU by a narrow 52 to 48% margin in June 2016 after a campaign in which Farage played a key role.
‘Not a happy new year’
Earlier today, Farage said in a video message: “He doesn’t understand for one moment that immigration was a big reason that we voted for Brexit. (It was) perfectly clear to me the British government hasn’t even discussed the subject with him so far.

He added that the chances of Britain leaving in March next year without an agreement on future relations with the EU — which would leave businesses subject to punishing World Trade Organisation tariffs — “will increase” without a compromise from Barnier.

Britain and the EU reached agreement in December on the terms of its exit from the bloc, including a multi-billion divorce bill.
They are expected to start talks in February on a transition phase after Britain leaves — the EU says it should last until the end of 2020 — during which most EU rules will still apply.
Negotiations on future trade and security relations are due to start in April, but the EU says it is impossible to agree on an actual trade deal until after Britain has formally left.
Barnier has travelled across Europe in recent months meeting governments to hear their wishes for the Brexit negotiations, but has also met several figures who are not directly involved in the talks, including British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-minister-varadkar-3534811-Aug2017/,"A FORMER UK Brexit Minister has said that former Taoiseach Enda Kenny was a lot more positive about finding solutions to the issue of a border in Northern Ireland after Brexit, and said that Leo Varadkar’s comments so far are “not terribly helpful”.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, David Jones MP said that “a technological solution” is required on the issues of the customs union and the Irish border, but said that Enda Kenny’s government appeared more receptive to finding a collaborative solution to the problem.
“I do detect a certain change of tone since Taoiseach Varadkar came to office,” he said. “I think that’s regrettable.”
When pushed on this comment, Jones said that it seemed to him that Kenny was “well disposed” to finding a technological solution butLeo Varadkar’s speech last week“appeared to rule that out”.
Varadkar had said that it was up to the UK to put forward solutions for the handling of the border between north and south in a post-Brexit world. He went on to say that the government’s position is that there should be no border, so it will not help in designing one.
Jones said that the British and Irish economies are very closely intertwined, and that the UK’s decision to leave the EU is something that should be addressed by both governments.
He said the impression he got from Kenny was that he was a lot more positive on finding “technological solutions” to the border issue.

Speaking at Queen’s University in Belfast last week, Varadkar said that the alternative to a customs union could mean a return of border posts, which he called “a brutal physical manifestation of historic divisions and political failure”.
He warned “the clock is ticking” to reach an agreement, as Britain began the two-year process of leaving the bloc in March.
When pressed on what these solutions could be, Jones referenced the border between the US and Canada, and Norway and Sweden.
Jones did, however, rule out similar posts at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
He also defended the British government’s approach to Brexit so far, despite admitting that there was no plan put in place before the referendum.
He is no longer a Brexit minister after he was subject to a reshuffle immediately after the general election. Jones said that, despite being moved out, the UK government’s overall approach had not changed.
The MP added that a lot of figures “had been plucked out of the air” when it came to the bill the UK would be required to pay when it leaves the EU.
He did dispute, however, that figures given on how much Britain sends to the EU every week – the £350 million that was quoted widely in the Brexit referendum campaign, for example – were incorrect.
TheJournal.iehas asked the Irish government press office for its response to the claim from Jones that the Taoiseach “may have regretted” his approach.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-3503193-Jul2017/,"BREXIT HAS UNDERMINED political stability and exacerbated cross-community divisions in Northern Ireland, a new report has found.
A report from the European Union Committee of the UK’s House of Lords said that Northern Ireland will be “profoundly affected by Brexit”.
It said there would be a significant impact on many aspects of life in the country including on cross-border trade, the agri-food sector, energy, transport, fisheries, access to EU labour, healthcare provision, tourism, and police and security cooperation.
The report looks at the impact Brexit will have on the UK’s devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It stated that political stability in Northern Ireland should not become the “collateral damage” of Brexit.
The report stated that “new uncertainty” had been created by the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive, the appointment of a new Taoiseach in Ireland, the DUP-Conservative arrangement and the fact that no Sinn Féin MPs had taken their seats in Westminster.
According to the authors all this underlines “the fragility of the political settlement in Northern Ireland”.

“A delicate equilibrium”
Northern Ireland has been a particular point of focus during negotiations between the UK and Europe over Brexit.
Concerns have been raised in relation to the special relationship between Ireland and the UK and the existence of the common travel area between the two countries.
Both Ireland and the UK don’t want a return to the “hard border” between the south and north of the island, however what will happen after Brexit remains an open issue.
In its report, the House of Lords said the Good Friday Agreement had created a “delicate equilibrium” in the North.
“It is imperative that Brexit does not weaken this equilibrium or the commitment and confidence of both unionist and nationalist communities in the political process,” it states.
The committee members said they were “heartened” by commitments from all sides of the Brexit negotiations to protect peace in the North.
The committee welcomed the European Council’s commitment to seek “flexible and imaginative solutions”.
It called on the UK government to with with the EU to identify these solutions.
In relation to other countries, the report expressed concern over a worsening on relations between Westminster and the Scottish government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-3-3621978-Sep2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said there’s a “better vibe” around Brexit negotiations but that a lot more work needs to be done to advance the tortuous process.
Varadkar was speaking on his way into meeting of EU leaders in Estonia at which they hope to speed up talks between the UK and the EU.
The leaders are set to decide at a summit on 19-20 October whether there has been “sufficient progress” on three key issues: the UK’s exit bill, the fate of Northern Ireland, and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.
Only when sufficient progress has been made on these issues will the divorce talks move onto the crucial issue of trade.
British politicians are keen to start talking about trade but European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said it would take “miracles” for that to happen next month.
“By the end of October we will not have sufficient progress,” Juncker said as he arrived for the second day of the summit.
Varadkar sounded more positive than Juncker but also stressed that trade talks are some way off.
“On Brexit there’s definitely a better vibe and a better mood coming out of negotiations between Michel Bariner and David Davis, but I think it’s still very evident that works need to be done,” Varadkar said.
European CommissionEuropean Commission
Despite the concerns, British Prime Minister Theresa May insisted there had been “very good progress” on the rights of EU expatriates, following a major Brexit speech she gave in Florence, Italy, last week.

“That has been part of the negotiations that we’ve had, very good progress has been made, that was made clear by the statements made by David Davis and Michel Barnier yesterday,” she said.
EU negotiator Barnier and his British counterpart Davis wrapped up a fourth round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels yesterday saying there had been progress following May’s speech, but with Barnier saying it could take “months” to move to trade discussions.

Varadkar was also asked about these issues given that many of these multinationals are based in Ireland.
“We discussed briefly the whole issue of digital taxation last night over dinner and the point that I made to other European leaders is that if we want to foster innovation and to make Europe a digital leader the solution isn’t more taxes and regulation,” Varadkar said.
He also denied that Ireland could be outnumbered by on the issue:
The leaders discussed the ideas — over courses of flank steak, salmon and rabbit liver — during a “good and constructive debate”, said European Council President Donald Tusk.

Fox said the cabinet had not agreed a deal on immigration once the UK is out of the European Union.
Hammond, however, said on Friday that there was “broad acceptance” in cabinet of a post-Brexit transitional period, extending current freedom of movement arrangements for up to three years.
This latest statement from Downing Street would suggest that free movement would end when the UK completes the planned two-year process of leaving the union.
Theresa May previously pledged that any travel changes would not affect Ireland and that Irish citizens would continue to enjoy freedom of travel to the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-victory-3754053-Dec2017/,"
AFTER A TURBULENT few months when some predicted she could be gone by Christmas, British Prime Minister Theresa May finally has some good news with a deal on Brexit — but any reprieve will likely be short-lived.
The EU’s decision yesterday to move to the next stage of negotiations with Britain was a much-needed success for May, whose leadership has been dogged by doubts since a disastrous snap election in June.
The approval followed an 11th-hour deal struck last week by the prime minister and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on the terms of the divorce, including Britain’s financial settlement.
It drew rare support from across all sections of May’s frequently divided Conservative party, and was agreed despite concerns in the Northern Irish party which props up her minority government.
But some key issues were left unresolved, while Britain is yet to set out what it wants from the future relationship with the European Union.
Cabinet ministers are due to discuss the subject formally next week.
A parliamentary defeat on the eve of the EU summit was a timely reminder of the opposition May faces to her Brexit strategy at home, as the negotiations enter what is likely to be the most challenging phase.
“The government has to decide what to ask for in phase two, which is going to be very difficult in itself,” said Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform.
“The British government is going to find that whatever it asks for, the EU is going to be tough,” he told AFP, adding: “I think there’s going to be a massive crisis.”
‘Formidable operator’
Daniel Leal-OlivasDaniel Leal-Olivas

May said the divorce agreement defied the doubters, and described the EU summit as “an important step on the road to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit”.
The agreement had almost collapsed following opposition from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party over the Irish border, sparking warnings about the fragility of May’s position and media reports of plots to oust her.

May has struggled to assert her authority since losing her parliamentary majority in June, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson openly challenging her Brexit strategy at one point.
But the deal was made, and despite the splits in her government — and two ministerial resignations over separate scandals last month — public support for May is holding firm.
A YouGov survey for The Times this week put approval ratings for her party at 42 percent, one point ahead of the main opposition Labour party.
She may face more trouble within her own party’s ranks.
Eleven Tory MPs joined with opposition parties on Wednesday to demand that parliament have the final say on the terms of the divorce, a move that has the potential to bind May’s hands.
But in a welcome move for her yesterday, Tory backbenchers tabled a new amendment to the draft withdrawal legislation on the exact timing of Brexit, which rebels are expected to support and should avert another House of Commons vote loss next week.
It proposes allowing ministers the flexibility to amend the date and time of Brexit, which the government wants to fix in law as 2300 GMT on March 29, 2019, but the rebels had opposed.
European leaders had sought to play down May’s parliamentary difficulties and hailed her leadership, with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte calling the prime minister a “formidable political operator”.
Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said that for both Brussels and the factions in the Conservative party, May provides a balance.
“European leaders recognise that she is their least worst option — if there were to be leadership contest in Britain they’ve got no idea who they would get,” he said.
And at home, as a pragmatic rather than idealistic supporter of leaving the EU, “she is the only alternative for both sides of the Brexit divide in the Conservative Party”.Hard decisions loom
But Bale warned that May’s position might not hold indefinitely as Britain prepares to withdraw by March 29, 2019.
“Decisions are going to have to be made in this phase, and some people are not going to like these decisions,” he said.
May says Britain will quit the EU’s single market and customs union, but forge a new “deep and special partnership” with as few barriers to trade as possible.
Options include following the model of a recent EU-Canada trade deal, or Norway’s membership of the European Economic Area — both of which would be controversial to sections of May’s Conservative party.
Chuka Umunna, a leading pro-European opposition MP, warned: “The clock is ticking, and we are far away from anything resembling a deal.”","7.35am, 16 Dec 2017",

https://www.thejournal.ie/blue-passport-brexit-3766216-Dec2017/,"UK PASSPORTS ARE set to become blue after Brexit, and the Sun has described it as a “stunning victory” for the newspaper.
In what the UK Home Office called a “move to symbolise our national identity” the cover will change from the burgundy colour it currently is.
Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said that leaving the EU would help Britain to “forge a new path for ourselves in the world” and this blue and gold-designed passport would be a part of that.
In its storyannouncing the news, The Sun said that the UK government had agreed to its demands to change the current design “enforced on the nation from 1988″.
It also said that people will be able to apply for the “iconic” passports that were “once famous across the globe” before their own expires.

From March 2019, the UK will still issue burgundy passports for a limited time, before switching to the dark blue ones.
Those blue passports were first issued in 1921, before EU passports were synchronised in colour in the 1980s.
The Home Office also said that the new passport will be “one of the most secure travel documents in the world, with a raft of new and updated security features and technologies to protect against fraud and forgery”.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May gave her backing to a legislative compromise allowing Brexit to be delayed, avoiding another parliamentary defeat while promising that pushing back the departure date would only happen in “exceptional circumstances”.
The comments came as the European Commission said that it wants a post-Brexit transition period, during which Britain must continue to obey EU rules, to finish at the end of 2020.
Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that “all EU policies will still apply” during the transition to a new relationship between London and Brussels following Britain’s exit from the union.

A&E Networks, which has channels like the History Channel have expressed interest in Ireland.
O’Keeffe said US channels tend not to go directly to the BAI, instead they go to consultant groups which act as a go-between.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-parliamentary-challenges-3697289-Nov2017/,"
BRITAIN’S GOVERNMENT HAS survived the first parliamentary challenges to its Brexit bill, as MPs began voting on various amendments tabled on the landmark legislation.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s minority government defeated an amendment backed by Welsh and Scottish lawmakers that would have given Britain’s devolved legislatures a veto over any final withdrawal agreement.
It won the vote – the first of many expected in the coming days and weeks as lawmakers debate some of the hundreds of amendments put forward – by a comfortable majority.
MPs also voted to keep the opening clause of the law, repealing the 1972 European Communities Act that took Britain into the bloc.
But May’s government, rocked by a string of scandals that forced out two ministers this month and divided by Brexit, faces potential defeats on other amendments ahead.
Earlier, lawmakers had their first chance to scrutinise the EU Withdrawal Bill, which would formally legislate for the end Britain’s membership and transpose four decades of European Union legislation into UK law.
They fired the opening salvos in what is expected to be a fraught parliamentary battle, with a heated debate on the date Britain leaves the EU — and whether to use London or Brussels time.
Legal certainty
MPs debated one of the government’s own motions — to enshrine in law the moment Britain leaves the EU as March 29, 2019 at 11pm in London and midnight in Brussels — but were not voting on the matter today.
In a bizarre twist, opposition Labour MP Frank Field proposed his own rival amendment to set the departure point one hour later at the start of March 30, 2019, but later withdrew it amid a lack of support.
Meanwhile a number of May’s own Conservative MPs oppose putting any date on the bill, saying it risks binding the government’s hands in negotiations with the EU.
Britain triggered the two-year Article 50 process of leaving the EU on March 29 this year, but this can be extended if all 28 EU member states including Britain agree.
Former finance minister Ken Clarke, a committed pro-European, said it would be “utterly foolish” not to leave this option open, however unlikely many commentators view it.
Advertisement
The bill — also known as the Repeal Bill — is intended to ensure legal certainty and avoid a damaging “cliff-edge” when Britain leaves the bloc.
But critics warn it represents a power-grab by allowing ministers to amend EU laws as they are transferred, while others see it as a chance to shape May’s Brexit policy.
May weakened
MPs also debated a Labour amendment — one of almost 200 pages tabled — to extend the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice into a post-Brexit transition period.
A vote on that amendment was expected late today.
The government said it wants an implementation period of around two years after Brexit — but insists Britain will be fully out of the EU by then.
The showdown comes as May, weakened by a June snap election in which she lost her parliamentary majority, struggles to assert her authority even over her own cabinet.
Two ministers have quit in the past fortnight — one over sleaze allegations, the other accused of effectively running her own foreign policy.
Two others, including leading eurosceptic Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, are reportedly instructing May how to run Brexit.
She is also under increasing pressure from Brussels to come up with a financial offer to keep negotiations on track, with a crunch summit of EU leaders looming in mid-December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon meanwhile has warned she will seek to block the bill unless changes are made to devolve more of the powers returned from Brussels.
“We oppose Brexit but we understand withdrawal legislation is necessary, so we want to find agreement,” Sturgeon said after talks with May.
A spokeswoman for May’s office said the prime minister stressed that as powers were repatriated from Brussels back to Britain, a significant number would be passed down to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

""That is definitely not a solution that we can possibly entertain"" – Taoiseach rules out US/Canada style borderpic.twitter.com/LA0mSdVfYQ
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that proposals from UK Prime Minister Theresa May for a US/Canada-style border in Northern Ireland after Brexit are “definitely not a solution”.
The Fine Gael leader was speaking this evening after May cited the US/Canada as an example to the House of Commons earlier as an example of “different arrangements for customs” that the UK was looking at post-Brexit.
Varadkar said this evening: “I didn’t hear those comments today… but I can say I visited the US/Canada border back in August and I saw a hard border with physical infrastructure.
Varadkar also retweeted a tweet he had sent last August at a US-Canada border crossing, where he had said at the time that it’s a “hard border”.

Responding to questioning from Labour MP Jenny Chapman, May had said: “There are many examples of different arrangements for customs around the rest of the world, and indeed we are looking at those, including for example the border between the United States and Canada.”

It was put to May that there are “guns and armed customs guards on that border – surely that is not what she has in mind? Can she perhaps find another example?”
She replied: “What I said is that we are looking at the border arrangements in a number of countries around the world.
Last Wednesday, the European Commission published draft text of what it is calling a Withdrawal Agreement. It is 118 pages long and includes a controversial protocol on Northern Ireland which is already a huge sticking point for the UK.
In the absence of a deal, it outlines how Northern Ireland would become part of the EU customs union to ensure no hard border will be established on the island.
British Prime Minister rejected that out of hand and said there would be no breaking up of the UK’s common market or a border running down the Irish Sea.
Last Friday, then, she reiterated her support for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, ensuring that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland.
Her proposals for how to do that – by way of either a customs partnership or special customs arrangement with specific exemptions for Northern Ireland – were the same as those dismissed by the EU last August.

On Saturday, Boulton had tweeted that “some of you Irish need to get over yourselves” and that “interviewing is about challenging the interviewee not respecting”, after criticism of an interview he carried out with Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.

Bored now. Some of you Irish need to get over yourselves. Interviewing is about challenging the interviewee not respecting.
On Friday, Boulton asked Coveney if he felt guilty over Ireland’s approach to Brexit negotiations.
Boulton was hit with a backlash of critical comments following his interview with Coveney, which sparked him to tweet his comment about Irish people.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourkethis morning, Boulton said that has had “absolutely no complaints at all” from Coveney or the Irish government over his comments.
When asked by O’Rourke if he had any regrets about sending the tweet, Boulton said:

“People appeared to feel justified simply because I had challenged an Irish minister in this context. I felt that what they were saying was tedious, which is why I said I was bored now.”

In his interview with Coveney, Boulton asked: “Do you think that this week’s kerfuffle has been necessary? Do you feel slightly guilty that perhaps the Irish government over-briefed what had been achieved as a victory over the British for the European Union?”
Coveney responded by saying: “We never looked for or claimed any victory over anybody.
“We have been saying for months now that we want to work with the British government to try to find a way forward that can reassure people in Ireland as well as the UK that we can manage Brexit and we can limit damage in the way that’s now in this agreement.”
Justifying his use of the word kerfuffle in his interview with O’Rourke this morning, Boulton said that “it was not in any way used to diminish the importance of the issues at stake”.
“[It was] simply to say that, frankly, we ended up on Friday where we had been on Monday. So you might think that it was in process terms, not in substance terms, all a bit of fuss about nothing.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passports-demand-uk-north-3800897-Jan2018/,"PASSPORT DEMAND FROM the UK has reached record demand.
The demand has risen ahead of Brexit as UK citizens race to keep their freedom of movement around the EU.
The figures come from a parliamentary answer issued to Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien.
They show that for the first time ever, the number of passport applications received from Britain has exceeded the number received from the North- 81,287 and 80,964 respectively.
Last month, the Passport Service’s figures shows that 20% of all those passports issued last year went to Irish citizens in the north and Britain.

O’Brien said:
“Since 2012, the number of applications for a Republic of Ireland passport from Northern Ireland has more than doubled.
“Many are now applying for a passport out of fear as opposed to requirement or necessity. The total number of Irish passport applications received from Northern Ireland and Britain is just over 160,000 and this is likely to have increased by the end of 2017.
“It is probable that changes will need to be made to procedures in order to cater for this increased level of demand and I intend to explore what additional resources will be available with the Foreign Affairs Minister.”
The Passport Service has undertaken what Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has described as an “ambitious reform programme to meet the unprecedented demand for passports from Irish citizens at home and abroad”, which is also looking at how to “continuously strengthen systems guarding against fraud and protecting the integrity of the Irish passport”.
To cope with the demand, it launched anonline passport renewal servicein March last year. This enables Irish citizens to renew their passport online, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/guy-vorhofstadt-3608415-Sep2017/,"EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BREXIT negotiator Guy Verhofstadt has hit out against Boris Johnson for denouncing some British people who want to “keep their European identity”.
Addressing a joint sitting of the Oireachtas Committees on European Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, Verhofstadt said:
“I know some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their countrymen and women for wanting to keep their European identity.
“He accused them even of split allegiance. I think this is a binary, old fashioned and reductionary definition of identity. So I think it’s nonsense to talk about split allegiance.”
Johnson recently wrote a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph in which he urged Britain tomake a clean break with the European Unionafter Brexit andcriticised young people for having “split allegiances”.
Verhofstadt said it is his view that identities are multi-layered and complex and that “should bring people together not divide them”.
He said it is “perfectly possible to feel English, British and European at the same time” in the same way that many other Europeans also identify with their national identity.
Guy Verhofstadt addressing the Dáil today.
He told the Dáil today that Europe will never allow Ireland to suffer because of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.
“What we will never allow is that Ireland will suffer from the British decision to leave the EU,” he said.
“That is a commitment that has been made by the European parliament and by the EU as a whole.”
“Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit,” he said, adding that Irish interests are a top priority for Europe.
He added that Ireland will not be used as a “bargaining chip” in the negotations. The reemergence of border question was not caused Ireland or the rest of the Europe, but by Britain’s choice to leave the EU, said the Belgian MEP.
A resolution to the border question is entirely the responsibility of Britain, he said.

“It is up to them to come up with a workable solution,” said Verhofstadt, adding that Britain must have a soft border with Northern Ireland.
“One way or another it [Northern Ireland] should remain part of Customs Union and the single market,” he said, stating that it is “nonsense” and “crazy” to put forward an idea of restricted movement.

Solidarity-PBP Richard Boyd Barrett,who previously questioned Michel Barnier(the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator) on similar issues, asked how Ireland could trust the EU in light of Ireland being punished for the banking collapse.
“I have no doubt of the stupidity and obnoxiousness of the Tory position, but how can we take you seriously when you say that you will not allow the punishment of Ireland,” he asked.
“We know the Irish people have made choice to remain at the core of Europe, we will never let them down,” said Verhofstadt.
He added that Brexit has offered an “ideal” moment to look at reforming Europe.
“It is something we need to do as well… it is the ideal moment now to reflect,” he said, highlighting that Europe needs to be strong on the world’s stage to fight against its challenges and fight against President Donald Trump’s protectionism.
He said people have started to vote pro-European again, but said this was not to say everyone was in favour of the EU in its current state, adding that the people of Europe are saying: “we will give you one last chance to make it work, to make Europe work.”
Concluding his speech to the Dáil he said be believed it is achievable, quoting a Seamus Heaney line:
“We believe that a further shore is reachable from here.”

There was some controversy prior to Verhofstadt’s visit today, with members of the Dáil debating yesterday whether MEPs and MPs could address the chamber.
While the visit is welcome, Sinn Féin said it was disappointed that MPs and MEPs were denied speaking rights despite some being members of the Good Friday Agreement Committee.
“The decision to deny speaking rights to Irish MPs flies in the face of the need for an all-Ireland approach to Brexit,” said Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard.
The party challenged the Ceann Comhairle on the decision and has sought legal advice.

He calls the European Union Withdrawal Bill “the worst legislation of my lifetime” and says he feels “duty bound to oppose it relentlessly from the Labour benches”.
He accuses the British government of “hurtling towards the EU’s emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European cooperation”.
Adonis also describes Putin and the rise of authoritarian nationalism in Poland and Hungary as “flashing red lights”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/conservative-mep-explains-why-he-took-out-and-irish-passport-3582440-Sep2017/,"A BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MEP who has secured an Irish passport in the wake of the Brexit referendum has described Ireland as a “godsend” for allowing him to remain an EU citizen even after the UK leaves the union.
Charles Tannock, a Conservative Party MEP for London, said today that he is “very grateful to Ireland” after being granted a passport by virtue of his grandmother, who was born in Dublin in 1895.
“I can still be European, and it enables me to enjoy the rights which unfortunately are going to be denied to many millions of Brits who voted to remain in the European Union to live, work and study throughout 27 countries, including the Republic of Ireland.”
The MEP was speaking on RTÉ’sToday with Sean O’Rourke, where he admitted he would not have pursued an Irish passport had Britain not left the EU – partly because the process was “lengthy” but also because “if Britain had stayed in the European Union I would still be proud of my Irish heritage but I wouldn’t have needed the passport to prove it”.

Tannock has been vocal against Brexit, and described being a member of the Conservative Party as a result as “a difficult place to be”.

Tannock also justified remaining a member of the party, which has been criticised for its hard-line approach to Brexit talks.
“I think if people like me leave then the Tory party would be devoid of all the moderates who are pro-European who want to bring a balance to the debate within the party.”
While he has considered leaving, and has been approached by other parties, Tannock insists that he will stay a member: “I do feel there is a need for moderate pro-European conservatives.”
Tannock was critical of the government’s approach to Brexit, stating that a softer Brexit, that would see the UK remain part of the customs unions, would solve many of the problems their exit is causing.
“We may be heading to a train crash of no deal whatsoever.”
On Northern Ireland, he said he did not believe Theresa May’s proposals for a “frictionless” border, which would rely on technology, would be successful. Introducing such a system, he said, would be “very difficult” and was likely to become a “recipe for smuggling”.
The Department of Foreign Affairs’websiteclarifies who is entitled to an Irish passport, and includes an FAQ section for people born in Britain. It explains:
The demand for Irish passports has risen dramatically in the wake of the Brexit referendum, with over65,000 applications waiting to be processedin June of this year.

UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson says that Britain and the EU will ‘work together’ to solve any issues that may arise of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic post-Brexit.
What exactly Britain is planning to do with the border once its exit from the EU becomes official in 2019 is still very much up in the air.
Yesterday, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in no uncertain terms that Britain would not be allowed to use the Irish border as a ‘test case’ for how it conducts its exit talks with the union.

Today, however, Johnson told AFP during a visit to British troops at a NATO base in Tallinn, Estonia: ”It’s certainly a problem we can all solve together and that’s what we’re going to do.”
“It is not beyond the wit of man,” he said.
In its position paper last month, Britain said the issue of how goods and people will move across the Irish frontier cannot be separated from discussion about wider customs arrangements between Britain and the European Union.
The EU has refused to broach any aspect of the future trade relationship until Brexit talks have achieved sufficient progress on citizen’s rights, the Irish border and Britain’s financial bill to leave the EU.

UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson held a joint press conference with Irish counterpart Simon Coveney in Dublin this morning and differences between their relative positions were evident.
Coveney reiterated the Irish position that a transitionary period of “four or five years” is preferable for new trade arrangements after Brexit while Johnson said he feels a new relationship could be forged “on a much shorter timescale”.
The pair were meeting at the Department of Foreign Affairs on an important day for Ireland-UK relations with leaders Leo Varadkar and Theresa May also meeting in Sweden.
At a Brexit-focused event in Dublin last night hosted by business group Ibec, Coveney said that “these aren’t the easiest times” for relations between the two nations. He also made remarks favouring the longer transitional period.
At this morning’s press conference, Johnson said he feels the timescale is too lengthy that negotiations should be moved forward.
“I must confess that I wasn’t aware of the proposal from Simon for such a long transition period, but I think I understand the sentiment behind it,” Johnson said.
Before UK-EU negotiations move onto the crucial issue of trade, parties must agree that sufficient progress has been made on three key issues: the UK’s exit bill, the fate of Northern Ireland, and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.
Johnson said that he wants the talks to move onto this phase, arguing that the post-Brexit relationship between Ireland and the UK can be discussed as part of wide trade negotiations.
“The issues of the Northern Irish border and how it works are intellectually, intimately bound up with the questions of the custom union, single-market, Britain’s relationship with those and those questions have been reserved by the commission for study in stage two of the negotiations,” he said.

Coveney disagreed with Johnson and said that talks are not yet at that point.

“The EU taskforce has said that there are parameters around which we need to find solutions, and the details of that will be in phase two, I am sure. But those parameters need to be a lot clearer and a lot clearer before we can move on to phase two,” Coveney said.
Ireland’s Foreign Minister also took issue with a description used by Johnson, saying that “we’re in the meat of the negotiations right now on certain issues”.
“What we have said is that by all means we want to get into the meat of the discussions on trade, we think it’s possible within 12 months to put a framework agreement in place in terms of what the future relationship might look like, but we also think it’s going to take a number of years to finalise the detail of that.” Coveney added.

Despite both parties being in different places in their view of the negotiations, Johnson said again that ”the British government has absolutely no interest in any kind of hard border”.
“That is the last thing we want to see as a result of this exercise,” he added.
The meeting coincides with talks taking place between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Sweden.
The pair are in Gothenburg for an EU summit meeting but are also meeting bilaterally to discuss Brexit.

The Taoiseach’s department has said that Varadkar  “will emphasise the importance of upholding all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement including the power sharing institutions, and will continue to urge the Northern Ireland parties to reach agreement”.
This meeting with the prime minister comes in advance of December’s meeting of the European Council where a decision will be taken on whether or not to progress to the next phase of Brexit negotiations.
The Taoiseach is expected to emphasise at the meeting that progress is possible in December but only if all sides show sufficient political will.

https://www.thejournal.ie/philip-hammond-uk-chancellor-enemy-eu-brexit-3646079-Oct2017/,"

Sky News/ YouTube
BRITAIN’S FINANCE CHIEF quickly backed away from comments that risked inflaming the Brexit talks today, saying he regretted describing the European Union as “the enemy” during an earlier television interview.
Chancellor Philip Hammond retreated from the potentially volatile comments moments after they aired on Sky News, saying on Twitter that he was “making the point that we are united at home. I regret I used a poor choice of words.”
He added that they would work with their “friends and partners” in the EU towards a Brexit deal, finishing the message off with the hashtag “no enemies here”.

We will work with our friends and partners in the EU on a mutually beneficial Brexit deal#noenemieshere(2/2).
Hammond’s comments came hours after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker suggested that delays in the talks were due to Britain’s failure to meet EU demands that it meet all financial commitments that it made as a member of the bloc.
“They have to pay,” Juncker told students in his native Luxembourg. “If you are sitting in a bar and if you are ordering 28 beers and then suddenly one of your colleagues is leaving and is not paying — that’s not feasible.”
The tit-for-tat came after Hammond was sharply criticized by members of his own Conservative government for his cheerless approach to Brexit — the British departure from the EU. Some have accused Hammond of talking down the British economy.

While attending a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Hammond told Sky News that British officials should put their differences aside and work together on Brexit. The real opponents were in Brussels, he said.
Various EU estimates suggest that Britain’s divorce bill could amount to between €60 billion to €100 billion. The British government has rejected such numbers.

Juncker’s comments came as EU leaders, without British Prime Minister Theresa May, prepare next week to launch preliminary talks on the outline of the EU-UK relationship once Britain leaves the bloc on 29 March 2019.
In a draft summit statement seen by the Associated Press, the leaders direct EU ministers and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier “to start internal preparatory discussions” on future ties.
This would allow the EU to move quickly on elements like trade relations if negotiators make “sufficient progress” on the terms of the EU-UK divorce agreement by December.Negotiations are moving slowly. EU leaders insist progress must be made on Britain’s divorce bill, the rights of citizens hit by Brexit and the future state of the border in Ireland.
The leaders, who meet in Brussels on 19 and 20 October and again in mid-December, have refused to talk about future relations until that happens.
In the draft text, which could be modified, the leaders note that “while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.”
Victoria Honeyman, a professor of politics at the University of Leeds, said that she believed Hammond’s remarks were directed at the EU machinery led by Barnier, rather than at the leaders of the member states, such as German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Given what others in May’s Cabinet, such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have said about the EU, it’s unlikely Hammond will get more than a slap on the wrist. The comments may even help EU negotiators.
“It gives you an insight into how things are going from the British perspective,” Honeyman said. “It’s kind of a Freudian slip of how they feel about the situation.”

Coveney was speaking in Brussels as the UK and the EU launched a fresh round of formal Brexit negotiations that will include a focus on the Irish border.
Asked about his view on the potential for technological alternative to a hard border, Coveneytold RTÉ Newsthat such a solution would not work.
“What we do not want to pretend [is that] we can solve the problems of the border on the island of Ireland through technical solutions like cameras and pre-registration and so on. That is not going to work,” he said.
Brussels is insisting that discussions on the future relationship between the EU and the UK must wait until make progress on a number of key issues surrounding Britain’s withdrawal.

These issues include an estimated €100 billion exit bill, the rights of three million EU citizens living in the UK and the Irish border.
Also speaking in Brussles was irish Agriculture Minister Michael Creed who said that it is imperative that some clarity is delivered soon:
During four days of talks this week spearheaded by the UK’s Brexit Minister David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier, both sides are aiming to make significant progress.
Barnier, who has repeatedly called on Britain to set out a full divorce strategy, said they needed to “examine and compare our respective positions in order to make good progress.”
“We’ll now delve into the heart of the matter,” Barnier, a former French foreign minister and European Commissioner, told reporters.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tony-blair-jeremy-corbyn-3781334-Jan2018/,"TONY BLAIR HAS launched a fresh attack on the direction of the Labour Party he used to lead, saying he disagrees with its Brexit position both “strategically” and “tactically”.
The former three-term UK Prime Ministerused the website of his think tankto say that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour would be “the handmaiden of Brexit” if it continued along its current path.
Blair feels that the UK people should be able to vote again on Brexit after the final deal is agreed with the EU.
Blair said today that Labour should be actively challenging Brexit rather than its current position of opposing the Brexit plans as laid out by UK Prime Minister Theresa May.
The Labour Party are not in favour of a second referendum, unlike the Liberal Democrats which are pushing for a rerun vote.
May’s government is negotiating exit plans and the outlines of a new trade relationship with the EU with an eye toward departing the bloc by a March 2019 deadline.
Blair and other opponents argue that voters should be able to review these terms and decide whether to go ahead rather than be bound by the 2016 referendum.
“I’m simply saying one very, very simple thing, which is that in 2016 you knew you wanted to get out of the European Union but you didn’t see the terms of the alternative relationship,” Blair later told the BBC Radio.
Current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticised by many Remainers, both inside his party and out, for not campaigning strongly enough in favour of Britain’s continued membership of the EU.

Some commentators have argued, however, that Corbyn’s perceived suspicion of the EU helped Labour win support from some Brexit-leaning voters in last year’s general election.
Although Corbyn’s party did not win last year’s election, he increased Labour’s vote share by the biggest margin for 70 years.
But Blair, who has long been skeptical of Corbyn’s leadership, insists that Labour should be doing more to fight Brexit.
“I would like the Labour Party to be on the high ground of progressive politics, explaining why membership of the European Union is right as a matter of principle, for profound political as well as economic reasons,” Blair wrote.

Blair argues that the focus of May’s government is on Brexit and that, by not opposing it, Labour are hamstrung in how they can attack her government’s policies.
“Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100%. Show people why Brexit isn’t and never was the answer,” he adds.
Blair’s popularity in the UK was hit following his decision to take the country into the 2003 Iraq War and due to the arguments he made in its favour.
Since Brexit he has been more vocal on domestic politics but has not formally reentered the political arena.

He toldThe Andrew Marr Show on BBC 1: “This was a statement of intent more than anything else. Much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing.”
His statement resulted in a spokesperson for the Irish government stating last night that Ireland and the EU would hold the UK to the Brexit agreement.
However, trying to calm issues this morning,Davis told LBC radiothat his comments had been misunderstood.

He said he had meant that the UK would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland even if a final deal did not happen.
“I said this was a statement of intent, which was much more than just legally enforceable,” he said, adding:
When asked about the clarification this morning, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was “delighted” to hear of Davis’ remarks this morning, adding that he was “very happy with the clarification”.
At the same event, Health Minister Simon Harris said Davis’ comments at the weekend were “unhelpful” and said the Brexit agreement is binding.
Earlier this morning, Northern Ireland Secretary, James Brokenshire, said Friday’s border deal was not legally binding.
However, he toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthat it is a “solid commitment” by the UK.

EU PRESIDENT DONALD Tusk has dismissed plans for post-Brexit relations, reportedly devised by the British government, as “based on pure illusion”.
Tusk said European Union leaders would push ahead with the release of their own red lines for the negotiations at a summit in March, whether Britain is ready or not.
Tusk’s comments came after Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet agreed Britain’s plans for the future relationship at a marathon meeting. She is due to unveil them in a speech next Friday.
One British minister, who was not present during Friday’s cabinet talks in London, said they had agreed that Britain would seek to align itself with European Union rules in certain sectors of the economy, but will retain the right to diverge in other areas.
“I’m glad that the UK government seems to be moving towards a more detailed position,” said Tusk, who will meet May in London the day before her speech.
“However if the media reports are correct I am afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion,” the European Council president told a press conference after a summit in Brussels.
“It looks like the cake philosophy is still alive,” he said, referring to earlier comments by British officials that they wanted to “have their cake and eat it” when it came to leaving the EU’s single market and enjoying its benefits.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker then wryly told the assembled reporters: “The president of the council was offering you the headline for tomorrow.”

Their comments capped a day of digs at the British side in the increasingly tense negotiations over Britain’s planned departure from the European Union in March 2019.
Juncker took a swipe at former British prime minister David Cameron, who opposed Juncker’s appointment in 2014 but lost his own job two years later after losing the Brexit referendum he had himself called.
“Where is Mr Cameron now?” the former Luxembourg premier said.
“I have heard some rumours that he is in a quiet, comfortable position,” quipped Tusk.
Juncker had earlier jokingly suggested that he could do the job better.
“I am not the British prime minister, it would be good for Britain if I was it, but I am not,” Juncker told a reporter who quizzed him on when he expected to get details of the outcome of the British cabinet meeting.
May is under pressure to set out more details of her position before talks get underway on the future partnership in April, with Brussels warning that Britain cannot have everything it wants.
The British Prime Minister gathered around a dozen of her senior Cabinet colleagues for eight hours of talks at her country retreat Chequers yesterday, in a bid to thrash out their considerable differences.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who has called for a clean break with Brussels, and Finance Minister Philip Hammond, who favours closer ties, were among those present.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-border-coveney-sun-story-3691744-Nov2017/,"THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Minister has called a story in today’s UK Sun “nonsense”.
Simon Coveney responded on Twitter to the paper’s story headlined “IRA’s political wing Sinn Fein to blame for new Brexit standoff over Northern Ireland border, ministers say”.
The story outlined how UK minister told the paper that Leo Varadkar had been forced to harden his stance on the post-Brexit border “under heavy political pressure from Gerry Adams’ Sinn Fein”.
It reads:
Former Cabinet minister and DexEU committee member John Whittingdale said: “If the Taoiseach takes the view that protecting his political flank is his priority, he must understand that there will be no deal.
“Sinn Fein should not be trying to profit from making a Brexit deal very hard to reach.”

The piece does not mention whether it asked the Irish government for comment, but Coveney shot back.
Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams TD, Michelle O’Neill MLA and party Vice President Mary Lou McDonald, who are in New York, yesterday held a 20-minute phone conversation with the British Prime Minister Theresa May on the current situation in the north.
Yesterday, an internal EU paper was published which suggested that it is essential for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and the customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The paper suggests that the EU’s guiding principles underlined that an important part of political economic, security, societal and agricultural activity on the island of Ireland currently operates on a cross-border basis, “underpinned by joined EU membership of the EU and Ireland.”
Both the EU and the UK have already committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, the paper says.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-boris-johnson-3635950-Oct2017/,"
A DEVASTATING ELECTION and a high-profile speech strewn with mishaps have ignited a leadership crisis for British Prime Minister Theresa May at a critical time as Brexit negotiators push for a deal in Brussels.
A plot by a group of Conservative MPs to oust May was exposed on Friday, reviving memories of the backstabbing that led to Margaret Thatcher’s ousting in 1990.
Many colleagues publicly condemned the attempt and backed their leader, but the Sunday Times has reported that at least three cabinet ministers have discussed the need to replace her this week.
Parliament returns tomorrow and May is expected to announce a number of policy initiatives in a bid to reassert her authority, while there are also rumours of a cabinet reshuffle.
She will also need some progress in the deadlocked Brexit negotiations which resume tomorrow.
May has struggled since June when her gamble in calling an election to cement her power backfired spectacularly and she lost her parliamentary majority.
For many Conservatives, it is now a question of when, not if, she steps down ahead of the next election in 2022 — and the date most often mentioned is 2019, when Britain is expected to leave the European Union (EU).
“Getting rid of her is like going to the dentist,” a government minister was quoted by the Sun as saying.
However, Culture Secretary Karen Bradleytold Sky Newsmore than 90% of Tory MPs support May, adding that the Prime Minister will “absolutely” still be in office at Christmas.
“This is a woman who puts public service and the country before anything else, she is as resilient as anybody. I’m absolutely certain she will keep on going,” Bradley said.
Reshuffle rumours
There have been reports of bitter divisions for weeks and speculation has swirled over whether Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson might mount a leadership bid after his contrary interventions in the Brexit debate.
Johnson pledged his loyalty to the prime minister this weekend, but his erratic behaviour has drawn widespread criticism and accusations of betrayal.
Other potential successors include Home Secretary Amber Rudd, while Brexit Secretary David Davis and First Secretary of State Damian Green are seen as possible place-holders until after Brexit.

Newspaper reports today suggest that May is considering a reshuffle of her cabinet in which she would promote a younger generation of MPs.
“Part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party,” she told the Sunday Times.
The newspaper said Johnson could be demoted in the reshuffle, which it said was planned for after the European summit on 19 and 20 October.
Britain had hoped EU leaders would use that meeting to agree to the next stage of talks on future Britain-EU trade ties, but this seems unlikely.
EU officials say Britain has so far not made sufficient progress on preliminary negotiations centring on the divorce bill, despite May’s push for a breakthrough with her Florence speech last month.
‘This cannot go on’
Thwarted in Brussels, May had hoped to revive her fortunes at last week’s party conference.
But her keynote speech was disrupted by a serial prankster who handed her an end of employment form, and she then suffered a series of coughing fits that made her combative message barely audible.
The sense of chaos only heightened when letters from the slogan ‘Building a Country that Works for Everyone’ started falling off the board behind her.
“The sense that this cannot go on may now overwhelm her,” wrote Times columnist Philip Collins, one of a growing number of commentators saying that the leadership crisis has finally come to a head.
Pro-Brexit MPs do not want another leadership election to slow down the process, and there are fears the lack of party unity could hand power to opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
But Iain Begg, a politics professor at the London School of Economics, said the current climate had “an echo” of the 1990 demise of Thatcher at the hands of Conservative plotters.
That ousting was in turn followed by recriminations over Europe in the 1990s under John Major that eventually led to Labour’s Tony Blair taking office in 1997.
“If the wind goes against Theresa May she could be finished by as early as next week. But if the cabinet is behind her, she will survive,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/esri-report-growth-economy-3747487-Dec2017/,"A NEW REPORT from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) says the Irish economy will have another year of strong recovery and growth this year and next.
The ESRI, an economic think tank, expects unemployment rates to fall to around 5% in 2018.
The reportsays the pace of growth in 2017 and the expected performance in 2018 means that “crucial policy challenges” are likely to arise in the coming years.
The economy is expected to grow by about 5% this year, and just over 4% next year, as a result of strong growth in jobs and tax revenue.
Putting this into context, the European Union is expected to grow by less than 1.9% for the same period.
Brexit impact
The report points out that much of the Irish growth is due to domestic factors with investment and consumption contributing strongly.
However, the forecast isn’t a wholly positive one, as Brexit looks like it will have a significant impact on many sectors. The ERSI notes negative investment levels in the food and agricultural sector over the past 18 months.
Brexit could also affect the performance of the UK economy, the report warns.

It notes the recent downward revision of the UK forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s Fiscal Watchdog.
“This illustrates the precarious nature of the UK economy, especially given the uncertainty of the Brexit outcome,” the report said.
Along with the uncertainty of Brexit, while the Irish banking sector continues to recover from the post-2008 financial sector downturn, a number of key areas where difficulties remain with financing conditions are highlighted within the report.
In particular, differences are still apparent between comparable European and domestic mortgage and consumer interest rates.
“This may be a contributing factor to the declining investment rates observed in certain key indigenous sectors of the domestic economy,” the report said.
Irish economy
The ERSI report includes a research note by professors Kieran McQuinn of ESRI and Karl Whelan of UCD, on Europe’s long-term growth prospects.
They note that growth rates for both the EU and Euro Area, which had been negative as recently as 2012 and 2013 respectively, have over the past three years averaged 1.7% per annum.
However, they found that the recent recovery is more of a “cyclical development” reflecting a decline in the relatively high unemployment rates, which had persisted since the international financial downturn.
The falling working-age population within the Euro Area, a lack of increase in hours worked, the lack of investment during the recession, and a weak total factor productivity growth have all suggested an average GDP growth rate of just 0.6% over the next 10 years.
“The findings are sobering for those expecting economic growth to deal with the Euro Area’s debt problems in the coming decades,” the professors said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-ireland-northern-ireland-3738759-Dec2017/,"THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has announced it is recommending to the European Council that “sufficient progress” has been made in the first phase of Brexit talks – but what does this mean for Ireland?
Speaking at a press conference in Brussels this morning, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that negotiations had been “difficult” for the UK and the EU.
However, he said that “we have the breakthrough we needed” and is positive the EU27 will open Phase 2 of Brexit talks.
Also speaking this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed there would be “no hard border” and that “the integrity” of Northern Ireland will be retained.
So, what does the deal that has been reached say about Ireland and Northern Ireland?
This morning’s publication of the joint report confirms that it’s all but certain that EU27 leaders will accept and approve the agreement on Thursday. This will mark a significant step forward in months of tense negotiations to make it possible for UK withdrawal in March 2019.
The new text confirms that the Good Friday Agreement reached on 10 April 1998 must be protected in all its parts.
It reads:
The text says that the UK remains committed to protecting North-South cooperation to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border.
The issue of Northern Ireland remaining within the EU’s customs union and internal market has been somewhat of a sticking point in crunch talks over the past few weeks.
However, it’s clear this morning that the EU and UK have agreed to work together to retain the current customs union status of Northern Ireland, while the rest of the UK departs.

The EU and UK have agreed to maintain the Good Friday Agreement’s recognition that the birthright of all people of Northern Ireland to choose to be Irish or British or both and be accepted as such.
The people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in Northern Ireland.
The Brexit agreement will respect the opportunity and identity that comes with European Union citizenship. The next phase of negotiations will examine arrangements required to give effect to the access to their EU rights, opportunities and benefits.
Following on from this, the text confirms that the EU and UK will agree that Britain and Ireland will continue to make arrangements between themselves in regards to the movement of people between their territories – the Common Travel Area.
If a final agreement is not reached between the UK and EU, the UK has agreed it will maintain “full alignment” with the rules of the customs union and internal market which support North-South cooperation.
The text also outlines that, in the absence of an agreement, the UK will take the following steps:
The text’s mention of Ireland and the UK wrapped up noting Ireland’s involvement in Phase 2 of negotiations.
It says that, given the specific nature of issues related to Ireland and Northern Ireland, both parties agree that the next phase will continue to address issues arising from Ireland’s unique geographical situation, including the transit of goods to and from Ireland via the UK.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney expressed his satisfaction with the deal.
“We want to be able to assure people – North and South – that there will not be the reemergence of a border again… We made it clear we couldn’t move onto Phase 2. We needed assurance,” Coveney said.
He said that the UK will be able to negotiate a new trade relationship that will solve the border issues.
“If that isn’t possible, this language says very clearly that the British government will put forward bespoke solutions to solve the unique Irish challenges,” he said.
“There will be in no circumstance a need to reintroduce border checks… This is something we’ve insisted on.”

Rhodri Philipps, 50, the 4th Viscount St Davids, made the threat in November, just days after Miller won a legal case requiring the government to consult parliament before beginning Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. He wrote:
He described Miller, who was born in what was then British Guiana, as a “boat jumper” and added, “If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles.”

Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot said the comments were racially aggravated and warned Philipps – who is also known as Lord St Davids – faces jail when he is sentenced tomorrow.
In a statement read to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Monday, Miller said the comments left her “very scared for the safety of herself and her family”.
Prosecuting lawyer Philip Stott said, “She took the threat seriously, and it contributed to her employing professional security for her protection.”
Philipps, who lives in the exclusive London district of Knightsbridge, accepted writing the posts but said they were not menacing and were not publicly visible. Prosecutors said they were.
Miller was subjected to torrents of abuse for her legal challenge, which critics took as an attempt to block Brexit. The government began the process of leaving the EU in March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-donald-tusk-talks-ireland-3726858-Dec2017/,"EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk is to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar later today, as Brexit talks rumble on.
Tusk and Varadkar are expected to discuss the border issue, the rights of EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit and the UK’s financial situation.
Talks between the UK, Ireland and the EU have become increasingly tense in the lead up a crucial EU Summit later this month and Monday’s meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker.
The Northern Ireland border has proved to be a significant sticking point in negotiation talks in recent weeks, with political parties here more or less united on the issue.
However, the UK – for its part – wants to leave the EU customs union and the single market, but also doesn’t want a hard border. So far, these positions have been irreconcilable.
The UK wants to progress negotiations to crucial issues of trade deals after Brexit, arguing that the border issues will be ironed out as these negotiations progress. Both Ireland and the EU are looking for firmer commitments from the UK before talks can move on.

The head of the largest group in the European Parliament has said there can be no progress made in phase two of the Brexit negotiations if the UK doesn’t provide assurances on the border issue.
Speaking toRTÉ News, German MEP Manfred Weber said that the Irish issue is of equal importance to the other key issues of Britain’s financial situation and the rights of EU citizens.
Conflicting views
This week, DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr said that Northern Ireland shouldn’t remain in the customs union or have a “special status” after Brexit.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Paisley Jr said that all of the UK would be leaving the customs’ union and single market but that didn’t mean that border posts would be necessary.
He also said that, while he respected Ireland’s position, the country “would be better off” leaving the EU, adding that “we could do an awful lot more together”.
Speaking Wednesday’s on BBC’s Newsnight, Ireland’s Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said Ireland had put forward what it wanted, and now it was time for the UK to come up with a reasonable offer.
“What’s clearly incumbent on Theresa May and her government and her negotiating team is to articulate an alternative which doesn’t give rise to a hard border because everybody is agreed that we do not want a hard border,” he said.

Varadkar says she boycotts the launches of homes he goes to because they are not built directly from by a local authority. But he says they are real homes to the people that are living in them.
Varadkar says he would look at Damastown proposal and her claim that it would pay for itself. He says he doubts that, but if that is the case, this government would be mad not to consider it.
He asks her to reconsider her position that just because houses are not built by local authorities they are not social housing units. He says there are a number of housing charities that build homes which are social houses.
That’s it for Leaders’ Questions today.

Anne Marie Morris issued an apology after using the word in a discussion about Brexit at an event in London.
The Newton Abbot MP said that UK leaving the EU without a deal would be a “real n***** in the woodpile”, according to a recording published on theHuffington Post.

The UK Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered the Conservative party’s chief whip to suspend Morris.
Announcing the suspension, Theresa May said she was “shocked” by the “completely unacceptable” language. In a statement she said:

This, however, has been thrown into doubt in recent weeks, with Britain remaining committed to leaving the single market and customs union.

Yesterday, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that if the UK follows through with this, there’s no other option but for there to be a hard border.
The government has said repeatedly that the return of a border would be the worst-case scenario in a hard Brexit, and would have a hugely detrimental effect on Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-letter-taoiseach-brexit-3743186-Dec2017/,"AROUND 200 INFLUENTIAL figures have written to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to ask that he protect the rights of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland.
The list of signatories include Olympic boxers Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan, and Irish international soccer player James McClean.
Published inthe Irish News today, the open letter asks that “Irish cultural traditions and Irish national identity” be protected at a time when “Brexit threatens to reinforce partition on this island and revisit a sense of abandonment as experienced by our parents and grandparents”.
“The fact that the majority of voters in the north of Ireland voted to remain will not be ignored,” it states.
The letter appeals to the Taoiseach for reassurance that he will protect the rights and security of citizens in Northern Ireland.
The list of signatories to the letter includes figures representing a wide range of sectors including the arts, business, education, health, law, media, sport and academia.
Last week, the EU and UK struck a deal on future arrangements on what will happen to the Irish border after Brexit.
Despite some to-ing and fro-ing, the deal reached ensured that there would be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland that would ensure hard infrastructure wouldn’t be needed along the Irish border.
A commitment was also made, at the request of the DUP, that this alignment wouldn’t “compromise” the United Kingdom.
Upon the announcement that a deal had been made, Varadkar confirmed that he was “satisfied sufficient progress” had been made on Irish issues. He said the established rights of people in Northern Ireland, which had been secured in the Good Friday Agreement and other arrangements, to hold an Irish/EU passport and to allow for the free movement of people across the Irish border had been secured as part of last week’s deal.
He also laid out the options that had been discussed in avoiding a hard border that would safeguard the movement of goods and the “all-island economy”.

Despite the agreement being hailed as a success in diplomacy, the deal has been thrown into doubt over the weekend by disagreement between the Irish and UK government over how legally binding it is.

Britain’s Brexit minister David Davis toldThe Andrew Marr Show on BBC 1that the deal was “more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing”.
However, the Irish government has hit back with government chief whip Joe McHugh describing the comments as bizarre. He toldThis Weekon RTE Radio 1:
Yesterday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney also tweeted out a section of the agreement with the UK that seems to contradict what Davis said.

Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland today, Secretary for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said that he hoped the deal between the EU and UK would “strike up a spirit of compromise” for talks between Sinn Féin and the DUP at Stormont.
“I think there can be progress,” Brokenshire said. “Once we’re through the European Council on Thursday, it will be clear that there’s a real need for them to be there [during Brexit talks].”
He said that the “real life pressures” of not having a government in Northern Ireland would become apparent “over the need for a new budget, work [for which] would normally have been well-advanced”.
“We can use it to refocus our attention,” he said.
Many of the British papers are reporting on the disagreement this morning, as UK Prime Minister Theresa May is due to address the House of Commons this morning to officially announce that a deal has been reached on Northern Ireland.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR and British Prime Minister Theresa May talked over the phone this afternoon, and both agreed on the importance of a post-Brexit soft border in Northern Ireland.
A statement from Number 10 said that both “agreed about the paramount importance of no hard border or physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.
“The Prime Minister said we are working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland that respects the integrity of the UK, the European Union and the Belfast Agreement,” said the statement.
“She added that we are committed to moving together to achieve a positive result on this as well as restoring devolved Government to Northern Ireland. Both leaders looked forward to continuing relations as close neighbours and allies as the negotiations progress.”
This evening, Varadkar had a meeting at Government Buildings with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte.

The leaders discussed a number of issues in advance of next week’s European Council meeting.
Varadkar told reporters afterwards that Ireland and the Netherlands had a lot in common as we are “both small countries with big neighbours”.
He said Ireland and the Netherlands want to move the Brexit negotiations onto the second phase “maybe more than any other member state”.
Rutte agreed it was a “very good discussion”, adding: “Everyone is working very hard to reach an agreement – it is difficult but it’s doable.”

Varadkar also gave his party an update on this week’s Brexit developments at tonight’s Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting.
The party leader said he believes that it can be brought back on track and that both the Irish and British Governments want to move to Phase 2 of the negotiations.
However, he reiterated that prior to this we want assurances written down in black and white.
Party colleagues heard that Ireland has the full support of our EU colleagues. The Taoiseach said European leaders across the continent see this as a test of Europe and the value of the European Union to smaller member States.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the good work done by his predecessor Charlie Flanagan, former Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister Helen McEntee along with Irish civil servants across the EU over the last 18 months was bearing fruit.
‘Bunch of jellyfish’
Earlier today, British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn lambasted Theresa May over the collapse of Brexit negotiations this week, as the PM took questions in the Commons.
At one point, Corbyn referred to May and her ministers as a “bunch of jellyfish masquerading as a cabinet”.
May gave assurances that all sides were still talking to each other, and that progress had been made.
She had spoken to the DUP’s leader Arlene Foster by phone in advance of Prime Minister’s Questions – but there were no major breakthroughs during their discussion.
“We will ensure that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,” she said during Prime Minister’s Questions.
“We will do that while we respect the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and we will be able to do that while we respect the internal market of the United Kingdom.”
European leaders have given May a deadline of the end of this week to resolve outstanding issues in order to draft an agenda in time for a crucial EU summit next Thursday and Friday and open the second phase of Brexit talks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/family-law-brexit-3604919-Sep2017/,"BREXIT IS CAUSING a great deal of uncertainty in many areas of society and trying to get a divorce is one thing that could become a lot more complicated and expensive once Britain leaves the EU.
If an Irish resident is married to someone who lives in the UK, the legal framework from Brussels clearly sets out the process to be granted a legal separation.
However, once Britain leaves the EU, this legal framework will no longer apply and that will be problematic in family law cases, according to Keith Walsh, a solicitor who chairs the Law Society’s family and child law committee.
He toldTheJournal.ie: “There’s no benefit to this [Brexit]. At the minute, we have certainty. It’s a complete disaster.”
The legal provisions in place from the EU, called Brussels II, currently govern issues of divorce, separation, annulment and parental responsibility.
Walsh gave this example of how it works in practice: “So go back a few years. There was a lot of emigration from this country. If I had gone to live in London, married an English woman, had a few kids, we separated and I came back to live in Dublin.
The solicitor said that there are a number of advantages to that system, if you’re the one who takes the matter to court first.
“Where it gets decided is really important,” Walsh said. “Divorce law is very different here for example. And it would cost a fortune to fight a case in London as opposed to here.”
He cited several recent cases where clients seeking to legally separate from a spouse living in England chose to initiate proceedings in Dublin, and this resulted in a positive result for his clients.
Walsh said: “The difficulty and cost for Irish people is once Britain leaves the EU, that [Brussels] convention won’t apply anymore.
He said that having this court fight will come at a cost to people even before a potentially costlier future court battle.
“And that’s just a waste of time,” he said. “A person with more money can fight that fight. Most normal people can’t. That’s where Brexit is going to have a big impact.”

In its position papers on Brexit, the UK government expressed a willingness to retain certain legal ties to the EU but the latter’s hard stance in the negotiations could mean that Britain won’t be able to have its cake and eat it when it leaves the bloc.
Walsh said: “And we’ve been talking about Dublin and London. It’ll be worse when it’s Derry and Donegal. The same issues would apply.
“The point really just is uncertainty. These are people’s lives. If you don’t solve these problems, your life is being stunted. It impacts everything.”
Handbook
Walsh chaired the Law Society committee which recently launched a new code of conduct for family law solicitors.
The previous code was published in 2008 and, according to Walsh, it’s not only Brexit that has shown the potential to completely change how family law is conducted in Ireland in the past nine years.
“We had the financial crash,” he said. “And anyone who bought a home after 2002 was going to feel the effects of that.”
He also cited a whole host of legislative changes on civil partnership, recognition of people living together outside of marriage and the referendum on the voice of a child as some of the main factors that have changed how family law operates in Ireland.
Walsh said: “Previously, [the laws] were rooted in the 19th century. Now, we’ve skipped the 20th century altogether and gone straight to the 21st.
He added that the most complex cases aren’t ones involving adultery, or difficulties with children. “The ones that take the most court time are those with complicated financial issues,” he said.
This could involve homes in negative equity, or self-employed people who are involved in running businesses.
“These complications would have caused a huge number of people to stay under the same roof where the marriage is over,” he said. “You can’t get on with your life. Living in a house where the relationship is over is not good for children either.
“But then another problem has come up again in recent years, particularly in Dublin. It’s where you rehouse yourself. Clients are worried that they won’t be able to pay rent. The reality is they can’t. Nobody these days can afford to keep two houses. It’s a very difficult position to be in.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-2-3865025-Feb2018/,"THE TÁNAISTE HAS said Ireland faces “unprecedented challenges” as Brexit negotiations continue.
Addressing an event organised by Columbia University in New York, Simon Coveney said the “creation of the closest possible future connection between the EU and the UK” is in the European Union’s interest and “overwhelmingly in Ireland’s interests”.
‘We cannot alter the basic facts of geography and history. And those facts shape our future in Ireland more than they impact any other country in the European Union.”
Coveney said the outcome of the UK leaving the EU should not “in any way undermine the hard-won gains of the peace process, as exemplified by the Good Friday Agreement”.
In December all sides agreed that the GFA, which officially ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland, must be protected in those negotiations. TheBritish deal with the EUmade specific reference to “protecting the operation of the 1998 Agreement”.

In recent days, Irish politicians have had to defend this stance, after a number of British politicians and commentators said itmay need to be reworked.
‘We can’t give up’
Speaking about the deadlock in negotiations to restore power-sharing at Stormont, Coveney said: “We urgently need to see the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly to harness greater and broader Northern Ireland input into how to make the best of Brexit.
He added that Ireland remains “more than ever committed to our membership of the EU”.
Speaking about the EU’s relationship with the US, Coveney said the Union “needs and wants the United States as its major international partner – in foreign and security policy, in free trade and investment, in protecting the environment”.
He said the US and UK have a “very strong” bond but that this “should not be an alternative to, or a threat to, the EU-US relationship”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-african-trip-3713885-Nov2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR’S trip to Africa will most likely be cancelled due to the escalating political storm involving Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.
Yesterday, Sinn Féin submitted a motion of no confidence in the Tánaiste – due to be held on Wednesday – with some speculating that it could trigger a winter general election.
Fianna Fáil’s Justice Spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan said yesterdaythat his party could not vote confidence in the Tánaiste. His party is due to submit their own motion of no confidence before 11am this morning.
A Fine Gael parliamentary party took place this evening at 10pm at which Varadkar and his colleagues gave enthusiastic support to Fitzgerald.
A unanimous motion in support of the Tánaiste was passed at the meeting with Varadkar saying she was facing “ a trumped up charge from the opposition”.
Fianna Fáil are due to hold a parliamentary party meeting at 9.30am.
For the past week, a row has been rumbling on over an email about Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe and the legal strategy the former Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan was pursuing against him.
Yesterday during Leaders’ Questions, Fitzgerald was staunch in the defence of her actions that it would have been illegal for her to intervene in any way.
Motion of no confidence
This whole debacle has thrown a spanner in the works for trip the Taoiseach is due to make on Monday.
Varadkar will have to remain at home to vote confidence in his Tánaiste next week if a motion goes ahead.
The Taoiseach is scheduled to travel to Mali to visit members of the Irish Defence Forces serving with the EU Training Mission to Mali (EUTM).

Twenty personnel from the Irish Defence Forces serve with EUTM, which is a training mission to improve the capacity of the Malian Armed Forces.
From a security perspective, it is believed to be one of the most challenging missions that the Irish Defence Forces are involved in.
African Union and European Union
On Wednesday, the Taoiseach is scheduled to travel to Ivory Coast to attend the Summit between the African Union and European Union.
It’s understood the Taoiseach has 12 bilateral meetings lined up with key European leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.
A discussion on Ireland holding a seat on the UN Security Council is also up for discussion at the summit, something the government has been lobbying for.
A government source said these meetings could prove vital in rallying support for the crunch European summit on Brexit on 15 December.
While domestically the Taoiseach must deal with the threat of his government falling, the issue of Brexit, the border and the stalemate in the talks is also pressing.
The African trip is understood to be a key time for the Taoiseach to meet with influential European leaders and build allies. The UK is pushing for the Brexit talks to move on to trade issues, before the matter of Northern Ireland and its border is dealt with.
The Taoiseach has made it clear that he wants detailed proposals on how the border issue will be solved from the British before the talks proceed – with the European negotiator Michel Barnier backing Ireland’s position.
It’s understood such high-profile European meetings, particularly with Juncker, could be key in ensuring support for Ireland to hold up the talks until the border issue is sorted out.
With Fianna Fáil stating it no longer has confidence in Fitzgerald and that it will not be voting confidence in her, the ball is firmly in the Taoiseach’s court.
Options open to him are to allow the motions to proceed which will trigger a general election or ask the Tánaiste to step down.
Varadkar is not willing to push Fitzgerald and the Tánaiste appears to have no intention in stepping aside. An election in December or January is looking all the more likely.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT is to set out its guiding principles as it moves towards ending the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the United Kingdom after Brexit.
A “future partnership paper” drawn up by the UK government will:
In a statement released today, the British government said: “The paper will be clear that as part of the deep and special partnership the UK seeks with the EU, it is in the interests of both sides that the rights and obligations agreed between the two can be relied upon and enforced easily, for example, by EU citizens in the UK courts, or UK nationals in the courts of EU member states.”
The paper will also examine “a variety of precedents for resolving disputes that may arise between the UK and the EU which help to demonstrate that it is normal for the EU to reach agreements with third countries without the CJEU (ECJ) having direct jurisdiction over them”.
The UK government has said the document will “make the point that the exact form of enforcement and dispute resolution is often tailored to the content of the agreement and varies across different issues such as trade or security”.
It will also say that there is no precedent driven by EU, UK or international law which demands that enforcement or dispute resolution of the UK-EU agreements fall under the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ.
Disputes
Ahead of the paper’s publication, a UK Government spokesperson said: “We have long been clear that in leaving the EU we will bring an ​end to the direct jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the UK.

“It is also in everyone’s interest that, where disputes arise between the UK and the EU on the application or interpretation of these obligations, those disputes can be resolved efficiently and effectively.
“This paper takes the next steps as we prepare to engage constructively to negotiate our approach to this.”
The document has been criticised by the opposition in the UK. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, a Labour MP, said the proposals could have a negative impact on Brexit negotiations.
Starmertold Sky News: “Any final deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy will require an effective and robust dispute resolution mechanism.
“This will inevitably involve some form of independent court. The Prime Minister’s ideological insistence that there can be no future role whatsoever for the ECJ or any similar court-like body risks preventing the deal Britain needs.”
Border
Meanwhile, speaking toRTÉ News, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney again stressed the desire to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland post-Brexit.
Coveney said the negotiations must aim secure “an outcome than can allow normality, as we currently enjoy it”.

EU NEGOTIATOR MICHEL Barnier has said he is still waiting for the UK to articulate their specific solutions to the Irish border after Brexit.
Another round of Brexit negotiations concluded today, with Barnier stating that it was “important to tell the truth” that border checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland would be “unavoidable” if the UK left the single market and the customs union.
Britain and the EU reached an interim deal in December on three key separation issues — the financial settlement, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens after Brexit.
But translating that into a proper legal agreement is proving especially difficult on the Northern Irish issue.
“The UK has committed to proposing specific solutions to the unique issue of Ireland. We are waiting for such solutions,” said Barnier at today’s press conference.
Barnier added that the eventual deal would contain an emergency option which states that if Britain fails to find a special solution for Northern Ireland, the UK would remain in “full alignment” with the EU on trade issues to ease the border impact.
Northern Irish unionists and pro-Brexiters have already angrily rejected this.

The Irish government has been calling on the British to outline their solutions for some time now.
Last year, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlined the Irish position by stating that Ireland would play no role in creating a border between the Republic and the North, adding that Britain had decided to leave the EU.
“If they want to put forward smart solutions, technological solutions for borders of the future and all of that that’s up to them,” he said in July.
Since the agreement in December, pressure has been placed on the UK to outline their specific solutions, in detail.
Barnier said today that time is now “very short”.
“The time has come to make choices, and we await with great interest the choices,” he said.
Junior Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee has urged Britain to outline their plans for the border, stating that it is getting more difficult for agreement to be reached.
Britain and the EU aim to start talks on a future relationship in April but time is running out. Barnier says a draft deal is needed by November so it can be ratified in time for Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-brexit-3533200-Aug2017/,"THE TAOISEACH SPEAKING in Belfast described Brexit as the challenge of our generation.
This is no understatement.
Leo Varadkar is right.
Brexit and the imposition of an EU Frontier across Ireland has the potential to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and the progress of the past 20 years but also the future economic prosperity of our Island.
Brexit was always about the needs of the British Conservative party. Its impact on Ireland was never a consideration. But we will be the collateral damage. David Cameron only called the referendum to keep his right wing on board and to head off the rise of UKIP.
Cameron is now gone, the Conservatives are back in power. The DUP have agreed to vote in support of legislation that the Tories bring forward on Brexit. They have given Teresa May a blank cheque.
The Taoiseach asked in Belfast who will speak for the people of the North. The people of the North have already spoken, they voted to remain within the EU in June 2016. This democratically expressed view of the cross-community majority who consented to Remain must be respected.
The Tories and the DUP have refused to listen. They are pressing ahead against the wishes of the majority of parties and the interests of citizens in the north.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier made clear that he will only negotiate with sovereign member state governments not devolved administrations.
The Irish Government therefore must defend the national interests and work with all those parties that represent the majority of voters, to ensure that vote in the north is respected, that our agreements are protected and the interests of all Ireland are represented at the EU negotiation table now and over the next 12 months.
‘There can be no EU border across Ireland’
The Taoiseach’s recent commitment for the need to avoid a hard border and to keep the free movement of people and goods post-brexit on a par with current arrangements is to be welcomed. There can be no EU border across Ireland. And there can also be no barrier to trade.
Advertisement
The British government have failed to bring forward workable political solutions to their Brexit policy. The fiction of a frictionless invisible border post Brexit has been exposed as nonsense.
Their Brexit is bad for the economy, all Ireland trade, for the rights of citizens and for our agreements.
The British government is pressing ahead with Brexit in the full knowledge that it is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement. And they are doing so with the full parliamentary political support of the DUP.
The rights of citizens and north/south cooperation are critical elements of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not up for renegotiation. It needs to be protected and it needs to be fully implemented.
The North must be designated special status within the EU in order for the whole island to stay in the EU together. That is the position agreed in the Dáil, that is the position of the cross party committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.It must become government policy.
Such status would ensure that an EU frontier is not imposed across Ireland. It would ensure continued access to the European Court of Justice and safeguard the rights of Irish citizens premised on the ECHR.
There are some that say there is no precedent for special status within the EU. But Brexit itself is unprecedented. The EU has demonstrated flexibility in the past.
The EU negotiating framework indicates that protecting progress in Ireland and our agreements is central. They have said that they are willing to be imaginative. So the government must build the case at the EU for special status.
In this they will have the support of the parties in the Dáil and deliver a solution for all our people and economy.
While Britain is driving head first into the train wreck that is Brexit, it cannot be allowed to drag our agreements, progress and prosperity with them.
Brexit is the challenge and designated special status is the solution.
The EU is also at a turning point, not only must it be imaginative in the response to Brexit – it must also radically change to respect the sovereignty of members states and live up to the ethos of which it was formed – to deliver social solidarity and equally for citizens of those states.

https://www.thejournal.ie/unionism-united-ireland-3849573-Feb2018/,"SENATOR MARK DALY is currently undergoing a task which, in the light ofthis week’s events at Stormont, may seem particularly daunting.
Daly is spearheading an effort by an Oireachtas committee to tease out what a reunited Ireland might look like in a post-Brexit world.
As part of this effort, the committee has tasked itself with understanding and comprehensively addressing the fears unionists hold of a united Ireland.
The thinking is that this engagement, and the plans that may stem from it, should be carried out before a border poll becomes a reality.
Daly argues that recent history shows just how important that is:
These efforts are already underway and Daly says he has been meeting with unionists of different backgrounds who have shown a willingness to engage on the issues.
He says that while most unionists do not aspire to a united Ireland or anything like that, there are pragmatic elements that value at least preparing for it should that be the will of people north and south of the border.
Brexit has seen also seen these discussion become more common, he adds.
“There’s a middle ground there. I was in Glencree on Tuesday at a cross-community meeting, unionist and republican and there is this kind of small u unionist who are kind of going: ‘You know we probably would be better of staying in the EU.’ ”
Ulster
The commitment to engage with unionists to assess their “fears and concerns” was part of a detailed report published by the committee in August of last year.
It was the first report of theJoint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreementand focused on the impact of Brexit and the prospect for a united Ireland.

Unionist fears and concerns were stressed to the committee by Dr James Wilson, a freelance lecturer who specialises in the field of unionism and loyalism.
In his submission to the committee, Wilson outlined that, aside from economic arguments, much of the opposition of northern protestants to Irish unity “has been based on fear”.
Wilson stated that these fears are “real and powerful” and broken down into three parts:
The retribution element he addresses relates particularly to members of British security forces who served during the Troubles. It’s estimated that there are 300 unsolved murders involving former members of the security forces during that period.
“The belief of post-unity retribution still lingers amongst former soldiers, policemen and prison officers, even though the vast majority never went to bed plotting to kill anyone,” Wilson said during his submission.
Wilson outlined that unionists also fear a literal dispossession of the lands that came under the possession of protestants during the Plantation of Ulster and in the following centuries.
Daly agrees but points out that there is no single branch of unionism. Among unionists there are working class people, farmers and business people, all of whom may have different priorities.
Asked whether he feels unionists would accept a united Ireland if that was the decision north and south, Daly points to a 2010 survey which found that 82% would accept such a scenario.
The remaining 18% he describes as “fight or flight”, with some unionists choosing to leave Ulster and others perhaps resisting the transition.
In order to help prepare for that, the committee has also heard the expertise of Michael R. Ortiz, who was senior policy advisory in the Obama White House, about how best to guard against the rise of unionist radicalism following a united Ireland.
Daly argues that the best way to do so is to provide opportunities for disadvantaged loyalists, whom he says are already being left behind by their representatives.
“It’s about giving jobs and opportunities, education and hope and making sure that there’s a society where they have a future,” Daly says.
“And at this moment in time, regardless of the referendum, the most disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland are the ones being left down by the DUP. The loyalist communities are being ignored and know they’re being ignored.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this article quoted Senator Mark Daly as using the term “small new unionist” when he had said “small u unionist”. The article has been amended to reflect that clarification.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-divisive-border-3595420-Sep2017/,"There are many more crossings along the Northern Ireland border than across the whole of the EU's eastern edges.Google MapsGoogle Maps
EAMON FITZPATRICK WAS pretty certain I’d have crossed the border five times on my way to meet him at his fuel business a few kilometres north of Clones.
Having kept a close eye out for the road signs changing from kilometres to miles and back again along the route from Cavan town, I was sure it was four times, not five. But I was willing to bow to his local knowledge.
“You would have had to cross it again coming in,” he said – gesturing towards the main entrance.
The only way for vehicles to enter and exit his busy fuel, grocery and hardware complex was on the Fermanagh side of the border, he explained.
As we chatted about Brexit and what it would mean for the area, he observed, wryly: “It would be interesting to see, when you come into this yard, where the border post is going to be.”
The Fermanagh border, heading into Co Cavan. There are 275 border crossings between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
I’d driven around the yard for a bit looking for parking before Eamon came to meet me, and may well have crossed the border a few more times than altogether necessary.
Of course, there’s no big black line running along the concrete. These sort of quirks of geography may illicit a sort of bemused curiosity from outsiders (visiting journalists included) but the very invisibility of the border has opened up trade and improved community relations exponentially since the beginning of the peace process.
People around here have strong memories of closed roads and British Army border checks, though – and recent proposals from London about how the border could be handled, post-Brexit, have done little to calm local fears of a massive negative impact on day-to-day business.
There are even concerns that any border controls that may be brought in will be seen by some as potential targets for violence.
Border roads
There are eight roads in and out of the Co Monaghan town of Clones – five of which run into Fermanagh.
At the height of the Troubles, most of these routes into the North were closed. Just a single main route across the border remained open in the area, and any traffic wishing to pass had to go through a full military checkpoint – often resulting in long delays.
That main route – the former ‘Concession Road’ – is now dotted with businesses every few miles (or kilometres): petrol stations, off-licences – a sole, shuttered firework store. Countless botharíns run off it to either side – but at the height of the IRA’s campaign in the 1970s and 80s these routes were spiked, blocked with concrete blocks or blown up by the British Army.
Routes along the length of the border began reopening from the 1990s – with the last few roads and bridges being repaired and reopened around a decade ago. 275 land border crossings now exist between the North and the Republic – more than along the whole of EU’s eastern border.
Eamon Fitzpatrick, the fuel and hardware man, said the return of checkpoints was his “biggest fear”. The return of controls in the wake of a UK exit from the EU threatens an administration nightmare for small and medium businesses.
The unique location of Fitzpatrick’s company – which actually straddles the border – underscores those concerns. He has customers and suppliers coming and going the whole time.
“If there’s checkpoints on the road – with Brexit does that allow us to continue coming into the yard via the North or does it mean me having to put a new access route into the yard to come solely south?
More than a year after the Brexit referendum, and just over a year-and-a-half until the expected exit date for the UK in March 2019, London’s most significant move on the border to datehas been the publication, last month, of a position paper.
No customs posts would be needed on roads in and out of the North, the paper said. Instead, there would be a wide-ranging exemptions for small and medium businesses – meaning they wouldn’t have to comply with new customs tariffs.
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he found the proposal worrying  - adding “creativity and flexibility can’t be at the expense of the integrity of the single market and customs union”.
Fitzpatrick’s criticism of the plan was a little more direct: ”They’re clowns…. They haven’t a clue.”
“At the moment, the uncertainty is the problem,” he added.
That uncertainty means planning for the medium-term future has been put on the backburner for Fitzpatrick for now, in the absence of any definitive agreement between the powers-that-be in London, Dublin, Berlin and Brussels.

Back in Clones itself, later in the morning, another business owner said that the protracted uncertainty over Brexit meant he was faced with a whole range of questions he hadn’t anticipated.
Colm Connolly startedhis food business, Rucksnacks, two years ago and the beef jerky snack is already being stocked in Supervalu stores.
The business recently relocated to Monaghan from Cookstown in Tyrone. But amid a state of near-paralysis in the Brexit negotiating process, they’re considering moving again.
“Our home farm is based in Monaghan. But in terms of markets … that’s the biggest struggle for us, because Ireland’s only maybe a tenth of the size of the UK for our product. We haven’t actively pushed into the UK as maybe other companies have - because there’s just so much uncertainty.
Trade tariffs – the taxes imposed on imports and exports – are a major concern, said Connolly. Irish companies are facing into an uncertain trading landscape ahead of the looming Brexit ‘cliff-edge’ in 2019.
The worst case scenario – a return to World Trade Organisation rules – would mean an enormous hike in tariffs for food exporters selling into the UK from the Republic.
“The risk of something happening around tariffs is a big one for us because we’re in a growth stage,” Connolly said.
Connolly was advised recently that the question of where to locate was the biggest decision his fledgling snack company would face. A move just a few miles across the border, into Fermanagh, would make sense “because if anything happens then you have access to a much larger market for our product than exists in Ireland – and we don’t have any problems with tariffs”.

As companies in the area continue to endure planning headaches in advance of the UK’s planned 2019 exit, retailers and other businesses have been forced to cope with the impact on the euro-sterling exchange rate.
The weak pound has driven shoppers north in search of bargains in the wake of last year’s referendum result. Big ticket items are proving popular, with one car dealership in the North reporting an 18% jump in used-car sales to customers in the Republic, according to a recent report in the Irish Times.
“People around here talk about the rate the way a Kilkenny man talks about hurling,” is how Bernard McNally, the owner of the local Supervalu put it.
“It has definitely had an effect,” on business in the Monaghan town, McNally said.

As for how his own business is faring: ”I think we’re still fairly competitive. Sometimes I think that the public feel that they’re missing out on something if they don’t go (North) because of the publicity – whereas there often isn’t a reason to go.
And while McNally may be pragmatic about the impact of Brexit on his trade to date, he’s concerned about the fortunes of the area in general, and still finds it hard to believe the result went the way it did in 2016.
He recalls: “I often describe it as our JFK moment.”

Bad blood
The border checkpoints placed a major burden on locals in the 1970s and 80s. Farmers and other workers were forced to make long detours to avoid roads that had been blocked or blown up.
Sectarian killings had sparked an upsurge in those army road closures –including the 1972 murders, within the space of 24 hours, of an off-duty member of the UDR by the IRA, and the killing of two Catholic farmers the following day by members of the British Army.
Author Colm Toibín, who walked the border in the months after the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1986, later documentingthe journey in his book Bad Blood, described how an atmosphere of tension and mistrust had become entrenched in the area.
The IRA regarded members of the security forces as legitimate targets. The Protestant farming community had become deeply suspicious of Catholics – any of whom, they believed, could have been part of the IRA’s information network.
Only 20 cross-border roads were open at the height of the Troubles. Locals would occasionally stage unofficial reopenings of border routes – prompting further conflict with authorities.
Paul Gibbons, who’s in his mid-40s, said the area had changed beyond recognition since the start of the peace process in the 1990s.
“A life-changing event,” is how he describes the reopening of the roads.
“I’m old enough to remember the pervading atmosphere at the time. It wasn’t a good place to be in or grow up in.

Gibbons, who is now a local organiser for Border Communities Against Brexit, also met me at Fitzpatrick’s garage.
Eamon Fitzpatrick is part of the campaign group too. And although the two men are campaigning to lessen the effects of Brexit – neither can envisage a scenario in which it goes ahead and some sort of customs posts arenotreintroduced.
“I can’t see any way at all,” said Gibbons
The checkpoints were a massive drag on everyday life in the 70s and 80s, Fitzpatrick recalled.
“We would have a farm down the road from where we’re standing now.
And while neither of the men is predicting an upsurge in violence overnight, if custom posts are reintroduced, Fitzpatrick painted a stark picture of how friction could soon arise.
“The decent people are not going to cause hassle. The people who would case the hassle are the people that would profiteer on the back of Brexit.
“I don’t think there’s any doubt about it,” he concluded. Gibbons agreed: “Just a matter of time.”
Sinn Féin councillor Pat Treanor said he was concerned border controls would become a target for groups opposed to the peace process.Daragh Brophy / TheJournal.ieDaragh Brophy / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
‘Disaster’
In a nondescript building known as the Fáilte centre (it turned out to be a drop-in and support centre for former republican prisoners) Sinn Féin councillor Pat Treanor said a return to border customs posts would be a “disaster”.
We spoke over cups of tea in a room festooned with photos and placards dating from time of the IRA border campaign of the 1950s to the hunger strikes of the early 1980s.
Treanor – a former prisoner himself, in Portlaoise in the early 1980s – has been a councillor for Clones for most of the last 32 years. I asked whether – as someone in regular contact with former participants in the IRA’s armed campaign – he regarded talk of a return to violence as a real concern.
“I suppose the fear is that even if they’re talking about soft borders or customs huts with customs men, there there will be armed guards or armed people there and the tensions will be created,” Treanor said.
As you might expect from a Sinn Féin politician, he also took the opportunity to suggest that Brexit gave further impetus to his party’s overarching campaign for a border poll, leading, eventually, to a united Ireland.
If border posts returned in some form, he added:
My short walk to meet Treanor had taken me up the main drag of Clones – along Fermanagh Street. And although a number of businesses on the street appeared to be thriving, just as many were closed down or entirely boarded up.
I asked if the local economy had improved measurably since the reopening of the roads.
“There hasn’t been a great turnaround… 29 premises on that main street are closed and 28 are open.
‘No decisive movement’
Driving back towards Cavan in the late afternoon I took a few turns south off the road along some of the botharíns that cross the border – searching for possible evidence of the roadblocks that existed years ago.
I didn’t find any. Once again, the only evidence of the different jurisdictions was a change in the road-signs. One crossing seemed to have become a trouble-spot for fly-tipping – the piles of rubbish dumped in ditches just a few feet across the border, on the Northern side.

Back on the main road, a man fixing bikes at workshop just over the Fermanagh side of the border said he expected to see a return to mobile customs controls – with teams of officials patrolling border routes and carrying out spot-checks on vehicles.
At one time there had been 40 such officers stationed in Clones, he said. “Around Christmas they could have had five or six cars on the road.”
“I can’t see any other way, with the movement of people from the EU into the UK. They’ll have to have mobile controls the way they used to have. There’s no other way that I can see – and I’ve been here 40 years – how else they’re going to do it.
Back in the car, the drivetime news programmes carried details of the latest joint press conference between David Davis, the UK’s Brexit secretary, and EU chief negotiator Barnier, following the latest round of Brussels talks.
Progress had been negligible at best,it seemed. Davis insisted there had been “concrete” developments; a rather less optimistic Barnier said the British proposals demonstrated “a sort of nostalgia” and that there had been no real movement.
Next Friday, Theresa Maytravels to Italywhere she’s expected to make a major speech in a bid to kickstart talks. Around the border, meanwhile, the uncertainty continues.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-westminster-2-3891610-Mar2018/,"TWO-THIRDS OF people polled have said that Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats in the UK parliament in order to vote on Brexit issues.
The party has seven MPs elected to Westminster from constituencies in Northern Ireland but has long operated an abstentionist policy whereby it refuses to sit in the parliament.
The party says it will not swear an oath of allegiance to the British queen and argues that the interests of its constituents should only be served by representatives sitting in the island of Ireland.
The policy has previously been criticised by other Irish parties and this criticism has intensified in recent months as Westminster debates the ongoing Brexit process.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that Sinn Féinwas “refusing to take part”.
In last year’s UK general election, Sinn Féin won seven of Northern Ireland’s 18 seats in the House of Commons, including all those that were held by the SDLP.
It has been argued by some other Irish party leaders that Sinn Féin could provide a vote for Northern nationalists, and indeed Irish people in the south, on issues relating to Brexit in Westminster.
Now, a new poll carried out on behalf of Claire Byrne Live andTheJournal.iehas found that67%of people think Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats to vote on Brexit issues.
13%of people said they should not take up their seats while20%of people said they didn’t know.

The numbers
Currently, Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government is operating with the support of the DUP’s 10 MPs. Combined with the DUP, May’s government has a working majority of 13 MPs.
It means that Sinn Féin’s 7 MPs would not alone remove the government’s majority in the House of Commons.
On Brexit issues, this could be more complicated with some MPs voting against their own party leadership.
The Financial Times reported last weekthat about seven pro-Brexit Labour MPs could potentially vote in line with May’s government while 12 Conservative MPs may rebel.
It makes things very tight and could potentially mean Sinn Féin’s votes could tip the balance.
In an opinion piece publishedearlier this week in The Guardian, Paul Maskey MP said that Sinn Féin MPs are elected on a mandate of abstentionism.
“Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs by people who vote for Sinn Féinnotto take seats at Westminster,” he said.
On Brexit, Maskey said that: “Westminster cannot provide the solutions when Westminster is the problem.”
“The people of Ireland will not find a solution to Brexit in the parliament that is imposing it. On Brexit, Irish people in the north look to Sinn Féin, to the Irish government, the Irish parliament and to Europe to defend their interests,” Maskey said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ukip-new-leader-3623208-Sep2017/,"
THE UK INDEPENDENCE Party (Ukip) has elected a new leader, its fourth in just over a year.
The party elected former army officer Henry Bolton as its new leader, the third elected since Nigel Farage resigned from the party after last year’s Brexit referendum.
“Brexit is our core task. However, it is not the end of the line,” he said after being elected at the party’s annual conference in Torquay in southwest England.
Bolton had earlier warned that Ukip could become the “UK Nazi Party” if it elected another candidate, Anne Marie Waters, who ran on an anti-Islam platform.
The rise of Ukip was one of the main factors behind then-prime minister David Cameron calling an EU membership referendum and was then a powerful driving force behind the successful “Leave” campaign.
The party has riven with tensions since then and some commentators said a party set up to oppose EU membership had lost its reason to exist, particularly after the charismatic Farage stepped down.
Farage was succeeded by Diane James, who stepped down in October last year, just 18 days after winning citing a lack of support within the leadership.

The favourite to replace her, Steven Woolfe, pulled out following an altercation with a fellow MEP at the European Parliament that left him hospitalised.
New leader Paul Nuttall left in June after failing to win a parliamentary seat in a general election.
“Without being united, we cannot lead,” Bolton said.
Farage hailed Bolton’s election saying on Twitter that he was “a man of real substance”.
Major Brexit campaign donor Arron Banks said Bolton’s election meant he would “re-engage” with the party.
Supporters say Ukip will play a vital role in holding the government to account for promises made in the Brexit campaign and ensuring there is no backsliding on demands such as cutting immigration.
Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkarsaid that there was a “better vibe”around Brexit negotiations but that a lot more work needs to be done to advance the tortuous process.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-killarney-speech-3796183-Jan2018/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said that she doesn’t want to “lose” the close relationship that has formed between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The former First Minister of Northern Ireland was speaking at the Killarney Economic Conference this morning, where she made her views on the ideal future relationships of Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit.
It follows months of debate around how the status of Northern Ireland should change in the wake of Brexit so that it can both leave the European Union and maintain peaceful relationship with the Republic – two things that many political commentators say is impossible to implement.
During her speech, Foster said that ties between Northern Ireland and the Republic have grown into an “unimaginably positive” relationship.
“I don’t want to lose any of that.
She outlined five key principles that the DUP have in relation to Brexit, which include Northern Ireland leaving the EU, and that a Brexit deal would recognise the Irish history.
She added that although she didn’t share people’s concerns about Brexit, she did understand them.
In December, the DUP found elements of an agreed wording between the EU and UK problematic, leading to a last-minute change that allowed Brexit talks to progress to Phase Two.
The DUP are currently propping up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Tory government, giving Foster and her party more leverage over the UK’s decisions than would otherwise be the case.
Foster has been steadfast in maintaining that Northern Ireland would leave the EU with the rest of the United Kingdom, and said that there shouldn’t be a border “along the Irish Sea” – meaning there shouldn’t be a great separation between the North and Great Britain.

But there has been little suggestions or solutions from the DUP on how the issue of the Irish border could be solved – today’s speech gives some insight into what unionists will want from the second phase of Brexit talks, and the future they envisage for Northern Ireland after it leaves the EU.
Semi-detached Republic

In her speech today, Foster compared the relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland to “a semi-detached house”.
“The houses may look the same on the outside, but, inside, they look different and we do many things very differently.
In a particularly significant part of her speech, she emphasised the importance of the relationship between the North and the Republic, and said that they didn’t wish to be “cut off” from one another.
Instead, they say they want the whole of the UK should leave the EU (meaning Northern Ireland isn’t left behind); any Brexit deal must recognise the geography and history of the region; to get the best deal for Northern Ireland.
“We want to maximise the opportunities that will flow from our exit from the European Union. More powers in the hands of devolved administrations.
“More flexibility for locally elected Ministers to set policies that work for our regions. And the ability to pursue ambitious new free trade agreements around the world.”
TheKillarney Economic Convergenceis described as an annual dialogue between political, economic and civic leaders from Britain and Ireland – with Brexit dominating the topics being discussed this year.
Fianna Fáil leader Michael Martin, who also spoke at the Killarney conference, said that it was a failure of the current government that it hasn’t engaged adequately with the North, “other than in the context of major crises”.
“The narrative of conflict has been followed by one of complacency,” he said.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he’s “confused and puzzled” by the UK’s post-Brexit trading plans.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Varadkar said it’s not “realistic” for Britain to expect the advantages of being in the European Union (EU), but none of the responsibilities and costs.
“What trade agreement does the UK want with the EU? At the moment, they have the best trade deal imaginable. What are these better deals the UK really wants from Europe and other countries? Some more clarity would be helpful,” the Taoiseach said.
Last week, Guy Verhofstadt, one of the EU’s Brexit negotiators, described aspects of theUK’s trading planas “fantasy”.
During the interview, Varadkar again stressed he doesn’t want a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.

He’s currently in Canada and is today expected to visit a section of the US-Canadian border, which has been cited as a possible model for any future Irish border.
“I’m a little bit sceptical, but I’d like to see it with my own eyes,” Varadkar said.
More progress needed
Elaborating on the ongoing Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU, he stated: “We’re not satisfied with the progress that has been made so far. We hope more progress can be made, but to date progress has not been sufficient.”
When asked about US President Donald Trump, Varadkar said he hopes to meet him in Washington DC next March for the annual St Patrick’s Day celebrations.
He said the importance of the two countries’ relationship is bigger than any one person.
“It’s fair to say that the policy and character of my government would be, or the government which I lead, would be very different to that of President Trump,” Varadkar stated.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-proofing-business-3496825-Jul2017/,"SURVEYS OVER THE past year have shown that although Irish businesses are worried about Brexit – only a small fraction of them have done anything to prepare for the effect it may have.
And that may be mostly related to the uncertainty of Brexit – not even the Irish government knows what it will look like or what exactly they should do about it.
“Businesses have been left to their own devices,” Paul Jacobs says, who’s the founder of Smart Storage, a business that manufactures and installs under stair storage units across the UK and Ireland.
But he’s taken advantage of the situation to explore other markets – and found what seems like a perfect market for his business in the suburbia around Amsterdam.
“Holland has the top 3 highest rate of home-ownership in Europe,” Jacobs tellsTheJournal.ie, adding that they also have one of the strongest English-language speaking population and are densely-populated.
He adds that Irish suburban homes are bigger than UK homes, and UK homes are similar to Holland’s – potentially hinting at the demand that would suit his business.

Jacobs says that after the EU referendum result in June last year, he was shocked. In the month previously, he had announced an expansion of one of the company’s manufacturing sites in Carrick-on-Suir and between 60-100 new jobs.
He estimates that around 65% of his business operations are UK-based, so the result would have some sort of effect.

“Nobody regarded the UK as a foreign market – they saw it as an extension of the domestic market,” Jacobs says.
But the vote encouraged him to what he sees as a healthy move for his business: look at markets further afield than their closest neighbours.
That’s a lesson learnt from the recession. Jacobs co-ran a construction business during the boom time, and says they thought about opening a base in London, but didn’t need to because the demand in south Dublin was so high.
“We didn’t realise that things weren’t going to stay the same – and those are the waves that will rock you.”
He says that the perfect business market should be like a pyramid base: either you have a wide range of products you sell to a very particular area, or a large geographical area where you sell a very specific number of products.
Back in Britain
But they’re not leaving their UK-based business behind either: “We can’t ignore UK market just because Brexit has happened. It’s too big, and there’s a lot of work there.”
Instead of carrying out the expansion of their Irish manufacturing site as announced last year, Jacobs is now considering opening a manufacturing base in the UK instead, and six months ago, he registered a UK company – both in an effort to Brexit-proof his business.
“People hoping Brexit won’t happen,” businessman Paul Jacobs says. “Hope is for mass on Sundays.”
And although the two-year negotiation process causes uncertainty for politicians and global markets, it gives businesses time to research the market and make decisions for the future, whatever kind of Brexit we might get.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-same-sex-marriage-northern-ireland-3531970-Aug2017/,"
LEO VARADKAR HAS said it is “only a matter of time” before Northern Ireland legalises same-sex marriage.
The Taoiseach made the comments at a gay pride event in Belfast today.
“It is of course a decision for the Northern Ireland Assembly, but I am confident that, like other western European countries, they will make that decision in due course,” Varadkar said.
Northern Ireland is the only part of Britain where same-sex marriage remains illegal. The largest political party in the province, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), is deeply opposed to changing the law and has consistently blocked this from happening.
DUP leader and the North’s First Minister Arlene Foster said Varadkar’s participation in the Pride event was “his own business”.
The Republic voted to allow same-sex marriage in a historic referendum in 2015.

Varadkar, the country’s first openly-gay leader, attended a Pride breakfast in Belfast this morning but did not attend the Pride parade as he’s going to the Dublin vs Monaghan GAA match in Croke Park this evening.
Brexit
Yesterday, Varadkar and Foster met to discuss Brexit, wth Varadkar saying he wants to build “bridges not borders” with the North.
“Brexit seriously risks driving a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, between Britain and Ireland. And I cannot imagine who benefits from that,” he added.
While Varadkar was speaking at Queen’s University in Belfast yesterday morning, a number of students wore Repeal jumpers.
The Taoiseach was asked about the timing of the referendum on the Eighth Amendment – which effectively bans abortion here, except in limited circumstances – after his speech, to which he said it will likely take place in May or June 2018.

IT’S BEEN A strange week in the increasingly fraught and occasionally maddening world of Brexit.
What’s set this week apart has been the apparent realisation in the UK that Ireland is indeed part of their Brexit world.
The border issue has been a major sticking point in negotiations for some time, but after areported deal on Britain’s divorce billit’s now the sticking point.
Even if Conservative politicians insisted as far as two years back that border wouldn’t even be a problem.
Of all the scare stories propagated by EU supporters, the idea that the UK and Ireland would impose borders after 94 years is the silliest.— Daniel Hannan (@DanielJHannan)November 18, 2015Daniel Hannan/ Twitter
Of all the scare stories propagated by EU supporters, the idea that the UK and Ireland would impose borders after 94 years is the silliest.
Without going into the details of why, it’s clear that theBritish government is keen to keep Brexit moving. The problem is that progress needs to be made on other issues before they can move on.
But the Irish government doesn’t think sufficient (or any?) movement has been made on what the border will look like and it doesn’t want to move onto other issues until there is.
The EU’s other 26 membersare standing behind Ireland.
That’s where we are and that’s why Brexiteers and some in the British media are blaming Ireland for stalling talks.
There have been claims that Ireland has threatened to ‘veto’ the talks moving on, even though no such direct threat has been made. Besides, it’s not likely any ‘veto’ would even be required with the EU on Ireland’s side anyway.
There’s been more than that though. In blaming Ireland for the current Brexit difficulties, some British politicians and commentators have been enraging Irish people with their interpretations of Irish history – interpretations that have been, at best, questionable (and at worst, provocative).
The takes came thick and fast, like this one from the Telegraph:
Telegraph.co.ukTelegraph.co.uk
The editorial argued that Ireland and the EU’s steadfastness on the border was not about protecting the Good Friday Agreement but more about “a crude negotiating tactic in the Brexit talks”.
“That this performance is dressed up as some crusade to protect the peace process is particularly tasteless,” thearticle argued.

The many people, the tone of the article epitomised the disconnect that exists between what the border means to some politicians in Britain and to what it means to those affected by it every day.
Even Irish people who don’t have to routinely cross the border were angered about how its historical significance was carelessly dismissed by a major UK newspaper.
Dear@Telegraph, the border isn't 'a stick to beat' brexiting GB. It is a wound of deep conflict. It is a join of close contact. It is a thread of careful agreement. There is no mere 'grandstanding' or 'posturing' here. This is not a game.https://t.co/G6bAX7fvr9— Katy Hayward (@hayward_katy)November 24, 2017Katy Hayward/ Twitter

Things then went from insensitive to positively Trumpian when Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey said that any customs border on the island of Ireland wouldhave to be paid for by the Republic.
It didn’t end there though and Ireland’s government coming to the brink of collapse early in the week offered a chance for British politicians to frame Dublin’s stance on the border as posturing.
And in a demonstration of just how central Ireland had become to the UK’s news, the decision by Frances Fitzgerald to step down as Tánaiste was a big story all acrossnews websites across the water.

While British politicians talking about Irish history may have been the most maddening thing to happen, perhaps the most memorable example was when Channel 4 took to the streets of London to askpeople where the Irish border was.
The results weren’t exactly stellar – with and one woman telling the reporter “the southern Irish have to lump it” likely to go down as the quintessential ‘little Englander’ take on Ireland.

If all this is somewhat of a diversion, a high roller flew into Dublin yesterday to greatly raise the stakes and likely annoy many of those aforementioned little Englanders.
European Council President Donald Tusk met with Leo Varadkar and left Britain with little doubt that it’s firmly by itself if it can’t come up with a solution to the border.
The Taoiseach has been clear that it’sthe UK’s job to come up with a border solution if it wantsto exit the customs union and Tusk basically endorsed this last night.
“If the UK offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it willalso be unacceptable to Europe,” Tusk said, ramping up the hype for a meeting in Brussels in a fortnight’s time.
At that meeting of EU leaders a decision will be made on whether the talks can proceed. It now basically means that if Ireland isn’t happy then Brexit moves no closer.
Let’s see how that goes down across the water.

The senator argues that having a “unionist voice” in the Upper House would be “helpful”, particularly given the current impasse at Stormont.
Feighan, who is on the record as believing thatIreland should consider rejoining the Commonwealth, added that in light of Brexit he believes it is “imperative from a symbolic, political and practical level that a Unionist voice is now needed more than ever in the Oireachtas”.

“The prospects of a deal between the DUP and Sinn Fein regarding a proposed Irish Language Act is clearly proving to be very challenging.

Varadkar said having both nationalist and unionist representatives would provide “different voices on issues which concern us all”.
The Sunday Independent reported last weekend about speculation the Taoiseach intends to nominate former Ulster Farmers’ Union president Ian Marshall to the Seanad.

Updated at 2pm
BRITISH OPPOSITION LEADER Jeremy Corbyn has called for a new customs union with the European Union after Brexit in a policy shift that could force Prime Minister Theresa May to change course.
Just days before a keynote speech by May on her desired future trading relationship with the European Union, the Labour leader drew a clear line between his policy and that of the government.
“Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need whatsoever for a hard border in Northern Ireland,” Corbyn told an audience in Coventry, central England.
Britain is currently part of the EU’s customs union, which has a common external tariff on imports, allowing goods to move freely inside the area.
But it would leave after Brexit in March 2019.
Citing the example of integrated supply chains in the car industry, Corbyn said it “makes no sense” for Britain to turn its back on “tariff-free trading rules that have served as well”.
The Confederation of British Industry, Britain’s big business lobby, has also called for a customs union with the EU.
Normally such unions preclude members from doing their own trade deals with other countries – the reason the option has been ruled out by May.
Corbyn offered a caveat, saying:
Foreign minister Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit supporter, accused Corbyn of cynicism.
“Corbyn’s Brexit plan would leave UK a colony of the EU – unable to take back control of our borders or our trade policy,” he said on Twitter.
“White flag from Labour before talks even begin.”
The prime minister’s spokesman was unequivocal: “The government will not be joining a customs union. We want to have the freedom to sign our own trade deals and to reach out into the world.”

Commons showdown
Talks on the future relationship are due to begin with Brussels next month, and after repeated calls for clarity from the EU, the prime minister is due to set out her opening position on Friday.
Labour’s position shift could prove problematic.
Any Brexit deal must be agreed by the 650-seat House of Commons, where May’s Conservatives only have a slim majority thanks to the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists and where Labour has 259 seats.
A showdown could come sooner than that, after rebel Conservative MPs tabled an amendment to a draft trade bill calling for a customs union.
“I appeal to MPs of all parties, prepared to put the people’s interests before ideological fantasies, to join us in supporting the option of a new UK customs union with the EU, that would give us a say in future trade deals,” Corbyn said.
Some Labour MPs are unhappy with the shift, however, with one suggesting Corbyn was betraying its many working-class supporters who backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s the latest wheeze by the well-oiled machine in this country to undo the referendum,” eurosceptic Labour MP Frank Field told the Daily Telegraph.
Boris Johnson concluded: “Crumbling Corbyn betrays Leave voters – and all because he wants to win a Commons vote. Cynical and deluded.”
Single market relationship
May says Britain will leave the EU’s single market after Brexit, and Corbyn accepts this.
But he cautioned today that new free trade deals with China or the United States would not compensate for loss of trade with the bloc.
The left-winger, who advocates a radical programme of nationalisations and public spending, said his priority was “to get the best deal for people’s jobs, living standards and the economy”.
He called for a “new and strong relationship” with the single market, which “includes full tariff-free access and a floor under existing rights, standards and protections”.
Pro-European Labour MPs welcomed the shift, but said it did not go far enough.
“The only sure and certain way to get the benefits of single market membership is to be a member of the single market and we should not pretend otherwise,” said backbench MP Chris Leslie.

UK LABOUR LEADER Jeremy Corbyn has been a divisive figure in the UK. On the one hand, you have crowds of people chanting his name at festivals and clubs, and on the other you have deep misgivings from within his party that he’s the person to lead them to electoral victory.
Of those two sides of the scale, most of the British media have been siding with Corbyn’s critics – and that’s putting it mildly.
One edition of the Sun, published on the day of the UK’s snap election, had the headline “Don’t chuck Britain in the Cor-bin” accompanied by a picture of the Labour leader in a metal bin (subtle).
Riding on the high of a significant increase in the UK’s June election, and subsequentpopularity ratings, Corbyn has taken the opportunity to hit back at his critics in the media.
“The day before the election, one paper devoted 14 pages to attacking the Labour Party,” Corbyn told the Labour conference in Brighton today.
And he didn’t stop there.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet

As Britain’s main opposition party, Labour has had some trouble with building itself up in the polls, despite a series of government scandals and flops (not dissimilar to our own Labour party).
But Corbyn assured crowds today that the party was “now the political mainstream” and “ready for government” – boldly stating that Labour was “on the threshold of power”.

“We’ve become a government in waiting,” he said, adding that Labour were “ready to build a new and progressive relationship with Europe”.
Corbyn has met with significant resistence from Labour MPs over his attempts to move the party to the left since being elected leader in September 2015.
But he defied expectations by winning 30 more seats in June on a manifesto promising nationalisations and a huge increase in public spending.
Now, Corbyn is more confident, telling delegates today:
Corbyn said May’s Conservatives, who are riven by infighting over the government’s strategy on Brexit, were “hanging on by their fingertips”.

The elephant in the room
But Labour is also divided over Brexit, particularly over whether Britain should continue to have access to the European single market after it leaves the EU and continue to accept free movement of people.
Corbyn offered no details on Labour’s position on Brexit in the speech and instead attacked Conservatives for “bungling” Brexit negotiations.
A YouGov poll for The Times published today showed Labour on 43% compared to the Conservatives on 39%.
But the poll of 1,716 people conducted last week showed trust in May as a leader was at 37% compared to 29% for Corbyn.

IN A MAJOR speech British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a two-year transition period for Britain after it leaves the European Union, suggesting that the UK would continue to “honour its commitments” under the bloc’s current budget.
May said Britain should be able to access the European single market during this period, adding that other EU members should not have to “pay more”.
The UK prime minister made the comments in a key speech in Florence today. The speech was aimed at breaking the deadlock in Brexit negotiations which are due to resume on Monday.
The success of negotiations between Britain and the European Union on Brexit is “in all our interests”, May continued.
“If we were to fail or be divided, the only beneficiaries would be those who oppose our values,” she said.

May also said she wanted British courts to “take into account” European Court of Justice decisions when ruling on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.
EU officials has said that the European Court of Justice should retain jurisdiction over citizens of the union.
May added that Britain will “honour its commitments” to the current EU budget and other EU members should not “pay more or receive less” because of Brexit.
The comments come amid pressure from EU officials for Britain to make a monetary promise on its Brexit “divorce bill” to unblock negotiations in Brussels.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-hard-border-3689647-Nov2017/,"AN INTERNAL EU paper has suggested that it is essential for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and the customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Published byRTÉ‘s Tony Connolly, the working paper says that in order to avoid a hard border there must be no divergence of rules on either side of the Irish border.
That would require Northern Ireland to stay in the single market and the customs union.
The working paper was presented to British negotiators in Brussels yesterday after being circulated to the 27 member states on Wednesday night, according to RTÉ.
The paper suggests that the EU’s guiding principles underlined that an important part of political economic, security, societal and agricultural activity on the island of Ireland currently operates on a cross-border basis, “underpinned by joined EU membership of the EU and Ireland.”
Both the EU and the UK have already committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, the paper says.
It says achieving this must be done in a way that “respects the integrity of the internal market and the customs union of which Ireland will remain a full member”.

It goes on to say that it seems “essential” for the UK to commit to ensuring that there is no regulatory divergence from those rules of the internal market and the customs union “which are, or may be in the future, necessary for meaningful north-south cooperation, the all-Ireland economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement”.
An entirely new structure would be imposed on the United Kingdom if Northern Ireland were to remain inside the customs union and single market, while the rest of the UK was outside.https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/928891842854313984
DUP tensions
The paper could put more pressure on the UK’s Conservative government given its reliance on Northern Ireland’s DUP party for survival.
The DUP has repeatedly warned that it will not accept any deals that may undermine the union between Britain and Northern Ireland.
The EU has said the UK can only qualify to Phase II of the Brexit negotiations if there is “sufficient progress” on the financial settlement, EU citizens’ rights, and the Irish border, according to RTÉ.
There was no breakthrough at the summit of EU leaders on 14 and 15 October as a result of a deadlock in the negotiations.
However, the working paper has revealed that both the EU and the UK have reached an agreement on the principle on the Common Travel Area.
“At the last round, agreement was reached in the principle on joint principles on the Common Travel Area which aim to recognise an existing bilateral arrangement between the UK and Ireland,” the paper says.

Updated 10.45pm
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has published its first formal papers today on its expectations for the Brexit negotiations with the UK.
And the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned Britain off from using its relations with Ireland as a ‘test case’ for how it hopes to process its new trading links with the EU after leaving the union.
“What I see in the UK paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland worries me,” Barnier told a press conference earlier in Brussels.
While calling for “creativity and flexibility” in all sides’ approach to negotiations, Barnier said that “cannot be at the expense of the integrity of the single market and customs union”, adding that to do so would not “be fair for Ireland and it would not be fair for the European Union”.
Earlier, in outlining its “guiding principles for the dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland”, the EU said that the “onus to propose solutions which overcome the challenges created on the island of Ireland… remains with the United Kingdom”.
The approach from the EU echoes that of the Irish government, as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said last month that it was incumbent on Britain to come up with solutions to the border issue, and that Ireland would not assist in coming up with them.
The EU said: “A thorough understanding of the other issues beyond customs arrangements which are relevant to the border is also required in order to move forward to discussing solutions in the context of the dialogue with the United Kingdom.

With the possibility of the UK leaving the EU Single Market, it raises the potential of a return to border posts between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Theresa May’s government has, however, said on several occasions that it has no wish to “return to the borders of the past”.
The EU said that the Good Friday Agreement will need to work effectively for the peace process to continue.
“Ensuring the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is central to protecting the gains of the peace process underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement,” it said.
From the European perspective, the responsibility lies squarely with the UK to figure out how it handles the situation in Northern Ireland.
It also singled out the common travel area and said that the continuation of these arrangements should be recognised.
In a statement today, the Irish government said it “welcomes and supports” the paper from the European Commission, while also indicating that Britain now needs to step up and offer “workable” solutions.
“The paper clearly reflects the continuing close engagement between Ireland and the EU Task Force and builds on the European Council Guidelines and subsequent negotiation mandate, in which Ireland’s concerns and priorities were strongly acknowledged,” it said.
The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs also welcomed the EU’s stance.
Its chairman, Michael Healy-Rae, said: “It is clear that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, in particular the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area, are fully recognised, which is very much appreciated.
“Now, we must continue dialogue and talk about potential ways in which those problems may be addressed to the benefit of all citizens affected.”
Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane said it is “strong support for protecting the peace process and Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-skint-3754260-Dec2017/,"UK POLITICIAN AND the former leader of Ukip Nigel Farage has claimed that he is “skint”, and has said that there is “no money in politics”.
In an interview with the UK Daily Mail, Farage talked about his personal life, relationships and how he can’t walk around outside on his own without fear of being attacked.
“My life is not easy. There’s a lot of aggro to deal with,” Farage told the paper.
Farage has recently separated from his wife and currently lives on his own in Chelsea, in London.
In the interview, he describes himself as “53, separated and skint”.
“There’s no money in politics, particularly doing it the way I’ve done it – 20 years of spending more than you earn,’ said Farage.

Farage is currently an MEP, and has been since 1999. He founded Ukip in 1993 and has run seven times for Westminster but has never been elected.
Despite this, Ukip and Farage played a role in last year’s Brexit referendum.
Farage has come in for criticism on social media following the interview, with people pointing out that he lives in a £4 million townhouse in Chelsea and has been taking an MEP salary since 1999.
According to the EU parliament’s website, the average monthly pre-tax salary of an MEP is €8,484 per month – which adds up to about €101,000 per year.
The Daily Mail interview is sympathetic to Farage, saying that he “cares deeply about his country” and calling him “one of the most successful politicians of his generation”.
Farage stepped down as Ukip leader in July, 2016, following the Brexit vote.
He faced criticism for having one of the worst voting records in the European parliament.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-strained-relationship-3764997-Dec2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the relations between the Irish and British government have been strained over the Brexit negotiations – but pointed out that everyone needs to be “grown up” about it.
Varadkar has previously pledged to rebuild trust between the two governments, stating that while relations may have been damaged, it is fixable.
However, he was quick to point out that whatever strain there has been, it is due to the British decision to leave the European Union.
“Relations obviously are a little bit strained, and they’ve been challenged by the events of recent months. Was it worth it doesn’t really comprehend the question. The reason that relations have become strained is because of Brexit.”
He added:
Varadkar said all parties need to “get on with it” and progress with the talks, which are expected to be particularly tough as they enter into phase two.
‘Not that bad’
He said his main priority is getting the best outcome for the Irish people.

“So even though relations are strained because of the different positions we’ve taken, they’re not bad,” he said, adding that he speaks to UK Prime Minister May probably every two weeks.
“I don’t think things are mutually exclusive. In a lot of areas we’d be very similar. For example on free trade – both of us will want to have as close as possible a relationship when it comes to trade for example, so you know, I think there’s a lot of work we could do together there.
Looking ahead to 2018, the Taoiseach said there will be a fresh push from the Irish government to get the National Executive in Northern Ireland up and running.
“I am very conscious that there are a number of parties in Northern Ireland, all of which represent people there. And I’m certain the Tanaiste and I will be meeting them over the course of January and doing anything we can do to get those institutions up and running again,” he said.
It has been nearly a year and the talks have failed to deliver a solution to governing the North. Talks have progressed, and broken down, with deadlines being extended and then broken.
Options for the North
If talks in the new year fail to re-establish the institutions in the North, the Taoiseach said there are two options open to them.
“There first option is another set of elections, which is an option, although it’s hard to see what outcome would raise from that would put us in a better position. The second option is convening the British-Irish governmental conference, which would allow the two governments to implement the Good Friday Agreement in the absence of an assembly and executive in Northern Ireland,” he explained.
“The Good Friday Agreement provides for matters that are not devolved to be dealt with by the British-Irish governmental conference and that’s what we will seek,” added Varadkar.
While he said the term “joint rule” is not used in the Good Friday Agreement, he said it does speak of a British Irish governmental conference, “which is not joint rule because obviously the legislative powers remain at Westminster, but it does involve real and meaningful involvement of the Irish Government,” he explained.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-competitiveness-2-3505319-Jul2017/,"BREXIT, CHANGES IN US tax and trade policy and uncertain global growth are among the main risks facing Ireland’s competitiveness, a new report has warned.
Ireland’s Competitiveness Scorecard for 2017found that strong economic performance in recent years is masking the country’s vulnerability.
The report from the National Competitiveness Council looks at Ireland’s competitiveness performance when compared to a number of other countries.
It found improvements in the areas of economic growth, improved public finances, trade performance and the labour market.
Exports continued to perform well as did Ireland’s traditional strengths such as the tax regime, having an educated workforce and being a business-friendly environment.

However, despite these positives, the NCC said concerns needed to be addressed in a number of key areas.
Among these were the potential for slower-than-projected growth in the UK and US markets as a result of Brexit and shifts in US policy.
Speaking at the launch of the report, council chair Professor Peter Clinch said that the country was at a “critical juncture” for ensuring the foundations of future competitiveness were in place.
“We face major competitiveness challenges in developing the resilience of the enterprisebase particularly in light of Brexit, and ensuring the environment in which to do business remains competitive, particularly in terms of costs, skills availability, infrastructure capacity and productivity,” he said.
The report found that trying to grow and improve Ireland’s infrastructure within the limits of EU budgetary guidelines was a challenge.
It said that while Ireland’s improving competitiveness performance was positive, the sustainability of growth and improvements in living standards is “under serious and imminent threat” if authorities do not work harder at national level to improve the country’s standing in relation to other nations.

EU President Donald Tusk said the bloc would open “exploratory contacts” with London after European leaders endorsed an interim deal on the terms of Britain’s divorce, and approved the next stage of discussions.
However, they agreed that while talks will begin in January on a post-Brexit transition period of around two years, actual negotiations on future trade ties would not start until March.
“It is now time for internal EU 27 preparations and exploratory contacts with the UK to get more clarity on their vision,” Tusk told reporters at the end of the summit.https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/941630669939249152
He congratulated British Prime Minister Theresa May – who had left the summit late yesterday evening – on the deal, and in return, she offered her thanks to him and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
May tweeted: “Today is an important step on the road to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit and forging our deep and special future partnership.”
As he arrived for the meeting on today, Juncker – who sealed the deal with May on 8 December after tense all-night talks – said the British premier had made “big efforts”.
But he warned the next stage “would be much harder than the first phase, and the first phase was very hard”.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed his comments, saying that while progress had been made, the negotiations ahead would be “even tougher”.
She had earlier warned that “there remain many issues to be solved and we don’t have much time”.
Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016 and is due to end its four-decade membership on 29 March 2019.
Irish concerns

After months of difficult talks, May and Juncker agreed a deal on the key divorce issues of Britain’s exit bill, the future of the Irish border and expatriate rights.
At a meeting without the British premier today, the other EU leaders formally approved negotiating guidelines saying there had been “sufficient progress” and that the second phase could begin.
Last week, doubt was cast on the landmark Brexit deal after Britain’s Brexit minister said that the deal was not legally binding.
Davis toldThe Andrew Marr Show on BBC 1, “This was a statement of intent more than anything else. Much more a statement of intent that it was a legally enforceable thing.”
However, on Sunday, a government spokesperson said Ireland and the EU will hold the UK to the Brexit agreement.
Reiterating this remark today, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney toldRTÉ’s Today With Sean O’Rourkethat all 27 EU countries are insisting that what was committed in phase one of Brexit negotiations has to be followed through in phase two.
“We won’t even progress with it probably beyond March unless there is proof on that. I think the proof of it will be that the EU commission through the Barnier task force will develop a draft withdrawal agreement early in the New Year,” Coveney said.
“There will certainly be a follow through on the commitments that the UK have made in the first phase. And if Britain if not supportive of that, I don’t think the talks will progress.”
Coveney said if we are forced down the road of negotiating a classic free trade agreement with no special deals, it won’t be a good outcome for Ireland or Britain.
He said if the UK insists on leaving the EU, the single market and customs union, it is clear in the guidelines today that the EU team will be forced into looking at a Canada-style trade deal.
“We would prefer if Britain chooses a Norway-style relationship with the EU… where it appeals all the rules of the single market but has preferential access,” Coveney said.
“Now the problem for Britain with that is they become a rule taker but I think here are arrangements they could negotiate around that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/missteps-uk-eu-3733295-Dec2017/,"OVER THE PAST few weeks, UK politicians have been lining up to criticise Ireland for its Brexit stance.
Brexiteers – in the Conservative party, in Labour and in the DUP – want Britain to leave the single market and customs union, and see the Irish government’s attempts to avoid a hard border as denying them the kind of Brexit they want for the UK.
While making their point in various TV spots, and radio interviews, however, some of them have demonstrated little knowledge of the current political landscape in Ireland, while some have got things spectacularly wrong.
Here are few of the faux-pas they’ve made in recent weeks:
“There’s an election going on in Ireland”
Iain Duncan Smith speaking in the House of CommonsPA ImagesPA Images
Iain Duncan Smith has been in politics for nearly 40 years. He was leader of the Conservative party in the early-2000s.
Appearing on Channel 4 News on the same show where English people wereasked to draw the Northern Irish border, the veteran Tory was asked about the potential for Ireland to veto trade talks with the EU if a border solution wasn’t found.
He began: “A lot of things are in the making on this one. There’s an election going on in Ireland…”
Now, as this was going on around the same time as the Frances Fitzgerald controversy, which had only been solved by her resignation earlier that day, Duncan Smith could perhaps have been forgiven for not being up to speed yet.
But, no, that’s not what he meant at all.
The potential for a presidential election next year has little bearing to the government’s stance on Brexit, however.

Iain Duncan Smith showed that he didn’t misspeak on Channel 4 with a doubling-down of this point in a BBC interview earlier this week.
In an interview where he warned the EU to “back off”, the former Tory leader reaffirmed his opinion that Ireland’s harsh Brexit stance was due to the potential for an upcoming presidential election.
He told the BBC: “You know this Irish stuff was not at this state some months ago. Now it’s suddenly become an issue because the Irish, for political reasons internally, presidential elections, disputes between the two elements of the same party, they suddenly laid this on.”
“Enda Kelly”
Where do we start with this one?

He didn’t even misspeak. He referred to both Ahern and “Kelly” as former Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland again later in the interview.

Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is an ardent Brexiteer, critical of Theresa May’s policies, and an advocate of ending free movement and leaving the single market and customs union.
He also got a bit confused about the Fitzgerald controversy, speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show like an election was still on the cards, a full five days after she resigned.
Here’s what he said: “Irish politics at the moment are quite complicated as you know. There’s a vote of no-confidence in the Deputy Prime Minister. They are worried about an election.
“Build that wall”

Labour MP Kate Hoey recently said that she had “seen a lot of negativity from the Irish government” in the Brexit negotiations.
Hoey said that there was “absolutely no way” that the UK would leave the EU but somehow keep Northern Ireland separate.
“So, obviously we want to not have a hard border,” she said.
Channeling a certain US President, she added:
“Ireland has been so disruptive”

Earlier this week, former Conservative Minister and now-BBC pundit Michael Portillo wound up a fair few people with his comments about Ireland keeps “messing up” things for Britain.
He said: “In a historical context, that will be minimal. Ireland has been so disruptive to the British and… and… Britain has been so disruptive to the Irish. I mean you do have to put it in context – our policy has often been determined, thwarted, and just messed up by our relations with Ireland.”
“Internal border with Southern Ireland”
This goes back a little further, but these comments from David Davis, the UK’s Brexit Minister and chief negotiator with EU, set a kind of tone.
Here’s what he told Sky News after the vote last year when asked about whether Scotland could have a veto on leaving the EU: “I don’t think that works.

THE UK’S LABOUR party has undergone a major policy shift on Brexit and has argued for a transitional period where the free movement of people would remain after the country’s March 2019 exit.
Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmeroutlined the change in an articlein today’s Observer in which he also argued that the UK should remain in the European Single Market during that period.
Irish politicians meanwhile, have welcomed the development, with Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin and Labour’s Brendan Howlin who said it was in Ireland’s interest that a hard Brexit is avoided.
“Transitional deal”
“Labour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy with the EU,” Starmer wrote.
“That means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during this period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both,” he said, meaning unimpeded immigration from the EU could continue.
Starmer added that curbs on immigration “must be addressed in the final deal” as it was a key issue in last year’s Brexit referendum.
EU leaders have consistently argued that the UK must leave the single market after Brexit. It had previously been Labour’s policy to accept that this would happen immediately after it separated from the bloc.
Labour’s shift comes as the UK’s Brexit negotiators sit down with their EU counterparts again this week to discuss exit terms.

“A welcome development”
In a statement, Micheál Martin said that UK Labour’s new stance is a “positive development”.
He said: “It is a sensible decision and one which my colleagues and I welcome.
Labour’s Brendan Howlin said that this new stance was welcome but said the UK government still had a lot of work to do to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
“The reality is that UK membership of some kind in the customs union and single market is the only solution that will work for the island of Ireland,” he said.

Sinn Féin, meanwhile, has said it will be in contact with the British Labour Party over the next few weeks to discuss its proposals.
Brexit spokesperson Chris Hazzard MP said: “However, remaining in the Customs Union and Single Market will only deal with part of the negative impacts of Brexit.
“Laying the groundwork”
In a statement, the UK government said that talks this week will likely be technical in nature, “laying the groundwork for more substantive discussions in September”.
Tomorrow, Brexit Minister David Davis will meet with the European Commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, and topics for discussion will include the UK’s position on Northern Ireland, and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.
A UK government source said: “This round of negotiations will focus on thrashing out the technical detail on important matters related to us leaving the EU, and will act as a stepping stone to more substantial talks in September.

The talks are expected to last for four days this week, ahead of further negotiations next month.
The Irish government has been critical of the UK’s approach thus far, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying that he was “confused and puzzled” by the UK’s post-Brexit trading plans earlier this week.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Varadkar said it’s not “realistic” for Britain to expect the advantages of being in the European Union (EU), but none of the responsibilities and costs.
“What trade agreement does the UK want with the EU? At the moment, they have the best trade deal imaginable. What are these better deals the UK really wants from Europe and other countries? Some more clarity would be helpful,” the Taoiseach said.
Last week, Guy Verhofstadt, one of the EU’s Brexit negotiators, described aspects of theUK’s trading planas “fantasy”.
During the interview, Varadkar again stressed he doesn’t want a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
Last month, the Taoiseach also said that Ireland will not participate in any British plans to solve the post-Brexit border issue.
Varadkar said that it was up to the UK to put forward solutions for the handling of the border between north and south in a post-Brexit world.
“Currently there is no economic border. There hasn’t been an economic border since 1992. As far as this government is concerned there shouldn’t be an economic border. We don’t want one,” he said.
After meeting with the UK government’s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland earlier this week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that they “noted that the issues for Northern Ireland can only be addressed through the ongoing EU-UK negotiations”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/foster-varadkar-border-3527522-Aug2017/,"FORMER TAOISEACH JOHN Bruton has said that the UK government and the DUP need to set their stall out for what kind of border they want with Ireland, and accused Arlene Foster’s party of talking in “platitudes” on the issue.
Speaking toRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Bruton said that the British “haven’t come forward with their own ideas” on issues such as borders or remaining in the customs union after it leaves the EU.
He added that it wasn’t necessarily important where the border is, but “what sort of border it is or if we can avoid having a border” were the questions we should ask.
The former Fine Gael leader said that while it looked likely that Brexit would now happen, “we have to do everything we can to stop it happening, if we can”.
“Really, it is the English,” he said. “They have to change their opinion. They have initiated Brexit. The opinion in Northern Ireland was against Brexit, and the opinion in Scotland was against Brexit. That has been overruled.”
Reacting to recent comments from DUP leader Arlene Foster criticising the Irish government’s stance on border issues, Bruton said that her party should be more forthcoming with its own Brexit ideas.
He said: “Some hard questions have to be asked. What sort of Brexit do they want? Do they want the UK in the customs union? What sort of agricultural policy do they want, because that will be very important at the border?

“Not going to help the UK come up with a border solution”
DUP leader Arlene Foster had said that the Taoiseach’s comments about the post-Brexit Irish border were “unhelpful”.
Last week, Varadkarspoke strongly on Ireland’s position, saying that ”we’re not going to help the UK come up with a border solution”.
“Currently there is no economic border. There hasn’t been an economic border since 1992. As far as this government is concerned there shouldn’t be an economic border. We don’t want one,” he said.
Varadkar went on to say that the government’s position is that there should be no border, so it will not help in designing one.
“So let them put forward their proposals as to how they think a border should operate and then we’ll ask them if they really think this is such a good idea because I think it will have a very severe impact on their economy if they decide to go down that route.”
Arlene Foster, however, said that Varadkar remaining “hopeful” that Brexit wouldn’t happen was “disrespecting” the wishes of the British people.
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, meanwhile,has said that Varadkar’s position is “total nonsense”, accusing Varadkar of sparking a series of “inconsistent and incoherent statements”, and “sending mixed messages” on Brexit.

THE UNITED KINGDOM will leave the European Union on 30 March 2019.
But there is much work to be done before that can happen. Actually, there’s much work to be done after it happens too. The so-called transitional period will not end until 31 December 2020 and any ‘future relationship’ between the UK and the EU has to be worked out after the leave date.
Despite numerous keynote speeches from Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May and almost as many press conferences led by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, there is still little concrete detail about what a Brexit will look like.
There was a lot of activity again in Brussels today but the path ahead isn’t exactly clear.
Here’s what wedoknow…
What was published today?
The European Commission published what it’s calling the draft Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK. (You can read it in fullhereif you wish. It comes to 118 pages.)
While everything in it was agreed in principle with the UK during talks before Christmas (you’ll remember the discussions around the Irish border back then), it is only a draft text. This document will be discussed with the European Council and the Brexit Steering Group of the European Parliament before negotiations with the UK begin in earnest.
Changes are expected as early as next month when the Council will add guidelines around the framework for the future relationship.
Again, remember this is adrafttext, drawn up by the EU so there is a starting point for negotiations with the UK about its withdrawal. This is its negotiating position, in full. The UK does not have a similar document as of yet.
So why bother with all the fuss today then?
The EU wants a deal done – written in legal stone – by October 2018 so that it can be ratified by all parties in an efficient manner.
Barnier emphasised today that the UK will be leaving the Union in 13 months. Again, that doesn’t leave much time for negotiations on this draft with the British government.
Barnier: I'm not trying to provoke.  It was the UK which decided unilaterally to leave the UK on the basis of the referendum,  it unilaterally initiated these negotiations to leave at the end of March. We're 13 months - 13 months! - off that date.— Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE)February 28, 2018Tony Connelly/ Twitter
Barnier: I'm not trying to provoke.  It was the UK which decided unilaterally to leave the UK on the basis of the referendum,  it unilaterally initiated these negotiations to leave at the end of March. We're 13 months - 13 months! - off that date.
Or the EU could have decided it wanted its wishlist out there first. A lot of what is included in the text – particularly on Northern Ireland – is the ‘wooden spoon’ if the UK doesn’t come to the table with a better offer of what Brexiteers can deal with.
How is this different to what they were doing before?
Depends on who you talk to. According to Barnier, there are no substantial differences, just more detail. He said there were ‘no surprises’ contained within – although the reaction from May and other British politicians tells a different story.
It details how the UK could make an orderly exit from the EU in terms of citizens’ rights, the divorce bill, matters related to the transition period and, most importantly to us, the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.
The European Commission says this document is simply a translation into legal text of theJoint Report of 8 December 2017andthe EU-UK Joint Technical notewith some of the blanks filled e.g. “The section on citizens’ rights is extremely precise so that it can be relied upon directly by EU citizens in British courts,” the Commission said in amemotoday.
Barnier will answer every angry challenge by a UK journalist by politely pointing out that in December the UK signed on to the basic principles of what has been set out in today's EU document.May now can either claim she was duped or that she did not understand what she signed— Alexander Clarkson  (@APHClarkson)February 28, 2018Alexander Clarkson/ Twitter
Barnier will answer every angry challenge by a UK journalist by politely pointing out that in December the UK signed on to the basic principles of what has been set out in today's EU document.May now can either claim she was duped or that she did not understand what she signed
So what does it say about Northern Ireland?
It contains details of the ‘backstop’ that we heard much about back in December.
That is, failing any deal being reached and a hard Brexit, then Northern Ireland would remain inside the customs union.
Chapter III, Article 3, of the document says:
It would mean alignment between the north and south for customs, VAT, energy, regulations for the protection of the environment and laws governing agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also have to adhere to EU rules on State Aid and would be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in those aforementioned areas.
But all of this is the last resort scenario – what has been labelled Option C.
Oh yeah, I keep hearing about Options A, B and C; unicorns and illusions. What’s the story with them?
The Joint Report, as agreed by the UK and the EU in December, outlined three options for Ireland/Northern Ireland. The details were contained inParagraph 49which reads as follows:
SoOption Ais that the UK and EU will find a way to avoid a hard border and protect North-South cooperation when they decide on what their future relationship will look like. In short, this would mean a very soft Brexit where the customs union remains in play for the UK.
This cannot even be discussed until Britain actually leaves in March next year. It is also looking less likely as hardline Brexiteers in May’s government insist they are leaving both the single market and the customs union, while for its part, the EU says the UK cannot cherry pick what parts of the Union it wants to keep. Hence, unicorns and illusions.
Option Bthen looks to the UK to “propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland”. Barnier today said he looks forward to seeing these proposals. No viable ones (see Boris Johnson’s London borough comparison) have been forthcoming as yet. Hence, unicorns and illusions.
So then,Option C.
This was the only one included in this document but the Commission insists all three “remain on the table” but with the following caveat:
If another solution is found, it would supersede this protocol. Barnier did say today that he would prefer Option A, as did Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
Under these proposals, where would the border be?
Probably unsurprisingly, it’s not clear.
Asked by journalists today, Barnier said he would not refer to a border in the Irish Sea but conceded there would be checks at ports and airports.
In response to a final question on Customs Union divide through the Irish Sea, Barnier points out again that the UK signed on to a set of principles over the Irish border and then bluntly states that it is up to the British to determine their own constitutional arrangements— Alexander Clarkson  (@APHClarkson)February 28, 2018Alexander Clarkson/ Twitter
In response to a final question on Customs Union divide through the Irish Sea, Barnier points out again that the UK signed on to a set of principles over the Irish border and then bluntly states that it is up to the British to determine their own constitutional arrangements
May, however, said that this deal would, if implemented, create “a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea”.
Barnier was accused of – but denied – meddling in the constitutional affairs of the UK.
Is any of this binding?
Absolutely not and May has said today that she – or any other Prime Minister – would not sign up to it as is.
Speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), she said she will be “crystal clear” to the EU that she opposes the proposal, adding that it threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK.

In the same session, she reaffirmed her commitment to avoiding a hard border.
Echoing her sentiments, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davies told his fellow Conservative party MPs in a letter today that the draft, as published today, would undermine the UK’s common market and constitutional integrity.

As Leo Varadkar predicted last night, there are ‘difficult’ times ahead.
We’ve a long way to go before this agreement is turned into legal text before the October 2018 deadline.
Why are the DUP angry?
No.
Not even a little bit.
Members were out the gates early after RTÉ’s Tony Connelly leaked aspects of the document last night with their criticisms and leader Arlene Foster today confirmed that the text is “unacceptable” to her party.
In a tweet, she said if Brexit played out with Option C it would be “economically catastrophic” for Northern Ireland.
EU draft text is constitutionally unacceptable & would be economically catastrophic for Northern Ireland. I welcome the Prime Minister's commitment that HMG will not allow any new border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland must have unfettered access to GB market. AF— Arlene Foster DBE PC #ProudofNI.

Is the Irish government happy?
Reasonably.
The Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister formally welcomed the text after its publication today, calling it an important step in the Brexit process.
“The draft includes a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the draft agreement, and gives legal effect to the firm commitments made in December,” Simon Coveney said in a written statement.
“At the same time, there is now the necessary legal provision to implement the backstop of maintaining full alignment in Northern Ireland with the rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to protect North South cooperation and avoid a hard border. This is very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary. This is about delivering on our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, no less, no more.”
Later, he questioned May’s ability to deliver on her promises to both leave the single market and customs union while ensuring there will be no hard border.
He said this in itself was “hard to see”, tellingRTÉ Radio Onethat nobody was looking to pick a fight or to have a go at the British government.
“Our response is, look, this [option C] doesn’t have to be the solution but come up with something better that we can agree and we’d be delighted to agree.”
Would the people of Northern Ireland have any say before the customs rules come into effect?
It is difficult to answer anything with certainty as we’re talking in hypotheticals but it would be unusual if one part of the UK was asked about arrangements, when others weren’t.
And, as previously stated, if Option C happens, it would actually be by default, not arrangement, because of the deal agreed to in December which could be put on a legally binding footing if it makes it into the final legal text in October. That is a big if though.
How much closer are we to a hard Brexit now?
Hard to say. There are still 13 months to try to figure out a deal. But it does make a Brexit more real.
Leon Neal / Getty ImagesLeon Neal / Getty Images / Getty Images
Former prime minister John Major made a significant speech today, accusing May of ‘bad politics’ and ‘grand folly’. He said that he opposed Brexit because he was patriotic and didn’t want to see his country isolated, cut off and a bystander in international politics.
He urged May to change course and show a “willingness to compromise”. He also mooted the idea of a second vote, saying:
However, that second vote would only come about after MPs get a free vote on the potential legislation – and then parliament should be allowed to vote on having a second referendum.
Are there other things in the document outside of the Northern Ireland stuff?
Yes.
It deals with:
Barnier's press conference todayThierry Monasse / Getty ImagesThierry Monasse / Getty Images / Getty Images
So, what does it say then on citizens’ rights?
Some of those blanks that are filled in by this draft treaty relate to citizens’ rights.
The document outlines that the rules agreed to in December – to give European Union citizens, regardless of country of origin, the right to reside in the UK if they currently live there (or do so any time up to the end of the transition period) – should also be extended to future spouses and civil partners. It also offers more safeguards to those people covered by these rules, ensuring they can cross the border of the host State (the UK) without fear of not being allowed back in.
The UK is not happy with the proposal that EU citizens arriving during the transition period are treated the same as those who were there before that process began.

Further plans in the document would see a professional person who has their qualifications recognised by the UK currently retain that status after the leave date.
The text, published today, if implemented, would also see the establishment of an ‘independent authority’ in the UK which would “monitor the implementation and application of the citizens’ right part of the Withdrawal Agreement”.
According to the Commission, this body should have the “power to receive and investigate complaints from EU citizens and their family members, and to conduct inquiries on its own initiative, concerning alleged breaches by administrative authorities of the UK of their obligations under the citizens’ rights part of the Withdrawal Agreement”.
And the divorce bill?
This follows what was agreed in December and outlines payment deadlines and other practical pieces of information. The Commission said there was no need to make any adjustment to the £39 billion agreed financial settlement.
What does the UK government say about all that?
In his letter today, Davies said that negotiations have been “progressing well” in recent weeks. He said much of what is included will be “comparatively straightforward”, citing the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens residing in Member States and the EU budget plan to 31 December 2020 (the UK will honour its obligations to that end).
However, he also takes issue with the mechanisms mentioned for governing and enforcing any Brexit. He says the UK will not stand for the continuing jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (CJEU).
He said he hopes to continue to engage in discussions in good faith and that many of the ‘separation issues’ mentioned in the draft text will not come to fruition because they will be superseded by agreements made when discussing future economic and security partnerships.
What next?
May is due to give another one of those keynote speeches on Brexit on Friday.
She will then talk to her MPs about Brexit policy on Monday. (They asked for more details today and she told them to ‘Just calm down’, according toThe Guardian.)
And we will all edge ever closer to 30 March 2019.

BEEF FARMERS ARE warning that a hard Brexit would be “catastrophic” for them.
A new report entitled Crisis – The EU Meat Industry in a Hard Brexit Scenario this week found that trade would “collapse” in the event of a hard Brexit.
The report, commissioned by Europe’s meat Industry body, UECBV found that a hard Brexit would lead to:

The report adds that the scenario would lead to additional veterinary checks and increased transport costs lead to a reduction of trade in meat from EU to UK by up to 84% for beef, 76% for sheepmeat and 48% for pigmeat. The effect of this excess meat on the EU market would decrease beef price by 8.8% and pigmeat price by 7.3% in the short term.
Commenting on the report’s launch, Cormac Healy, Director of Meat Industry Ireland said:
“A hard Brexit represents the greatest threat to European producers, consumers and processors of meat, with a potential impact much greater than the Russian import ban.
“By potentially cutting off one of the largest and highest value meat markets in Europe, Brexit threatens to be catastrophic for the meat sector across Europe and UK.
“The findings contained in this Report confirm our worst fears: A Hard Brexit would send shock waves through the whole European meat industry, destroying jobs, crippling trade and devaluing meat output across the EU. The scale of this crisis is simply too great to ignore, and we implore policymakers to follow through on recommendations put forward in this Report and to protect this vital European food sector” he added.

DRINKING OUT OF his ‘World’s Best Taoiseach’mug on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar could hardly hide his delight.
After a stop-start week of Brexit negotiations, the Taoiseach finally got his moment in the sun when it appeared he had emerged unscathed while Theresa May and Arlene Foster had to spin their wins.
His smile was evident throughout the early morning press conference when he announced there will be no hard border.
“This is a very significant day for everyone on the island of Ireland.”
Varadkar is riding high on the wave of the latest opinion poll from The Irish Times which has Fine Gael with a double-digit lead over Fianna Fáil.
Word of the poll seeped through as Fine Gael and Fianna Fail both held their Christmas drinks on Wednesday night. The Taoiseach was clearly in good spirits, despite the Brexit negotiations hanging in the balance.

It appears nothing consolidates the Irish more than ‘outsiders’ throwing their weight around.
The Taoiseach was told to ”shut your gob” by the British edition of The Sun, then there were lines from the DUP thatIreland was being overly “aggressive”in its approach, and criticism that the Irish government shouldn’t even be mentioning a united Ireland (despite it being a key element of the Good Friday Agreement).
Perhaps all of the above gave Leo a Brexit bounce.
Fianna Fáil on the other hand were keeping their cards close to their chests, stating that they don’t pay heed to polls, and pointing to the trend of past surveys which they say shows the bigger picture.
Despite the news giving the Fine Gael Christmas drinks a healthy boost – there were some that put the jump down to “the public obviously realising that we were right all along, and that Frances Fitzgerald did nothing wrong”.
Wishful thinking, perhaps. Or the Christmas drink.
A long week in politics
A week can be a long time in politics and if you cast your mind back just 14 days, Varadkar’s leadership was in crisis. How Varadkar handled the whole Fitzgerald email situation was downright puzzling to people, including some in his own party.
He brazenly thought he could ride out the storm, but once additional emails were revealed, the writing was on the wall for Fitzgerald.
Despite her stepping aside, the Taoiseach’s loyalty was still evident when he stated that he couldn’t wait for her to be vindicated and for her to return to a high position within the party.

The whole mess took the country to the brink of an election. His stubbornness and the realisation that this just wouldn’t have got this far under Enda Kenny had people  scratching their heads.
But hey, there’s nothing like an international crisis, in which you, a pretty tiny country in the grand scheme of things, is at the centre. If the British and the Europeans didn’t know much about Leo Varadkar, they certainly do now.
Casual Mondays
Which is why the Taoiseach’s wardrobe choice on Monday had people talking. Monday was the day a deal was looking most likely.
Donald Tusk’s “tell me why I like Monday’s” tweet set the stage, there were positive words coming from both the Europeans and British and it all looked like it was going to be much more straightforward than anticipated.
But no one didcasual Monday like Leo Varadkarwho rolled into Government Buildings post-work out in a red activewear vest top.

With the press waiting in a holding pen at Government Buildings, it soon became evident that the DUP had issued a reminder of their existence and Theresa May was left to scuttle out of her lunch with Juncker and tell reporters that no deal had been done.
It all looked dead in the water on Monday. Who was to blame? There was a lot of finger-pointing. Arlene Foster rounded on the Irish government claiming they had told Theresa May not to show then the final text.
Realistically, this isn’t credible.
The Irish government just does not have that clout, something confirmed by a source close to the Taoiseach likening it to Theresa May requesting Varadkar not tell Kevin Boxer Moran or Katherine Zappone certain information.

There is no doubt that Anglo-Irish relations have been damaged over the past week. Varadkar admitted it himself during the week, noting he wishes to rebuild relationships.
However, that will remain difficult with scathing remarks still emanating from various quarters, such as DUP MEP Sammy Wilson who chastised the “green” approach from “those two” (Varadkar and Coveney) which he claimed had pushed relations back years.
In some eyes, Varadkar’s handling of the Fitzgerald debacle made him looked naive and inexperienced, but the Brexit talks changed that somewhat.
However, the success was not a one-man (or even one-party) play. Ireland’s success, and in turn Leo’s, was down to the country having unwavering support from the big players in Europe.
Had Ireland been batting solo – there could have been a very different outcome. Unusually, he also had across-the-floor support from all parties in Dáil Eireann.
With the first Brexit crisis out of the way though, it’s the ever-steady list of domestic problems and crises that could trip up the Taoiseach.
Health, hospital waiting lists, homelessness, housing, home carers in distress, corporation tax, the abortion referendum, not to mention the threat of a possible election … and sometimes,it can just be the little things.
Roll on 2018.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-brexit-sun-3704287-Nov2017/,"THE UK SUN newspaper launched a strong attack against Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, writing that he should “grow up” and help “make Brexit work for millions of his citizens and ours”.
The Sun’s editorial comment came following strong words from Varadkar at a European Union summit in Sweden yesterday.
The Irish leader raised the issue of the border between the UK and Ireland, saying more progress needed to be made before the Brexit negotiations could move on to the next phase.
Doubling-down on Ireland’s position that more work needs to be done before phase two of the Brexit talks, Varadkar said Ireland wants any kind of physical border “off the table” before that.
“Needless to say my main concern as Taoiseach, as Prime Minister of Ireland, and we’ve been talking for 18 months and we’ve been given assurances now for 18 months since the referendum, is that there’ll be no hard border,” he said.
“That there’ll be no physical infrastructure, that we won’t go back to the borders of the past. And we want that written down in practical terms at the conclusion of phase one.
Sun response
Varadkar’s position won him praise from many quarters, with commentators praising the tough stance.
However, his words also raised the ire of some pro-Brexit politicians and commentators.
The fiercest of criticism has come from editorial comment in the Sun.
The SunThe Sun
The paper said that Varadkar needs to “accept what’s happening”.
“His priority should not be picking holes in our position,” the comment states.
“It should be helping make Brexit work for millions of his citizens and ours, including by engaging constructively on a border solution.
The editorial states Ireland’s economy depends hugely on the UK’s.
It states that the UK is “Ireland’s biggest trading partner” and that effects of a hard Brexit “could be catastrophic”.
“Yet Varadkar’s rookie diplomacy, puerile insults and threats to veto trade negotiations are bringing it ever closer,” the Sun states.

Varadkar also drew criticism from Labour Party MP Kate Hoey.
Hoey said on Twitter that “no one wants a hard border so why does [Varadkar] imply it is british government’s responsibility?”

Praise
Despite the harsh criticism, Varadkar also won a lot of praise for his tough stance among domestic and international commentators.
Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin condemned the Sun editorial, calling it “ignorant, bullying and ageist”.
“The UK Sun is entitled to put its point of view.  But the tone of this editorial is deliberately offensive and will contribute nothing to resolving the issues our countries face,” he said.
“It reverts to the bad old days when the UK thought it could tell Ireland what to do, a view no longer held by the vast majority of the British people.
“The Taoiseach is representing the interests of Irish citizens and indeed many UK citizens living in Northern Ireland. He is not just entitled to do so, he is obliged to do so.
Former UK Labour Party Government Press Secretary Alastair Campbell said Varadkar should “play hardball”.

Sky News political correspondent Lewis Goodall wrote in an analysis piece that Ireland had a strong power hold over the UK in relation to Brexit and the border.
“And so it comes to pass that Brexit, where we were meant to take back control, has thrown up a unique historical conundrum,”he wrote.
As well as the meeting of the EU leaders, Varadkar met bilaterally with UK Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday morning.
Following their meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said:

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-davis-brexit-assessment-3736485-Dec2017/,"BRITAIN’S BREXIT MINISTER David Davis has come under fire after admitting to MPs that the government has made no official assessment of the impact of Brexit on various sectors of the UK economy.
Davis was called before the House of Commons Brexit committee after MPs were dissatisfied with the “sectoral analysis” provided to the committee by the government.
He told the committee that “he wasn’t a fan of economic models because they have all proven wrong”, citing the 2008 economic crisis as an example of their inability to model “paradigm” changes.
The government initially said it would provide the committee with an 850-page assessment of Brexit’s impact on 58 economic sectors.
However, Davis said the studies were merely “sectoral analyses”, which did not predict the effects of leaving the EU.

When asked about whether there were impact assessments completed on the financial services, automotive and aerospace, Davis said: “I think the answer is going to be no for all of them.”
“You don’t need to do an impact assessment, a formal impact assessment to understand that if there is a regulatory hurdle between our producers and a market that it will have an impact, it all has an effort,” David told MPs.
“The assessment of that effect, I think I have said it to you before, is not as straightforward as people imagine.

The fact that no impact studies had been for aviation, automobiles and financial services drew derision.
Commission chair Hilary Benn said: ”On the most fundamental change that we are facing as a country you’ve just told us that the government hasn’t undertaken any impact assessments at all.”
Davis said there would be such studies “at some stage” when Brexit negotiations move on to the second phase, but other lawmakers also hit out.
“Davis is either grossly incompetent or someone who struggles with the truth and treats MPs with contempt,” said Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas.
“Either way, he should be out of his job.”
Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron also called for Davis to step down, writing on Twitter that under his leadership “the Brexit department has turned incompetence into an art form.”
MPs have also approached House of Commons speaker John Bercow about the possibility of a contempt motion against Davis, but the move appears unlikely after the committee voted it down by 11 members to eight.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that he wants to be “building bridges not borders” with Northern Ireland in the aftermath of Brexit.
Speaking from Belfast today after meeting with DUP leader Arlene Foster and other political party leaders, he also repeated his opposition to an economic border.
“Brexit seriously risks driving a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, between Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar said. ”And I cannot imagine who benefits from that.”
Cross-border infrastructure projects such as roads were made possible due to the current free movement of goods and people, he said.
“That’s our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders,” he said.
Varadkar said he would prefer if Britain remained in the EU, and failing that, for it to stay in the European single market to maintain the current free trade arrangements between Ireland and the UK.

Another way to smooth Britain’s departure would be to establish an EU-UK customs union, he said.
Noting that this type of deal existed with Turkey, he said, “Surely we can have one with the United Kingdom.”
In a speech at Queen’s University Belfast, he said the alternative could mean a return of customs posts, which he called “a brutal physical manifestation of historic divisions and political failure”.
But he warned “the clock is ticking” to reach an agreement, as Britain began the two-year process of leaving the bloc in March.

‘Challenge of our lifetime’
A border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has been publicly highlighted as a top priority in the negotiations between Brussels and London, which began in June.
There are fears the return of a ‘hard’ border would disrupt the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, which was plagued by decades of unrest until a 1998 peace deal.
Varadkar described Brexit as “the challenge of our generation”, saying: “Every single aspect of life in Northern Ireland could be affected by the outcome.”
‘Nonsense,’ says the DUP
Varadkar’s visit to the north follows a barrage of verbal attacks by the DUP who weren’t happy when Varadkar said he favoured no border – economic or otherwise – between north and south.
“We’re not going to be helping them to design some sort of border that we don’t believe should exist in the first place,” he said.
His comments, which also expressed the hope of a U-turn over Brexit, provoked a furious reaction from the DUP.
“He may be hopeful, but that is disrespecting the will of the British people – Brexit is going to happen, we are leaving the European Union,” Foster said.
Deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds went a bit further – he called Varadkar’s position on no border “nonsense” and said that the government had been going backwards since Enda Kenny left office.
Varadkar also called for the immediate restoration of the Stormont Assembly, which has been suspended since power-sharing collapsed earlier this year amid bitter divisions between the pro-British DUP and Irish nationalist Sinn Féin.

IRELAND WILL NOT be used as a pawn in any “bigger negotiations” between the UK and Europe, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, said today.
“We will be realistic and fair but we will also be stubborn in relation to defending Ireland’s interests,” the minister told the media in Iveagh House in Dublin today.
In a policy paper published today, London outlined its wish to have no hard border between Ireland and the North after the UK leaves the EU.
The UK government has said it wants to maintain a “seamless and frictionless” border between the two countries. Currently people and goods are able to move freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
The possibility of a hard border being introduced following Brexit has stoked concern for people living in the areas of both countries that would be most affected.
According to the UK government, it will be pushing to avoid any physical border infrastructure and border posts for any purpose following Brexit.
While welcoming the two UK Brexit position papers on customs, Northern Ireland and other Irish issues, Coveney said he is glad to see an acknowledgement by the British that technology will not work in controlling the post-Brexit border.

“This paper seems to say that type of infrastructure (cameras on the border and number plate recognition) is not going to happen and I think that is welcome.
“I think it is vindication of the position that we have been taking that technology is not going to solve this border issue,” said Coveney, who admitted it might assist in the future.
A solution which does not exist anywhere else
What is needed now, he said, is a “political solution” and one that “doesn’t have any precedent within the EU”.
Speaking specifically about the issue of the border, the minister said areas that need to be addressed are issues such as farmland, agri-food and disease control.
“Diseases and animals don’t respect borders,” he said, adding:
Coveney said he is satisfied there is commitment to avoid any physical border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, but said more clarity is needed as to how this is going to be achieved.

“Delivering on aspirations will be difficult,” he said, telling reporters that there are “still many unanswered questions”.
The British media coverage of Brexit
Coveney was quick to point out that the two position papers released by the UK government are just that – position papers and a jumping off point for negotiations.
He said the UK position on issues such as Northern Ireland was “badly needed”, adding “now we have to negotiate the realities of that paper”.

He said he was pleased to also see other issues, such as the Common Travel Area, the Good Friday Agreement and peace co-operation mentioned in the new Brexit papers.
The minister said, for the first time ever, the UK has also acknowledged the need for a common electricity market on the island of Ireland, as it will impact greatly on prices in the North.
Irish concerns are Europe’s concerns
“We appreciate the extent to which Irish Government concerns in these areas are being taken on board,” he said, adding that it reinforces what Europe’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier has been stating for some time: “Ireland’s interests are Europe’s interests.”
While welcoming the clarity the British have given today, he clarified that Ireland will not be used “as a pawn”, adding that his focus is delivering the best deal for the people of Ireland.
He said the Irish government is preparing for the “worst case scenario”.
Ireland cannot be walked to the “cliff edge” and “pushed over”, said the Cork TD, stating it was correct that preparations for all possible scenarios are discussed.
The decision to leave the EU was a British decision, not an Irish one, said Coveney. However, despite this fact, Ireland must be prepared to protect its own interests.
The release of the UK position papers has been described as timely and helpful, but the government warned, “protecting the peace process is crucial and it must not become a bargaining chip in the negotiations”.
Customs
The UK yesterday laid out its plansto leave the customs union in order to negotiate a new deal with the EU.
To replace this union, the government released a document outlining two possible options: a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” or a “new customs partnership” with the EU.
Under a new customs partnership, the UK said there would be no customs border at all between the UK and Ireland.
Under a highly streamlined customs arrangement, provisions to deal with the border could include:
The UK said both these arrangements would need facilitations which reflect the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.
However, Guy Verhofstadt, one of the EU’s Brexit negotiators, yesterday described aspects of the customs plan as “fantasy”, so it remains to be seen how Europe will react to these proposals.

Good Friday Agreement
The UK paper also makes clear its plans to protect the Common Travel Area (CTA) between Ireland and the UK and the rights for citizens that go with it.
It also committed to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and called on the EU to prioritise these objectives also.
“Both sides need to show flexibility and imagination when it comes to the border issue in Northern Ireland and that is exactly what our latest position paper will do,” a UK government source said.

Irish response
“The immediate focus for the coming rounds of negotiations remains on advancing the issues identified for phase one of the negotiations, including citizens’ rights and the financial settlement, as well as issues specific to Ireland,” said Coveney.

Transport Minister Shane Ross and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney were given Cabinet approval for a new agreement with the UK on the mutual recognition of driver disqualification in both countries.
A government spokesperson said clarity on the issue was needed in light of Brexit.

The 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications did allow for the transfer of such disqualifications. However, there had been confusion surrounding a number of cases since the UK pulled out of the EU directive in 2013.
Advice was sought by the Attorney General in 2014, and it was advised that a new agreement, replacing the old, was needed.
The agreement involves disqualification for offences that involve, reckless or dangerous driving, hit-and-run driving, driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as well as speeding.
Disqualifications as a result of accumulating penalty points arenotincluded in the arrangements, for the time being, as this would require further primary legislation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/previewing-irelands-economy-in-2018-its-gonna-get-better-before-it-gets-worse-3758948-Dec2017/,"PEOPLE LIKE TO have something to look forward to. That’s why, even in the dark days of December, people look forward to ringing in the New Year, full of new possibilities.
They may call economics the ‘dismal science’, but even economists are not immune to looking for silver linings among the winter clouds. So, what’s in store for the Irish economy in 2018, I hear you ask?
Growth forecast
The latest data from the CSO number crunchers suggest an economy in rude health. The official numbers suggest the economy, as measured by GDP, was more than 10% larger in the three months to end-September than a year earlier, and up more than 60% from the mid-crisis low recorded in early 2013.
True, these eye-watering numbers owe much to the distortions caused by multinational activity, dubbed ‘Leprechaun economics’ by some. But, even the least distorted element of GDP, personal consumption, is up 2.8% on a year earlier, and 14.3% since the first three months of 2013.
Just last month, the European Commission upgraded itsgrowth forecastfor Ireland and the EU as a whole. Even though Irish GDP is projected to slow slightly, from 4.8% this year to a still-healthy 3.9% in 2018, this is still enough to see Ireland retain third place in the growth league table, behind only Malta and Romania.
Ireland’s growth rates this year and next are expected to be about double the rates in Germany and three times the rates in the Brexit-stricken UK.
As a small, open, trading nation, we are benefitting from the most sustained and synchronised expansion in the global economy in a decade, with all major regions growing simultaneously and relatively strongly. The OECD recently revised upwards its global GDP growth forecasts to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018.
Of course, you can’t eat GDP. So, what does it all mean for you and me?
More people back at work
The Irish economy is generating more than 1,000 full-time jobs every week, while people are increasingly moving from part-time to full-time work. Unemployment is on course to fall towards 5% by the end of 2018, levelsnot seen since 2007.
After half a decade of stagnation, wage growth is starting to show signs of life, with hourly earnings up 2.2% in the past year and the ESRI predicting they will increase by 3% in 2018. Average weekly earnings have barely moved since early 2016, while hourly earnings have actually fallen slightly.
Given this relatively rosy picture, it doesn’t come as much surprise that inflation has turned a corner too. Having been falling until the middle of this year, there areearly signsthat consumer prices are starting to pick up, with inflation expected to accelerate through 2018.
Tax changes and the 30 cent an hour increase in the minimum wage, both announced in October’s budget, should provide a further modest but welcome boost to pay packets when they kick in in January. In such an environment, it won’t come as any surprise if the coming months see consumer confidence surpass the post-crisis high set in February 2016 to reach levelsnot seensince 2006.

Risks over the horizon
The government’s much-needed plan to hike capital spending is likely to further boost the economy over the coming years, while ensuring infrastructure is in place to support growth over the longer term.
An extra €790m capital spend was allocated for 2018, bringing the total to €5.3bn for the year, a stepping stone towards the €7.8bn foreseen annually by 2021. About a third of the 2018 capital spend, or €1.8bn, will be dedicated to housing, funding the construction of 3,800 social homes.
Even if the number of houses being constructed is already starting to pick up, it is a drop in the ocean compared to the number needed to provide for new households, let alone clear the backlog of recent years and truly address the housing crisis.
But, as the ESRI and others have pointed out, the expected normalisation of housebuilding could cause the economy to overheat just as it approaches what economists call ‘full employment’. As Ireland learned in the early years of the 21st century, an overheating economy can feel great at the time, but it stores up problems for the future.
The elephant stomping around the room
Without doubt, Brexit is the elephant stomping around the room. Already, the UK’s economy has slowed and sterling has weakened, hurting Irish exporters. Things could get infinitely worse if the negotiations go pear-shaped during 2018, resulting in a ‘hard Brexit’ and new tariffs on our trade with Britain.
Recent researchhas shown that Ireland is the country with most to lose from Brexit under any scenario; even more than the UK itself. But, Irish job losses could reach 50,000 (about 1 in 40 jobs in the country) in the event of a ‘hard Brexit’ in early 2019, nearly 5 times worse than a ‘soft Brexit’ scenario.
Another fly in the ointment is the tax reform package passed in the US this week, which will see their corporation tax rate reduced from 35% to 21% from 2018 onwards.
Other changes included a 15.5% amnesty rate at which US multinationals can repatriate historical profits and a move towards a ‘territorial’ tax system whereby global profits of US multinationals will be exempt from US taxes going forward. The aim of these reforms is to bring jobs and investment back to US, meaning places like Ireland could lose out in the future.
Apple Inc alone isreportedto be in line to gain $47bn from the amnesty, given that it maintains a cash mountain of over $200bn in Ireland and other jurisdictions.
Things likely to get a bit better
These tax changes will take time to feed through to multinationals’ investment decisions, and may not in any case lead to the scale of ‘re-shoring’ of jobs to the US that has been hoped for (or feared, from an Irish vantage point). So, the impact in 2018 may be rather limited, but can expect to be felt from 2019 onwards.
Other headwinds from the US include further interest rate hikes, although in Europe the ECB has signaled its intention to keep printing money until at least next September, while any interest rate rises would be even further in the future.
But, none of Brexit, US tax changes, ECB interest rate rises or the fallout from an overheating economy are expected to weigh heavily on Ireland in 2018. Even buoyant financial markets look set to continue defying economic gravity in the short term. Our national economic wellbeing may be haunted by the ghost of Christmas Past, and fearful of the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sammy-wilson-coveney-varadkar-3739986-Dec2017/,"DUP MP SAMMY Wilson has claimed that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have been “cynical, aggressive, green and partisan” in their approach to Brexit negotiations.
Wilson is one the DUP’s most prominent voices in Westminster and was speaking toRTÉ’s News at Onefollowing this morning’s announcement thatan agreement was reached between the UK and the EUabout the Irish border post-Brexit.
The deal had appeared to be reached on Monday but this was scuppered at the last-minute by the concerns of the unionist party.
Wilson was among those in the DUP who blamed the Irish government for its approach during negotiations and again today claimed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney had antagonised the unionist community.
“In Northern Ireland their handling of this has been seen as cynical, aggressive, green, partisan and has damaged relationships which were built up over a long period of time,” he said.
“And whether they like it or not, they have damaged those relationships and are going to have to do a lot of work to convince unionists that they are not seeking to undermine Northern Ireland’s position and using Brexit as a cover to do so.”
In the past, Wilson has frequently made headlines for attacks on political opponents.
Last year he comparedSinn Féin to the so-called Islamic Stategroup and he also made headlines when he said that publicbreastfeeding amounted to “exhibitionism”.

Disagreements between the Taoiseach and the DUP have been an undercurrent of the Brexit talks over the last six months.
Back in July, the DUP’s Nigel Dodds claimed Varadkar’s position on theborder was “total nonsense”and there have been numerous other such examples since.
In the Dail this week, Varadkar said that the DUP doesnot speak for everyone in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Féin
Sinn Féin has also been giving its reaction to this morning’s deal with party president Gerry Adams giving it a “cautious and qualified welcome”.
“While the communiqué recognises the unique and special circumstances surrounding the issue of the Irish peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and the border it does not address key areas of concern for many citizens, especially nationalists living in the north and citizens in the border region,” Adams said.
“The insistence by the British that Britain and the North must leave the customs union and the single market presents a real and live danger which cannot be understated.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ballybofey-vacant-town-3-3588271-Sep2017/,"
LAST WEEK, DONEGAL’S Ballybofey was named the centre with the most commercial vacancies in Ireland – but locals say that doesn’t paint a true picture of the town.
Located on the south side of the River Finn, Ballybofey is about a half-hour drive from Letterkenny and the Northern Ireland border.
It ranked bottom in an analysis of just over 100 locations around the country by GeoDirectory and DKM consultancy, which found that just over28% of all the shops and offices in the town are empty.
That’s double the national average, although vacancy rates have improved slightly since 2016 -when Edenderry topped the poll.
Unsurprisingly, people on the ground were irritated by the new title of ‘most vacant’ town in Ireland.
“It’s very frustrating,” said Leah Fairman, manager of the town’s BASE business centre. “It gives the idea that we’re a ghost town. The opposite is true, this is a really bustling market town.”
Fairman said the figures may be accurate - there are a lot of vacant units in the town – but the statistics don’t tell the full story.
“If I think about the screetscape, there are individual units that might be cafés and things like that which would generally have a high turnover (of occupants),” she toldFora. “Other than that, most of the units would be things that were never quite completed.”

This point was echoed by Fine Gael councillor and local publican Martin Harley, who said that a lot of commercial properties in Ballybofey are leftovers from the Celtic Tiger years.
Harley said Ballybofey has experienced the same issues as any small town in the west of Ireland, namely that a lot of business migrated outside the town centre, making it difficult to attract main-street trade.
The region has also seen its population shrink in recent times – County Donegal was one of the four constituencies in Ireland to record a decline in the 2016 census.
Harley said the county council “has been talking to the people who own these properties” in Ballybofey in an effort to spruce up the vacant and unfinished units.
“The council has looked at buying up some of the houses in the town centre with the view to leasing them out to council tenants,” he said, adding that this might help get things moving in the town centre.

Commercial rates
For Harley, the real problem facing Ballybofey business owners is a “crippling” commercial rates system, which he said should be based on a company’s turnover and not the value of a property.
Martin McElhinney – general manager of Ballybofey’s famous McElhinney’s department store – agreed that commercial rates are a “large barrier” for businesses but said the problems there are on a national scale.
“Ireland is a very, very unfriendly environment for a young entrepreneur,” he said. “I talk to people every day and there are some great ideas out there, but it’s a not a business-friendly environment in Ireland.”
Martin McElhiinneyMcElhiinney's Department StoreMcElhiinney's Department Store
McElhinney complained that there is little support for self-employed people and that there is too much “lip service” paid by the government in Dublin, particularly when it comes to the cost of doing business in the Republic.
“People who are in employment at the moment, if they take a self-employed position, that’s a big risk,” he said. “God forbid they take a chance and their business fails, there’s no safety net.
Leah Fairman said it was unfortunate that it took a tragedy like the recentfloods in Donegalto bring media and government attention to the area – although she was quick to praise Donegal County Council, which has helped fund the BASE business centre.

Brexit
While many have predicted the recent plunge in sterling would hit border towns like Ballybofey hard, McElhinney said the challenge of a fluctuating exchange rate is nothing new.
“The border has an amplifying effect,” he said. “When things are very good, it’s very good. When things are bad, it’s very bad.
When asked what business owners in the town were crying out for the most, Fairman said transport infrastructure is a major issue.
“We’re still without trains,” she said, an issue that wasrecently acknowledged by Donegal Airport. “That may seem small, but it does have an impact on how far people are willing to travel.
“We also need a motorway,” Fairman added,echoing a call from the Sligo-based Revive Northwest campaign. ”In the modern age, people aren’t willing to sit on single-track roads.”
McElhinney, whose family have been in business in the town for 50 years, said it was “a different environment today than when my father started – it’s more difficult”.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has batted away critics of her leadership, saying she is “not a quitter”.
May is under pressure from across her Conservative party over her Brexit strategy and her domestic policy programme, with one veteran MP calling it “dull, dull, dull”.
The House of Lords has been scrutinising a key piece of legislation on quitting the EU as a leaked government report shows only economic downsides to leaving the bloc.
May made her comments as she began her three-day visit to China, which kicked off in the central industrial city of Wuhan and continued in the Chinese capital.

“First and foremost, I’m serving my country and my party. I’m not a quitter and there’s a long-term job to be done,” she told reporters travelling with her on a visit to China, according tothe BBC.
“That job is about getting the best Brexit deal, it’s about ensuring that we take back control of our money, our laws, our borders, that we can sign trade deals around the rest of the world. But it’s also about our domestic agenda.”
“We need to ensure that we do speak about the achievements that we’ve seen,” she added.
May was severely weakened by the UK’s general election in June in which she lost her parliamentary majority, forcing the Conservatives into a power alliance with Northern Ireland’s DUP.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/snobbery-and-hypocrisy-when-some-people-in-the-26-counties-talk-about-the-north-3743432-Dec2017/,"SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HAPPENED last week in Ireland, and I don’t just mean the resolution on the Irish border issue. Some healing took place if you will.
Leo Varadkar had a message for Irish men and women in the North: “You will never again be left behind by an Irish government.”
Northern nationalists had been somewhat forgotten

For the first time we had a Taoiseach acknowledging that northern nationalists had been somewhat forgotten about and left behind since the formation of the two States. A healing moment. Comments that were welcomed and did not go unnoticed by all sections of the community there.
Over the years I’ve had several conversations with people from across this island about Irish history and politics. And although I think it’s important to stand up for one’s beliefs, I find it equally important to listen attentively to opinions that differ from your own. You learn a breadth of knowledge on how that opinion has been formed and the experience that has come with it.
In some conversations I’ve got a sense of snobbery, hypocrisy and lack of understanding when it comes to some people in the 26 counties when they talk about ‘The North’ or ‘Northerners’. None so much summed up by the Wexford radio host Ivan Yates who recently expressed on his Dublin-based show: “We don’t actually like the Nordies”.
A man who complains about the lack of progress and reconciliation there but goes on a smug filled rant attacking them.
A strong sense of our identity
I grew up in the south Armagh countryside and had a great childhood. My home was a five-minute drive from the border boundary that was drawn up in 1921 separating, in our case, Armagh and Louth. We were and continue to be in both jurisdictions weekly.
My family was not a political one. They voted, of course, but were not of any strong opinions when it came to politics. However, we had a strong sense of identity.
We were Irish and we identified with every corner of the island as a whole. RTÉ was the main channel in our house, my sister and I both learned the tin whistle and Irish dancing, I played GAA for a while and attended the Gaeltacht in Donegal during my teenage years.
Growing up in the 90s it was safe to say that the troubles were coming to an end. I was lucky enough to be oblivious to what was going on around me. My parents were sure to shelter us from what was happening and what had happened in the past. A form of neutral thinking and treating everyone as equal no matter their creed was instilled in us.
However, I do have quite strong memories of playing outside and having British Army helicopters fly over our house, or soldiers walking through our fields and being stopped now and again in our car by them. For us this was completely normal, but on closer evaluation was not the most standard of childhoods.
How far we have come
Opinions like Ivan’s or comments by people of that mindset frustrate me. In some ways I can understand. Northern Ireland gets a lot of bad coverage. It is known for its political hiccups, and in some cases, rightly so. We are still in the middle of an evolving peace process.
If you really look at the North in the 1970s and 80s, and the attitudes that existed then compared to now, you can see how far it’s come. The place is unrecognisable. We agreed on a peace deal that seemed like it could never be done, and for all its ups and downs, it has mostly stuck. How amazing is that? What an example to the world.

I often ask people to consider if it had been six counties in Connaught, Munster or Leinster that had been partitioned, and nationalists there were discriminated against in terms of jobs, housing, voting rights and culture, while the new Republic moved on. How would have that developed? Would everything have been different?
It’s all well and good commenting from the sidelines when people in the Republic have had the liberty to move on and embrace their Irishness and culture. This is something we in the North are still trying to fully achieve as we take into consideration our Unionist friends and neighbours.
Both States were formed on violence
I’m not a supporter of unnecessary violence and the majority of the people I know would agree. Unfortunately, in some cases it has been unavoidable in the last 100 years. I think the 1916 centenary was a good way of reflecting on that.
It made us recall the fact that both States were formed on violence and whatever your opinion on it, it happened. On all sides. North and south of the border. Throughout the generations. And thankfully those day are over.
Reflecting is a great thing and in the spirit of reconciliation I’ll borrow a few words from the Queen on her famous visit to Dublin in 2011:
Attitudes towards the North
Belfast’s Niall Ó Donnghaile is a senator in the Seanad and doing a lot for Irish citizens in the North. He supports extending presidential voting rights to those in the North and hits the nail on the head when he says, the President represents Irish citizens no matter where they are located. He is constantly highlighting the grievances nationalists feel and is someone I admire.
Another prominent example is the controversy around RTÉ’s butchery of the map of Ireland on one of its shows. The map was showing health data from the 26 counties that obviously it didn’t have available on the North. It left the six counties out.
I think many people understand that context but I think what many people couldn’t get to grips with is why a national broadcaster would not at least include the outline of the whole of Ireland and fill in the data for the 26 counties it did have.
The map produced was seen as an insult to the Irish men and women of the North who have contributed so much to Ireland. I’m thinking of people like the ROI footballer James McClean from Derry, the poet Seamus Heaney, and former president Mary McAleese from Antrim. We exist too.
Remember partition is new
It’s important to remember that partition and in some cases, this disconnect between the North and the Republic  is relatively new: 96 years to be exact. The age of my grandmother. The proclamation of the Republic’s founders envisioned a 32-county republic.
Dáil Éireann was first created in 1919 and was established as an all-Ireland Dáil with elected representatives from all 32 counties of Ireland taking their seats.
Keeping these points in mind, I’ve learned there are many forms of being Irish and no hierarchy of what makes someone a true national of Ireland exists. Accents, interests and faiths might be different but we are all part of one nation and this is something that should be constantly yet respectfully embraced.
The Ireland we are working towards should be an inclusive one. A society of all backgrounds, nationalities and traditions.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tony-connelly-book-brexit-3752058-Dec2017/,"BREXIT IS NOWHERE near being completed – and we’re going to be hearing about it for at least the next two years.
So one of the people we’ll be turning to to keep us up to date is RTÉ’s Europe Editor, Tony Connelly.
He’s the man in Brussels who’s tasked with getting the latest news on all things Brexit – and it was arecent tweet of his that inadvertentlyled to the DUP throwing a spanner in the works of a deal on the Northern Irish border.
Connelly has just published a new book on Brexit, titled Brexit and Ireland – not just a look at how things are going so far, but also a guide for people who don’t realise exactly why the whole process is so complicated and what it means for Ireland.
We talk to him about finding out the leave vote had won, what he thinks of Theresa May, and how important leaks are to his work.
‘They’re out, honey’
Asked if he remembered the night when he found out that Brexit was go, Connelly recalls how quickly things changed.
“I had stayed up till about 1am and it looked like it was going to be a remain vote. And then I woke up and my wife, who is a Danish journalist – she had a very early deadline – she called upstairs: ‘They’re out, honey’. I was like ‘what?’ This was about 5.30 in the morning and I couldn’t believe it. Then it was full tilt, all the coverage, three or four days of intense reporting.”
Connelly was approached by the publisher, Penguin Ireland, in February to write the book, and though there was a very tight deadline – it was due in June – at the time he had no idea that Brexit would be so heavily on the agenda this autumn.
But was he wary about releasing a book so early?
“It was very fortuitous that it happened that way, that the book came out and that Ireland was the big issue,” says Connelly.
“That’s why it’s been very helpful for me reporting the subject, but the book has been a useful primer for people who aren’t Irish and who are trying to figure out what this is all about, why is this an issue.”
One thing the book makes clear is that Connelly has some great contacts – he peppers the book with lots of great anecdotes. There are the awkward meetings between Irish and British government members, an email the UK’s David Davis sent about meeting with ‘Kenny’ (which did not go down well on this side of the water), and curiosity Michel Barnier had about why he had to meet the DUP and Sinn Féin separately on EU talks.
Connelly gets his hands on information the rest of us wouldn’t get – and information gets leaked to him that helps to illuminate just what sort of decisions are being made about the Brexit process.
How important are leaks to his job? “As a journalist, leaks are always part of your job and part of any negotiation process – the trouble is in this situation it’s so incredibly sensitive that people on one side might assume that people on the other side are deliberately leaking stuff to undermine them and that creates bad blood,” he says.
But he knows that leaks are important, too – and they need to be handled well.
“If we get leaks we just have to make sure they’re accurate and we have to publish them.
“It’s not really our job to worry about the fallout, but it’s a difficult call to make because you have to be aware of the wider repercussions of a leak – but if you decide to suppress a paper that you’ve been given, then you’re crossing a line. As journalists you try to operate without fear.”
In writing the book, he had to “try and build a trusting relationship with people who were involved in the only Irish [Brexit] team”.
“That took time and in a sense most of the information I got was from Irish sources and you can see it would make sense for the Irish government to want to steer the narrative a bit,” he acknowledges. “I think they could see an interest in helping me – [the book] was maybe the first draft of the history of Brexit.”

Brexit concerns
The book functions as a way of exploring the many ways Brexit will affect Ireland. It wasn’t all new to Connelly – he’d had a sense before the result of what the concerns from the Irish side were thanks to the ‘perm rep’, which is the Irish permanent representation to the EU.
“It is basically the Irish civil service in Brussels – they’d be the first port of call for Irish journalists in Brussels to get the Irish government line,” he explains.
It was through his interaction with the perm rep, going back before the referendum, that he was able to get a picture of the risks for Ireland.
“Then once the referendum happened, I had a basic knowledge of what the problems were,” he says.
It was a lot of “pure plodding journalism” in putting the book together – picking up the phone and calling fishing organisations, the Irish Farmers’ Association, universities, and those in the aviation and mobile phone sectors for example.
He wanted to get a sense of what was really going on behind the scenes in Ireland, the contingency planning done by the Irish civil service, and a  better sense of what the risks were.
“The idea was to make it as human as possible,” he says. So the book contains the real-life stories of people who are most worried and likely to be affected by Brexit – like farmers.
“People were willing to talk because people were scared and not sure of what was going to happen,” he says. “Because of my contacts in Brussels I could also tell the story of what the Irish government was preparing from an EU level. I had to work a lot of contacts to get that behind-the-scenes stuff. It wasn’t just Irish officials but British officials, officials in the EU council and others, [that] was a tougher thing because it’s sensitive and they were not quite so willing to spell out graphically what was happening. But I was able to put together a portrait of all the meetings that happened and the general orientation of the response to it.”
Euroscepticism
The closer the referendum got, the deeper he had to go into the implications of a leave vote for Britain and Ireland.
“Even looking at implications for Britain, I thought they would be mad to do it from an economic view of the reasons they are pushing Brexit don’t seem to justify a huge economic and political and diplomatic upheaval,” says Connelly. “But then when I met people in Brussels who had been over to the UK for the weekend, and they’d say they met people who were going to vote leave, and that there was a weird mood over there.”
Despite the deal that David Cameron had struck with Europe the previous February – which included concessions on migrants and welfare benefits – Connelly says he knew that there was an “innate euroscepticism” in the British public, and that they wouldn’t necessarily accept this new deal to stay in Europe.
“I think the Irish system was alert to the danger of a leave vote,” says Connelly, but most Irish people ”just assumed it’d be close”. But there were signs.
“From early November there was the leak of a paper from the taskforce which I got and I think the Telegraph and the Financial Times got it. It was 8 November so that was a paper from the Michel Barnier taskforce where they said for the first time probably the best way to avoid a hard border would be no regulatory divergence, no divergence from the rules of the internal market and the Customs Union.
“The first time that concept took shape was in November and obviously the British were highly vexed over this,” recalls Connelly. “There was very strong criticism and complaints that this was an ambush by the Irish and would effectively mean Northern Ireland staying the customs market and the rest of the UK leaving.”
As for Ireland’s approach in it all, he thinks that when Taoiseach Enda Kenny was replaced by Varadkar, the tone changed. “His personal style is a lot different but the Irish strategy hadn’t really changed at all,” he said.
In particular, he mentions Enda Kenny’s“very tough” speechto the Institute of International and European Affairs in February of this year.
“It was very tough, it was very uncompromising,” says Connelly. “So the relationship between Enda and David Cameron was very, very warm one – it’s totally different between Kenny and Theresa May, it wasn’t quite as warm, she is a different person – it was a bit more pragmatic and professional and Leo Varadkar and Theresa May, that is a different chemistry altogether.”
As for British politics, Connelly says that coming into the autumn he thinks “people were looking in horror at what was going on in the Conservative party”.
The mood in Europe is that they want things sorted, and fast. “From the EU side they just want this to be sorted – it’s just sucking up so much political oxygen,” says Connelly. “They get fed up with what’s going on but I think at this stage they probably feel Theresa May is weak and stable. There’s obviously no appetite in the Conservative Party for a leadership move at this point.”
As for the months and years ahead, Connelly doesn’t see any acceleration in the Brexit process. But one thing is for sure – he’ll be the person to follow if we want to know what’s really going on behind the scenes.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney answers Adam Boulton's ""do you think this week's kerfuffle has been necessary?""pic.twitter.com/PkoJ0VgZ9y
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER Simon Coveney has responded to questions around whether he felt guilty over the country’s stance on Brexit, by saying that assurances were needed from the British government before negotiations could continue.
Coveney was speaking to Sky News presenter Adam Boulton after a deal was struck between the UK and the EU this morning.
The deal saw British Prime Minister Theresa May guarantee thatthere would be no hard borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland following Brexit.
The deal follows weeks of tense negotiations between all sides, with the UK wanting to move onto other issues, but Ireland and the EU insisting that this matter be addressed first.
Commenting on the deal, Sky News’ Adam Boulton asked Coveney if all the back and forth had been necessary, and if he felt at all guilty over what had happened.
He also referenced a deal that was almost reached around the issue on Monday, only for it to be scuppered when the UK withdrew its support after it became apparent that the Northern Irish DUP would not back it.

“Do you think that this week’s kerfuffle has been necessary? Do you feel slightly guilty that perhaps the Irish government over-briefed what had been achieved as a victory over the British for the European Union?” Boulton asked Coveney.
Coveney responded that that may have been the briefing on the British side, but that the Irish position had been clear.
“I mean we never looked for or claimed any victory over anybody,” Coveney said.
“We have been saying for many months now that we want to work with the British government to try to find a way forward that can reassure people in Ireland as well as in the UK that we can manage Brexit and we can limit damage in the way that’s now in this agreement,” he said.
Coveney said that had always been the Irish government’s position.
“Yes of course there’s been some friction because many people have been saying, ‘look we don’t need and don’t want to give those assurances right now, we’ll deal with these issues in phase two’.
“The Irish government’s response has always been that for us that’s like a jump into the dark.
He went on to list the various assurances that were needed: among them that there will be no return to a hard border on the island; that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected; and that the Common Travel Area between the two nations will be upheld.
He said those assurances had not been given.

THE GUARDIAN: Revealed: Tories' Brexit plan to deter EU migrants from Britain#tomorrowspaperstodaypic.twitter.com/yYTMrnLSpp
THE UK INTENDS to impose limits on low-skilled EU workers and restrict the arrival of Europeans’ family members after Brexit, according to aleaked document posted on the Guardian’s websitelate last night.
Various other UK newspapers also splashed the draft proposals across their front pages.
The 82-page document outlines Home Office proposals to manage migration after Britain leaves the European Union, putting an end to free movement from the bloc.
“Put plainly, this means that, to be considered valuable to the country as a whole, immigration should benefit not just the migrants themselves but also make existing residents better off,” the document says.
The government envisages a dual system for EU citizens arriving after Brexit, with those wishing to stay long-term needing to apply for a two-year residence permit.
Those deemed “highly-skilled”, however, would be allowed to apply for a permit for up to five years under the proposals.
In the lengthy document, marked “sensitive”, Britain’s interior ministry also says it may “tighten up” the definition of family members allowed to accompany EU workers in the UK.
Partners, children under 18 and adult dependant relatives are the suggested limit.

Changes would also be seen at Britain’s borders, with the document detailing government plans to require all EU citizens to travel on a passport rather than a national identity card as currently allowed.

This latter measure could be imposed as soon as Britain leaves the bloc — set for 29 March 2019 — but the Home Office promises “adequate notice” will be given.
A period of at least two years following Brexit is foreseen to fully implement the plans.
An ‘extreme’ hard Brexit
The proposals immediately attracted criticism and were dubbed “back-of-an-envelope plans” by Britain’s trade union umbrella group, the TUC.

“These plans would create an underground economy, encouraging bad bosses to exploit migrants and undercut decent employers offering good jobs,” said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan, from the opposition Labour party, said the document paved the way for “an extreme form of hard Brexit” which risked splitting up families.
“It reads like a blueprint on how to strangle London’s economy, which would be devastating not just for our city but for the whole country,” he said.

A spokesman for the Home Office told AFP the government would not comment on the leaked draft.
“We will be setting out our initial proposals for a new immigration system which takes back control of the UK’s borders later in the autumn,” the spokesman said.
The issue of citizens’ rights has been labelled a top priority by the EU during Brexit negotiations, which are being held in stages and hosted by Brussels.
In June. the British government outlined plans for EU citizens in the country before Brexit, which would see them apply for “settled status” granting indefinite leave to remain.

In a speech made at the John F Kennedy Summer School in New Ross, County Wexford, McDonald said Ireland desperately needs to change course.
Earlier this week,Britain was warned off using Ireland as a “test case”for how Brexit will work with the EU.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had stern words for the British, stating that the “onus to propose solutions which overcome the challenges created on the island of Ireland… remains with the United Kingdom”.

“They say Sinn Féin will not be in government, is not ‘fit for’ government. We say that will be the people’s decision,” she said.
She said the current confidence and supply arrangement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is not working, stating that it is “designed to serve the interests of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil”.
“It does not answer the needs of the people; it does not serve the public interest”.
She claimed that both parties have “created and perpetuated” a housing and homeless crisis, and criticised the solutions that have been put forward to date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-oleary-theresa-may-3573406-Aug2017/,"RYANAIR’S MICHAEL O’LEARY has criticised British Prime Minister Theresa May for “swanning around Japan eating cakes and drinking sake”.
Despite being on a visit to the Asian economic powerhouse, May has struggled to shrug off questions about her leadership of the Conservative party and O’Leary has said that he believes her days are numbered.
There have been reports that May was considering stepping down after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 but she denied this in a series of interviews in Japan, insisting that she isstaying for the “long term”.
“There is absolutely no basis for those reports whatsoever, I am in this for the long term, because this is a long-term challenge for the United Kingdom, ” May said.
May has been under increasing pressure from within her own party after her decision to hold a snap general election backfired when her party lost seats.

Opinion polls showed the Conservatives popularity sliding during the election campaign and May’s leadership was held up by many as a major cause of this.
It’s led to unrest within her own party and questions about whether she could front another campaign.
Asked about May’s leadershipon Sky Newsthis morning, O’Leary said her focus must be on negotiating Brexit and not “swanning around Japan eating cakes and drinking sake”.
The Ryanair CEO also doubted her claim that she will remain “for the long term”.
“She says lots of things, look at the way she handled the last general election, I’m not sure she’ll be allowed into the next election,” O’Leary said.
“Clearly David Davis is not delivering and you need the Prime Minister not swanning around Japan for three days but in Brussels, in Frankfurt, in Paris, doing the deal. Just parroting out cliches about doing a great deal for Britain, do it, get on with it.”
O’Leary previously cast doubt on the future of UK Ryanair flights after Brexit and again this morning argued that an aviation deal must be agreed between the UK and the EU.

Updated 2.40pm
THE UK GOVERNMENT has officially announced that it wants to leave the customs union in order to negotiate a new deal with the EU.
Britain’s Brexit negotiator David Davis and chancellor Philip Hammond have previously said the UK would leave the customs union, but this is the first official evidence of their intention.
However, there is still a lot of confusion around what would replace it. TheUK government’s documentoutlining this intention lists two possible options: a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” or a “new customs partnership” with the EU.
Speaking toBBC’s Radio 4 Todayprogramme earlier today, Brexit Minister David Davis said he wanted a “shortish” period after the Brexit negotiations conclude where the UK remains a part of the customs union, while looking to negotiate other trade deals elsewhere.
The customs union allows EU countries to trade more freely with one another, as it imposes the same regulations and duties levied on imported goods.
A change to this would impact greatly on businesses in the UK and the EU that do business with one another on a regular basis. In order to prepare businesses in Europe for the change, the UK is suggesting that an interim strategy be put in place.

The UK has emphasised in the announcement that the new, “ambitious” deal would allow the “freest and most frictionless possible trade in goods” between the UK and the EU, although failed to mention any specifics of what it wants.
“The UK is proposing two different ways that would best meet these goals,” the UK government’s statement said, listing its suggestions as:
However, Guy Verhofstadt, one of the EU’s Brexit negotiators, described aspects of the plan as “fantasy”.
He previously said: “If you want the advantages of a single market and customs union, you have to take the obligations.”

To be in & out of the Customs Union & ""invisible borders"" is a fantasy. First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement
Those obligations include trading with countries outside the EU in the same way as other member states do – which is the exact restriction the UK is trying to avoid.
The proposal for a transitional arrangement was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain’s big business lobby group.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said it would “take note” of the proposals, but warned:

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also repeated that talks on the future trading relationship could not begin until progress was made on other issues, including Britain’s exit bill.
‘No apologies’
Davis said the UK government was “making no apologies for being ambitious” in seeking to remain in the customs union for a temporary period while trying to negotiate deals with other world powers at the same time.

He said: “We’re being assiduous … we’re being good European citizens.
When pressed on the divorce bill that the UK would be required to pay to the EU, Davis said: “I’m not going to do the negotiation on air.
“You will find it difficult sometimes to read what we intend. That’s deliberate.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, told British Prime Minister Theresa May that “Brexit cannot be a success” at a dinner at Downing Street in April, adding that Britain will not even be in the customs union.
What does this mean for Ireland?
“It’s too early to say, but it’s pretty bad news for us that they won’t stay in the customs union,” Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Stephen Donnelly toldTheJournal.iepreviously.
He said that any kind of ‘streamlined’ border, as suggested by the UK in the above statement, could easily turn into a hard border.
Tomorrow, the UK government will set out its solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations at the end of the month.
A spokesperson for the Irish government toldTheJournal.iethat it welcomes “more clarity from the British government”.
It said: “The immediate focus for the coming rounds of negotiations remains on advancing the issues that have been identified by both the EU and the UK for Phase 1 of the negotiations, including citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues.
The president of the Irish Farmers’ Association Joe Healy said that the UK’s position effectively amounted to a hard Brexit.
“The first option would see the reinstatement of a customs border between the EU and UK. This is a very retrograde development for trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, after forty-five years of EEC/EU integration.”

In an interview withSky Newstoday about his thoughts on Brexit, he said that he agrees with the UK’s chancellorPhilip Hammondin aiming for the seamless border that has been between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for the last decade or so.
“I think that’s the way everybody on the island of Ireland wants it,” he said. “The difficulty is that as I’ve said time out of number, the experts in this area say that’s impossible.”
Ahern said that until this is resolved, there is no certainty on the issue – which is worrying from a business point of view, in relation to people who cross the border to work, and for tourism.
With regard to previous suggestions about a border on the Irish Sea, Ahern said:
He said he doesn’t think there will be an easy solution to the border issue, and that he doesn’t believe Irish unity is possible at this stage either.

With regard to Ireland following the UK out of the European Union, Ahern said: “That’s not going to happen, there is no support thankfully for us to get involved in an act of insanity.”
He added: “I think Isaid before to you, we’re mad but we’re not that mad and we’re not going to do that now or in the future.”
Ahern said that his concerns around a hard border post-Brexit include the movement of goods, and land border checks.
“We should have been trying to get a hard position negotiated,” said Ahern of the Irish border situation post-Brexit, saying that this position should have been then put to Europe.
“There is no realistic solution that has been put forward yet,” he said, adding he is worried the issue has not been examined to the extent it requires.
That one hasn’t is a “mistake on all sides” that needs to be rectified, he said. He also said he believes there needs to be a transition period for Brexit, which may stretch to four or five years.
Hammondsaid todaythat the UK will seek a Brexit transitional deal for up to three years after Brexit takes place in 2019.

DONALD TUSK HAS said that every European Union leader is dedicated to protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland and avoiding a hard border with the Republic.
The President of the European Council made the comments at a joint press conference with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today.
Tusk said he has spoken to all 27 EU leaders and each one told him their priorities regarding Brexit are “protecting the peace process and avoiding the hard border”.
“The EU stands by Ireland. This is a matter between the EU 27 and the UK, not Ireland and the UK.”

Tusk added that while the UK’s democratic decision to leave the EU must be respected, so too must the democratically backed Good Friday Agreement – which was signed 20 years ago next month.

He said destabilising the peace process in Northern Ireland “must be avoided at all costs” and that it is up to the UK to put forward a “specific and realistic plan” to avoid a hard border.
Tusk also said that, while it is the prerogative of the UK to define what is in its best interests post-Brexit, the EU must do the same.

‘Not a beast’
In a lighter moment, Tusk opened his speech by referencing the recent bad weather, saying: “Let me assure you that I haven’t come to chill the air but rather to warm it up. I may be from the east but I am not a beast.”
Varadkar echoed Tusk’s sentiments about the border, saying the pair had an “extensive discussion over lunch” about Brexit.
He thanked Tusk for his “solid and sensible leadership on this issue” and the support the EU has shown Ireland in relation to our “unique concerns” about Brexit.
Varadkar said the European Single Market must be protected throughout the negotiations, adding that he wants “the transition period to be smooth”.
He said the EU wants a “deep, comprehensive and ambitious” relationship with the UK post-Brexit, noting the two must still work together on certain issues such as fighting terrorism and international crime.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-tusk-statement-brexit-morning-3738403-Dec2017/,"DONALD TUSK, THE president of the European Council, is set to make a statement early tomorrow morning on Brexit talks.
His spokesperson made the announcement today, saying that he would make a statement at 7.50am CET time,RTÉ reports. That’s 6.50am Irish time.
There’s speculation that the early time for the statement is due to the fact he may have news on his talks with Theresa May over the Northern Irish border.
May and Tusk’s talks over a deal on the border were interrupted by the DUP earlier this week, who objected to the planned wording of the text related to the issue.
The DUP and the British government were in talks again today on the issue.
Speaking last night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that May had told him in a phone call that the new text would arrive by today, and that he was willing to consider it. That deal would be sent to Europe first, and then communicated to Ireland.

The Taoiseach, however, said that any new offer should not be substantially different to the one offered earlier this week.
The European Commission said this afternoon that there was still “no white smoke” on a Brexit deal and set a limit of Sunday for May to return to Brussels with an acceptable deal.
SDLP leader Column Eastwood sent a memo to Number 10 Downing Street today, warning the British Prime Minister not to isolate the majority of Northern Ireland in the Brexit negotiations.
Hesaid:
Time is now running out for a deal on Brexit divorce terms, which would allow the opening of talks on a future trade deal at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on December 14-15.
In a statement last night, Number 10 said “the Prime Minister said how she recognised the significance of this issue to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland and how this remained a joint priority for both governments, and the EU, to resolve”.

EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS would accept tightening up immigration rules to accommodate Britain, so the option of the UK staying in the bloc should remain open, former prime minister Tony Blair said today.
More than a decade of mass immigration from the EU under freedom of movement rules was a major factor in the referendum that saw Britons vote to leave the EU.
David Cameron as prime minister sought reform but got little out of his fellow EU leaders.
But Blair said the election of French President Emmanuel Macron had changed EU dynamics.

“Rational consideration of the options would sensibly include the option of negotiating for Britain to stay within a Europe itself prepared to reform and meet us half way,”he wrote in an articlefor his Institute for Global Change think-tank.
“The members of the eurozone will integrate economic decision-making.
“The European leaders, certainly from my discussions, are willing to consider changes to accommodate Britain, including around freedom of movement.
Blair won a Labour record of three straight general elections, having shifted the party from the left towards the centre ground. He was Britain’s prime minister from 1997 to 2007.

Viscount St Davids, also known as Lord Rhodri Philipps, was today handed the sentence for what the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) described as a “racially aggravated Facebook threat about Gina Miller”.
He was sentenced at Westminster Magistrates’ Court after his conviction on two charges of sending menacing messages.
The CPS asked the court to increase Lord St Davids’ sentence – known as an “uplift” – as his comment about Miller was racially aggravated.

Without the uplift his prison sentence would have been eight weeks.
The comment which gave rise to the second charge, a menacing message about a migrant called Arnold Sube, was not judged to be racially aggravated.
Kate Mulholland, London CPS reviewing lawyer, said: “Where offences are motivated by hostility towards victims based on their perceived race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity, the CPS has a duty to ask the court for a formal ‘uplift’ in sentencing.
Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gallagher, from the Met’s Organised Crime Command, added:“These posts were grossly offensive in nature and Phillips has now been brought to justice.
“The Metropolitan Police is committed to tackling all forms of hate crime and I would like to encourage anyone who has been a victim of such a crime to contact police and we will make every effort to hold offenders to account.”

Micheál Martin is talking about the RTE Primetime programme about the crisis in the health system relating to home carers.
He lists off a number of cases and says one person came into his clinic recently who is caring for three of his older siblings.
“I am fed up of going to service providers with emergency cases,” he said, adding that the service providers say they are getting no funding from government.
Martin asks the Taoiseach to watch the programme and come in with an action plan.
Varadkar says he did not watch it but said: “I will make a point of doing so over the weekend.”
I know very much the five families featured last night that there experience is not unique… everyone in this government is full of concern and full of respect for the work home carers do… any of us could be in that situation with a loved one… but for luck and the grace of god we could find ourselves in the same position.
Varadkar says it is important to acknowledge the changes his government have made including an increase in home care hours and an increase in funding.
He says the budget for disabilities has increased dramatically in the last number of years.
“I absolutely acknowledge that more needs to be done,” he said pointing out there need to be improvements in respite care, personalised budgets, and residential care.
Martin says the people featured in the programme do not want politicians to say they care – they want them to get angry.
He says there are no respite hours.
“It is a shocking indictment on us,” he tells the Taoiseach.
He says Varadkar needs to lead on proper investment. No family needs to go through the stress that programme showed last night.
Varadkar says the people do not want false rhetoric from Fianna Fáil either stating that they cut disability allowance during their time.
He says the people don’t want false words from any political party.
He admits respite hours available is far short than it should be.
The Ceann Comhairle gives a shout out to members of the Slovenian government who have joined them in the chamber. There’s applause.
Gerry Adams also wants to talk about carers and the RTE programme.
He says the human cost of the State’s failure was there “for all to see”.
He says one of the people in that programme is a constituent – he lost his service at age 13.
“Sam has taken to violent episodes, he recently assaulted his mother,” he says.
You as Taoiseach have the duty to ensure these people have the necessary supports, he says.
Adams it would cost €13m to give sufficient respite hours.
“I am asking you to make this a Republic of opportunity for these citizens,” says Adams.
The Taoiseach says there is no lack of understanding from the government about the importance of respite care.
He says he is happy to take a look at Adams’ proposals in terms of the healthcare budget.

Varadkar wants to check that Adams’ costings are correct. He says the budget provides an extra €75m for disability services for next year.

Theresa May has been taking a hammering on Brexit in the Commons, where she’s been taking Prime Minister’s Questions.
She insisted that current discussions were focusing on maintaining continued cross border trade while ensuring the constitutional integrity of the UK.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at one point referred to her ministers as ’a bunch of jellyfish masquerading as a cabinet’, as he lambasted Monday’s collapse of a UK-EU deal that would allow Brexit talks to move on to phase two (which will focus on trade).
Asked to sum up the plan, here’s what she said:
We will ensure no hard border, May tells PMQs. 'How' say Labour backbenchers. That will all be agreed properly in phase two of the talks, she says.pic.twitter.com/4y8MXd8nnq— TheJournal Politics (@TJ_Politics)December 6, 2017TheJournal Politics/ Twitter

(We’re still waiting for a question for May from the DUP)
Mick Wallace is now up and he is talking about Pesco and a video from the EU on what it means. It includes fighter jets and weapons.
“The EU was set up to prevent the frequent and bloody wars,” he says. Now it seems you have to sign up to their defence scheme to stay on the right side.
Wallace says a European army is being set up and we are being asked up to increase our defence system. This is when we can’t pay the wages of the members of the Irish army, he points out.
“Our neutrality is already on shaky footing,” he says and states this will be the final nail in the coffin.
Wallace says no media is covering this. But TheJournal.ie has for the last number of weeks:
A Europe that is worth building is a Europe that is worth defending,” says the Taoiseach.
He says the EU can no longer be reliant on the US for defence which he says it has done since 1945.
Varadkar says he will defend Ireland’s neutrality.
Ireland wants to join Pesco because it is an opt-in and opt-out basis where we will choose what schemes to join like cyber security and counter terrorism.
“We will not be shopping around military defence shows,” he says, adding that we won’t be buying fighter jets or carriers.
Wallace says this will impact our neutrality.
What the hell do we need the American army to protect us, says Wallace.
He says we won’t be attacked if we don’t bother anyone else “We are a small country,” he says.
The Taoiseach says he doesn’t accept that he is being hawkish.
“We want to be part of Pesco,” says Varadkar stating that it will share expertise.
For other countries it will be different, he points out.
“We should be able to defend ourselves and not rely on the US to do so,” he adds.
Varadkar also wants to inform House that a defence forces operation are taking part in a major stunt operation in Dublin today.
Another update from the House of Commons:
Jim Shannon of the DUP has been given the nod to ask a question. The chatter in the chamber died down as he asked the prime minister whether she could guarantee that there will be nothing in the Brexit deal that will create any form of barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
“Simple answer, yes,” May replied. She went on to talk about various cross-border arrangements that already exist between the two jurisdictions, like the shared energy market
Eamon Ryan is talking about Brexit now.
He wants to know if Taoiseach will use his veto if Ireland gets no guarantees.
The Taoiseach says it is still an evolving situation.
Varadkar says a lot of people are watching what he is saying now, so he must be careful.
Varadkar reminds the House it is a structured negotiation – on the one side the EU negotiating team and on the other side, the UK government.
He says we are in a strong position with the 27 member states behind us.
Quoting Lady Sylvia Hermon in the House of Commons yesterday, she said the DUP does not represent everyone in Northern Ireland. Varadkar says we must listen to all the voices in Northern Ireland, not just one party.
Ryan wants to know if Varadkar plans to pick up the phone to talk to Arlene Foster.
He also wants to know why she appears to have been left in the dark. He is also concerned about rebuilding trust again.
Varadkar says all parties should be receiving texts at the same time. He says he does not accept that one party speaks for everyone in NI. “I do not accept that.”
He says he will be talking to Theresa May in the coming days.
“It is the role of the UK to come back to us… there are different views in her own [May's] party and she also has to manage the confidence and supply agreement,” he adds.
He reiterates point that Ireland wants to move to phase two. If not possible “we can pick it up in the new year”, he adds.
“We stand by the text that was agreed Monday,” he concludes.
Tánaiste now up talking about news that US President Donald Trump is to recognise Jerusalem as capital of Israel.
Simon Coveney says he was in touch with the American embassy yesterday to make Ireland’s position known.
He says he was very clear in setting out that such a move would be “very unhelpful” in terms of progressing a peace process and would cause “unnecessary tensions” in the area.
Coveney says he made Ireland’s point of view “very clear”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fear-violence-customs-checkpoints-3732409-Dec2017/,"MORE THAN HALF of people say they fear a return to violence if customs checkpoints are brought back to the border with Northern Ireland after Brexit.
A deal to avoid a hard border was expected to be announced this afternoon. London was expected to concede that there would be no “regulatory divergence” relating to the single market and customs union between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
However,no deal was reached in the end.
The DUP said it wouldn’t accept Northern Ireland having a different deal to the rest of the UK.

Some 57% of people said they fear violence would return if customs checkpoints came back after Brexit.
The figures come from a poll forTheJournal.ieand RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live undertaken by Amárach Research.
It asked 1,000 Irish adults, “Do you fear a return to violence if customs checkpoints return to the border with Northern Ireland after Brexit?” The results were:
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was “surprised and disappointed” that the British Government did not conclude what was agreed earlier.
British Prime Minister Theresa May asked for more time after the DUP said they wouldn’t support the agreement.
The British Prime Minister said the negotiations would reconvene before the end of the week: “I am also confident we will reach an agreement”.

THE DAY BRITAIN leaves the EU may be the happiest of UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson’s life – but it’s already upsetting regional hoteliers who are losing out on sales from cross-border weddings.
Each year, around 500 couples from Northern Ireland cross into the Republic to get hitched.
However, according to the Irish Hotels Federation, many border-county hoteliers have reported a decline in bookings and inquiries from the region thanks to the weaker sterling and possibility of a hard border.
Weddings are big business and couples spend an average of €24,000 on their big day. Such events require a significant amount of lead-in time, with many couples booking a venue two years in advance, according to a 2017 survey by Weddingsonline.
With the Brexit deadline just 12 months away, the economic uncertainty surrounding the UK’s divorce from the EU has led to a slowdown in cross-border bookings for 2018 and 2019, the IHF says.
‘Bread and butter’
Michael Naughton, general manager of the Clanree Hotel in Donegal, says wedding trade from Northern Ireland has for many years been “the bread and butter” for hoteliers in the county.
“We’re probably one of the counties that will be affected most (by Brexit). 98% of our land border is with Northern Ireland, that’s the reality of the situation,” he says.

On average, the Clanree Hotel hosts up to 80 weddings a year. Based on the current rate of bookings, Naughton expects that figure to be closer to 65 or 70 by the end of 2018.
He believes the dramatically lower value of the pound has contributed to fewer Northern Irish couples booking their big day with the hotel.
A major attraction for those couples to tie the knot in the Republic was to get more bang for their buck than in the UK. However, the weaker exchange rate means that’s often no longer the case.
The Hillgrove Hotel in Monaghan normally hosts between 90 and 100 weddings each year, 40% of which typically come from the North because of its close proximity to the border.
General manager Martin Daly says there has been a slowdown in cross-border bookings which he anticipates is “going to get tougher” as Brexit looms closer.
“The whole problem is the uncertainty of it. I’m getting that across all hotels in the area,” he says.
A nightmare scenario for hoteliers like Daly would be the reintroduction of border checks, which he believes is also putting off engaged couples.
“You worry about how you’re going to get weddings across the border. Are they going to bring their guests across checkpoints?” he says.

Naughton also shudders at the thought of a return to checkpoints.
“We’ve seen that down through the years. People don’t like that and don’t want to come out for that reason. You’re putting your wedding guests under pressure. It’s a special day for a bride and groom.
Investment
Although there has been a definite decline in cross-border bookings for this year and next, the IHF’s newly elected president, Michael Lennon, says he’s confident the market will bounce back based on the level of investment within the industry.
“I think 90% of hoteliers in Ireland are planning to put more money into their properties,” he says.
Lennon says hoteliers are heeding the advice of tourism officials and seeking to attract more business from North America and Germany.
“Whether we’re getting American and German weddings, I don’t think so, but one thing I would say is that the amount of people that have emigrated over the last five or seven years, they’re coming back to get married in Ireland,” he says.
Michael LennonIHFIHF
Lennon, who owns and runs the Westport Woods Hotel in Mayo, says the industry should also wise up to changing consumer habits if it wants to hold to its share of the weddings trade.
“Drink sales haven’t grown as much as the accommodation and the food element of weddings. People are really putting more emphasis on the wines and the good food and they’re getting more localised in their menu planning,” he says.
Tony Walker, general manager at Cavan’s Slieve Russell Hotel, agrees that there’s a need for the sector as a whole to improve its wedding offering.
“We think (the decline in wedding bookings) is for other reasons. There’s more competition in the marketplace,” he says.
“The younger millennials, they seem to want to opt for more quirky venues or these exclusive venues that are springing up in every county.
Walker says hoteliers need to focus more on creating more attractive packages.
“A lot of us have the same offering but in a different venue at a different cost,” he says.
“It’s just trying to be that bit different. Maybe we need to get away from the traditional wedding fare.

LONDON LANDMARK BIG Ben will fall silent today for four years as a political revolt rumbles on over renovations that will rob England of a cherished symbol at a time of national uncertainty.
Westminster’s Elizabeth Tower, one of Britain’s most popular tourist attractions, is due for conservation work.
The famous clock’s bells are set to stop ringing at midday over safety concerns, silencing an emblem of continuity as the country grapples with Brexit negotiations.
The decision will protect builders working on the site, amid fears that prolonged exposure to the 118-decibel bongs from the 13.7-tonne Big Ben bell, which chimes out the hour, could damage hearing.
But the debate has swiftly moved into the political sphere.
The shutdown will coincide with the UK’s impending departure from the European Union – a period set to be politically turbulent and economically fraught.
The bongs are a venerated part of life in England, used at the start of radio and TV newscasts and the midnight countdown to New Year’s Day. The sound is also familiar to many people beyond the country, as it is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
Pro-Brexit members of parliament have criticised plans to shut down the chimes for what would be the longest duration in the clock’s 157-year history.
Victoria JonesVictoria Jones
Prime Minister Theresa May is among those who have raised concern.
“Of course we want to ensure people’s safety at work, but it can’t be right for Big Ben to be silent for four years,” she told reporters.
She hoped a House of Commons commission would “look into this urgently so that we can ensure that we can continue to hear Big Ben through those four years”.
The Commons has said that it “will consider the length of time that the bells will fall silent”.
“Of course, any discussion will focus on undertaking the work efficiently, protecting the health and safety of those involved, and seeking to ensure resumption of normal service as soon as is practicable,” it says
Under the plan, a lamp at the top of the neo-Gothic bell tower is also set to be turned off for the first time in more than 70 years, but it is not yet known when it will go dark, or how long it will be off for.

Brexit bongs?
Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, held emergency talks on Friday with Speaker John Bercow, who chairs the Commons panel that approved the measures.
The commission has agreed to meet next month to review whether the bongs can be heard on certain exceptional days.

Under current plans, the bells would still ring on important occasions such as Remembrance Sunday in November, which commemorates Britain’s war dead, and New Year’s Eve.
A trio of MPs from May’s Conservative Party are calling for the clock to be back in action on the eve of 29 March, 2019, when the UK is due to leave the European Union.
“It would be very fitting if Big Ben was to chime us out of the EU. We need to go out with a boom as we regain a sovereign parliament once again,” said MP Andrew Bridgen.
The 96-metre (315-foot) high tower is the most photographed building in Britain. The renovation is estimated to cost £29 million (€31.9 million).
But politicians have claimed that when they agreed to the work, they did not know the chimes would be silenced for four years.
A YouGov poll published on Saturday found that 44% of Britons believe Big Ben should be silenced during the renovations, except for special occasions, while 41% said it should operate as normal.
Some MPs have suggested the bells could ring outside of the conservation team’s working hours.
But the Commons said starting and stopping the clock took around half a day, and this would be neither practical nor “a good use of public money”.
Some commentators have dismissed the Big Ben debate as superficial or a distraction, given the far greater stakes of Brexit.
In March, May triggered the two-year countdown for leaving the EU – but critics say that as the clock ticks to the crucial deadline, her government is adrift and divided.
“(P)erhaps the cabinet room could be relocated to within six feet (two metres) of the bell,” suggested The Guardian’s Marina Hyde.
This way, she said, ministers could be provided “with a frequent reminder of the need to acquire a clue, like, months ago”.

Speaking ahead of the visit, Varadkar said: “I had the pleasure of welcoming Prime Minister Trudeau to Ireland early last month when we discussed a number of issues concerning Irish and Canadian relations.
Varadkar said, in the context of Brexit, it is “more important than ever” that the Irish government “seeks to expand our markets overseas and strengthen our relationships with major trading partners”.
As well as meeting political and business leaders, the Taoiseach will meet members of the Irish community in both cities and representatives of emigrant support services.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mps-brexit-davis-3695143-Nov2017/,"THE UK’S BREXIT Secretary has told MPs that they will be given a take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final Brexit deal before it leaves the EU.
David Davis said that the terms the UK agrees with the EU, such as the new citizen rights, trade deals and financial arrangements must become law, giving MPs a chance to vote on it.
While it will not mean that Brexit could be stopped, it will mean that Britain could leave the EU without a deal.
Davis said: “It is clear that we need to take further steps to provide clarity and certainty both in the negotiations and at home regarding the implementation of any agreement into United Kingdom law.
Labour, and some Conservatives, were critical of this stance and said that it would give parliament no chance to have its say if the UK’s negotiators are unable to reach any deal with the EU at all.
Labour’s Keir Starmer accused the UK government of a “last-minute climb down”, after it had repeatedly called for voting on a Brexit deal in the House of Commons.

The Conservatives made the concession after facing into a defeat in the House on an amendment calling for a vote on the final deal.
“With less than 24 hours before they had to defend their flawed Bill to Parliament, they have finally backed down,” Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Starmer said.
Conservative Dominic Grieve said that negotiations with the EU should be extended if a deal can’t be found and that parliamentarians should have a say before the date that the UK is due to leave the EU in 2018.
Last week, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he is making contingency plans for the “possible” failure of Brexit talks.
“It’s not my (preferred) option,” he told French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD). “But it’s a possibility. Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike. We too are preparing for it technically.”
On Friday, Barnier gave Britain a two-week ultimatum to make concessions on a divorce agreement if it wants to unlock the next phase of talks in December.

IRELAND NEEDS TO re-examine its neutral status as Britain moves closer to leaving the European Union (EU), Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes has said.
Hayes made the comments following European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s annual state of the union address at the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.
In his speech, Juncker pushed for the EU to implement plans for a common defence strategy — what critics call an “EU army”.
He proposed a European intelligence unit to ensure the automatic sharing of data on suspected jihadists, and for a planned European prosecutor’s office to be able to pursue those involved in cross-border terrorist transactions.
Juncker also proposed the creation of a European cybersecurity agency to defend against a growing threat he warns is more dangerous to democratic and economic stability than conventional war.

Cybersecurity and terrorism
Speaking toEuroParlRadioafter the address, Hayes said Ireland’s neutrality needs to be looked at.
“They’re the new threats and I think the discussion on the future of Europe at home and here allows us an opportunity to look again at our defence commitments, to look again at our security and to look at how we can … be a more effective and a more integrated tool of policy within the European Union.
“We helped build this thing called Europe. We’re one of the oldest, most grown up, wealthiest members of this club. We’ve got to defend it too in my view and I think we need to look at this policy, especially now that Britain are leaving the European Union,” Hayes stated.
Juncker dealt with Brexit in fewer than 100 words in his speech, saying Britain and the EU would “regret” the decision but that the EU must not be held back.
Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy criticised Juncker’s speech, saying: “He recommends that EU goes further down the road of neoliberal policies and away from a more social and democratic Europe. This will see the creation of an EU army, more dangerous trade deals, increased liberalisation of key utilities and less democratic oversight.
“It is a charter for an EU driven by the interests of large multinational corporations and dominated by the larger states. This will inevitably result in further alienation from the EU by member states and citizens and further political instability,” Carthy said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-irish-government-brexit-3521833-Jul2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has come under harsh criticism from the DUP after he announced that he didn’t support an economic border between the North and the Republic.
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said that Varadkar’s position is “total nonsense”, accusing Varadkar of sparking a series of “inconsistent and incoherent statements”, and “sending mixed messages” on Brexit.
He also took aim at Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who clarified that his calls for a special status for Northern Ireland were not the same as Sinn Féin’s policy, and said that the Irish government sounded like Sinn Féin in their support of “Irish language supremacy” (in reference to the ongoing debate around an Irish Language Act).
It’s the second time that Dodds has criticised the Irish government in two days.
On Friday, Dodds accused Varadkar of changing his position by saying there should be no economic border between the two regions. Varadkar said that he wouldn’t help the UK government come up with border options as he believedthere shouldn’t be one.
“We’re not going to be doing that work for them because we don’t think there should be an economic border at all,” he said.

DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr said that Varadkar was “cutting off his nose to spite his face”.
Today, Dodds was a little more critical, calling Varadkar’s position “total nonsense”.
“There already is an economic border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
The statement ends with a call for cooperation ahead of Brexit talks:
“It’s simply taking things backwards at a time when common sense cooperation between our two countries and between the Republic and Northern Ireland is what’s needed.”
Varadkar has said in one of his first interviews as Taoiseach that he would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime, and has said he doesn’t want to see a border between the North’s six counties and the Republic.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-government-3789320-Jan2018/,"SINN FÉIN DEPUTY leader Mary Lou McDonald has said that her party is frustrated by a lack of progress around forming a new devolved government in Northern Ireland.
It’s now one year since the power sharing executive in Northern Ireland collapsed after Sinn Féin walked out on government, citing a number of key issues with their partners the DUP.
In that time, there have been a round of elections in Northern Ireland (and the UK), Northern Ireland deputy first minister Martin McGuinness has died, and there have been many rounds of negotiations trying to restore power, but none have been successful.
One year later and it would appear both sides are no closer to reaching an agreement.
Into the mix,a new Northern Ireland secretary was announced yesterdayas part of Theresa May’s cabinet reshuffle after former secretary James Brokenshire stepped down citing health reasons.
Speaking today on RTÉ Six One News, Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was “disappointed” and “frustrated” that no deal had yet been reached.
“I can assure you nobody is more disappointed or indeed frustrated with the fact that we haven’t as of yet struck a deal – that we don’t have the institutions back live – than all of us in Sinn Féin,” she said.
However, McDonald placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of the DUP, citing a number of legacy issues – including theIrish Language Act, and last year’s“cash for ash”scandal – that needed to be overcome before the two sides could return to power.

DUP
As well as the issues above, the two parties are divided on Brexit.
The DUP staunchly supports Northern Ireland leaving the European Union with the rest of Britain.
Sinn Fein backs remaining in the bloc and has called for a referendum on Irish reunification, warning that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU could have a devastating economic impact on Northern Ireland.
Topping it all of, the DUP has a lot of sway in Westminster as the ruling Conservative Party needs the votes of its MPs in order to prop up their government following a disastrous election result last year.
Into this political deadlock steps new Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley, who said yesterday on being appointed that forming a new Executive was her “top priority”.
“It is now a year since Northern Ireland has had an effective, functioning power-sharing administration, and forming a Northern Ireland Executive, to deliver for the benefit of all, is my top priority,” she said.
DUP leader Arlene Foster said that she looked forward to working with Bradley in the months to come.

Bradley will have her work cut out trying to find a way past the year-long impasse.
Power-sharing negotiations were expected to resume this month, but the resignation of Brokenshire due to ill-health could result in further delays.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-bill-settled-billion-3721742-Nov2017/,"
BRITISH AND EUROPEAN negotiators have reached a deal for Britain to pay tens of billions of euros to leave the European Union, according to media reports.
London and Brussels have agreed on Britain’s financial obligations but had not settled on an exact amount for the so-called divorce bill, bothThe Telegraphand the Financial Times reported, citing diplomatic sources.
Both sides have now accepted the British will pay between €45 and 55 billion, with the final figure depending “on how each side calculates the output from an agreed methodology”, the Telegraph said.
Meanwhile the FT reported Britain would cover EU liabilities worth as much as €100 billion, but when structured as net payments over many decades that could drop to less than half that amount.
The newspapers said negotiators, headed on the British side by leading Brexit official Olly Robbins, reached the understanding at meetings in Brussels last week.

An agreement would be a major breakthrough as Britain prepares for an EU summit in December where it is hoping to get the go-ahead to start the next phase of talks on future trade ties with the EU.
It would leave two major areas on which the two sides still do not agree – expatriate citizens’ rights after Brexit and the future of the Irish border.
“The deal on the money is there,” a senior source involved in the negotiations told the Telegraph.

“It’s now the ECJ (European Court of Justice) question and Northern Ireland that are the outstanding issues ahead of the Council,” the source said.
One key area of contention is whether the 3.2 million EU citizens living in Britain will continue to be allowed to appeal to ECJ jurisdiction or if their rights will be governed by British courts, as London insists.
So far both sides have avoided publicly declaring a clear-cut number for what Britain owes the rest of the EU.

Prime Minister Theresa May had offered to cover Britain’s contributions to its budget in 2019 and 2020 – a total of around 20 billion euros.
That pledge was reportedly doubled to €40 billion at a ministerial meeting in London last week.
A third EU source with knowledge of the talks said the text of the financial agreement would allow a “low figure” to be generated for the British public but would also give the EU the certainty it is looking for.
Asked about the reports, a spokesman for Britain’s Department for Exiting the European Union said “intensive talks” are taking place in Brussels this week, and did not address the divorce bill directly.
A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-poultry-chemicals-usa-3752566-Dec2017/,"CONSUMERS COULD BE eating “dirty” chlorinated turkeys at Christmas if the UK agrees on a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, according to a new briefing paper by leading food policy experts.
The team found US poultry – washed in up to four chemical disinfectants – does not meet EU safety standards.
The academics from the University of Sussex also found the chemicals are used in the US to wash fruit, vegetables and fish.
They warn that British shoppers would be safer if the UK kept European Union standards and said future controls should be “stricter, not weaker”.
Current UK and EU standards were compared with those in the US, and professors Erik Millstone and Tim Lang concluded that the use of chemical disinfectants by the US food industry posed risks to consumers and workers in the industry.
“The UK should continue to insist on improving hygiene standards in poultry farms, slaughterhouses and meat-cutting plants and not allow standards to decline, nor try relying on chemical disinfectants to reduce the harm that filthy meat can cause,” Millstone said.
The question of whether the UK would import chlorine-washed meat after Brexit was raised when the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross warned that a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal would require that the UK abandoned EU standards.

US chemicals
The turkeys and chickens on sale in the UK this Christmas cannot lawfully be washed with four chemicals that the US poultry trade calls “pathogen reduction treatment” (PRTs).
The briefing paper identifies the set of scientific and policy documents, endorsed by the US Food and Drug Administration, which explain why the country’s poultry industry uses these chemicals, and why they are not permitted in the UK or EU.
The animal carcasses are washed with disinfectants in the US because when they arrive at abattoirs and meat-cutting plants they are far more contaminated with infectious filth, including excrement, than in the UK’s current food supply chain, according to the authors.
The UK and EU approach insists that hygiene standards in the supply chain are sufficiently high that they don’t need to be chemically disinfected.
Professor Tim Lang said: “We cannot support any weakening of UK food hygiene standards, this is not what UK consumers have voted for or been consulted on.
“We were shocked when we found that PRTs are allowed to wash fish, fruit and vegetables, as well as poultry.”
Recommendations
The academics cite a World Health Organisation and UN Food and Agricultural Organisation report saying disinfectants “must not be used to mask poor hygienic practices”.
The experts make a series of recommendations, including that the UK commits to at least maintaining safety and quality standards,
It recommends that public health, environment, animal welfare and consumer organisations combine to prevent the sale of poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables washed with chemical disinfectants in the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-advice-businesses-3534385-Aug2017/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT is expected to release key Brexit policy papers in the next few weeks, according toThe Guardian.
The paper says that the documents are expected to cover topics such as the customs union and the Northern Irish border.
The news comes as a new survey says that 77% of Irish exporters report ongoing uncertainty over Brexit is making it difficult to plan for the future, while just 3% of them have a plan in place for Britain’s exit from the EU.
That’s according to the latestInterTradeIrelandBusiness Monitor, which says that despite this, there is stability in the all-island economy, with little indication of direct negative impacts from prevailing uncertainty.
According to its survey, 56% of firms are reporting they are ‘stable’ and 33% reported growth.
Looking for guidance
But a year on from the Brexit vote, the Business Monitor suggests firms may now start to seek guidance on Brexit matters.
More than a third of businesses with cross-border sales (36%) say they would welcome additional one-to-one support and almost a quarter of exporters (24%) want additional information on tariffs.
While the stability experienced in the last quarter is described as “encouraging”, InterTradeIreland is advising businesses to start planning for Brexit to ensure they remain resilient in the face of future change.
Aidan Gough, Strategy and Policy Director at InterTradeIreland said: “The stability we see in this quarter’s Business Monitor survey is quite remarkable given the level of uncertainty in the marketplace. It’s interesting to see that so far, there is little indication of direct negative impacts from uncertainty linked to Brexit. That being said, it’s essential Irish SMEs start to prepare and plan for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.”
He said that InterTradeIreland is encouraging all businesses to plan, act and engage for every potential outcome, adding that it offers a Brexit advisory service.

Gough said there is a “window of opportunity” for business, which “must now be grasped to prepare for the challenges and indeed the opportunities that will be presented by any new cross-border trade arrangements which may emerge over the coming years”.
The report also found:
Government advice
Meanwhile, Ibec, which represents Irish business, has published a set of briefs outlining the business priorities for each ministerial portfolio.
Danny McCoy, CEO of Ibec, said that the publication is being launched “so as to ensure our reputation as a competitive and world-class business destination is maintained”.
“The country is at the very bottom of the EU league table for infrastructure spend, yet we have the fastest growing population,” he said. “There has never been a more cost effective time for Government to borrow money, and despite the many uncertainties we face, there is no reason not to be confident about the Irish economy’s potential for growth and continued success.”
The document,which can be found here, says that the Taoiseach should secure commitments in any EU-UK deal “that recognises the unique economic and political challenges that Brexit presents to Ireland”.
It says Leo Varadkar should also ensure that comprehensive transitional arrangements are put in place to “avoid a precarious ‘cliff edge’ scenario” and allow business time to adapt to a trading relationship.
It also recommends that the Taoiseach “ensure a level playing field in relation to Ireland’s business tax offering for indigenous business”.
The document also recommends that the Agriculture Minister support climate change policies that recognise the “sustainable grass-based food production system in Ireland” and the Minister for Communications stabilises the funding of public service broadcasting, such as adopting effective measures to combat television licence fee evasion.
The Minister for Education is encouraged to implement a reform of the Junior and Leaving Certificate curriculums so that the emphasis is moved away from rote learning “towards a more holistic education experience”.
Meanwhile, The Minister for Employment and Social Protection is advised to reform the private pension system.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-whatsapp-3637018-Oct2017/,"UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson has called on his “so-called friends and allies” to stop telling newspapers that he’s planning to move against Prime Minister Theresa May.
In a Whatsapp message to a group of Conservative MPs, Johnson said that he didn’t know who kept leaking this information to the press and asked them to stop doing so on his behalf.
In thismorning’s Daily Telegraph, it was reported that the former London Mayor would resist any attempt by May to demote him in a cabinet reshuffle.
A source, claiming to be a supporter of Johnson, said that moving him would go down “like a bucket of cold sick” with those who’d voted for Brexit. Another ally said that there was a “stench of death” from Downing Street.
In a Whatapp message, seenby the Guido Fawkes website, Johnson said that he didn’t want any more information like this getting to the papers.
He is reported to have said: “Folks I have just seen yet more stuff in the Telegraph and the Sun purporting to come from so-called friends and allies of mine.

“I heartily disagree with the sense, tone and spirit of what they are quoted as saying. Whoever they are they do not speak for me.”
While Johnson has been publicly supportive of May, a 4,000 word Brexit manifesto he had published in the Telegraph a few weeks ago led to it being reported that he was planning to launch his own leadership bid against her.
During her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference last week, the Prime Minister was stopped mid-way when a prankster handed her a P45 claiming he had been sent by Boris Johnson.
No sooner had she resumed, than May was overtaken by a prolonged coughing fit, which continued on and off throughout the rest of the speech.

To make matters worse, the slogan on the wall behind her – “building a country that works for everyone” – began to collapse, with two letters falling off.
Today, May said that the “ball was in EU’s court” as the next round of Brexit negotiations got underway.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-brexit-has-dangers-and-possibilities-for-ireland-3676340-Nov2017/,"IRELAND IS AN export country. We look outwards. Relentlessly positive in our mindset (and unrelentingly pessimistic in our words) we have a tendency to assume it’ll all work out, that ‘it’ll be grand’.
Sometimes though, a force comes that is just a little too big to get our heads around, a little too all-encompassing to simply wave away with a shrug. The solution used to be when these forces came along was to hit the bar and wait for it to pass by; nowadays it requires a bucket of coffee and countless brainstorming sessions in case it rolls over us.
Brexit is such a force.
The relationship won’t be the same
Every Irish exporter is aware of the dangers, and possibilities, of Brexit, and have probably elucidated these views at the end of a board meeting or over the dinner table. They have read the business papers, mentally taking note of those aspects of Brexit that will affect them, and have kept a keen eye on the exchange rates as they’ve fluctuated since June 2016.
Most Irish exporters, however, haven’t written anything down. There is no plan, just a feeling that we may have to be more flexible down the road. Maybe there’s vague notions that the Chinese market is opening up so ‘we must look into it’ or perhaps there’s a feeling Brexit won’t really happen. It will.
Maybe not in the ‘Hard Brexit’ that was the prevailing political wind until recently, but the UK is leaving the European Union and the relationship won’t be the same for the foreseeable future. It is now incumbent for Irish businesses, and exporters in particular, to develop their international business plans to mitigate against the risks coming down the road.
80% of Irish exports are either sold directly in the UK or transit through the region. Do Irish organisations have alternative market strategies in place? Does their export wing have plans for any transit barriers that may (suddenly) come into place?
Let’s take the tactical question first – are businesses prepared for a new set of administrative practices associated with transiting goods through Britain if it’s not part of the Customs Union?
Preparing staff or procuring new staff hires
In practical terms, this may mean businesses have to prepare staff or procure new staff hires to make this trade efficient. Imagine if tomorrow all exports needed to transit through Norway instead of Britain, what would be the challenges? What would be the costs associated?
Advertisement
Many Irish businesses are waiting for answers from the government rather than proactively seeking out alternatives themselves. Almost two-thirds of Irish export companies have said they are unprepared for Brexit, and have not put any counter measures in place over the last six months, according to a survey of 600 Irish businesses by Enterprise Ireland.
This is a dangerous strategy. We’ve seen the lack of clarity from all sides of the negotiation table, partly as a negotiation tactic in itself, and it is likely that the rules will come as one big release when negotiations are finalised. In other words, at the last minute.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has stated that companies using Britain as a transit location to other markets could be badly affected by Brexit, but has been unable to accurately track what goods, and it what volume, actually passes through Britain from Ireland. So, when it comes to negotiations on what goods are subject to custom tariffs, they may end up negotiating blind.
This makes it even more vital for Irish businesses to make their own plans. Of course, as the famous Navy Seal quote goes ‘No plan survives contact with the enemy’ but without a plan, we are doomed to fail.
Penetrating new markets
Now let’s return to the first question: If Brexit makes the UK less profitable to trade with, or at the worst-case scenario, becomes uneconomical to trade with, do Irish businesses have a plan to penetrate new markets to cover the gap?
Let’s be clear here, no perfect plan exists. There are too many variables within each sector, too many knowns, and even more unknown unknowns, to accurately sit down today and predict what we’ll need down the road.
And, ironically, when it comes to planning for this, it may be best to ignore the force that is Brexit for now. Instead, now is the time to formulate those international development plans and begin putting in place a plan of action.
The organisations who turn Brexit to their advantage will not be the ones who happen to be picked up by the tide and get lucky (although that will inevitably happen too) but the organisations that take a multi-pronged approach to the problem, tackling it from all sides.
They will not be able to share their plans with the rest of the class because, well, everyone is in a different class. This is a huge problem that will be tackled through a million solutions, tens of thousands of face-to-face negotiations across the world, through public and private sector policies and actions, and through lots and lots of planning.

BARCLAYS BANK HAS signed a lease to let more than half of a new office block under development on Molesworth Street that’s capable of housing up to 430 staff.
The 20-year agreement will see the financial firm take on 3,437 sq m of office space at investment property firm Green REIT’s One Molesworth Street development in Dublin 2.
This will see Barclays occupy two and a half floors of the office building, with the option to take up a further half floor of the development upon the building’s completion.
The two and a half floors at One Molesworth Street let by Barclays are capable of holding up to 430 staff – Barclays currently employs 120 staff in Dublin.
The financial firm will pay €2.35 million in rent annually for the office space, with each car parking space it avails of costing €4,000 per annum.
There are a further two full floors still to be let by Green REIT, with a retail space at ground level also available.
The property firm said it is expected the rest of the building will be ready for fit-out before the end of the year.

Earlier this year,Barclays tried to downplay reportsthat it plans to open a post-Brexit EU headquarters in Dublin.
It was suggested at the start of this year that the bank planned to establish a European base in the Irish capital if Brexit negotiations failed to secure continuing passporting rights for British finance firms.

A spokesman for Barclays toldForaat the time that the company’s headquarters would remain in London.
He confirmed however that the decision to look at Dublin was done to find a solution to a potential “passporting conundrum”.
They’re coming
Since the UK’s referendum to leave the EU last year, there has been a lot of speculation about financial firms moving their operations away from London’s financial hub, with Ireland often cited as a potential area for relocation.
Last month, the chairman and CEO of US investment and banking giant JP Morgan confirmed that the company plans toexpand its Irish workforce.
This announcement followed the news that the US financial giantpurchased an office block on Sir John Rogerson’s Quayin the heart of Dublin’s docklands that could house an extra 500 staff.
JP Morgan has also revealed plans to expand in other European cities, including Frankfurt.
Within the last few weeks, banking giant Bank of America has also confirmed plans to set up its newEU hub in Dublinpost-Brexit.
The company said that it would move some roles from London to Dublin, but it did not specify how many people it may move to, or hire in, the Irish capital.

EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk has said that if the UK’s Brexit offer is unacceptable to Ireland, it will be unacceptable to Europe.
The EU chief visited Dublin today for talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of the EU summit, which he will chair, with the other 27 member States.
During a press conference this afternoon, Tusk said Ireland will be consulted on any offer put forward by the UK to deal with phase one issues – which include citizen’s rights, the Brexit bill and the border with Northern Ireland.
He said such news will be “hard” for some British politicians to understand, but he said Ireland’s interests are Europe’s interests.
“If the UK offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it will also be unacceptable to Europe,” said Tusk.
Varadkar thanked Tusk for his unwavering support and solidarity with Ireland.
Before the talks can progress to phase two trade talks the UK must make sufficient progress on the issues, including how it aims to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland.
While Varadkar said there has been progress made on EU citizen rights and the financial settlement, questions still hang over the border issue.
“The best and most obvious solution” would be for the UK to remain in the Customs Union and the Single Market said the Taoiseach, but he acknowledged that this had been ruled out by Theresa May’s government.
Time is running out
He said the onus was now on them to offer “credible” and “workable” solutions to prevent a hard border.
“The period between now and the European Council meeting in two weeks time will be crucial. Indeed the next few days will be crucial. So we don’t have long,” said Varadkar.
He added that with the right engagement, and being an optimist by nature, a solution is achievable.
While he said he is willing to work intensively on the issue over the next few days, the Taoiseach is also willing to “stand firm” with Ireland’s European partners if the UK offer “falls short” on any of the three phase one issues.

Earlier today, the Tánasite and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said he wants to avoid the Brexit debate becoming an “orange versus green” issue in Northern Ireland.
Former DUP leader Peter Robinson has accused the Irish Government of acting provocatively in the negotiations and said the South should “wind its neck in”.
Yesterday, British media reported that the DUP threatened to withdraw from the confidence and supply arrangement that is propping up the British Government over the Irish border issue.
Just one day into the job as Tánaiste, Coveney confirmed that he has talked to the DUP about the issues.

However, he said the Brexit border talks are not a “green and orange” issue and have nothing to do with any clandestine attempt by the Republic to take back Northern Ireland.
“I have tried and I continue to try to avoid this debate becoming a green versus orange issue in Northern Ireland – it is very hard to prevent that given the language we have heard, but our approach here is to listen to everybody.
“No one party has a monopoly in Northern Ireland in the context of what is acceptable and what is not,” said Coveney.
The minister said the Irish government will work with all parties to find a practical way forward, adding that he wanted to give assurances to the unionist communities in the North.
Reassuring the unionists
“I can assure unionists that this is not some sort of tactic by the Irish government to progress  some sort of constitutional change on the island of Ireland – quite the opposite.
“In fact what we want is to protect the status quo in terms of improving relations with unionists and nationalist communities both in Northern Ireland and on border communities, north and south, that is what we are interested in and nothing else,” said Coveney, adding:
The Tánaiste said a Brexit deal on the Irish border question is “doable” but he said before that is possible there must be more movement and flexibility than has been seen to date.
However he acknowledged that he believes “we can get to where we need to be in the next few days”.

The Irish government’s position on Brexit is “stern and stubborn” but is fair, said Coveney, but he said he can not allow Brexit to drive communities apart.
Coveney said the question of whether Ireland will use its veto to prevent the talks progressing to the next phase misses the point – stating that all the EU27 are behind Ireland’s position.
“There is not an anti-British bone in my body – Britain is a great country and we want a good deal. A good deal for Britain is a good deal for us, but Ireland will not be steamrolled in this issue,” he said.
DU leader Arlene FosterDominic LipinskiDominic Lipinski
On the border issue, Coveney said it is part of phase one and the UK has put nothing on the table in terms of a customs union.
“I don’t mind what we call this, we can call  it a customs union partnership, we can call it a grand trade partnership, whatever we want to call it – but the bottom line is if goods are going to have to move from one customs union to another then there will have to be customs checks somewhere, whether it is in a business premises or a borer, and we are trying to avoid that. I think we can avoid that in the context of the negotiations in phase two, I hope – but that is for a future date,” said Coveney.
Next election?
In terms of other issues that dominated the headlines this week, and whether the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael has been damaged, Coveney appears to believe it is stable.
Coveney said the confidence and supply arrangement is “robust” and he doesn’t agree that an election in the spring is inevitable.
The new Tánaiste went so far as to claim the agreement with Fianna Fáil can last until the next budget.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has accused Fianna Fáil of acting as though a hard border with Northern Ireland is inevitable, amid testy exchanges in the Dáil.
Varadkar was facing criticism from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin about theleaking of a Revenue report that details the effectsof Brexit on trade with the UK.
The report was drafted before the Brexit referendum and finds that an open customs border would be impossible from a customs perspective, and would lead to a vast increase in workloads at ports and airports.
The report remains unpublished butwas leaked to RTÉlate last week.
In Leaders’ Questions today, Martin accused Varadkar’s government of suppressing the document.
“You told Deputy Donnelly and other representatives that you would share this kind of information with them and you did not do it, ” Martin said, referring to Fianna Fáil TD Stephen Donnelly.

Martin said that the work being carried out by Revenue was “commendable” and demonstrated the “enormous physical impact” that Brexit could cause.
“Once negotiations are completed, the UK will become a third country for customs purposes and associated formalities will become unavoidable. And while this will affect all member states, the effect will be more profound in Ireland,” Martin said.

Solution
Responding to Martin, Varadkar denied that the report had been suppressed by government.
He noted that it was from 2015 and thus did not take into account some significant recent factors, such as the Brexit vote itself and the UK’s statement that it was against a physical border with the Republic of Ireland.
He told Martin:

“We’ve been very resistant to any defeatism from anyone, including the opposition to suggest that this hard border is inevitable and we should start preparing for it.
Border guards and dogs
Varadkar has previously stated Ireland will not be helping the UK devise a border that “we don’t want”, and today he attacked Fianna Fáil for pushing for work on border solutions.
“I’ve never been a one to be talking about invisible borders, frictionless borders and telepathic borders or some IT-based solution to this. I’ve alway said that the only solution to this is a political one,” Varadkar told Martin.
He added:
Martin then attempted to speak again but was prevented from doing so by Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl, who called on Gerry Adams.
“Well, may I say Ceann Comhairle, 100 years on, it’s good to hear these two parties talking about the border, ” the Sinn Féin leader said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-3505075-Jul2017/,"IF THE UK leaves the EU without a deal it could have “widespread, damaging and pervasive” on the country, according to a new report.
The report –Cost of no Deal– from academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe warned against the dangers of a “chaotic Brexit”.
UK prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly stated that no deal on Brexit is better than a bad deal.
The UK triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March, beginning a two-year process to extricate itself from the EU.
The second round of negotiations between EU and UK officials kicked off on Monday and are due to end today.
If no deal is struck, it could have a wide-ranging negative effect on various aspects of UK life including energy, trade and agriculture.

Scenarios
The report looks at four different scenarios where no deal is reached, and describes the pitfalls of each.
“Our findings show a chaotic Brexit would, at least in the short-term, spawn a political mess, a legal morass and an economic disaster,” said Professor Anand Menon of King’s College London, one of the report’s authors.
Northern Ireland
The report authors also warned that no deal would result in “serious” consequences for Northern Ireland.
It said that if the UK did not reach a deal then that would mean the country leaving the single market and customs union and, as a result, “there will be a return to some form of hard border”.
The report called this “the very thing that everyone seems so keen to avoid”.
It said that this type of Brexit would be “truly chaotic” for Northern Ireland.
Yesterday,a report warnedthat Brexit had undermined political stability and exacerbated cross-community divisions in Northern Ireland.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS denied he’s planning to quit as the UK’s Foreign Secretary.
There have been rumours Johnson is considering stepping down because he disagrees with Prime Minister Theresa May’s approach to Brexit.
Speaking tothe Guardian, Johnson played down the reports, stating: “I am mystified by all this stuff.
“Not me, guv. I don’t know where it is coming from, honestly. It feels to me like an attempt to keep the great snore-athon story about my article running. I think that is what is going on.”
Johnson was referring to the 4,000-word article he wrote for the Daily Telegraph last week in which he urged Britain tomake a clean break with the European Unionafter Brexit.
The article led to a colleague accusing Johnson, who campaigned for the UK leave the EU, of “backseat driving”.

Special meeting
May is set to hold a special cabinet meeting tomorrow – on the eve of her highly anticipated Brexit speech in Florence this Friday, as she seeks to bring her ministers in line behind her EU strategy.
“There will be a cabinet meeting on Thursday morning ahead of the speech on Friday,” a Downing Street spokesman told AFP.
Addressing one of the most contentious issues in negotiations with Brussels, Johnson wrote in the article that Britain should not continue paying into the EU budget after Brexit, even at the price of continued access to Europe’s single market.
Despite the challenge to her authority, May sought to brush off the controversy during a trip to Canada yesterday, saying: “Boris is Boris.”
“The UK government is driven from the front and we all have the same destination in our sights — and that is getting a good deal for Brexit with the European Union,” she told reporters in Ottawa.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-brussels-summit-3749741-Dec2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has arrived in Brussels at a meeting of the European Council, with Brexit once again dominating the agenda.
Discussions at the two-day summit will focus on the next phase of Brexit negotiations, migration, and closer economic and monetary union.
The Taoiseach is expected to welcome last week’s joint UK-EU report, which ensures that the Common Travel Area will be maintained, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process will be protected, and there will be no hard border.
In an interview with Sky News, Varadkar said that he has “absolute confidence and trust” in the UK government to turn the tentative agreement into a legally-binding one.
He told the station that there is no timetable agreed for a transitional deal, saying it is “a dynamic situation”.

Weaknesses
The summit comes as UK Prime Minister Theresa May reels from a parliamentary defeat over Brexit that threatens to undermine her just as EU leaders back the opening of trade talks.
Yesterday, May’s own lawmakers rebelled to demand that parliament have the final say on any Brexit agreement before Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019.
The fresh blow to May’s authority will renew fears in Brussels about her ability to push through a deal and avoid a disorderly Brexit — something EU President Donald Tusk said this week would involve a “furious race against time” to avoid.
Leaders are expected to give the green light for a second phase of talks covering a post-Brexit transition phase, and future relations between Britain and the EU, including a possible trade deal.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker recommended the move after all-night talks with May last week, saying Britain had made “sufficient progress” on its divorce bill, the fate of the Irish border, and protections for European expats living in Britain.

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-brexit-customs-union-3717770-Nov2017/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is facing fresh pressure over her plans to deal with the Northern Ireland border post-Brexit, as Ireland’s European Commissioner Phil Hogan advised the UK not to leave the customs union.
A threat of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a major obstacle to May’s attempts at securing a UK and EU trade deal.
Hogan, however, suggested this can be solved if May drops plans to leave the customs union and the single market when Britain leaves the EU.
Hogan’s comments come after the DUP warned that they would not stand for any attempts to put a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK after Brexit.
He toldthe Observer newspaperthat it was a “very simple fact” that remaining inside the single market and customs union, or allowing the North to do so, would end the standoff.
“I continue to be amazed at the blind faith that some in London place in theoretical future free trade agreements,” Hogan said.
“First, the best possible FTA with the EU will fall far short of the benefits of being in the single market.

“Most real costs to cross-border business today are not tariffs – they are about standards, about customs procedures, about red tape. These are solved by the single market, but not in an FTA.”
May has been given a deadline of 4 December to make further proposals on the border issue.
She has already ruled out staying in the single market and customs union.
Hogan warned that Britain may struggle to keep the 59 trade deals it currently has through the EU.
“The UK would be running at a standstill,” he said.
“When it comes to trying to negotiate new FTAs with the rest of the world, Britain will be pushed around the way the EU – with currently more than eight times the UK population – will never be.”
DUP leader Arlene Foster told her party conference yesterday that the party “will not support any arrangements that create barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations”.
Along with Britain’s divorce bill for leaving and the rights of citizens affected by Brexit, the Irish borders issue is a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations, and EU leaders won’t allow talks to move into critical trade areas until the issues are resolved.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eating-disorders-3895490-Mar2018/,"THE IMPLICATIONS BREXIT might have for those travelling abroad for eating disorder treatment is “unclear”, according to the Health Service Executive (HSE).
One Fianna Fáil TD said he is particularly concerned about reports that the number of children with eating disorders being sent to the UK for treatment is increasing.
“This option, while unacceptable, may not even be available post-Brexit, as the legal mechanism for doing so is by way of an EU regulation,” James Browne toldTheJournal.ie.
In a reply to his parliamentary question on the matter, the HSE said given that the numbers of persons under 18 with eating disorders who received treatment in the UK is so low it could not disclose the exact figures, as it could identify patients.
“The implications of Brexit on the Treatment Abroad [Scheme] are unclear at present but the HSE and the Department of Health are aware of the issue and will plan accordingly,” said the health service.
The Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) allows patients get treatment in another EU member state.
Sending patients to the UK
High Court Judge Peter Kelly recently raised his concerns on this issue, stating that the numbers being referred to the UK for eating disorder cases are such that he thought it would be “a lot cheaper” to provide the necessary facilities in Ireland, rather than sending people to the UK.

He also said the HSE must consider that sending people abroad for treatment could be a casualty of Brexit, stating that the health service was not doing enough to provide services in Ireland.
Currently children with an eating disorder requiring acute treatment will have their in-patient care provided through the four national Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) acute treatment units in Dublin (where there are two), Cork and Galway.
As part of the new Children’s Hospital there is a plan for eight eating disorder beds and the community element of this service is currently being developed.
There are just three specialist eating disorder beds at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin for the acute treatment of adults.
The Department of Health estimates that somewhere in the region of 200,000 people in Ireland may be affected by an eating disorder, with an estimated 400 new cases among men and women each year.
Fianna Fáil Senator Catherine Ardagh said those “without private health insurance can expect a lengthy wait for assessment, let alone treatment under the public health system. For most, this leaves them suffering when we are all aware that early intervention guarantees the best chance of recovery”.
She said the government have an obligation to improve the current standard of care available to those suffering with an eating disorder in Ireland.
“We can already predict that there will be increased demand for such services in the years ahead. We must invest in our services now to ensure they can deliver the clinical outcomes that these patients deserve,” she concluded.
In January, the HSE’s Eating Disorders Services published its Model of Care for Ireland report.
The HSE has said that “when implemented, there will be a national network of specialist eating disorder community team based services and access to an enhanced level of special treatment beds”.

The Department of Foreign Affairs says that March was a particularly busy month in comparison with 2016, with a 36.5% rise in applications in the month that the online application option was launched.
Peak demand this year was in May, when the Passport Service registered close to 97,000 passport applications during that month.

The department said that it expects the year-on-year increase to continue in the coming years.

In April, it emerged that the cost of running the Passport Officesurged by almost €4.3 millionlast year as demand for Irish passports increased in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
An additional 32 staff were hired to cope with the rise in applications for Irish passports during 2016, while a number of temporary clerical officers were also engaged during especially busy periods.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the process has been sped up through the online application option, which was launched in March.
“The target turnaround time for online renewal is ten working days plus postage. In actual fact, 90% of online applications are currently being processed within just five working days.”
Almost 17% of all applications are sent through the online service, the department said.
Coveney advises those planning holidays and looking to renew or apply for passports to consult thePassports sectionof the department’s website to identify the right application route and renew online if possible.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-alignment-3876085-Feb2018/,"Updated 11.52am
THE EU HAS published thedraft text of the EU/UK Withdrawal Agreementwhich will see the UK leave the European Union.
The 118-page agreement sets out the arrangements for Brexit. The European Commission and European Council say they will discuss the document in the coming weeks before entering negotiations on it with the UK.
Aspects of the divorce deal relating to Northern Ireland leaked last night, igniting the fury of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
The text was confirmed today with a certain urgency displayed by negotiator Michel Barnier who mentioned a number of times that it is just 13 months until Britain’s leave date.
It outlines a plan for keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union if no other solutions to avoid a hard border in Ireland are found.
Under Chapter III, Article 3, it says:
sineadsinead
This is the “default” or “backstop” option where there will be no change to the current border between north and south. Northern Ireland would remain in “full alignment” with the EU’s customs union in order to uphold the Good Friday agreement.
It would mean alignment between the north and south for customs, VAT, energy, regulations for the protection of the environment and laws governing agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also have to adhere to EU rules on State Aid and would be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
This “default” option, however, is unpalatable to the hardline Brexiteers, in particular the DUP.
Speaking this morning, the EU’s top negotiator Michel Barnier said that what is contained in this document has already been agreed by the UK and the EU.
Denying he was trying to provoke the UK, he said there must be a solution that avoids a hard border and protects the Good Friday Agreement.
There are three options available to negotiators in relation to Northern Ireland:
.@MichelBarnier: my responsiblity is that we have a proposal for a functioning agreement. We have done this is a practical, pragmatic, legal fashion.— Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE)February 28, 2018Tony Connelly/ Twitter
.@MichelBarnier: my responsiblity is that we have a proposal for a functioning agreement. We have done this is a practical, pragmatic, legal fashion.
Barnier says he is also due to meet the political leaders in Northern Ireland, the DUP’s Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill next week.
Answering questions from the British press, he denied that the plan amounted to meddling in UK constitutional affairs.
He also said that the backstop plan would not amount to a defacto border in the Irish Sea, saying there may be controls in ports and airports, but he wouldn’t refer to it as a border.
If options A or B work out, the text allows for this “subsequent agreement”, stating:

Other areas
The draft text also deals with EU citizens living in the UK and the financial settlement.
EU citizens, regardless of country of origin, who have lived in the UK (up to the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020) will continue to have the right to reside there, under the deal.

Problems with the backstop
Speaking about the leaks last night, Jeffrey Donaldson MP says this would “fundamentally breach the understanding reached in December and would undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland”, and added “if the EU or Dublin believes the UK government will be signing up to a border in the Irish Sea, they are deluded”.
Jeffrey Donaldson / TwitterJeffrey Donaldson / Twitter/ Twitter
Speaking on Sky News, Sammy Wilson MP said that there is already a border in Northern Ireland, and that the EU and Irish government are trying to eliminate it.
He said: “Even at present, there are checks which go on goods which cross the Irish border, whether they be veterinary checks or spot checks by revenue controls, and when it comes to transport goods.”
And, in a statement, MEP Diane Dodds said that it is “simply unimaginable that there would be any barriers to trade across the Irish Sea”.
He added that the rest of the UK is Northern Ireland’s biggest trading partner, and that Ireland is only a part of its trade.
This proposed alignment would apply in lieu of the UK offering up solutions on how to create a frictionless border. Despite saying it wants to leave the customs union and single market, the UK government offered a guarantee in December that it would provide these solutions on how to reconcile this.
To date, however, these solutions haven’t been expanded upon and, yesterday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was criticised as “ignorant”for comparing the Irish border to travelling through different boroughs of London.
Speaking onNewstalk Breakfast, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the UK shouldn’t be able to cherry pick what kind of alignment it wants with the EU after Brexit.
“That’s not a serious position,” he said. “All we want is a good deal. Ireland, and our economy, could be impacted worse than the UK’s economy [in a hard Brexit], but it has to be based on realistic principles.”
He added that it was important to remember that the DUP does not speak for everyone in Northern Ireland.
“Most people voted remain,” he said. “And let’s bear in mind that the majority of people didn’t want to leave the EU.”
The Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister formally welcomed the text after its publication today, calling it an important step in the Brexit process.
“The draft includes a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the draft agreement, and gives legal effect to the firm commitments made in December,” Simon Coveney said in a written statement.
“We have always been clear that our preference is to avoid a hard border through a wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK [Option A], a view we share with the British government. We are also committed to exploring specific solutions to be proposed by the UK. At the same time, there is now the necessary legal provision to implement the backstop of maintaining full alignment in Northern Ireland with the rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to protect North South cooperation and avoid a hard border. This is very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary. This is about delivering on our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, no less, no more.”
It is hoped that a version of this draft will become legal text by October.

The EU’s heads of state are meeting in Gothenburg to discuss social rights within the union but a doorstopinterview between journalists and Varadkarwas dominated by the issue of Brexit.

Before UK-EU negotiations move onto the crucial issue of trade, parties must agree that sufficient progress has been made on three key issues: the UK’s exit bill, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.
A gap has been developing between Ireland and the UK over whether talks are at a point where the parties can move forward.
This “impasse” was evident at a meeting between UK Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson and Ireland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneyearlier this morning.
Doubling-down on Ireland’s position that more work needs to be done before phase two of the Brexit talks, Varadkar said Ireland wants any kind of physical border “off the table” before that.
“Obviously we’re open to alternative proposals but we need that in the conclusions,” he added.

The Taoiseach was asked whether this, in effect, meant that the UK would have to remain within the EU’s customs union. He denied this was necessarily the case.
“I don’t think that’s hugely divergent from the UK position that they would like to enter into a customs partnership with the EU after Brexit. What we want to do is set the parameters for the talks about trade.”
“We want it taken off the table any suggestion that there will be a physical border, a hard border, new barriers to trade on the island of Ireland.”
“It’s 18 months since the referendum, it’s 10 years since people who wanted a referendum started agitating for one. Sometimes it doesn’t seem like they thought all this through,” he added.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin also met with Boris Johnson today and agreed with the assertion from the Taoiseach that much of the plans of Brexiteers were not well thought out.
“They use this language, ‘we need to have control. we need to be part of a big global world free trade’ et cetera, et cetera. But there is no sense of any blueprint for that. There is no sense of people having worked through the practical implications of all that. And that was clear this morning,” Martin said.

Despite facing starvation and poverty themselves, the Choctaw people contributed $170 (€150) – which is about $4,400 (€3,950) today – to send food aid when they heard about Ireland’s struggle in 1847.
Varadkar, who is in the US for the annual St Patrick’s week trip, said: “For me, the story of our two peoples symbolises the spirit of St Patrick better than anything else.
“You showed compassion to a starving people, who were dying in their hundreds of thousands, or about to embark on our own ‘Trail of Tears’ across the Atlantic Ocean to seek a new life in Canada or the United States.”

Varakar said the two communities have “a sacred bond, which has joined our peoples together for all time”.
“Its impact was more than the lives that were saved 171 years ago. It is seen in the way it made us think of our fellow human beings when they are suffering and in distress. To always look outwards as a nation,” he stated.

During his speech, Varadkar also announced a new scholarship programme which will allow Choctaw students to study in Ireland.
“This is an opportunity for us to learn from you and from your culture, and you from ours, in a sharing of knowledge that will enrich both our peoples,” he said.
The first scholarship will commence in autumn 2019.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May this evening spoke to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar by phone ahead of the pending publication of the draft Brexit legal text.
The call, which was requested by an increasingly under-pressure May, saw both leaders agree that the various Brexit options agreed upon last December should be ‘examined in detail’.
However, Varadkar also reiterated the necessity that Option C of las December’s joint report, the option known as the ‘backstop’ facility which would see a commitment to no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should the other two options fail, be ‘spelled out’ in the forthcoming draft legal text.
That text is set to be published on Wednesday.
The backstop is proving to be a major political headache for May. Should it come into force she risks enraging the DUP, on whom her fragile government wholly depends, as it would see, to all intents and purposes, Northern Ireland stay within the customs union and the EU single market post Brexit, which contradicts May’s commitment to the unionist party that no new regulatory barriers will be placed between the UK and the North.

Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney this afternoon met with chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, a meeting that saw Coveney declare that, ahead of the publication of the draft text, “the Irish government and the task force are of one mind”.
He said that the text “will be faithful and true to the political agreement that was made in December”, but added that the document itself will “be negotiated over time”.
“Our preference will be to try and solve a lot of the Irish border issues and Irish issues through option A which  hopefully we will hear an awful lot more about on Friday from the British prime minister,” he said.
Coveney added that “we are not looking to try and put pressure on anybody”.
“We are simply looking to translate into a clear legal language a text that has already been agreed to politically before Christmas,” he said.

Could you draw Ireland's border with Northern Ireland? The border with Northern Ireland has become a major Brexit stumbling block.pic.twitter.com/yyqCRpPFuW
WITH THE LATEST round of Brexit talks looming, and with a divorce bill of at least €45 billion for the UK,Channel 4 News tookto the streets yesterday to gauge the English public’s knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland.
Equipped with a map of Ireland and a marker, they asked people to draw the line separating Ireland from Northern Ireland but most got it wrong.
The report came in the midst of several weeks of tense relations between Ireland and the UK over the issue of the post-Brexit border in Northern Ireland.
Leo Varadkar and Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney have been strong on the issue of the border, insisting that the talks cannot progress to trade issues until the British give real guarantees that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
In response,British politicians, andsections of the UK press, have lined up to criticise the Irish approach. This included Labour’s Kate Hoey, who said that Ireland would have to pay for a hard border if there wasn’t a Brexit deal.
“We don’t know too much about it”
With these tensions going on, some members of the public were unable to draw the correct border between the two.
One said: “As a younger generation, we don’t know too much about it. We don’t learn this kind of thing. It’s not something that is taught to be honest. ”
Another said: “I don’t think enough people know about it at the moment. They don’t know the implications of it.
This man made a stab at drawing a border which cut off Donegal, and sections of a few other northern counties in Ireland.

Another man, who also got the border slightly wrong, said the way the border issue could be fixed would be if Ireland left the EU.
One woman drew a map that cut off half of the country, with places like Galway, Westmeath and Dublin included in Northern Ireland.
She said: “Obviously, they’re separated by water and then to have another hard border with the Republic of Ireland. It would shut a lot of them off I suppose.”

Another woman accused Ireland of “just making trouble because they lost”, adding “it’s a bit petty isn’t it really?” and that “the southern Irish have to lump it basically”.
One man, who was fairly accurate with his drawing of the border, said: “Brexit is going to be an utter disaster all the way round… I don’t think they’ve thought this through frankly.”
Iain Duncan Smith
Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith made a faux-pas of his own on Channel 4 News last night when he confidently suggested that Ireland are playing hardball on Brexit because we have a presidential election due next year.
The Brexiteer was asked about the potential for Ireland to veto trade talks with the EU if a border solution hadn’t yet been found.
He said: “A lot of things are in the making on this one. There’s an election going on in Ireland…”
He was interrupted by presenter Cathy Newman, who pointed out that an election was now off the table due to Frances Fitzgerald’s resignation yesterday, but Duncan Smith retorted:
The former Conservative Party leader has been in politics since 1981, but still doesn’t appear to know that our democratically-elected President Michael D Higgins is not a member of the government.

Updated 2.30pm
THE EU AND Britain clashed Monday after British Prime Minister Theresa May said the ball was in the EU’s court as Brexit negotiations entered a critical fifth round.
Officials from both sides are meeting in Brussels, but chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier and British counterpart David Davis are not attending the start, underscoring low expectations for the talks.
This round of divorce discussions is the last before European leaders meet at a summit on 19 October to decide whether there is “sufficient progress” to move on to the trade talks that Britain desperately wants.
The European Commission roundly rejected May’s assertion that it was up to Brussels to take the initiative to advance the stalled talks, amid fears that her domestic political woes were threatening the negotiations.
“We do not provide comment on comments but what I can remind you of is there is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” the commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a press conference.
“So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen,” he added.
Even before the commission’s latest intervention, the prognosis for the talks was grim, with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker having warned that “miracles” would be needed this week to make enough progress to get a positive decision at the summit.
Brussels is particularly alarmed by the leadership crisis engulfing the British prime minister, facing a plot to oust her after a catastrophic, mishap-strewn speech at her Conservative party’s conference.
The embattled May is set to tell parliament today that she expects “leadership and flexibility” from the other 27 EU countries in the negotiations.
“As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response,” May was expected to say, according to her office.
Sufficient progress ‘unlikely’
The questions over May’s leadership have killed off hopes that a separate speech she gave in Florence in September, which contained key concessions, could give a “new dynamic” to the talks.

Initially Barnier had hoped to achieve “sufficient progress” to move on to discussing future EU-UK relations by the end of October, with the clock ticking for a deal before Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The talks have stalled on all three of the key divorce issues – the exit bill Britain must pay, the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and the fate of Northern Ireland.
London wants to begin talks on the future, including a possible EU-UK trade deal, as soon as possible.
Barnier tweeted on Friday that “Brexit negotiations next week should continue to advance” but he himself has warned there are still “significant divergences” and a lack of progress.
“It’s quite unlikely there will be sufficient progress made over the coming two weeks,” a senior European source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Diplomats said there was still an outside chance that the leaders of the EU member states, with an “eye on history”, might decide to approve the next phase anyway.
“Leaders want to lead,” a senior European diplomat said.
‘Eroded confidence’
But they would be flying in the face of not only Barnier’s advice, but also that of Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and the European Parliament.
MEPs overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion last week calling on the leaders to delay their decision until their next summit in December, owing partly to divisions in May’s government.
The fear in European capitals is that May is no longer calling the shots, making it virtually impossible to negotiate with the British government.
While May has backed a two-year transition period after Brexit to ease the impact on the economy, hardline Brexiteers want to cut ties with Europe more decisively.
“(Foreign Secretary Boris) Johnson’s statements in the run-up to and during the Tory party conference have killed the prospect of a fudge at the October European Council,” Eurasia Group analyst Mujtaba Rahman said in an analysis.

THE NEW TEXT of a deal to be offered by British Prime Minister Theresa May on the question of the Irish border is expected to be provided today.
Speaking last night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that May had told him in a phone call that the new text would arrive “by tomorrow” and that he was willing to consider them. That deal would be sent to Europe first, and then communicated to Ireland.
The Taoiseach, however, said that any new offer should not be substantially different to the one offered earlier this week, which was vetoed by the DUP.
He said: “We believe the agreement we had on Monday is one that would work for Ireland. Any new language would have to be consistent with that.”
The DUP, meanwhile, has said that there is still “work to be done” if it would agree to any border plans. Arlene Foster’s party had suggested that Dublin had blocked them seeing the proposed deal on Monday, but this was flatly denied by Varadkar last night.
Meanwhile, Scotland’s nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon accused the British government of being “totally and utterly incompetent” on Brexit, saying the current situation showed that Scotland should be independent.
“This week, this Tory UK Government — strictly speaking, it’s a Tory/DUP UK government — has been shown to be dissembling, mendacious and totally and utterly incompetent,” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said at a Scottish parliament session in Edinburgh.
During Leaders’ Questions today, Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said if the Tories wanted to “sail into the sunset” away from Europe that is their business, but that the Irish government’s business includes those in the North.
She said Sinn Féin would “stand shoulder to shoulder” with the Irish government if they stand firm. “You cannot afford a fudge,” she told Tánaiste Simon Coveney.
She asked the Tánaiste to commit to the North not being dragged out of the Customs Union and the Single Market.
Coveney said the Irish government has acted “consistently” since the beginning, adding:
“The core issues agreed at the beginning of this week are not changing,” he said.
“Of course we will look at other proposals the UK may offer… but the core meaning of the text needs to remain intact.”

With words not usually shared between Sinn Fein and Fine Gael, McDonald said: “I agree with you on all that Tánaiste — we will back you and applaud you for your efforts.”
Coveney said he was aware that he had to be cautious in what he said to the House due to the sensitive nature of the talks, but reiterated that the statements made at the beginning of the week still stand.
No white smoke
The European Commission said this afternoon that there was still “no white smoke” on a Brexit deal and set a limit of Sunday for May to return to Brussels with an acceptable deal.
“So far no white smoke. We stand ready to receive prime minister May at any moment in time when they are ready,” Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman for commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters in Brussels.
The Vatican sends up white smoke when a new pope is chosen.
Talks between May and Juncker broke up on Monday without a deal after a pro-British party in Northern Ireland that props up the British leader’s government objected to a clause about future arrangements for the Irish border.
Time is now running out for a deal on Brexit divorce terms, which would allow the opening of talks on a future trade deal at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on December 14-15.
Schinas dismissed British newspaper reports that the deadline could be extended into next week as “not correct”.
Diplomats from the other EU 27 nations are to meet on Monday and would need to see European Council chief Donald Tusk’s draft guidelines for opening the next phase of talks then in order to approve them for the summit, he said.
But EU sources said it was still possible that European leaders could agree at the summit next week that there had been “sufficient progress”, in order to give May a win, while postponing their approval of the guidelines for trade talks.
They could then approve those guidelines at EU summits due in February, or failing that in March, sources said.
With Ireland, the EU, and the DUP now playing the waiting game, all eyes are on London and Theresa May to see what offer she makes now.
In a statement last night, Number 10 said “the Prime Minister said how she recognised the significance of this issue to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland and how this remained a joint priority for both governments, and the EU, to resolve”.
She faces conflict within her own party, with pressure from Brexiteers to ditch talks with the EU, and pressure from more moderate MPs who say leaving without a deal would be “highly irresponsible”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-visit-to-canada-2-3557246-Aug2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR today announced government plans to double Ireland’s global footprint by 2025 – but the plan won’t be published until the end of the year.
Varadkar made his remarks in a speech to an Enterprise Ireland Business Breakfast in Toronto.
This marks the second day of a three-day official visit to Canada, where Varadkar is carrying out a number of engagements focused on growing trade and tourism opportunities between Ireland and Canada.
Announcing the plans, Varadkar said that the move “means new and augmented diplomatic missions and as well as significantly increased resources for our investment, tourism, cultural and food agencies overseas”.
The government will approve the specifics of what Ireland’s doubled presence overseas will look like in 2025 later this year, according to Varadkar.
The new plan, Ireland’s Global Footprint 2025, will aim to attract greater investment in Ireland, boost tourism and trade, build stronger links with our diaspora and increase cultural exchange.
Canada’s investment in Ireland is estimated today at $14 billion.

International presence
Yesterday,Varadkar marched alongsidehis Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau in the Montreal Pride Parade.
Before the parade, the two leaders held a bilateral covering a wide range of topics from EU-Canada trade deal CETA, along with Brexit, abortion and health issues.

Varadkar also spoke of CETA and Brexit during this morning’s breakfast speech, outlining that he wishes to “increase our international presence”.
“Foreign Direct Investment from Canada to Ireland has been buoyant in recent years and at the end of 2016, IDA Ireland had 28 Canadian companies in its client portfolio, employing over 3,100 people in Ireland,” he said this morning.
“We plan to grow this inward investment significantly in the years to come. Our efforts will undoubtedly be helped further by the entry into force of CETA.”
CETA, the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, comes into effect on a provisional basis from this day next month.
He said that over 98% of tariff barriers to trade between Canada and the EU, including Ireland, will be removed.
“This will help unlock the enormous untapped potential for greater trade and investment between Ireland and Canada,” Varadkar said.
‘Greatest political challenges in a generation’
Varadkar noted that Ireland today faces “undoubtedly the greatest set of political and economic challenges in a generation”, as a result of Brexit.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Varadkar said, in the context of Brexit, it is “more important than ever” that the Irish government “seeks to expand our markets overseas and strengthen our relationships with major trading partners”.

As well as meeting political and business leaders, the Taoiseach is due to meet members of the Irish community in both cities and representatives of immigrant support services.
Later today, Varadkar will attend a Tourism Ireland launch and a reception with the Irish community.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-speech-3882040-Mar2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has conceded that no side in the Brexit talks can get exactly what it wants.
In a speech given at the Mansion House in London today, she set out to give the UK’s negotiating position following the publication of theEU’s draft withdrawal treaty on Wednesday.
On multiple occasions, she restated there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland – but also made clear that the UK would not allow any breakup of its own common market. There was no explanation for how that would be achieved.

However, she did say concessions would have to be made if the bespoke trade agreement she wants was to be arrived upon.
“I want to be straight with people because the reality is we all need to face up to some hard facts,” she said.
On the matter of European Court of Justice jurisdiction, she noted that its existence, and its rulings, will still impact the UK.
On the accusations from the EU that she was attempting to ‘cherry pick’ the most beneficial elements of the Union, she said that was not her approach. However, she added: “If this is cherry picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry picking. What would be cherry picking would be to seek a deal where our rights and obligations were not held in balance.”
She said that there will need to be binding commitments made in any trade agreement, but caveated that idea with the fact that parliament will have its sovereignty and change these at any time.
During her speech, May said that no ‘off the shelf’ deal will work for the UK and the EU, explaining why the Norway, Turkey and Canada models cannot be used.
“We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,” she said.
She said that the border between the UK and the EU should be as “frictionless as possible” and that her government will “explore the terms on which the UK could opt to remain part of EU agencies”, including those regulating chemicals, medicines and aerospace. To do this, she acknowledged that certain fees and obligations would need to be met.
She noted that the UK’s regulations on goods and services would be “at least as high” as those of the EU.
Two options
At the end of her speech, May said that much of what she set out relies on the use of new technologies.
She laid out two customs options that she believes would be acceptable.

On the ”deepest and broadest possible” trade agreement that she wants, she said it would require reciprocal commitments to fair competition, the establishment of an arbitration mechanism, ongoing dialogue and the means for regulators to consult each other, an arrangement for data protection and the retention of links between the people.
Concluding, she noted: “So my message to our friends in Europe is clear. We know what we want. We understand your principles. We have a shared interest in getting this right. Now let’s get on with it.”
Q&A
Two queries – one from a German journalist and one from a French journalist – caused problems for May during the Q&A section after her speech was delivered.
One asked if ‘Brexit will be worth it’. May attempted to laugh it off and said the UK would not be rethinking the outcome of the referendum.
She was then asked to “be honest” on the Northern Ireland question, with the French journalist saying that there will be at least a ‘light border’. May again reiterated her commitment to avoiding this outcome, but again, did not say how this would be achieved.
Reaction
Initial reaction to the speech – her third keynote on Brexit – was to point out that much of what was proposed was a re-presentation of ideas that were dismissed as fanciful by the EU last August.
The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said she failed to come up with answers.
“The Prime Minister’s commitment to work for a solution on the border is a belated recognition of reality, however that commitment is severely undermined in the same speech when she advocated the very same customs proposals which were widely and comprehensively dismissed last year.”
On the same point, the DUP’s Arlene Foster said, “Last August’s United Kingdom proposals were innovative but did not receive a fair hearing in many quarters. Those proposals can ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after we exit the EU.”
The party welcomed her entire speech, saying it “set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward”.
“The Northern Ireland section of the draft legal text published by the EU, has not only been rejected as unacceptable by the Government but also the Labour Party, thus reinforcing the fact that no United Kingdom Prime Minister could accept such a concept,” he statement continued.
Foster and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill are due to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Taoiseach said he will study the speech closely.
Leo Varadkar said, “I welcome that she has given a number of important reassurances today, including restating her overall goal of a very close relationship with the EU.”
“We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK. Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short.”

THE UK GOVERNMENT is under pressure to publish its latest Brexit analysis after a leaked internal report said Britain would be worse off whatever deal it strikes with the EU.
The economic impact assessment, drawn up for the Brexit ministryand seen by the BuzzFeed News website, showed growth would be lower under a range of potential scenarios.
The leak comes as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to fly out on a three-day trade mission to China and as parliament’s upper House of Lords begins scrutinising the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, a key plank of Brexit legislation.
The January 2018 study, titled “EU Exit Analysis”, examined three of the most plausible Brexit scenarios.
If found that if the UK remained in the European single market, growth would be 2% lower over the next 15 years compared to current forecasts.
Under a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union, growth would be 5% lower, it said.
And if London and Brussels end up with a “no deal” scenario and revert to World Trade Organisation rules, growth would be reduced by 8% over the same period, the report said, according to BuzzFeed News.

Responding to the leak, a government source said officials across the ministries were undertaking “a wide range of ongoing analysis”.
“An early draft of this next stage of analysis has looked at different off-the-shelf arrangements that currently exist,” the source said.
“It does not, however, set out or measure the details of our desired outcome – a new deep and special partnership with the EU.
Opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, part of the Open Britain group – the continuity Remain campaign from Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership – urged the government to make its assessment public.
“The government must now publish their analysis in full, so that MPs and the public can see for themselves the impact that Brexit will have and judge for themselves whether it is the right thing for our country,” he said.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs from May’s governing Conservative Party, said the findings were “highly speculative”.
Meanwhile parliament’s foreign affairs scrutiny committee said Britain’s diplomatic network was spread too thinly and needed to be bolstered to cope with Brexit.
The panel of MPs said British representation in EU capitals, particularly Berlin and Paris, needed to be significantly increased to help maintain influence in Europe.

The department will publish a number of papers – including one on the plans for the North.
The papers form the result of more than a year of preparatory work in Whitehall.
The papers will cover both the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the “deep and special partnership” they want to build with the European Union.

“The approaches outlined in these papers have been carefully formulated following months of work and consultation.
“These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations. Businesses and citizens in the UK and EU want to see the talks progress, and move towards discussing a deal that works for both sides.”

Of the current 751 MEPs, 73 are held by representatives of the UK; it’s been recommended that 27 of these be filled by current members and 46 be kept vacant.
Ireland will get two new MEPs as a result, raising their representation from 11 to 13. France, Italy and the Netherlands will get three new MEPs each, and Spain will get five extra MEPs (from 74 up to 79).
Austria, Croatia,  Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Sweden all have been allocated one additional seat.

Co-rapporteur of the committee Danuta Hübner said “One of the main challenges of this report was on how to deal with the legacy of Brexit.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has called for a “deep and special partnership” in relation to security to be maintained between the UK and the European Union post-Brexit.
In a speech delivered at the Munich Security Conference in Germany this morning, May spoke about the impact of terror attacks on Europe.
She said people throughout Europe have “shared the pain and heartbreak of terrorist atrocities”, noting it’s almost a year since the “despicable” attack in Westminster, which was followed by further attacks in Manchester and London.

May called on the EU to not let “rigid institutional restrictions” get in the way of a wide-ranging post-Brexit security partnership. She warned that there will be “damaging real-world consequences” if such a plan isn’t agreed.
She added that Britain is “just as committed to Europe’s security in the future as we have been in the past”.
“This cannot be a time when any of us allow competition between partners, rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology to inhibit our cooperation and jeopardise the security of our citizens,” she stated.
Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019.

Doubt was cast on this week’slandmark Brexit deal- which sets out guarantees that there won’t be a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland - after Britain’s Brexit minister said that the deal was not legally binding.
Davis toldThe Andrew Marr Show on BBC 1, “This was a statement of intent more than anything else. Much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing.”

However, the Irish government has hit back with government chief whip Joe McHugh describing the comments as bizarre. He toldThis Weekon RTE Radio 1:

“My question to anybody within the British government would be, why would there be an agreement, a set of principled agreements, in order to get to phase two, if they weren’t going to be held up? That just sounds bizarre to me.
Government chief whip Joe McHughSam BoalSam Boal
The deal, which will see Brexit talks move to the second phase, also agreed terms on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU and on citizens’ rights.
In a statement a government spokesperson added, “As the Taoiseach indicated on Friday, even if the worse case scenario occurs and there is no final deal, there must still be full alignment north and south under the agreement.”
Davis also noted that Britain would not pay the €44 billion exit bill to Brussels unless it secures a trade deal.
But speaking after Friday’s deal, the UK Chancellor Philip Hammond had said it would be “inconceivable” that the UK would fail to honour its international obligations.
Questioned on this, Davis said, ”No. It is conditional on an outcome. I am afraid that wasn’t quite right … No deal means that we won’t be paying the money.”

EU BREXIT CHIEF Michel Barnier has said the bloc would give the UK its “most ambitious” trade deal — but only if a solution is found to the border issue.
Barnier has warned Britain it had to come up with a solution to avoid imposing a hard border in Ireland if it wanted talks on its departure from the bloc to move on to trade.
If it does, Barnier is now promising a worthwhile trade deal.
“The island of Ireland now faces many challenges. Those who wanted Brexit must offer solutions,” Barnier said.

The EU is backing Ireland in this demand and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney welcomed this support.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Nine Newsthis evening, Coveney said.
That’s been our position for months. Some people I think maybe didn’t think Ireland would hold to that position during this negotiations, we are holding to that position and the European Union negotiating team is supporting us absolutely in that.
The EU is demanding that the UK makes “sufficient progress” on three key areas before the talks move to a possible trade deal and a transitional arrangement. As well as Northern Ireland, the issues are the UK’s Brexit bill and the future status of EU citizens in the UK and vice-versa.

In a gesture to London, EU leaders are set at a summit next week to order the launch of preparatory work on a future trade deal, even though they will not approve moving on to full trade talks until December.
But the stalemate will stoke fears swirling in London and Brussels of a breakdown in talks that could see Britain leaving the European Union in March 2019 without an agreement to soften the blow.
After a fifth round of talks with Britain’s David Davis, Barnier said he “cannot recommend” to EU leaders at the 19-20 October summit that negotiations move on from divorce issues to talks on a post-Brexit relationship.
The Frenchman reserved his most cutting comments for the issue of financial commitments, saying Britain had still not spelled out what Prime Minister Theresa May promised in a key speech in Florence, Italy, last month.
“We are at a deadlock on this question which is extremely disturbing,” Barnier said at a press conference with Davis at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels.
But Barnier added:
‘Tiger in the tank’
The leaders of the 27 other EU countries have demanded there be “sufficient progress” on the Brexit bill, the rights of EU citizens living in Britain, and on Northern Ireland before moving on to discuss a post-Brexit trade deal.
Germany has led opposition to having even informal talks on trade or on a two-year trade transition period suggested by May, saying the divorce must be sorted out first.
The tough line taken by Europe on Brexit was restated by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said in Washington Thursday that the “British people and British government have to assume the consequences of their decision” to leave.

But May later said the two sides were “very close to agreement” on a number of issues including citizens’ rights and welcomed Barnier’s recognition that progress could be made in the coming weeks.
British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson told the EU to step up the pace. “We’re looking for some urgency from our friends and partners, and it’s time to put a bit of a tiger in the tank and get this thing done,” he said.
Davis, a key figure in the Leave campaign in last year’s Brexit referendum, said he still hoped EU leaders could decide to shift to the next phase when they meet next week.
If that was not possible, he called on the EU to give Barnier a mandate next week to “explore ways forward” even if the next phase is not formally opened.
Deal or no deal?
In response, a draft summit statement by the EU leaders said they would reassess progress in December and if the verdict is positive they will issue guidelines for trade talks plus a transition.
“In order to be fully ready for such a scenario, the European Council invites (ministers) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussion,” said the draft obtained by AFP.
The concession, however slight, comes amid growing concerns that Britain could leave without a deal, which could cause huge economic disruption on both sides of the English Channel.
Barnier warned that “a ‘no deal’ will be a very bad deal” after May admitted this week that her government was setting aside money for a so-called hard Brexit.
EU President Donald Tusk warned Tuesday that the bloc might rethink whether a Brexit deal is possible if there is no progress by December.
“If it turns out that the talks continue at a slow pace, and that ‘sufficient progress’ hasn’t been reached, then – together with our UK friends – we will have to think about where we are heading,” he said.

On Friday, Boulton asked Coveney if he felt guilty over Ireland’s approach to Brexit negotiations.
In recent days, some people have been critical of Boulton’s line of questioning and last night he tweeted: ”Bored now. Some of you Irish need to get over yourselves. Interviewing is about challenging the interviewee not respecting.”
A deal announced on Friday morning saw British Prime Minister Theresa May guaranteethere would be no hard borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK leaves the EU.

“Do you think that this week’s kerfuffle has been necessary? Do you feel slightly guilty that perhaps the Irish government over-briefed what had been achieved as a victory over the British for the European Union?,” Boulton asked Coveney.
“That [then] provoked the DUP and if you had been a bit more straightforward about a practical agreement at the beginning we wouldn’t have had these four days of turmoil.”
Coveney responded by saying: “We we never looked for or claimed any victory over anybody.
“We have been saying for many months now that we want to work with the British government to try to find a way forward that can reassure people in Ireland as well as in the UK that we can manage Brexit and we can limit damage in the way that’s now in this agreement.”

Fine Gael TD Noel Rock was among those to reply to Bolton’s tweet last night, posting “Some of you presenters need another dose of reality” alongside a video of a heated 2010 interview between Boulton and Tony Blair’s former spokesman Alastair Campbell.

Johnson met with Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney on 17 November, but Sky claims his own officials told Dublin to “ignore the public utterances” of Johnson.
However, the Department of Foreign Affairs “absolutely refutes” the story, it toldTheJournal.ie.
“We absolutely refute the contents of that report.”
The UK Foreign Office also hit back, tweeting:
“We do not recognise this version of events, and the claims made in the article are not supported by any sources from the Foreign Office – either on or off-the-record. Disappointing to report as fact.”
Johnson and Coveney held a joint press conference on the day,but were not on the same page when it came to Brexit talks.
Coveney reiterated the Irish position that a transitional period of “four or five years” is preferable for new trade arrangements after Brexit while Johnson said he feels a new relationship could be forged “on a much shorter timescale”.
Brexit talks remain stalled, with the issue of the border one of crucial importance to negotiations progressing.

The Irish government wants guarantees from the UK government around the border. That there will be no so-called “hard border” with regulatory checks on goods and people passing between the two countries.
An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to meet with European Council President Donald Tusk tomorrow, but it is not thought the issue will be resolved by then.
Aggrieved
Meanwhile, a former British MP says the UK and Ireland’s relationship is special “despite Ireland staying neutral in World War II”.
Speaking toPat Kenny on Newstalk, former Chancellor Nigel Lawson said that the border should be as unobtrusive as possible.
However, he said that the European Commission wanted to “punish” the UK and said that old attitudes to Ireland pervade in the UK.
“We have always had a good relationship with Ireland. Despite the shock at the decision of De Valera to stay neutral in the war against Hitler and Nazi Germany.
“Despite that, we have maintained a very special relationship.
“The decision to stay neutral was a great shock.”
He paid tribute to the Irish soldiers who fought for the Allied forces and said that Britain would not have allowed a Nazi occupation of Ireland.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR is due to make a statement on a major development in the Brexit negotiations.
London is expected to concede that there will be no “regulatory divergence” relating to the single market and customs union between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The announcement, which he is to make alongside Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, was scheduled for 2.30pm. It has since been postponed, however.
RTÉ is reportingthat the press event has been postponed because the Government has not yet been given a notification from Brussels, where British Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Reporters were briefly allowed into the reception area at the front of Government Buildings, but have since been asked to step back outside to the street. A revised time for Varadkar’s statement is yet to be confirmed.

Border deal
The UK concession to EU negotiators means there will be no divergence of the rules covering the EU single market and customs union on the island of Ireland post Brexit, according to reports this afternoon.
A series of meetings have been taking place today in Government Buildings to decide a wording on the Irish issues affected by Brexit, and events have been gathering pace this afternoon.
A special Cabinet meeting was held this morning, and Varadkar met with party leaders at lunchtime today in advance of his planned announcement.
Meanwhile, in a statement in Belfast, DUP leader Arlene Foster claimed in the wake of this afternoon’s reports that the Irish government is “seeking to unilaterally change that Belfast Agreement”.
Foster said:
Agreement between Dublin and London on the border issue is required for Brexit negotiations to progress onto crucial trade matters following a special EU summit next week.

May has been holding a lunch meeting with Juncker. She will also sit down with European Commission president Donald Tusk later.
Tusk earlier tweeted a deal was close (paraphrasing a Boomtown Rats hit in the process):

On Friday, Tusk said that the EU will not accept Britain’s offer if Dublin is not satisfied with proposals for future border arrangements.
Speaking this morning, Coveney said that no such proposals had yet been agreed.
“There was progress made between the two negotiating teams on Thursday and we were looking at draft texts and that’s continued into the weekend,” he toldRTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
“We’re trying to deal with issues that are very important to us and we believe essential for the island of Ireland as a whole. There’s this very difficult issue of getting wording that both sides can agree on in preventing a hard border.”
Later giving an update on RTÉ’s News at One, Coveney said that they were at a “much better place now than we have been in Brexit negotiations at any point to date”.
He also hinted that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland, when he said:

“I certainly think we are making progress, a huge amount of work has been done over the weekend. Officials have been meeting throughout the weekend and late into the night,” she said.
Sticking point
The UK is keen to move on to trade issues, but the Irish border has proved to be the main sticking point preventing this.
Worries that the return of checkpoints could reignite the sectarian divisions that led to decades of conflict in the North have led to calls for London to come up with a way to avoid a hard border.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sadiq-khan-interview-trump-3520643-Jul2017/,"MAYOR OF LONDON Sadiq Khan has discussed the many challenges his first year in office has brought – including why he thinks he has incensed President Donald Trump.
In the aftermath of the London terror attacks, Trump responded by attacking Khan for saying that ‘Londoners should not be worried’ about the increased police presence on streets.
“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed’!” Trump tweeted, which seemed to take Khan’s comments out of context.
Speaking to the Guardian, Khan said that if the President’s problem is that he’s a Muslim, ‘it says more about Trump than it does about him’:
It’s one of the many challenges that Khan has faced as mayor – and probably the least important.
The beginning of Khan’s term in office was dominated by Brexit. In the run up to the June 2016 vote, Khan had debated passionately for remaining in the EU, including one late-night appearance during which he was observing Ramadan and hadn’t eaten for hours.
Since then he’s seen London respond to terror attacks at Westminster Bridge, Borough Market and a London mosque which has led to an increased police presence on the city’s streets.
It marks a distinctive contrast to his predecessor Boris Johnson’s term in office, which was marked with jokes and gaffes (that Johnson hasn’t completely abandoned).

In response to what he’s done in the past 14 months,  Khan says: “First, you get the information out there, so we’ve published the air quality reports that Boris hid away.”
“Already, in 14 months, we’ve improved the air on Oxford Street. How? By getting rid of the most polluting buses.”

The former Labour MP also claimed that his party could reverse Brexit, and would win if there were another election today under Corbyn’s stewardship.
Khan, who previously called for the party to ditch Corbyn as leader, says he’s learned an important lesson from the politician who won over swathes of young voters in this year’s snap election:
“Be who you are. What Jeremy has proved is the famous West Wing phrase, ‘Let Bartlet be Bartlet’.”

On the issue of Grenfell Tower disaster, Khan council authorities were accused by locals of abandoning residents in substandard accommodation. He says he doesn’t think there was anything he could have done to prevent the disaster.
Despite worrying about the growing number of hate crimes in a post-Brexit UK, and a public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire looming, Khan says he loves his job and wants another six terms as Mayor of London.
“I’ve been blessed – every job I’ve had I’ve loved, whether it’s as a lawyer, MP, cabinet minister… But I’m not going to pretend otherwise: I love this job more than any of them.”

THE EUROPEAN UNION wants the power to be able to cut the UK’s access to the EU’s single market during the post-Brexit transition, if it violates agreed rules, EU sources have said.
The comments are contained in the latest EU draft of the transition agreement laid out by the European Commission, which is expected to be published later today.
Under plans for the 21-month transition after Britain leaves the bloc on 29 March 2019, London must abide by all EU laws without having any decision-making power – turning the country into what critics call a “vassal state”.
The latest EU draft of the transition agreement says the bloc should be able to cut Britain’s access to the EU’s single market if it misbehaves and if there is not likely to be enough time to take the issue to the bloc’s top court in Luxembourg.
The punishment clause emerged as Brexit negotiations resumed in Brussels.
The text calls for a “mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market”, a European source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Being part of the bloc’s single market will allow Britain to keep trading without tariffs or customs checks during the transition, as well as allowing British citizens to keep living and working wherever they like in the other countries.
Punishments should happen “where it considers that referring the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union would not bring in appropriate time the necessary remedies”, the source confirmed the text as saying.

Germany backs EU draft
Britain did not say whether it would accept Brussels’ proposal, or if the government had come up with contingency plans if Britain is blocked from the single market during the transition period.
“This is a draft document produced by the EU that simply reflects their stated directives,” a Brexit ministry spokesman told AFP.
Germany’s Brexit coordinator, Peter Ptassek, said the Commission’s draft text “provides the clarity with the economy facing Brexit needs”.
“Not so much time left to get a deal on this in March,” he wrote, referring to the month-end deadline given by the EU and Britain to conclude talks on the transition.
The two sides reached an interim deal in December on three key separation issues – the financial settlement, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens after Brexit.
This week’s technical talks in Brussels will look at plans for the 21-month transition, while the issue of the border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland will also be revisited.
After reaching agreement on the transition period, Britain and the EU will move on to talks about their future relationship including a possible trade deal.
But they have already disagreed about whether EU nationals moving to Britain after Brexit day but during the transition should have the same rights as those who moved before.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nigel-farage-second-brexit-referendum-2-3805913-Jan2018/,"BREXITEER NIGEL FARAGE has said that he actually doesn’t want a second Brexit referendum but fears that the UK may be forced to vote again, referencing Ireland’s second vote on the Lisbon Treaty.
Farage was interviewed onTV3′s Tonight Showlast night and his referendum comments were in stark contrast to those he made on Twitter last week, where he suggested that a second Brexit referendum should be held.
Speaking via a Skype call last night, Farage said: “I haven’t called for a second referendum, I don’t want a second referendum, but having seen what happened to you guys after you rejected the Lisbon Treaty and being forced to vote again, I fear the same may happen to us.”
Despite his fears and his calls for a referendum last week, Farage said that he thinks Britain would vote in favour of Brexit on an even larger scale if there was a second referendum.
“We took a fork in the road for Brexit and what we ought to do is simply to get on with it but I don’t think the British would get bullied in the second referendum into changing their minds,” Farage said.
“One of the reasons for that, of course, is the creation of a European army, airforce and navy, the militarisation of the Union and the creation of the United States of Europe,” he said.https://twitter.com/TonightShowTV3/status/954145478177951744

‘A European Unionist’
Farage hit the headlines again yesterday after he branded Leo Varadkar a “European unionist” as heattacked the Taoiseach’s EU speech in Strasbourg.
Varadkar had addressed the parliament and had shared with the MEPs his vision for Europe – citing the North’s special relationship with the EU, banking regulations as well as corporation tax.
But responding to the speech, Farage said that Varadkar was being used as a political pawn and that Ireland was, for once, useful to the big countries in making Brexit as convoluted and as difficult as possible. Farage added that “small countries normally count for nothing”.
Speaking on the Tonight Show, Farage noted that he met Varadkar for a drink after the meeting.
“He is a very, very competent man. He’s a great debater and in many, many ways he’s a real smart cookie but he has an absolute devotion to the European project that has been with him ever since he was a young man,” Farage said.
However, he continued to say that Varadkar “should be arguing, banging the table and fighting and saying look, we in Ireland are the one country who could potentially really be hurt by Brexit, can we make sure we have a proper grown up deal with the UK?”.
He then went on to say that he is surprised to see that Ireland is becoming so integrated into the EU’s ideas and that the country is “self-harming” itself.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-draft-text-3875590-Feb2018/,"
THE EU’S DRAFT of its Brexit ‘divorce agreement’ is set to be unveiled today.
The legal document will spell out the agreement reached last December on three key topics:
It’s the Irish border that is perhaps the most sensitive of these three pillars.
The Guardian saysthat the European Commission will say in the draft today that “as a last resort to avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland would remain in the EU customs union and aligned to European single market rules”.
And RTÉ’s Tony Connellyreported last nightthat the report will reflect the ‘backstop’ option inDecember’s agreementbetween the UK and the EU.
Speaking yesterday in the Dáil, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that he was “satisfied” that the draft had resolved a number of issues, which were put to him by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. These included explicitly stating there would be no Brexit border on the island; protecting the Good Friday Agreement; and making it clear there will be no loss of rights for citizens.
Varadkar has already seen the draft agreement, which will be published at 12 noon today by Brussels.
Varadkar said, however, that he believes “we could have an interesting few weeks ahead of us”, as we “cannot automatically assume” the draft will be acceptable to the UK or all the parties in Northern Ireland.
Backstop
The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, had earlier acknowledged that the draft would “render operational” a controversial “backstop” opposed by London on the issue of how to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.

The fallback option says that if no better solution is found, Northern Ireland would remain in “full alignment” with the EU’s single market and customs union in order to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
“The Irish question cannot remain unresolved,” Barnier said.
After a meeting with Barnier, Tánaiste Simon Coveneysaid yesterdaythat “the Irish government and the task force are of one mind” ahead of the publication of the draft.
He said that the text “will be faithful and true to the political agreement that was made in December”, but added that the document itself will “be negotiated over time”.
“Our preference will be to try and solve a lot of the Irish border issues and Irish issues through option A which hopefully we will hear an awful lot more about on Friday from the British prime minister,” he said.
Theresa May is due to give a speech on Friday.
He said that they want to “translate into a clear legal language” a text that was agreed to politically before Christmas.
This ‘backstop’ facility was option C in last December’s joint report, and would see a commitment to no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should the other two options fail, be ‘spelled out’ in the forthcoming draft legal text.
But this backstop is somewhat of a political headache for Theresa May, as if it comes into force it may anger the DUP – and May’s government depends on Arlene Foster’s support.
Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson raised some irewhen talking about the border issue, by comparing Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the London boroughs of Camden and Westminster.
The UK may have made assurances that there will not be a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, but it hasn’t come up with a solution for it to leave the single market and customs union but not have border checks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-northern-ireland-3655533-Oct2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that Northern Ireland’s citizens will want to become Irish and European “at the very least for convenience” after Brexit.
Speaking toRTÉ Newsahead of a summit of EU leaders today, Varadkar said that negotiations weren’t at a cliff edge, but that he was “very keen that Ireland builds new political alliances in Europe”.
Negotiators in the thick of Brexit talks have been batting away rumours of a stalemate in brokering a deal – mainly due to a lack of progress on three core issues.
The European Union team want these three issues solved before discussing the UK’s preferred topic of free trade. (The EU’s wishlist are the rights of EU citizens living in the UK (and vice versa), the bill that the UK will have to pay upon leaving (hinted to be€20 billion), and the issue of a border in Northern Ireland.
A deadline was set for those three things to be ironed out before moving on to the next phase, which hasn’t happened, setting negotiators and the press pack around them into a panic.
Those strained relations were exacerbated when theUK’s chancellor called Europe “the enemy”.
Today, Leo Varadkar said more detail was needed from the UK on their position on Northern Ireland in particular.
“I don’t think it’s enough to say you don’t want certain outcomes, you have to really explain how you’re going to avoid them,” he toldRTÉ News.

He then said:
“After the UK leaves the EU it is very likely that the majority of people in Northern Ireland will be Irish and European citizens. Even people from a unionist background will want to become Irish and European citizens at the very least for their convenience.”

IRISH POLITICIANS ON both sides of the border have been forced to defend the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) amid an increasing number of attacks from UK Brexiteers.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that criticism of the agreement was “reckless” and could “undermine” the peace process.
The GFA has come onto the radar of pro-Brexit politicians because its existence has made the Irish government a central player in the UK’s separation negotiations with the EU.
All sides agreed that the GFA must be protected in those negotiations and theBritish deal with the EU in Decembermade specific reference to “protecting the operation of the 1998 Agreement”.
That December deal has been criticised by some hardline UK Brexiteers who argue that it could force the UK to maintain regulatory alignment with the EU’s customs union.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Now, with the inability of the DUP and Sinn Féin to agree a power-sharing deal at Stormont, some Brexiteers have taken the opportunity to question whether the agreement should remain at all.
Labour’s Kate Hoey MPtold the Huffington Post:
Writingin the Telegraphabout the GFA, Tory MEP and one of the founders of Vote Leave Daniel Hannan said “its flaws have become clearer over time”.
“I don’t object to the Belfast Agreement on orange or green grounds, but on democratic grounds. It’s unhealthy to have the same people in office all the time,” he said.

In another column inThe Telegraph, journalist Ruth Dudley Edwards wrote that:
Despite the criticism from some of the hardline Brexiteers, both the British and Irish governments have said that 1998 peace deal is still the way forward.
In a series of tweets today, Simon Coveney said that criticism of the agreement was not a good idea.
“Talking down Good Friday Agreement because it raises serious and genuine questions of those pursuing Brexit is not only irresponsible but reckless and potentially undermines the foundations of a fragile peace process in Northern Ireland that should never be taken for granted,” Coveney said.
He later added:
Good Friday Agreement 1998 was supported by referendum in Northern Ireland. The result was 71.1% in favour. A simultaneous referendum held in the Rep of Ireland produced an even larger majority (94.4%) in favour - today Irish and British Govts remain absolutely committed to GFA— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney)February 20, 2018Simon Coveney/ Twitter

Fine Gael’s EU affairs spokesperson Senator Neale Richmond was more strident against those criticising the GFA, telling those engaged in such rhetoric to “sod off”.
“Not content with stirring up horrible xenophobia in the campaign, they now want to destroy peace in Ireland for their petty brand of British nationalism! In terms they’d understand…. sod off! #StopBrexit, ”Richmond tweeted.
Asked about his tweet onRTÉ’s News at One, Richmond said that some “arch-Brexiteers” have been making “unwelcome” comments.
“These are the same people who said we need to respect the British vote, the 52%. It’s very important that they remember that 94% of people in the south and 71% of people in the north voted for the Good Friday Agreement,” Richmond said.
On the British side,  the UK’s Brexit Secretary David Davis said today that opposition to the GFA is not coming from within the government.
Speaking in Austria, Davis was asked about Coveney’s comments that people have been “talking down” the agreement.
Davis denied this was the case: “I’m not conscious of anybody talking down the Good Friday Agreement. Certainly nobody in government has and everything that we are doing is aiming towards ensuring that we meet every aspect of it. So I don’t foresee that being a problem.”

DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has claimed that the Irish government is “seeking to unilaterally change that Belfast Agreement” following reports of deal between Dublin and London.
Adeal was expected to be announcedthis afternoon but European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker confirmed that work still needed to be done.
The UK was expected to concede that there will be no “regulatory divergence” on the island of Ireland in relation to the single market and customs union.
It would effectively mean that Northern Ireland would operate under the same regulatory rules that pertain within the EU.
Details of the deal were to be announced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this afternoon but that announcement was put on hold.
Further negotiations are set to continue ahead of a crunch Brussels summit beginning on Friday week.
The DUP is opposed to Northern Ireland being treated any differently to the rest of the UK and has said it will not accept any such deal.
Following reports of the deal, DUP leader Arlene Foster spoke to reporters this afternoon.

“We have been very clear, Northern Ireland must leave the European Union on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom and we will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the UK. The economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom must not be compromised in any way,” Foster said.
Foster then said that the DUP wanted a “sensible Brexit” and accused the Irish government in Dublin of seeking to change the Good Friday Agreement.
“The Republic of Ireland government for their part claim to be guarantors of the Belfast Agreement but they are clearly seeking to unilaterally change that Belfast Agreement without our input and our consent. And of course we will not stand for that,” she said.

Scotland
News that Northern Ireland may be treated differently to the rest of the UK has prompted Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to suggest that Scotland could also be treated the same way.
In the June 2015 referendum, both Northern Ireland and Scotland had majorities voting to remain within the EU.
In a tweet, Sturgeon said:
Outside of Northern Ireland and Scotland, Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has also suggested the remain-voting London could “remain within the single market”.
Huge ramifications for London if Theresa May has conceded that it's possible for part of the UK to remain within the single market & customs union after Brexit.

AFTER WEEKS OF feuding, two key figures in Britain’s cabinet came together today to say any post-Brexit transition would not be a “back door” to continued European Union membership.
Finance minister Philip Hammond, who favours a softer, pro-business Brexit, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a hardline supporter of Britain leaving the EU, have clashed over the UK’s future outside the bloc.
But in a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, they agreed there should not be a “cliff-edge” when Britain leaves in March 2019.
They said any transition period would be “time-limited” and that Brexit would mean Britain pulling out of both the European single market and the customs union.

“We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months’ time,” they wrote.
“That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty — but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.
“We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a ‘third country’, not a party to EU treaties.”
Meanwhile British government ministers were this week due to start publishing detailed papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks, with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government facing criticism over a perceived lack of clarity about its negotiating position.
Britain’s Brexit Secretary David Davis is due to hold a third round of talks with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels at the end of August.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-what-next-3882396-Mar2018/,"MANY BREXIT COMMENTATORS believed that we would have a clearer picture of what Brexit will look like by today.
Those predictions have not really been borne out, despite the delivery of a key speech by the British Prime Minister and the publication of an important document by the European Union.
We do have the starting negotiation positions from both the EU and the UK – but right now, all we can see are differences.
On Wednesday, the European Commission published draft text of what it is calling a Withdrawal Agreement. It is 118 pages long and includes a controversial protocol on Northern Ireland which is already a huge sticking point for the UK. In the absence of a deal, it outlines how Northern Ireland would become part of the EU customs union to ensure no hard border will be established on the island.
British Prime Minister rejected that out of hand and said there would be no breaking up of the UK’s common market or a border running down the Irish Sea.
On Friday, then, she reiterated her support for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, ensuring that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Her proposals for how to do that – by way of either a customs partnership or special customs arrangement with specific exemptions for Northern Ireland – were the same as those dismissed by the EU last August.
So, where does that leave us?
With a lot of work for both Barnier and May to do. Here’s what’s due to happen over the coming year…
Monday 5 March and Tuesday 6 March
DUP and Sinn Féin leaders Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill will travel to Brussels to meet chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
The DUP said on Friday its delegation’s message on Tuesday would be clear:
MEPs Matt Carthy and Martina Anderson are also part of Sinn Féin’s group which will be carrying a different aim on Monday. McDonald has said:
“Sinn Féin has consistently called for the North to be designated special status… Since the referendum, the Tory government has repeated their rhetoric of no hard border across Ireland and failed to bring forward a workable solution to how this would be achieved.
“Prime Minister May agreed principles to avoid a hard border in December. On Wednesday, she rejected her own deal. It is clear that the British Government approach to Brexit, once thought of as merely disorganised, has been exposed as destructive.”
22-23 March
There will be an EU summit in Brussels which will see Barnier given the mandate to negotiate.
Speaking this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he is preparing for this March European Council, which is expected to agree new Negotiation Guidelines.
“Progress on the Withdrawal Agreement published this week will be important in the context of that next phase of work.”
Advertisement
Over the two days, the European Council, in an EU 27 format, will “review the state of the negotiations following the United Kingdom’s notification of its intention to leave the EU and adopt additional guidelines”.
Those additional guidelines will be added to the draft text which was published on Wednesday and will focus on the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
After the European Council and European Parliament (particularly its Brexit Steering Group) has their say on the Withdrawal Agreement, it will be “transmitted to the UK for negotiation”.
The UK doesn’t have any similar document, other than May’s three keynote speeches given over the past 18 months.
Over these seven months, UK and EU negotiators will work to reach a deal on the terms of the UK’sorderlyexit from the Union.
Remember, discussions about their future relationship can only be done in framework terms, rather than in real, legal deals. Those agreements can only be made in full once Britain has left completely.
The EU has set a ‘by October’ deadline for it to agree with the UK a final legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. That is so it can be ratified by the European Parliament, the Council and the UK.
This is Barnier’s plan:
The European Parliament must give its consent, by a vote of simple majority, including Members of the European Parliament from the UK. The Council will conclude the agreement, acting by a qualified majority representing 72% of the 27 Member States, i.e. 20 Member States representing 65% of the EU27 population. The UK must also ratify the agreement then, again according to its own constitutional arrangements.
18-19 October
As per the above, its hoped that a final draft of the agreement will be ready for this EU summit in Brussels.
It needs to be done as early as this (remember, the UK leaves on 30 March 2019, which is five months from this date) so that countries can get the required sign off from their parliaments about the EU-UK economic package.
13-14 December
There will be another EU summit in Brussels which could act as a cushion if everything isn’t in place by 18 to 19 October.
But, these deadlines would be getting extremely tight if that is the case.
21-22 March 2019
There are no details for this EU Council meeting as yet. And you’d need a seriously good crystal ball to be able to predict what will be discussed. Definitely one to mark in the diary though.
30 March 2019
The UK leaves the European Union. Deal or no deal.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has hit back at critics of her handling of Brexit, writing in the Sunday Telegraph that she had “proven the doubters wrong” after securing an interim deal.
Pressure lifted on the embattled leader after she struck a deal with the European Union over Britain’s divorce terms on Friday, enabling talks to turn to the country’s future trading relationship after months of fraught negotiations.
“We have proven the doubters wrong and are making progress towards a successful exit from the EU,” she wrote in the centre-right broadsheet, calling the agreement “a watershed” in negotiations.
“Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job,” she added. “We will not be derailed from this fundamental duty to deliver the democratic will of the British people.”
The prime minister said it was important to work out the exact terms of an implementation period, designed to soften the effects of Brexit after the March 2019 leave date, “as soon as possible… to provide invaluable certainty for employers.”

She also played down fears of Brexit voters that Britain would end up being bound by EU rules, insisting that the country would regain “control of our borders, and set our own laws”.
However, prominent Brexit campaigners in her own cabinet appeared concerned that Britain would be restricted by EU rules during the transition period, which is expected to last for around two years.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the Sunday Times that Britain risked becoming a “vassal state” of Europe if it did not fully leave the jurisdiction of European courts or the customs union, which would prevent it from striking trade deals with other countries.
His comments came shortly after finance minister Philip Hammond said Britain would “effectively replicate the status quo” during the transition period, highlighting May’s task in uniting her cabinet ahead of the second phase of negotiations.
She also faces battles with her own MPs, 11 of whom rebelled last week to deliver the government a damaging parliamentary defeat on the bill that will enshrine Brexit into domestic law
A BMG Research poll for The Independent newspaper on 51% of Britons now favoured staying in the EU compared with 41% who backed Brexit, the widest margin since the June 2016 vote — although the poll was carried out before the interim deal was announced.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fisheries-brexit-3496589-Jul2017/,"IT’S BEEN MORE than a year since the UK voted to leave the European Union, and for a while, it wasn’t clear what kind of split that would be.
Despite British Prime Minister Theresa May’s promises that she wanted to keep relations between Britain and Ireland close in the wake of Brexit, and that she wishes to avoid a hard border in the North, the announcements so far have hinted at a ‘hard’ Brexit.
Already, the UK have publicly announced their intention:
The final one is quite significant – announced as Brexit talks began, it showed that the UK fully intended to assert their “take back control” mantra in relation to their waters – even if it could adversely affect their own industry.
The London Fisheries Convention allows other EU countries to fish in the 6-12 nautical mile zone off the coast of countries, and allows neighbouring countries to fish in the 0-6 mile zone (such as Northern Ireland and the Republic).
Michael Gove said that it was time the UK ""takes back control"" of its waters.Dominic Lipinski via PA ImagesDominic Lipinski via PA Images
When the announcement was made by UK environment secretary Michael Gove, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed called it “unhelpful and unwelcome”.
In committee this week Creed acknowledged that Brexit poses a “very specific threat over and above those common to most other sectors”.
“In fact, if we no longer have access to the UK waters, or we see a significant drop in our quotas, the trade implications will be the least of our problems,” he told the committee, saying that the UK had made “no secret” of their desire for a hard Brexit.
Did we get a heads-up?
The UK government did tell Ireland in advance – through our British embassy.
The week before the announcement, Creed told Gove about the importance of long established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected after Brexit.

He had previously discussed fisheries issues with UK secretary George Eustice, and twice with Gove’s predecessor Andrea Leadsom.
Despite those efforts to maintain cohesion, the UK verbally notified Ireland of its intention to withdraw via the British Embassy in Dublin – two days before the UK’s public announcement on Friday 30 June, a spokesperson said.
That leaves Ireland in a tricky position to safeguard its fishing industry - on average, 34% of Irish landings are taken from UK waters.
For our largest fishery, mackerel, 64% is taken in UK waters, and our second biggest fishery, prawns, 43% is taken in UK waters.
The Irish government are also in the process of passing an amendment that would allow the government to comply with the Convention. Currently, there’s no provision in law to allow boats from Northern Ireland to fish in Ireland’s 0-6 mile-belt.
The government has fought hard for this provision – both in the Seanad and in the courts – but will now reconsider their position following the UK’s announcement.

Although the Convention only concerns the 0-12 nautical mile belt off the coast, there are concerns about the influx of boats to Irish shores should the UK continue to “lift the drawbridge on its waters” as Creed himself put it.
So what Britain are saving?
It mightn’t be all that much – but it’s hard to measure.
In the aftermath of the announcement, the UK’s environment, food and rural affairs secretary George Eustice told Sky News that although overseas vessels caught just over 10,000 tonnes of fish in the 6-12 nautical mile zone that the Convention concerns, British vessels catch a relatively small amount in EU waters.
He said that out to 200 nautical miles, access for foreign vessels is for up to 700,000 tonnes of fish; “there’s a huge imbalance here, because we only fish about 150,000 tonnes in other people’s waters.”
Creed said however that it would be “hard for the UK to ignore the fact that they rely on the EU for 70% of their seafood exports”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-border-solution-leo-3519923-Jul2017/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that Ireland will not participate in any British plans to solve the post-Brexit border issue.
He was responding to reported proposals to move the border to the Irish Sea.
Speaking to journalists today, Varadkar said that he and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney were “on the same page” on the issue.
Varadkar said that it was up to the UK to put forward solutions for the handling of the border between north and south in a post-Brexit world.
“Currently there is no economic border. There hasn’t been an economic border since 1992. As far as this government is concerned there shouldn’t be an economic border. We don’t want one,” he said.
“It’s the United Kingdom, it’s Britain that has decided to leave and if they want to put forward smart solutions, technological solutions for borders of the future and all of that that’s up to them.
Advertisement
“We’re not going to be doing that work for them because we don’t think there should be an economic border at all. That is our position. It’s our position in negotiations with the British Government and it’s the very clear position that we have when we engage with the task force that is negotiating on our behalf with the United Kingdom.”
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Varadkar went on to say that the government’s position is that there should be no border, so it will not help in designing one.
“So let them put forward their proposals as to how they think a border should operate and then we’ll ask them if they really think this is such a good idea because I think it will have a very severe impact on their economy if they decide to go down that route.”
DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr said that Varadkar’s stance was “cutting off his nose to spite his face”.
Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly backed the Taoiseach, saying that his party has been calling for this solution.
“The solution which Minister Coveney, and now the Taoiseach, has outlined is something which Fianna Fáil has been calling for some time. In February, I along with Micheál Martin and Darragh O’Brien met with the Northern Secretary James Brokenshire and outlined to him that a frictionless border simply wouldn’t work and the border between Ireland and the UK should be the Irish Sea.
“It is important that we have an honest conversation with our UK neighbours, and despite coming late to the table on this issue, I am relieved that the Government now appears willing to start that conversation.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/tony-connelly-dup-brexit-3752443-Dec2017/,"WHEN TONY CONNELLY, RTÉ’s Europe Editor, tweeted about a draft agreement between Britain, Ireland and the EU on the Northern Irish border, he knew his information was solid.
But what he didn’t realise was that this tweet, and his subsequent article, would lead to the DUP putting a major spanner in the works.
Theresa May was having lunch with Jean Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, to discuss that very deal during the first phase of Brexit talks when she stopped to call Arlene Foster, the DUP leader.
Foster was not happy.
That phone call showed May that the DUP did not want the deal, as they saw it, to go ahead.
Earlier that day, Connelly and RTÉ had felt they were secure in sharing the information he had received from sources. Reflecting on what happened, Connelly can see why the DUP acted the way it did.
“We were very careful in the way we wrote the story but I think the DUP were so neurotic at that stage about the whole process, the moment they saw RTÉ running a story then they obviously felt that’s it: Dublin is claiming victory.”
The DUP now felt betrayed, and that the Irish government was victorious. And that may have repercussions for the future.
“There is bad blood now between Varadkar and Coveney and the DUP so I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of more trouble,” he said. With the Brexit divorce process to take years (it just moved onto the second phase of talks on the 15 December), and the DUP propping up May’s Tory government, this is significant.

The Irish text is part of an overall joint paper entitled The Joint Report from the Commission and the United Kingdom Negotiators on Progess. It's 4-5 pages long, covering citizens rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border.
The tweet came on a day when May was meeting with Jean Claude Juncker about future arrangements about the Irish border after Brexit. While the pair were in talks, the tweet was sent – and it basically set out the details of a draft agreement in which it was said there would be no “regulatory divergence” on the island of Ireland in relation to the single market and customs union after Brexit.
In other words: a soft border.
But the key word that seems to have drawn the DUP’s ire was ‘concede’. And with the DUP effectively propping up Theresa May’s Tory government, the party was able to immediately scupper talks by taking a stand against the agreement.
Connelly brought us back to the day itself, when he ended up becoming a central figure in one of Europe’s biggest news stories.
After Donald Tusk set a deadline of 4 December for the British government to come up with solutions on the border and citizens’ rights, Connelly was “really trying to find out what was going on”.
There were talks going on between Britain and the EU and the Irish.

“It was very, very hard to get information because it was so sensitive,” recalled Connelly.
It was “impossible to get any good sense of where this was going”. The new Tánaiste Simon Coveney appeared on Morning Ireland on the Monday morning, and he “sounded quite downbeat”.
Connelly kept pushing his sources for more information.
I agree Twitter is unpredictable, but newspaper reports are also overtaken by events. All RTE reporting incl Tweets stressed this was a draft. It was newsworthy as it was by no means clear the UK wd accept any concepts re ""no regulatory divergence"" or ""continued reg alignment.""— Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE)December 5, 2017Tony Connelly/ Twitter
I agree Twitter is unpredictable, but newspaper reports are also overtaken by events. All RTE reporting incl Tweets stressed this was a draft. It was newsworthy as it was by no means clear the UK wd accept any concepts re ""no regulatory divergence"" or ""continued reg alignment.""
Finally, they came through. “One source said they had seen the text [on the agreement] over the weekend and was able to convey to me what was in the key Irish paragraph,” he said.
It was decided the story was good to go. The RTÉ story was put out at 11.15am, 15 minutes after the Irish government had been contacted by Juncker saying the agreement was squared between Britain, Ireland and the EU.
“So at that stage nobody knew the difference between those ideas – I couldn’t see a huge difference. We felt confident then to put out the story on the website and I tweeted the first line and four minutes later tweeted the second line,” said Connelly.
“The trouble is the way it was conveyed to me by the source was this was quite a concession to the UK.”
This was particularly important following the leaked paper in November where the reaction to the idea of Northern Ireland being in a single market customs union “was so violent”, said Connelly.
The UK side “did seem like they really were talking conceding on this point”.
“But the trouble is when that tweet went out it was just about the time the DUP were in London trying to find out what was going on in the text,” said Connelly. “And when they saw the tweet they assumed it was the Irish government briefing in a triumphant way and the Irish government was victorious. That threw everything in the air and they threw the spanner.”
Does he think that things would have been different without his story?
“I think they could have rejected it anyway because they never were on board with either phrase. I was being blamed for scuppering the talks,” he said.
What about how it was handled by British PM Theresa May?
“I think in a sense Theresa May faced them down – that was the way it was presented. They weren’t happy with the new text, I think Theresa May said I have to do this it’s in the national interest; we have no choice here. I think she faced them down once – it makes it difficult to make them hold them to ransom next time.”
Connelly even ended up having to face down accusations that the leak was Irish government propaganda, with the Guardian’s Brexit correspondent Lisa O’Carroll saying that his leak didn’t come from within the Irish government.
2/2 RTE Brussels correspondent@tconnellyRTEhas said while RTE protects its sources he is happy to source his leak to ""two other"" contacts, not in Irish govt. His story went live at 11.15am yest - 15m after Juncker had called Taoiseach to say text had been agreed.— Lisa O'Carroll (@lisaocarroll)December 5, 2017lisa o'carroll/ Twitter

In aninterviewafterwards, Connelly said that reports said that what spooked the DUP was his report on RTÉ news on the text.
“First of all, RTÉ protects its sources very carefully and we do not reveal sources, but I am comfortable in saying that this was not a leak by any means from the Irish government, this came from two other non-Irish sources,” he added.
The DUP, not being in the room with Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker, must have felt it was only getting the full story online. It was a case of those reporting the news becoming the news – but also how closely political parties pay attention to what’s going on on social media and in online reporting.
And with more talks to come, it’s perhaps an example of, when it comes to Brexit, the next few years are going to be a very interesting ride.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-3724541-Nov2017/,"THE POLITICAL WRANGLING and back and forth over the fate of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit is heating up, with the issue one of crucial importance to negotiations progressing.
The Irish government wants guarantees from the UK government around the border. That there will be no so-called “hard border” with regulatory checks on goods and people passing between the two countries.
This is a sticking point for Ireland, with political parties here more or less united on the issue. The other EU state members are backing Ireland on this.
The UK – for its part – wants to leave the EU customs union and the single market, but also doesn’t want a hard border. However, so far these positions have been irreconcilable.
The UK wants to progress negotiations to crucial issues of trade deals after Brexit, arguing that the border issues will be ironed out as these negotiations progress.
It is seeking to offer more vaguely-worded commitments and guarantees to Ireland around the issues, so that it will be able to move onto trade following a crucial EU summit on 15 December.

However, the Irish government is looking for firmer commitments. Essentially, it wants no divergence to the free movement and cross-border cooperation specifically for Northern Ireland.
The UK government will find this difficult to sell to the DUP, on whom it relies to stay in power.
An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to meet with European Council President Donald Tusk tomorrow, but it is not thought the issue will be resolved by then.
Ireland’s EU commissioner Phil Hogansaid yesterdaythat the UK was “very close” to an agreement on its Brexit bill. WhileThe Guardian reportedthat a solution to the border issue was near.
Speaking yesterday on BBC’s Newsnight, Ireland’s Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said Ireland had put forward what it wanted, and now it was time for the UK to come up with a reasonable offer.
“What’s clearly incumbent on Theresa May and her government and her negotiating team is to articulate an alternative which doesn’t give rise to a hard border because everybody is agreed that we do not want a hard border,” he said.
Other key issues preventing the progression of negotiations is the fate of EU citizens in the UK and the final financial settlement that the UK will have to pay.

BRITAIN’S HOME OFFICE sent deportation warnings to around 100 EU citizens by mistake, it emerged today, an incident that campaigners said would increase fears among Europeans living in Britain.
Eva Johanna Holmberg, a Finnish historian at Queen Mary University of London specialising in the study of early modern Britain, was one of the recipients.
Holmberg said she received the Home Office letter last week, telling her that if she did not leave the country within a month then the ministry would have to give “directions for removal”.
The letter said Holmberg, who is married to a Briton and has lived in Britain for years, was now “a person liable to be detained under the Immigration Act”.
“I could not believe my eyes,” Holmberg told the BBC today, saying that she had contacted a lawyer to ask if she could appeal against deportation.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
But after her case prompted a furore, the Home Office was forced to apologise for the mistake today.

“We have spoken to Ms Holmberg to apologise for this and assure her that she can remain in the UK,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman said around 100 similar letters were sent.
“We are contacting everyone who received this letter to clarify that they can disregard it,” he said.
Britain is in negotiations with the European Union over the future status of European nationals living in Britain and Britons in the EU after Brexit.
Immigration was a top issue for the Brexit campaign and Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to cut the number of EU nationals moving to Britain.
“This is shameful stuff,” said James McGrory, head of the pro-EU campaign group Open Britain.
“It’s little wonder that many EU citizens feel worried about their future status in the UK when they hear of people with every right to be here getting letters threatening their deportation,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-scenario-3849849-Feb2018/,"Ireland's growth would be less in any Brexit scenarioDepartment of Business, Enterprise and InnovationDepartment of Business, Enterprise and Innovation
THE IRISH ECONOMY will grow by 7% less than it would have without Brexit in the worst-case scenario and by 2.8% less in the best-case scenario, according to a new report published by the government.
The independent study by Copenhagen Economics examined the impact to Ireland from Brexit under a number of potential outcomes.
Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphries said that the study “underlines the importance of a satisfactory transition period and exit deal”.
She did, however, stress that this report was based on the government not making a number of policy decisions to try to mitigate the effects.
Impact
The report looked at the impact of Brexit from four different scenarios.
The first was an EEA scenario, where a deal is struck between the EU and the UK like the deals between the EU and Norway, and Iceland. This scenario would see largely duty-free trade between Ireland and the EU.
Under this scenario, Ireland’s economy will grow by 2.8% less by 2030 than it would have if the UK remained in the EU.
In the Customs Union scenario, duty-free trade exists on a number of fronts, but there is a higher risk of regulatory divergence for goods and services. In this scenario, GDP growth is 4.3% less than it would have been without Brexit.
In a free trade agreement scenario, the impact is the same as customs posts and border inspections will hit growth.

The worst case is a WTO scenario, where it is assumed that trade will be governed by World Trade Organisation rules.
The report says: “In this case, the UK and the EU will impose MFN tariffs on each other’s goods where these are not bound by existing plurilateral agreements or arrangements… As in the previous scenarios, the introduction of border inspections add customs costs.”
Under this arrangement, the growth of the Irish economy would be 7% less than it would have been without Brexit.
This compares to the economic crash of 2008/9 where the Irish economy took a hit of over 8% to its GDP.
Taking a hit
The report says that Brexit will “also impact Irish wages negatively for all skill groups”.
“In the WTO scenario, our results show that real wages will be 8.7% below the 2030 non-Brexit baseline level for low skilled workers, while the equivalent negative effect for high skilled workers will be 6.5%,” it says.
Certain sectors will bear the brunt of the negative effect, with agri-food, pharma-chemicals, electrical machinery, wholesale and retail, and air transport set to account for 90% of the impact of Brexit.
The report adds that some domestic policies could be pursued as an opportunity from Brexit, “notwithstanding the fact that the overall impact of Brexit will be negative for Ireland”.
Humphreys said: “We are acutely aware that certain sectors are particularly exposed to Brexit. That is why, among other supports, we will be rolling out a new €300m Brexit Loan Scheme in late March, which will be open to all sectors, with at least 40% of low-interest loans being made available to the agri-food sector.”
She said a number of government initiatives would attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on the Irish economy, as per the recommendations in the report.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ian-paisley-brexit-3724650-Nov2017/,"DUP MP IAN Paisley Jr has said that Northern Ireland shouldn’t remain in the customs union or have a “special status” after Brexit.
He also said that, while he respected Ireland’s position, the country “would be better off” leaving the EU, adding that “we could do an awful lot more together”.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Paisley Jr said that all of the UK would be leaving the customs’ union and single market but that didn’t mean that border posts would be necessary.
Paisley Jr also said that it was in Ireland’s interests for Britain to get a good deal because it’s such a close trade ally.
“Let’s get on with getting a good Brexit,” he said adding that the Irish government was spreading “doom and gloom” about the post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland.

In the Brexit referendum, a majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. The DUP, however, advocated a leave vote and is now propping up the Conservative government in Westminster.
In recent weeks, Leo Varadkar’s government has said that it is up to Britain to come up with border solutions and that the next round of Brexit talks should not take place until that solution is found.
In response, British politicians have been sharply critical of the Irish position. Last night,the BBC reportedthat the UK was planning to take a “carrot and stick approach” with the government here.
Speaking today, Paisley Jr accused the Irish government of wanting to put up customs posts between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
He said: “It’d be silly. We hope that the common travel area will remain in place. We don’t want to destroy that, we want to encourage that.”
Paisley Jr added that trying to prevent a part of the UK leaving the EU would “reflect very badly” on the Irish government.
“The focus now is on negotiations that will get us all a good Brexit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-explainer-3844594-Feb2018/,"IN DECEMBER, TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar said that “we have the assurances and guarantees we need from the UK on the Irish issues” when it comes to Brexit.
He said that there had been a“cast iron” guaranteefor no border separating Ireland and Northern Ireland. The securing of this guarantee for the Irish government allowed the talks to move to the next stage.
December’s deal promised “full alignment” with the EU single market and customs union rules that are crucial to the Good Friday Agreement.
The UK has, however, remained steadfast in its commitment to leave both the single market and customs union after Brexit.
And, yesterday, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that it was “important to tell the truth” and that the UK leaving the single market and customs union “will mean border checks in Ireland”.

.@MichelBarnier: It is important to tell the truth. The UK leaving the single market and customs union will mean border checks in Ireland.
So, what’s happened since this “cast iron” guarantee? Is the possibility of a hard border now back on the table?
A common mantra from UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been “Brexit means Brexit”. The problem is no one actually knows definitively what that means, beyond the UK leaving the EU.
Factions within the ruling Conservative Party disagree – while being propped up by hard Brexit advocates the DUP – but officially Number 10 has said that it doesn’t want to be part of the customs union or single market post-Brexit.
These arrangements provide for the trading of goods across European countries without restrictions or tariffs. As goods travelling from outside into this union are subject to restrictions and tariffs, a border must be crossed to bring these into the EU.
This, of course, raises the prospect of a hard border needing to be established between Northern Ireland and Ireland when the UK leaves the EU.

For countries outside the EU, negotiations are held between that country and the EU for what arrangements they will have.
While the UK says it wants out of this, it instead wants a “highly-streamlined customs arrangement” or a “new customs partnership with the EU”.
At the time of the December deal, the term “alignment” was used frequently by both sides. A “regulatory alignment” would allow the UK to still conduct its affairs with EU member states in a similar manner to how it does now, but that appears incompatible with the desire to leave the current customs arrangements.
That deal contained the following lines: “The United Kingdom remains committed to protecting North-South cooperation and to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border. Any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements.
So the UK plans to leave the customs union but has committed – albeit in a non-binding manner – to find the solutions to prevent a hard border. Northern Ireland will need to, in effect, stay within the single market and customs union in some shape or form to prevent a hard border.
Talks on how this can be done are currently happening between the two negotiating teams in Brussels.
Yesterday, Michel Barnier was talking tough on the Northern Ireland border issues. He stated it was “important to tell the truth” that border checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland would be “unavoidable” if the UK left the single market and the customs union.
Translating the December deal into a proper legal agreement is proving especially difficult on the Northern Irish issue.

“The UK has committed to proposing specific solutions to the unique issue of Ireland. We are waiting for such solutions,” said Barnier at yesterday’s press conference.
Barnier added that the eventual deal would contain an emergency option which states that if Britain fails to find a special solution for Northern Ireland, the UK would remain in “full alignment” with the EU on trade issues to ease the border impact.
Barnier (right) has urged the UK to offer its solutions.Monasse Thierry / AND/ABACAMonasse Thierry / AND/ABACA / AND/ABACA
He also said that time is now “very short” to find these solutions.
Britain has asked the EU if, in the transition period after it officially leaves the EU in March 2019, it could remain part of the customs union and single market for a period of almost two years.
In a position paper this week, it said: “The UK view is that the best approach would be for the parties to confirm that, for the duration of the implementation period, these agreements continue to apply to the UK and that the UK is to be treated in the same way as EU member states.”
So, even when it leaves the EU, the UK is asking to be treated the same as other member states for almost two years.
In light of this request Barnier is seeking answers, including answers on Northern Ireland.
“The time has come to make choices, and we await with great interest the choices,” he said.
In December, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that his government “got the guarantees and assurances we needed… we protected what we wanted to protect”.
He said that Ireland and the EU would abide by that deal, and that he had no reason to believe that the UK will back out of it either.
In the Dáil this week, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney echoed Barnier and said that it would be very difficult if the UK leaves the single market and customs union in an “absolute way”.
He said: “I and many others have called for clarity from the British Government as soon as possible as that would make it far easier for the EU negotiating team to plan for the structured negotiations that need to take place in the future.
Coveney added that no conclusions could be drawn until the British government provides clarity in what it is seeking.
The UK government has offered a guarantee that it would arrive at a solution to avoid a hard border in the event no deal is reached with the EU.
Now, the EU wants the details on how exactly it will do this.
With barely 13 months left until it leaves, the UK appears to be drawing the ire of the EU for this perceived lack of detail it is providing.
As a result, Barnier and the EU are adopting a tough stance in a bid to get these details as soon as possible.
This guarantee is not legally binding. And if it is announced that Northern Ireland will remain in the single market post-Brexit, Theresa May will be facing into a showdown with the anti-Europe Brexiteers in her own party and the party keeping her in government, the DUP.
Such conflict within the British government could throw further doubts on the border issue going forward.
The UK guaranteed no hard border when it leaves the EU but, with time running out, everyone is looking to them for answers on how it can be done.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-may-3814590-Jan2018/,"
BREXIT SECRETARY DAVID Davis has insisted today that he expects the UK to reach agreement on the terms of a transition deal for leaving the European Union “before the end of March”.
The UK is set to officially leave the EU in March 2019, but plans to abide by many of the EU’s rules for around two years to make the transition more orderly.
Davis said that Britain and the EU should have agreed the “substantive” terms of their permanent future relationship by March 2019.
But the structure of the transition deal, which is expected to run until 2020/21, is the cause of heated debate.
“I would expect it before the end of March,” Davis told a parliamentary committee when asked when the terms of the transition deal would be agreed.
The minister said a transition deal was essential to give governments and businesses time to adapt to the future arrangement.
Davis said that during this period, “we will be replicating to a very large extent the operations of the single market and customs union” and that the UK would remain subject to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
Brexit supporters from Davis’s own Conservative party criticised the plans, saying Britain would be a “vassal state” of the EU during this period.

“If on 30 March 2019, the UK is subject to the ECJ, takes new rules relating to the single market and is paying into the European budget, are we not a vassal state?” asked MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.
Citizens rights ‘moral issue’
Davis replied that in the future Britain would no longer be bound by the rules of membership of the EU’s custom union that are currently preventing it from negotiating trade deals with nations outside the EU.
However, he did admit that this issue could be a sticking point in upcoming negotiations on the transition deal and that Britain would probably have to abide by new rules handed down by the EU during the transition, without having a say on them.
He also revealed that Britain would continue paying into the EU during the transition period, potentially before all the details of the final deal have been agreed, but stressed that Britain would not pay to access the single market as part of the permanent deal.
Davis moved to calm fears of EU citizens living in Britain, saying they would be taken care of even if Britain crashed out without a deal.
“One way or another we will resolve this issue. I’d say to anyone who is worried about this issue: don’t be,” he said, calling it a “moral issue”.
Representatives from Britain’s Brexit department have been meeting with EU officials in Brussels in recent weeks, said Davis, but formal negotiations will restart in March.
British MPs gave the green light last week to a landmark Brexit bill that will transfer four decades of EU rules onto the British statute books, although it faces a battle in passing the upper House of Lords.","3.31pm, 24 Jan 2018",

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-trade-deal-brexit-macron-3807771-Jan2018/,"FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has suggested the UK could get a special trade deal with the European Union after Brexit.
However, he warned that Britain would not be able to have full access to the single market without accepting the EU’s rules.
In an interview withBBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Macron said that the UK cannot “cherry-pick” the elements of the EU it likes.
He said that that the UK should not gain access to the single market without accepting its “preconditions”. These include budget contributions, freedom of movement within the EU and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
Macron’s comments came during his first UK visit since becoming French president, during which he held talks with Prime Minister Theresa May.
When he was questioned on whether there should be a bespoke special solution for Britain, Macron said: “Sure, but this special way should be consistent with the preservation of the single market and our collective interests.
He said that as soon as a country decides not to join the EU preconditions, then it cannot be considered full access.

“There should be no cherry-picking in the single market because that’s a dismantling of the single market,” he said.
“What is important is to not make people believe that it is possible to [have your cat and eat it].”
Financial deal
During the interview, Macron said access to the EU just for the UK’s financial services sector was “not feasible” if the UK won’t accept the conditions of the single market.
He did, however, stress that he does not want to “unplug” the city from the EU.
“It doesn’t make sense because it’s part of the whole financing of our European Union,” Macron said.
I do respect this vote, I do regret this vote, and I would love to welcome you again.
“It’s a mistake when you just ask yes or no when you don’t ask people how to improve the situation and explain how to improve it,” he said.
Theresa May has repeatedly made it clear that the UK government does not wish to remain in the single market. She has, however, noted that a comprehensive trade deal covering goods and services is in the interest of both the UK and EU.
