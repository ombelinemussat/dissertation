BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May bowed to pressure from eurosceptics in her ruling Conservative Party by agreeing to a series of amendments to a bill setting up a new customs regime after Brexit.
Downing Street confirmed the climbdown, which accepts changes tabled by Jacob Rees-Mogg and other hardline Brexiteer MPs that appear to stymie May’s own favoured plans, ahead of a potentially-crippling parliamentary defeat on the proposed legislation late this evening.
“I’m happy to sit down and listen and hear concerns from my colleagues,” the prime minister told lawmakers.
“We did that on the EU withdrawal bill and we continue to do that on other bills,” she added, referring to a landmark law passed last month enacting key parts of Brexit.
The compromise on the latest legislation – the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, also known as the customs bill – was immediately criticised by pro-European MPs.
Anna Soubry, a vocal proponent of keeping close ties with the EU, told parliament: “One has to wonder now who’s in charge in this country?
“These are people who do not want a responsible Brexit,” she added of the hardliners in her own party.
Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, had earlier warned May had no choice but to change course.
“The inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it to keep the party united,” he told BBC television.

Second referendum support
The latest wrangling comes as the prime minister struggles to win acceptance for her Brexit strategy – unveiled in a much-anticipated policy paper last week – from both pro-Brexit and pro-EU factions within her party and parliament.
Brexiteer critics believe it keeps Britain too close to the EU, while pro-Europeans think it fails to protect Britain’s dominant services sector, among other gripes.
Two top pro-Brexit ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, quit in protest last week followed by a string of junior walkouts, including another today.
Davis, the former Brexit secretary, warned in the Financial Times it would deny the government the “freedom to run our own economy”.
Meanwhile, a pro-EU former minister described May’s plans as a “fudge” and became the most senior member of May’s Conservative party to back the idea of holding a second EU referendum.
Former education secretary Justine Greening said the plans to follow EU rules on trade in goods without being able to influence them was “the worst of both worlds”.
Noting the deep divisions in government and parliament on the way forward, she said voters must now decide.
“The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,” she wrote in an article in The Times.
May has repeatedly ruled out a second referendum, after Britons voted by 52-48 percent for Brexit in 2016, but Greening’s support for a so-called People’s Vote will give the campaign a huge boost.

THE EU IS willing to strike an “ambitious” deal with post-Brexit Britain far beyond any agreements the bloc has made with other countries in the past, the European Union’s top negotiator has said.
“We are ready… to propose a partnership like there has never been before with any other third country,” Michel Barnier told a Berlin press conference alongside German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.
Such a deal could include “an ambitious free trade agreement” as well as cooperation in the areas of aviation, security and foreign policy.
But he warned that any agreement had to respect “the four pillars” of the EU’s cherished single market – the free movement of people, goods, services and capital.
“Single market means single market,” Barnier said.

With just seven months to go until Britain formally quits the EU, talks between Brussels and London on the exit terms have stalled.
Last week, British finance minister Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit could have “large fiscal consequences” on productivity and borrowing.
British Prime Minister Theresa May later sought to downplay the worst-case outcome, saying that a no-deal Brexit wouldn’t be “a walk in the park but it wouldn’t be the end of the world”.
British lawmakers are split on May’s proposals to keep Britain close to the EU on trade – parts of which have already been rejected by Brussels.
London and Brussels hope to strike an agreement by October, to allow its ratification by the European and British parliaments before the 29 March 2019 divorce date.
The EU’s Barnier said earlier this month that if solutions could be found to the outstanding issues, “I am sure we can build a future partnership between the EU and the United Kingdom that is unprecedented in scope and depth”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-horror-4404103-Dec2018/,"BRITISH BUSINESSES HAVE warned that they are reaching the “point of no return” as they must put significant time and money into preparing for a no-deal Brexit as chaos continues to reign in Westminster.
“Businesses have been watching in horror as politicians have focused on factional disputes rather than practical steps,” the British Chambers of Commerce said in a statement this morning.
It comes as the UK is due to leave the EU in 100 days’ time.
The EU is set to announce a slew of notices today on how a Brexit no-deal will affect a range of sectors today, as preparations ramp up from the Europe-side.
These proposals could see the European Commission proposing legislation to ensure flights can still arrive in EU airports from the UK, even though a no-deal scenario would see Britain outside the single aviation space,RTÉ reported.
Separately today, the British government is set to publish a series of planning notices on Brexit today, as parliament remains deadlocked with the vote on Theresa May’s deal with the EU not taking place until next month.
Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to announce a new skills-based immigration to “get control over our borders,”the BBC reported. The system would scrap the cap on high-skilled workers like doctors and engineers.

According tothe Times of London, a document that was leaked to them indicate that the government is being told to prepare in the event of a no-deal for a rise in “homelessness, poverty and suicide”.
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancocktold BBC Newsnightthat there were plans to store six weeks of stockpiled medicines for the NHS in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Prime Minister May cancelled a vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal last week after it became clear it wouldn’t be passed by parliament.
Pressed by the opposition this week, she said that it would now be held in January just a few weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU.
‘This is not where we should be’
In its statement, the British Chambers of Commerce expressed dismay at the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
“With just 100 days to go, the suggestion that ‘no-deal’ can be ‘managed’ is not a credible proposition,” it said.
It called on MPs to listen to its constituents and ensure a deal is reached.
“This is not where we should be,” it added. “We hope that they will listen and remember that when they return to parliament, the future course of our economy will be in their hands.”

The term ‘gammon’ is being used to describe the complexion of angry middle-aged white people.
The bacon-based insult was popularised by younger voters during the 2017 UK general election to describe a red-faced white male, usually ranting about Brexit and immigrants.
Gammon has since taken over the UK press, with analysis pieces appearing in most publications.
Huffington PostHuffington Post

Daily ExpressDaily Express
A recent article inThe Times UKclaims that it is supporters of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn using the term to attack middle-aged men.
The phrase is seen as a response by the left to the term ‘snowflake’, which describes an millennial who’s easily offended.
The gammon and snowflake clash has highlighted the division that still remains between the generations following the Brexit vote.

According to theBBC, gammon gained momentum as an insult in 2017, when a Twitter user posted a collage of contributors to the programme Question Time, with the phrase ‘Great Wall of Gammon’.

Since then many people in the UK have spoken out against the term, describing it as derogatory and even racist towards older white people.
Democratic Unionist Party MP Emma Little-Pengelly has backed the claims of racism, saying she was appalled by the used of the word.
I'm appalled by the term ""gammon"" now frequently entering the lexicon of so many (mainly on the left) & seemingly be accepted.

A MEMBER OF Theresa May’s government has resigned suddenly ahead of today’s key parliamentary debate on legislation regarding Britain’s departure from the European Union.
Conservative minister Phillip Lee, a prominent Remainer, resigned as justice minister so he could speak out against his party’s policy on Brexit.
He said that while he was sad to leave the government, he believed many big changes were needed to make the UK’s exit a success.
“If Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well; regardless of how long that takes,” he said.

May’s fragile government will be trying to defeat a rebellion by pro-EU lawmakers and reverse changes to its key piece of Brexit legislation as the matter comes before the House of Commons for two days of debate.
I am incredibly sad to have had to announce my resignation as a minister in Her Majesty’s Government so that I can better speak up for my constituents and country over how Brexit is currently being delivered.

May is resisting changes approved by the House of Lords that would soften Britain’s exit from the EU, because she says they will weaken the government’s negotiating position.
Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned Tory rebels that proposals to give parliament the power to direct negotiations with the EU are simply a tactic to overturn the results of the 2016 referendum that mandated Britain’s departure from the bloc.
Davis earlier told the BBC “that was the decision of the British people… and whatever we do, we’re not going to reverse that”.
Lee said that nonetheless, the present course raised questions of legitimacy because the end game was unclear.
“When the government is able to set out an achievable, clearly defined path – one that has been properly considered, whose implications have been foreseen, and that is rooted in reality and evidence, not dreams and dogma – it should go to the people, once again, to seek their confirmation,” he wrote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-brexit-spanish-veto-4355844-Nov2018/,"LAST UPDATE|23 Nov 2018

SPAIN’S PRIME MINISTER Pedro Sanchez warned today there would “very probably” be no summit to approve Britain’s exit from the European Union on Sunday if the issue of Gibraltar is not first resolved.
Madrid is seeking a guaranteed veto on post-Brexit relations between the EU and Gibraltar, the British enclave on Spain’s southern tip, and has threatened to scupper the draft Brexit deal if it doesn’t get its way.
“If there’s no agreement” over Gibraltar, Sanchez said at a press conference in Cuba, “there very probably won’t be a European Council” summit.
Earlier on Friday, Spanish officials in Brussels said Sanchez might not attend the summit if London fails to put into writing a promise that no future agreement between Britain and the EU that applies to Gibraltar can be signed without first being negotiated on a bilateral basis with Spain.
That would effectively give Spain the power of veto over any future relations between the EU and the 2.6 square mile (6.8 square kilometer) British territory on its southern tip.
Sanchez wouldn’t confirm that threat to skip the summit but said current “guarantees are not enough and so Spain maintains its veto on the Brexit deal.”

“If there’s an agreement, we’ll obviously go.”
An original clause in the deal Britain has drawn up with the EU gave Spain it’s guarantees, but that has since disappeared from the final draft.
Although the legal service of the EU Council has tried to reassure Spain that the current text does not preclude this, Madrid wants that veto power clearly spelled out.
“We have demanded that it be published by the British authorities before the European Council on Sunday,” Luis Marco Aguiriano Nalda, state secretary for European affairs, told reporters in Brussels.
Both British and EU negotiators said that the withdrawal agreement itself would not change at this stage, but in London a spokesman for the prime minister’s office had earlier said: “We will work with the governments of Gibraltar and Spain on our future relationship.”
Should EU leaders sign off on the deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May would still have to convince her own parliament to back it, something seen as a greater challenge.
“If this deal does not go through, we are back at square one. What we end up with is more division and more uncertainty,” said May.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-raab-brexit-deal-4315702-Oct2018/,"THE UK’S BREXIT negotiators need to step up their efforts if there is to be a Brexit deal in place next month, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.
Coveney was responding to, subsequently withdrawn, remarks from Britain’s Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, in which he said he believes that there could be a divorce deal in place by November 21. This evening Raab distanced himself from his remarks.
Raab made the comments in a letter to the House of Commons Brexit scrutiny committee, dated October 24 which was made public today.
“I would be happy to give evidence to the committee when a deal is finalised, and currently expect 21 November to be suitable,” Raab wrote in his letter.
However, he rowed back from the remarks this evening with his office releasing a statement saying that there was no set date for the negotiations to end and the November 21 date was simply the date that lawmakers proposed that he next appear before the Brexit committee.
When questioned by reporters in Paris this evening Coveney concurred with Raab’s earlier view. However, he warned that time was short and negotiators would have to signal the likelihood of a deal as early as next week.
“It is up to the British side in particular to intensify negotiations towards a deal,” he said.
He added that the UK would have to sign up to commitments it had made on the Irish backstop last December.

Most of the divorce deal is agreed but talks remain stuck on how to avoid new checks at the border after the UK leaves the single market and customs union.

Raab will visit Northern Ireland on Friday on a “fact-finding trip”, which will include meetings with local businesses and politicians, an official in his ministry told AFP.
EU leaders had mooted a special summit in mid-November to seal the Brexit deal, but warned earlier this month that this would not happen without more progress on the border issue.
In the letter last week Raab wrote: “The end is now firmly in sight and, while obstacles remain, it cannot be beyond us to navigate them.”

Oliver Robbins, Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief Brexit advisor, refused to repeat the date of November 21, only repeating that “we wish to conclude the deal as quickly as possible”.
Previously, he had said the government was pressing for a deal this autumn.
British officials are keen to avoid the negotiations dragging on, with Brexit day scheduled for March 29 next year.
Separately, Raab’s predecessor David Davis, who quit over the government’s approach to Brexit in July, said the final deal will likely pass when it comes to a vote in the House of Commons.
Davis is among a large minority of May’s Conservative MPs who strongly oppose her strategy, raising fears the deal will be rejected.
“The fear of no deal, I think…. that will win and there will be a deal,” Davis told an event yesterday evening, according to Sky News.
Today he retracted his reported remarks saying that any deal similar to May’s current plan of close economic ties with the EU “will not pass the Commons”.

While the right to peaceful protest must be respected, people are entitled to “go about their day without fear of violence, disorder or disruption,” police said.
The “Brexit Betrayal” will see protestors marching in a demonstration backed by controversial far-right activist Tommy Robinson and organised by UKIP.
Over 1,000 people have signed up to a Facebook event for the march, which says the protest will express “the strength of feeling amongst leavers despite the torrent of anti-Brexit propaganda we have been exposed to for almost two-and-a-half years”.

A counter march and rally planned by “Oppose Tommy Robinson in London” and “United Against Fascism and Racism” is also set to take place on Sunday.
Conditions have been imposed on both sets of rallies, with participants set to be confined to certain streets depending on which march they’re part of.
All members of the “Brexit Betrayal” rally are only allowed assembly in Parliament Street to the south of police barriers, the Met said.
The opposing marchers, meanwhile, must only assemble in Whitehall, north of police barriers.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: “Experience has shown us that when groups with conflicting views come together it can create tension and disorder, not just on the day itself but in the longer term.

THERESA MAY has vowed to fight a motion of confidence in her leadership, after members of the Conservative Party reached a threshold to trigger a ballot yesterday.
The chairman of the party’s backbench 1922 committee Graham Brady confirmed this morning that at least 48 Conservative MPs had written to him calling for a vote on the motion.
It comes two daysafter May announced the deferral of a House of Commons voteon her EU withdrawal agreement.
Reports from the UK are now suggesting that May will step down before any election – though this hasn’t been confirmed by May herself.

Breaking:@theresa_mayto step down before election: clear pitch to her potential enemies tonight, especially leadership wannabes, to back off and let her finish Brexit. ""This vote isn't about who leads the party into the next election,"" her spokesman says.
A spokesman for the Department for the Taoiseach toldTheJournal.iethat a scheduled meeting between Leo Varadkar and May today would not take place.
The spokesman added that it was not known whether the meeting would be rescheduled if May survived tonight’s vote, saying there was a tight deadline before this week’s Council of Europe meeting.
May told reporters outside Downing Street that she would remain in London to make the case for her leadership with her party colleagues.
In a statement confirming that the confidence motion would take place, Brady said a ballot would be held between 6pm and 8pm in the House of Commons this evening.
“The votes will be counted immediately afterwards and an announcement will be made as soon as possible in the evening,” he said.
“Arrangements for the announcement will be released later today.”

Delaying Brexit
Speaking to reporters later, Brady did not reveal how many MPs had written to him to trigger the motion, but said he spoke by telephone with May last night.
In a speech outside Downing Street shortly before 9am, May said she would “fight the vote with everything” she had.
“A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country’s future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,” May said in her speech.
May also warned that a new leader wouldn’t be in place by 21 January, the legal deadline to ratify the EU withdrawal agreement, and said a leadership election would risk handing control of Brexit to opposition MPs.
“The new leader wouldn’t have time to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement and get the legislation through parliament by 29 March,” she added.
“So one of their first acts would have to be extending or rescinding Article 50, delaying or even stopping Brexit when people want us to get on with it.”
‘Self-indulgent’
May needs 159 Conservative MPs to support her in order to survive the vote.
Several have already expressed the confidence in her following the news this morning, including Sajid Javid, Brandon Lewis, Amber Rudd, Liam Fox, and Michael Gove.
“The last thing our country needs right now is a Conservative Party leadership election,”Javid tweeted.
“Will be seen as self-indulgent and wrong. PM has my full support and is best person to ensure we leave EU on 29 March.”
Gove – who has previously been touted as a potential successor to May – also called on his fellow Conservatives to back her in tonight’s vote.
“She is battling hard for our country and no one is better placed to ensure we deliver on the British people’s decision to leave the EU,” he said.
Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who earlier this year confirmed he was one of those to have written to Brady, welcomed news of the vote.
“The Country needs a new leader, it is time for Mrs May to resign,” he said.
If May survives the motion, a second vote cannot be taken by party members for another year, but she could still face a no-confidence motion from opposition parties.

McDonald said that Brexit creates “a problem” because a majority in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.

CAR MANUFACTURER BMW has joined Airbus in warning that uncertainty about Brexit is forcing it to reconsider its investment in manufacturing in the UK.
Earlier today the aviation giant, which employs 14,000 people at 25 sites across Britain,warned in a risk assessment yesterdaythat it would be forced to “reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and at large its dependency on the UK” if Britain leaves the single market and customs union without any deal in place.
The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 but current trading arrangements will remain in place until December 2020.
While Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly expressed the desire to bring the UK out of the single market and customs union, the lack of clarity on what would replace ithas been a hallmark of negotiationswith the EU so far.
With the potential for no deal to be reached, Airbus said it needed to take appropriate action
“Put simply, a no deal scenario directly threatens Airbus’ future in the UK,” Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in a statement.
The company estimates that delays and disruptions to its production that would be caused by the trade barriers that would spring up would cost it up to €1 billion a week in lost turnover.

It said a no-deal Brexit “would be catastrophic” for the aviation group.
Even if there was an “orderly” Brexit with an agreement and transition period, Airbus said that its business would still be impacted.
It said: “The new EU/UK relationship will entail new procedures, regulatory regimes, duplication of tasks, divergence of standards etc… potentially leading to higher complexity, more effort, more cost, more risks; more friction/delay in our cross-channel, deeply integrated supply chain operating today on a just-in-time basis.”
Williams added that in any scenario, Brexit has “severe consequences” for the aerospace industry and Airbus in particular.

AFTER A ROLLERCOASTER week of Brexit rows within her government and with Brussels, British Prime Minister Theresa May will on Tuesday seek to avoid another setback in a long-awaited showdown with parliament.
MPs in the House of Commons will vote on a string of amendments to a key piece of Brexit legislation that could force the government’s hand in the negotiations with the European Union.
Over 12 hours of debate on Tuesday and Wednesday, May will seek to overturn changes made by the unelected House of Lords to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which sets the legal framework for Brexit.
Flashpoints include proposals to increase the power of parliament to decide on the final Brexit deal, and others seeking to keep Britain closely aligned with the EU’s economy after it leaves the bloc.
May this weekend said the Lords had gone “far beyond” their scrutiny role in trying to amend the bill to “tie the government’s hands in the negotiations”, and urged MPs to overturn the changes.
The Conservative government is seeking to overturn 14 of the 15 Lords amendments and appears confident of success on most of them.
One in danger of not being overturned is the so-called meaningful vote amendment, which would give parliament the power to decide what to do if it rejects the final Brexit deal.
The government may also lose a vote on membership of the EU’s customs union, but this may not have much practical impact due to the way it is drafted.
Another on joining the European Economic Area (EEA) – the single market – will likely fall because the main opposition Labour party opposes it.
Eurosceptics worried
The very fact that such discussions are being held, however, is viewed by those who favour a “softer” Brexit that momentum is on their side.
They point out that talk of staying economically aligned to the EU was widely dismissed just a year ago.
Eurosceptics who want a clean break with the EU, in which Britain has its own independent trade policy free of European rules, are increasingly worried.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was secretly recorded this week saying that while Brexit would happen, “the risk is that it will not be the one we want”.
He implied that May might not have the “guts” to be a tough negotiator with Brussels, and that US President Donald Trump may have done a better job.
Brexit Secretary David Davis also reportedly threatened to resign over plans to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
He objected to a fall-back plan that would see Britain remain aligned to EU customs rules if the problem could not be solved through a wider trade deal or with the use of technology.
Eurosceptics fear the so-called “backstop” would tie Britain to the bloc indefinitely, and May inserted a time-limit at Davis’s request – only for it to be swiftly knocked back by Brussels.
May’s position ‘perilous’
As May presides over a divided government and country, and with no overall parliamentary majority, every part of the Brexit process has been bumpy.
But this week’s turmoil reflects an increasingly febrile atmosphere in Westminster, as pressure builds for a deal by October ahead of Britain’s withdrawal in March next year.
There is a sense among both eurosceptics and pro-Europeans that crunch time is fast approaching.
The Sunday Times newspaper reported that eurosceptics unhappy with May’s direction were considering trying to oust her once the EU (Withdrawal) Bill goes through parliament.
Pro-European MPs wary of destabilising the situation may hold their fire this week as a result.
They will have the opportunity to press the case for customs and single market membership in two other bills due in the Commons within weeks.
“The prime minister’s position is quite perilous at the moment, and it may be that people think, well, she’s got enough problems,” a Conservative MP said this week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pet-passports-4259729-Sep2018/,"IRISH PET OWNERS have been warned to be mindful of potential changes for travelling with pets in the event of a no-deal Brexit situation.
This week the British government outlined the worst-case scenario for pet owners in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place in March next year. Currently, people can travel within the EU with their pets using the pet passport scheme.
To get one of these passports, pets are required to have certain vaccinations and if they have this document, they do not need to be quarantined before travel or on re-entering their home country.
The British government said it is a possibility that after Brexit, the UK could be considered a an “unlisted third country”:
Gillian Bird of the DPCSA said the charity has been closely watching developments in this area.
“It’s all up in the air – as is much of the other stuff around this. Pet owners need to be aware of this and keep an eye on dates if they are planning to travel to the UK,” she said.
Advertisement
She said people may not have an issue travelling into the UK if they have a European Union pet passport, but on returning from what may then be a non-EU passport country, they may run into trouble in Ireland.
“We just don’t know what will happen,” she said. “Coming from a non-pet passport country like China for example, you have to have documents and you can travel with them if you have paperwork and the vaccinations but the animal may still have to spend a few weeks in quarantine.
The period in quarantine could be more than three months if owners have travelled to the UK without a pet passport – and the DSPCA has seen examples of people attempting to do this at Dublin Port. They could make it to Britain without any issue, but on return they may face problems.
And if negotiations around the Northern Ireland border do not end in a resolution that prevents a hard border, this could even impact on travel between there and the Republic. Currently, pet owners do not even need a pet passport for this travel.
“We really just want people to be aware of it. We don’t know anything, but it’s getting closer now and people might have travel planned. The more we’re asking these questions the more likely we are to get an answer.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said “the UK has not yet announced what, if any, requirements it may impose on pet animals travelling from Ireland to the UK after it leaves the EU”.
“Negotiations on the exiting of the UK from the EU are on-going. Therefore, the Department is not in a position to comment any further at this stage.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May’s government saw off a rebellion by her pro-European MPs this afternoon after making further concessions over parliament’s role in the final Brexit deal.
MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject a motion that would have strengthened the power of lawmakers to intervene if no deal is reached with Brussels before Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019.
Just hours earlier, Brexit Secretary David Davis issued a statement offering a clarification that the rebels said would ensure parliament would have a “meaningful vote”.
In the end, MPs voted by 319 to 303 reject a rebel amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which sets the legal framework for Brexit.
The government’s proposal was passed through without a vote.

Winning the vote is a huge relief for the prime minister, who has struggled to maintain her authority over a deeply divided government.
A defeat would also have been a humiliating setback as she heads to a summit next week with fellow EU leaders, although she still faces tough negotiations with Brussels.
Sovereignty of parliament
May has offered parliament a vote on the final terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but has been engaged in months of negotiations over what happens if it is rejected.
Pro-Europeans are determined that parliament be given the opportunity to intervene to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc, which they say could have catastrophic consequences.
But May had warned that any attempt to tie her hands would undermine her chances of a good deal in the Brexit talks, while eurosceptics accused the rebels of trying to block Britain’s exit.

The government last week agreed to an amendment stating that if there is no deal by 21 January next year, ministers must put a statement to a vote in parliament.
This vote would be on a “neutral motion”, however, meaning it would not be open to any amendments that might force the government into a course of action.
Pro-European rebels in the ruling Conservative party said this rendered the vote meaningless, and warned they would vote against it and instead back their own rebel proposal.
In his last-minute statement, Davis acknowledged that under House of Commons rules, “it will be for the Speaker to determine whether a motion… is or not amendable”.
Leading rebel Conservative Dominic Grieve said this was an “obvious acknowledgement of the sovereignty of this place (parliament)”, and confirmed he would back the government.
Another rebel, former minister Nicky Morgan, tweeted: “On this basis parliament’s vote is meaningful – and I will support govt amendment.”
Every vote matters
While May won the day, the high-stakes vote is a reminder of how difficult her situation is.
Her Conservative party commands only a slim majority in the 650-seat Commons and relies on the support of Northern Ireland’s 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs.
In a sign of how close Wednesday’s vote was, heavily pregnant and sick MPs were called in to cast their ballots, including one in a wheelchair.
Further clashes are due in the coming weeks, notably when bills on Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU are debated by MPs.
The main opposition Labour party had backed the rebel amendment, but that party has its own eurosceptic rebels.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has seemingly breached royal protocol by discussing his private conversation with Queen Elizabeth II who he says thinks Brexit is a “very complex problem”, according to an interview with British media.
The convention-shredding president, who had already attracted ire ahead of his four-day visit to Britain by rebuking Prime Minister Theresa May as she struggles over Brexit, met Britain’s queen on Friday at Windsor Castle.
He later told TV host Piers Morgan that they had discussed the UK’s controversial exit from the European Union.
“She said it’s a very — and she’s right — it’s a very complex problem, I think nobody had any idea how complex that was going to be,” he said according to an interview published bythe Mail on Sunday.
“Everyone thought it was going to be ‘Oh it’s simple, we join or don’t join, or let’s see what happens’,” he said.
In the interview, Trump was pushed for more on what the queen told him about Brexit but he declined to say:
Theresa May
Trump said he also told May that the UK should obtain a Brexit “carve out” from the EU to allow them to do a comprehensive trade deal with America.

Despite a series of diplomatic spats between Britain and Trump, May is hoping for a quick trade deal with the US after it leaves the EU.
“I said (to Theresa May), ‘Make sure you have a carve out, you have to have a carve out’ where no matter what happens they have the right to make a deal with the United States,” Trump said in the interview.
The US president also repeated his claim that he had given May an “option” to give the UK an advantage over the EU in Brexit talks, without saying what that option was.

Trump is now staying at one of his luxury golf resorts in Turnberry, southwest of Glasgow, on a private part of the trip before heading for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.
The president largely managed to avoid mass protests planned for his visit, and has shrugged off the organised demonstrations, which on Friday included a giant baby-shaped balloon bearing Trump’s features.
May weathered the resignations of her Brexit and foreign ministers last week over her proposals for Brexit.
Prior to his arrival in the UK, Trump scorched her policy towards the EU divorce in an interview with The Sun newspaper that shocked Britain’s political establishment.
Both leaders tried to brush aside Trump’s incendiary language at a news conference Friday, insisting they were determined to pursue a post-Brexit pact.

WORKERS FROM THE EU who are flooding out of the UK are looking to Ireland as an escape route – but a move to the Republic will only make financial sense for a select few.
Figures released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics show that the number of EU workers in the UK has dropped by the most on record.
Between July and September, roughly 2.25 million EU nationals were working in the UK, which is 132,000 fewer than the previous time period last year. During the same time frame, the number of non-EU workers increased by 34,000 to 1.24 million.
Data from jobs listings site Indeed shows the outflow of EU workers is part of a trend that began in the middle of 2015 when European workers started to “lose interest” in the UK, according to Indeed economist Pawel Adrjan.
The data also showed that there has been a drop in search traffic from workers in another EU country looking at UK-based rules. The largest decreases were among people currently based in Ireland, followed by Poland.
Adrjan said the trend started as economic prospects in EU workers’ home countries improved markedly, with wages in Poland growing more than twice as fast as British pay packets.
Morgan McKinley global foreign direct investment director Trayc Keevans toldForaher firm’s most recent employment monitor shows there has been a 12-month peak in the number of professionals registering for opportunities in Ireland.

EU workers scoping out Ireland is good news for Irish-based employers, which have seen the local talent pool dry up as the country approaches full employment.
Keevans said these workers see Ireland as a “safer bet”, but she added that when they do their homework on the movea lot of them are being scared offby the cost of housing.
“The higher-earning professionals that are coming in, they are not experiencing the challenges that we’re reading about (housing),” Keevans said.
“It tends to be the mid-level, those that are earning anything between €30,000 and €60,000, they are the ones that are really experiencing difficulty.”

She added that the narrative of around Ireland’s rental market is spreading across the continent.
“We’ve had a number of eastern European professionals that are concerned about making the move and wondering will they be able to secure housing.”
Keevans also said we shouldn’t expect too many senior professionals to be among those scoping out a move here.
“If monetary is their primary objective, then the personal taxation structure here is restrictive to them making that choice to move here.
“They usually have another reason for coming here, which is they’ve already made the commitment or have a related spouse and it’s a move for lifestyle reasons.”
Tech status
Keevens said that UK-based financial services and tech professionals were the largest groups showing an interest in Ireland, while those in similar roles from the continent were also likely to be weighing a move here.
“It’s a mixture of those that would have been going to the UK, which would have been their first choice, but now of the uncertainty they’re not. They’re focusing on Ireland because it’s English-speaking.
Adrjan said the flow of EU workers out of the UK is likely to cause skill shortages in healthcare and construction in the British labour market.
He noted that workers in these sectors are also demonstrating an interest in working in Ireland, based up on Indeed’s traffic. Nevertheless, Adrjan said it didn’t look like the migration trend would significantly affect the UK’s tech hub status.
“Indeed research shows that global jobseekers looking for jobs in technology have not been put off by Brexit just yet.
“This suggests that Britain could keep its position as a global tech magnet in a post-Brexit world, provided that the economy continues to grow, and migration policy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate an internationally mobile skilled workforce.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-4-4421153-Jan2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has been urged to delay a crucial Brexit vote in the UK parliament, with a Conservative Party member and former Brexit secretary saying that they must “get it right”.
Writing in the UK Daily Telegraph, former Brexit Secretary David Davis said that it was time for the UK “to take stock” ahead of the planned crucial vote.
May faces the vote over the final deal for Britain leaving the EU later this month, after she delayed it in December when it became clear that MPs wouldn’t back the proposals she had secured in negotiations.
Parliament is set to begin debating proposals again on Monday after the Christmas break, with a vote set to be held sometime the following week.
It’s reported that May has been meeting with party members and the DUP over the Christmas break to try to drum up support for her deal.
However, she is still facing a lot of resistance from both within her own party and from opposition figures, who are either advocating for a better deal to be negotiated before the crucial 29 March deadline, or for another referendum to be held.
As well as this, the Northern Irish DUP – who are propping up May’s government – have steadfastly refused to endorse any deal which includes a permanent backstop.
The backstop is the element of the Brexit deal which would see the UK remain in the customs union if a permanent solution is not reached over the issue of the Northern Ireland border.
It is a sticking point for Ireland and EU negotiators, but is highly controversial in Britain and opposed by many MPs.
‘Decisive moment’
“Before we whip ourselves into another frenzy, perhaps it is time to take stock?” Davis wrote in The Telegraph.

“I have always said that the EU would push and push until finally we reach a resolution at the eleventh hour.
Davis said that the EU was worried about the potential loss of a £39 billion “divorce payment” that will not be paid if no deal is reached.
He said it was now the moment “to be hardnosed about these issues”.
“The more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes,” he said.
He said that the current Withdrawal Agreement did not “respect the referendum result” and that Tory MPs must “remain committed” to delivering the result.
He said that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March, and that there is no “wiggle room” in this.
“I appreciate we all want to get Brexit done and move on, but if we get it wrong, we are stuck with what is agreed and a bad deal will lead to more division and uncertainty,” he said.
Davis resigned as Brexit secretary in July of last year after he said he no longer “believed” in the UK’s approach.
Global
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the UK could punch above its weight globally after it leaves the EU.
In a speech outlining Britain’s global role after Brexit, Hunt said his country would remain an influential global player independent of the EU, even as he warned that failure to reach a deal would “cause disruption that could last some time”.
“We are not a superpower and we do not have an empire,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-tory-opposition-dup-theresa-may-eu-4335893-Nov2018/,"CHANCES OF AN agreement on a Brexit deal this month receded after another meeting between the European Union and the UK ended without a breakthrough.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government was working “extremely hard” to save a deal that continued slipping out of grasp despite frantic negotiations.
However, she faced further revolt from inside her own party, as both pro-European and eurosceptic MPs begin to speak out.
Meanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneypraised the EU 27 at the start of a crucial week for Brexitnegotiations, saying solidarity across the EU remained “very strong”.
This afternoon, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned that no deal had yet been sealed on Britain’s departure from the bloc, despite earlier claims to the contrary.
In London, May’s spokesman said there were “still substantial issues to overcome” after overnight talks in Brussels that lasted until early this morning.
The prime minister is expected to host a weekly cabinet meeting tomorrow, but a source in the UK source told AFP: “As it stands there’s no agreement for them to discuss.”
Earlier, there were suggestions that the terms of a Brexit deal was set to be presented to ministers for approval at the meeting, but Barnier’s statement appeared to quash any hopes that such a deal was imminent.
‘Terrible mistake’
Government sources said that a deal must happen by Wednesday if there is any chance of an extraordinary EU summit this month taking place for the withdrawal agreement to be signed.
If there is no deal in November, the crisis will likely drag on until a regular EU summit on 13 December, just over three months until the UK’s departure from the bloc.
Hints that May was giving ground drew anger from the Democratic Unionist Party and of eurosceptics in the Conservative Party.

Opposition from the other side of the debate has also sharpened in recent days after pro-European junior transport minister Jo Johnson resigned, calling for a second referendum and saying the mooted deal with Brussels was a “terrible mistake”.
British Prime Minster Theresa MayPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
He joined several other Conservatives who want to stay in the EU by urging fellow MPs to vote down the deal when they can.
Britain faces the prospect of crashing out of the EU with no deal in place if there is no agreement signed and ratified by the time of the scheduled date of Brexit on March 29, 2019.
Meanwhile members of May’s cabinet, which has publicly backed her since the dramatic resignations of two eurosceptic ministers in July, are also beginning to speak out.
Hardline MPs
Aid minister Penny Mordaunt, a eurosceptic reported to have reservations about the Brexit deal, raised alarm bells today by saying ministers would act as a “check” on the plan as much as parliament.
The Conservative divisions had already meant that May would likely have to rely on opposition Labour votes to get the deal through – despite that party also threatening to reject it – but the numbers are looking increasingly hard to add up.
Speculation in recent weeks suggests up to 30 or 40 hardline MPs could vote against the Brexit agreement, believing Britain would be better off leaving the EU with no deal.
May has previously urged MPs to “act in the national interest” and privately warned her party that she cannot predict what might happen if it is rejected.
The Labour Party claims the deal falls short of expectations and suggests it will reject it, eyeing a possible election in which it might win power.
But individual Labour MPs have indicated they could back the government, many of them representing manufacturing areas that they fear would suffer badly without a Brexit deal.
After the vote, there may still be trouble ahead when the deal is put into legislation, which must be passed by Brexit on March 29.

https://www.thejournal.ie/consumer-confidence-index-4260075-Oct2018/,"IRISH CONSUMER SENTIMENT fell sharply in September, according to a report released today.
The KBC Bank/ESRI consumer sentiment index fell to 96.4 in September, its lowest level since December 2016. The six-point drop from August’s reading of 102.4 was also the largest monthly decline in four years.
The report attributes the decline in confidence to “concerns about Brexit, sharp increases in energy and housing costs and expectations of very limited gains in the upcoming Budget”.
However, it notes that, for four of the five key elements of the survey, positive responses still outnumbered negative responses in September. The report’s authors also state that the dip in confidence in relation to Brexit “could be at least partly reversed”.
Consumer sentiment in the US this month rose to the second highest reading in 14 years. In marked contrast, confidence measures in the Euro area and UK both tumbled in September.
The report notes that British consumers are “gloomier about their personal finances as well as the broader economic outlook” due to Brexit.
KBC Bank Ireland / ESRI Consumer Sentiment IndexKBC Bank Ireland / ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index / ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index
The fall in Irish consumer sentiment in September saw material declines in four of the five main components of the index. The one element to post a monthly gain was expectations for the jobs market, and the improvement compared to August in the employment area of the survey was fractional.
“Our sense is that this owed something to the release of particularly strong official data showing sharp increases in numbers at work in Ireland in spring 2018 from a year earlier as well as a host of new jobs announcements through the survey period,” the authors note.

The report states that this deterioration is “primarily because fewer consumers expect the Irish economy to perform well through the next year”.
‘Increased nervousness’
In July 52% of consumers expected the economy to strengthen over the next 12 months, while 14% envisaged weaker conditions. In September just 36% anticipated stronger conditions while 21% predicted a weakening.
“Our sense is that this re-assessment of Irish economic prospects is largely prompted by increased nervousness about Brexit,” the authors note.
The September survey period saw the UK government’s ‘Chequers proposals’ for the withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU draw increasingly hostile reactions both from within the Conservative party and elsewhere in the UK political establishment as well as from various EU sources.
“In turn, the growing threat that the UK might ‘crash out’ of the EU without a deal or a transition period prompted a marked increase in consumer concerns about the outlook for the Irish economy through 2019.”
Household finances
The area of the survey showing the largest monthly drop in September related to consumers’ judgements as to how their household finances had developed over the past year.
For the first time since December 2016, a larger share of consumers (23%) felt their financial circumstances had worsened over the previous year, than felt they had improved (21%).
This negative assessment of household finances likely owes something to significant price increases in some important areas of consumer spending.
Official inflation data for August show a 3.1% monthly rise in the cost of light and heating that brought the annual increase to 13%, while a 1% monthly increase in private rents brought the annual rate to 6.2%.
The authors said it’s likely that “comments downplaying the scope for Budget day improvements to tax and social welfare also contributed to a downgrade of household financial circumstances in September”.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May said in her New Year’s address that Britain can turn a corner in 2019 and move forward with optimism – if parliament backs her Brexit deal.
“New Year is a time to look ahead and in 2019 the UK will start a new chapter,” May said, as Britain prepares to leave the European Union on 29 March.
“The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people and in the next few weeks MPs will have an important decision to make. If parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner.”
Most British lawmakers do not back the deal May reached with the European Union.
They are due to debate the UK-EU withdrawal agreement on Wednesday next week, before voting the following week.
The 2016 referendum on leaving the EU, was “divisive”, the prime minister said, “but we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together, into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation.”

Once Britain left the EU, the Conservative government could focus its energy on boosting the economy, opening up new markets, and building homes, she added, while a skills-based immigration system would replace the free movement of EU migrants.
“Together I believe we can start a new chapter with optimism and hope,” May said.
A spokeswoman for May’s Downing Street office said discussions between London and Brussels had continued, and the prime minister was working on getting “legal and political assurances”.
May had “been in contact with European leaders and that will continue in the lead up to the vote”, the spokeswoman added.
“Her focus is certainly on getting the assurances that MPs want ahead of that vote taking place. There is still work to do and talks will continue.”
In a message posted on Twitter, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, denounced the Conservative Party’s handling of Brexit as “a complete mess”.
“Eight years of damaging Tory failure has left us with a divided country where millions are struggling to make ends meet,” he said.

FIVE JUNIOR LABOUR MPs and a shadow minister have quit in an act of rebellion ahead of another key Brexit vote this evening.
The politicians quit their posts in protest against their party’s handling of Brexit votes – specifically on its decision to abstain from a vote being held tonight.According to the Sun, they are shadow cabinet office minister Laura Smith, Ged Killen, Ellie Reeves, Tonia Antoniazzi and Anna McMorrin.
The Guardianreports that around 75 Labour MPs defied the whip by backing the EEA amendment – 74 by voting in favour, and one by acting as a teller. A further 15 voted against the amendment, bringing the number who defied the party whip to 90.
This places pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of being too soft in opposing the government’s stance on Brexit. Although Corbyn has said that he’s a ‘remainer’, he’s been accused of being anti-Europe prior to the June 2016 referendum.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
The resignations came ahead of another key Brexit vote being held on whether the UK wanted its relationship with the EU post Brexit to be based on the “Norway model”.
But MPs voted 327-126 against the House of Lords’ amendment in Withdrawal Bill which would have forced the government to negotiate remaining in the EEA (that’s the Norway model).
Labour had decided to abstain from the vote, which prompted the initial criticism of Corbyn that led to the resignations.
‘Remainer’ MP Dominic Grieve told Sky News after the vote that he voted against the government and in favour of “the Norway model” as a symbolic gesture.
He said that Norway can control its agriculture and fisheries sector and that those who wanted to leave the EU had advocated this model before the referendum.

“We want to express the view that it shouldn’t be ignored,” he said.
This week, rows have been brewing at Westminster relates to the flagship EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which sets the legal framework for Brexit and would transfer thousands of European rules into British law.
The Scottish Parliament has refused to approve the bill because it could mean powers currently held by Brussels are moved to London, even when they relate to devolved areas – Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Earlier today, the Scottish National Party leader Ian Blackford, used a parliamentary procedure to try to disrupt the weekly prime minister’s question time, calling for an immediate vote on a motion for MPs to sit in private.
The speaker agreed to discuss the issue once question time was over but when Blackford refused to take his seat, ordered the Scot out of the chamber for the rest of the day.
The reason the SNP acted this evening was because the government allowed no time for MPs to debate devolution issues in the bill last night, in what would have been their last opportunity to object.
Blackford said the lack of debate was a “democratic outrage” and said the situation had become a “constitutional crisis”.
A Downing Street source dismissed the protest as a “stunt”. The source said the government had held talks with Scotland for a year and the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff had accepted its devolution proposals.
“The vast majority of powers that come back from the EU in terms of the devolved administrations will go directly to Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff,” the source said.
Northern Ireland’s Stormont Assembly has been suspended for more than a year after Sinn Féin pulled from the power sharing agreement with the DUP over the cash-for-ash scandal.

May confirmed that she had a “robust discussion” with Juncker after footage emerged this morning of the pair having a heated row at an EU summit.
As the leaders gathered in their conference room, May was filmed by the EU’s in-house TV crew confronting Juncker after he called the UK’s position on Brexit “nebulous”.
Instead of the anodyne pleasantries the leaders normally exchange in front of the cameras, a visibly angry May confronted Juncker to demand he explain his comments.

“What did you call me? You called me nebulous. Yes you did,” May said according to lip-readers hired byBritain’s Channel 5 News.
As Juncker puts his hand on May’s arm to placate her, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is seen striding across the room to restore the peace.
At a press conference this afternoon, Juncker was asked about the comments again.
He first joked that “we were not dancing” – a possible reference to May’s entrance to the Tory party conference where she danced on stage to Abba’s “Dancing Queen”.

He then attempted to clarify that he used the word “nebulous” to mean “foggy” and it was in reference to the parliament debate, rather than May herself.
The word “nebulous” is defined by theMerriam-Websterdictionary as meaning “indistinct, or vague”,Oxfordhas the first meaning as “hazy” and the second as “vague or ill-defined”.

Tensions are high between the UK and the EU after an EU Council summit held yesterday and today.
After Theresa May survived a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Tory party, she returned to Brussels to attempt to salvage her Brexit deal.
May had postponed the House of Commons vote on her deal after forecasts predicted it had no chance of being approved: some MPs expressed concern at the idea of the UK remaining in a customs deal with the EU indefinitely, and without having any unilateral power to withdraw from the backstop if the next round of talks fail.
She had thought that if the EU were to give additional assurances, that the deal might pass through the House of Commons; but she failed to gain any additional promises to time-limit the backstop or to give the UK more power to leave it in the future.
All bets are off as to what happens next: the House of Commons breaks for Christmas on 21 December, and doesn’t return until 7 January.
The vote on May’s Brexit deal must be held before 21 January to keep to the timetable for the UK to leave the EU by 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-drivers-brexit-4234090-Sep2018/,"UK DRIVERS WHO want to drive in European countries after Brexit may have to get an additional permit added to their licences as their current ones “may no longer be valid by itself” after Britain leaves the EU.
That permit will cost each driver £5.50, with the UK’s National Audit Office previously warning that anywhere between 100,000 and seven million international permits would need to be issued in the first year after Brexit, if no deal is reached.
This news came part of the British government’s latest“no deal planning papers”, which outlines what would happen in a number of instances if the UK and EU cannot agree a Brexit deal prior to Britain leaving in March 2019.
The policy document also doesn’t rule out that this could apply to UK driving licence holders travelling to Ireland, if no deal occurs.
Although it points out that a no-deal scenario “remains unlikely”, it said that it was its duty as a “responsible government to prepare for all eventualities”.

“It has always been the case that as we get nearer to March 2019, preparations for a no deal scenario would have to be accelerated,” it said. “Such an acceleration does not reflect an increased likelihood of a ‘no-deal’ outcome.”
While the policy document acknowledges that the UK government must “respect out unique relationship with Ireland” in this scenario, the application of these rules around driving licences for Northern Irish people driving across the border is not ruled out.
“The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of no deal with the European Commission and EU Member States,” it said, adding that the UK government would be on hand to “engage constructively” on the matter.
Another potential implication from a no-deal Brexit is that UK nationals travelling to theSchengen areain the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run.
“If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel,” the UK government said.
Other potential implications of a no-deal Brexit included higher roaming charges for mobile customers, and a new range of health warnings on cigarette packaging.

Irish business sentiment has consistently declined throughout the year, with only 32% of business leaders remaining optimistic about the Irish economy in Q4, down from 35% in Q3, 46% in Q2 and 52% in Q1.
Some of the other key findings are as follows:
Commenting on the results, Maura Quinn, Chief Executive of the IoD, said: “It should serve as a worrying indicator that business sentiment has fallen consistently throughout the year, with Brexit remaining the dominant risk we face into 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-spokesperson-may-4354671-Nov2018/,"A FORMER CIVIL servant who worked as the Brexit spokesperson at 10 Downing Street  has said the current Prime Minister may have a decent chance of getting her EU divorce deal through parliament – but only because the alternatives are so unpalatable.
Matt O’Toole worked at Number 10 in the communications section under both David Cameron and Theresa May, before leaving his role in September 2017.
He toldTheJournal.iethat although it was an “amazing experience” to have been part of, there was also a sense of frustration with the approach to Irish issues that Brexit created both before and after the referendum in 2016.
Brexit wounds
The Brexit endgame has been going on for quite some time now, but we’re now at the most critical moment yet in the negotiations between the UK and EU.
May has agreed a Brexit deal with the EU,with a draft deal on their future relationship settled during the week.
But, she faces a major challenge to get this deal through the House of Commons. Brexiteers within her own party loathe it. DUP members – who had been supporting her government – are irate. And the opposition Labour party has also said it won’t support the deal.
The Prime Minister told the House of Commons on Thursday that a “critical moment” had been reached ahead of this weekend’s EU summit.
The deal has proven controversial – in particular around what it’ll mean for Northern Ireland. It guarantees a backstop, if all other talks fail, that would prevent a hard border and keep the North aligned in a regulatory sense with the EU.
Focus may be fixed on how Brexit will affect Northern Ireland now, but O’Toole – who’s from Northern Ireland – said this was something that was sorely lacking in debates in the run up to the referendum.
“Even if you don’t give two hoots about the border, which is a thing you should care about, you’re going to have to negotiate with the EU whodocare about it,” he said.
Advertisement
Whereas in recent successful campaigns – such as the remain side in the Scottish referendum and the 2015 general election – the Conservatives under Cameron had been able to sway the public by saying the alternative would put the economy at risk, this wasn’t successful during the Brexit vote.
While the possibility of the UK voting to leave seemed a distant one to the civil servant in the run-up to the referendum, the difficulties that were faced by the remain side – which then-Prime Minister Cameron advocated – were clear at the time.
“One of the challenges about the referendum was trying to convey how something as structurally important to the UK economy and its position in the world affected people’s everyday lives,” O’Toole said.
Part of identity
When the people of the UK ultimately voted to leave the EU, O’Toole found himself with someone new living in Number 10 Downing Street, after Cameron resigned and May took over.
He’d gone from being a spokesperson from the perspective of being in favour of staying in the EU to one that had to express the view of leaving it in a short space of time.
“It was radical in policy terms,” he said. “A distinct and different change in the context of a much bigger change in UK politics generally.”
Part of this new policy that the civil servant had to espouse and present to journalists and the public was the mantra from Theresa May that “Brexit means Brexit”.
Although he would have been responsible to defend this in his dealings at the time, O’Toole now said: “The phrase is mind-bendingly circular.
He said that rather than what the phrase actually means – which of course we still don’t really know – it became imbued with a sense that people could culturally identify themselves as a Brexiteer or a Brexit supporter.
“It’s actually reminiscent of Northern Ireland,” O’Toole said. “And that’s one of the tragic things about Northern Ireland – the extent to which people have very tribal identifications. Brexit has made the UK as a whole a little bit more like Northern Ireland, hardened into one of these tribes, and how people see themselves in society.”
Stepping down and where we go from here
Over a year after the Brexit vote, O’Toole left his position as the Brexit spokesperson for the Prime Minister.

“It wasn’t that I walked out in protest,” he said. “But I think that there should have been more emphasis on Irish things before the referendum.
When he left his job, the DUP had made a confidence-and-supply arrangement with May’s government, further complicating matters concerning Ireland post-Brexit.
O’Toole also said it took quite a while for the position of the UK government on the guarantee of no hard border to align with that of the Irish government on the issue.
The deal now agreed between the EU and UK reflects that.
He said: “The thing that’s changed is that the UK has de facto accepted that its relationship with Ireland is going to play a huge role in its end relationship with the EU, rather than it determining things for itself.
And the chances of May getting the deal through a bitterly divided House of Commons?
Although not yet certain, the numbers don’t look good at present for May. There are a large number of dissenters within her own party, although of talk of challenging her leadership has died down significantly in the past week.
Her party only has a majority in the House of Commons through the support of the DUP, but this support will not remain with the current Brexit deal on the table.
Theresa May’s Conservative party has 316 seats, and it has also secured the support of the 10 seats from the DUP. The opposition have said they won’t be supporting the deal so the Prime Minister has a great deal of convincing to do in the next few weeks.
O’Toole said that all eyes are now on British parliamentarians, and it will be down to them if this doesn’t go through.
“I think the main chance [for May's deal] is the two alternatives are structurally unpalatable,” he said. “A no-deal is calamitous. Now the UK has agreed a deal, the culpability for rejecting a deal will be with parliament. They can’t blame the EU. And then no Brexit is politically very difficult for people on both parties.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-coveney-3-4224221-Sep2018/,"THE OCTOBER DEADLINE for a Brexit withdrawal deal could be pushed out, if necessary, said Tánaiste Simon Coveney.
Making his comments in Galway this morning, he said the withdrawal agreement is 85% agreed.
Coveney added that “deadlines are needed  otherwise difficult decisions will just get pushed out and pushed out,” adding: “We are running out of time.”
While it is important to stick with the October deadline, he said “if it is necessary to go beyond that, of course people will look at that”.

He acknowledged that a number of things were standing in the way of timeline being met, in particular, the party conference season in the UK.
The Conservative party conference will be meeting at the end of September.
The EU taskforce, led by Michel Barnier, is still focused on an end of October deal.
A final plan is scheduled in for a summit in October, where European politicians are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal. But without any progress on the Irish border issue they’re behind schedule already – prompting rumours that the vote could be pushed back to December, even January.
Coveney is of the view there is not enough time to get through the process by the 29 March date, if an agreement on the withdrawal is not locked down soon.
“If it spills over into November I think people will look at that with an open mind, but if it moves beyond then I think the capacity to make decisions and ratify them and prepare for Britain’s exiting of the EU in an orderly and successful manner starts to look difficult.”

The UK is to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 – two years to the day since Article 50 was triggered.
Talks between the two sides have intensified in the last couple of weeks.
He added that there is now a “much more united British Cabinet than they were in May or June – they are united behind the prime minister, and their negotiation position is clear, it is consistent with the white paper of the Chequers agreement. None of that was clear before July”.
“We also have a Brexit minister who is a lot more hands on … he is determined, in my view, in finding an agreement, that is not a reflection on previous ministers that is just my impression of the current one,” he said, adding that with “flexibility on both sides, a deal can be done, hopefully by the end of October if it needs a few extra weeks so be it”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sky-uk-tv-blackout-disney-discovery-4294684-Oct2018/,"BRITISH BROADCASTER SKY has asked broadcasters to confirm their post-Brexit plans by the end of 2018, amid speculation about what will happen in a no-deal scenario.
However, the company insists that it does not anticipate that any channels will be pulled next year, despite concerns that they will not be permitted to broadcast here under EU law in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
As it stands, a number of broadcasters currently with the company will need a second licence to continue broadcasting in EU countries, as their British licence will not allow them to transmit outside of the UK if no Brexit deal is reached.
According toThe Guardian, Sky has contacted US media companies including Discovery, Disney, Viacom and Turner, which use the UK as their European broadcasting hub.
The companies’ British licence currently allows them to broadcast in the EU via Sky’s pay-TV service, which goes out to more than 12 million households across the UK and Ireland.

But in order to continue broadcasting in European countries, the companies will require a second licence to continue broadcasting in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
It is understood Sky has also sent a letter to domestic broadcasters in the UK, including ITV, Channel 4 and UKTV, which also transmit on Sky under a UK licence.
If a deal to retain EU-wide broadcast rights after Brexit is not struck by the UK government, companies may look to relocate their businesses and licensing arrangements to other countries so they can continue to broadcast in Europe.
A no-deal Brexit would mean that companies that do not get a second licence to broadcast in Europe will not be allowed to air in Ireland.
However, an insider said that the affected companies will likely seek to continue broadcasting across Europe, and will apply for another licence in addition to their UK licence if required.
A spokeswoman for Sky Ireland toldTheJournal.ie: “We don’t anticipate any channels coming off Sky’s platforms and are continuing to work with our partner channels to ensure they have the licenses they need to broadcast.”
Meanwhile, Ireland is also one of the countries to have emerged as a possible location where broadcasters could move their operations to secure new European licences.
However, it is understood the country faces rivalry from Estonia, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands.

THE LEADERS OF 27 EU member states, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, have endorsed the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement as was expected.
It’s been reported that it took just 37 minutes for the European Union’s leaders to agree to the deal this morning.
The European Council agreed with the progress made so far in the 500-page Brexit deal, which includes specific provisions to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and also endorsed a 26-page document on the future relationship (more on what we expected to happen here).
In a statement given from Brussels, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the Brexit deal struck with the European Union is the only one possible, urging MPs and the British public to get behind it.
“If people think there is somehow another negotiation to be done, that is not the case,” she told reporters after EU leaders approved the divorce text, echoing comments made by EU leaders earlier today.

EU27 has endorsed the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relations.
Ahead of the meeting, Varadkar told RTÉ that the summit would be the “culmination of nearly two years of work”.
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney said that it was an “historic but sad day in Brussels as EU leaders support Brexit plan for UK departure from the EU.
“There’s work ahead to ratify the deal in London, the EU Parliament and to negotiate detail of future relationship, but today a big step towards an orderly Brexit.”
The conference started with a statement from the European Council President Donald Tusk, then opening the floor to a discussion from EU leaders, and ending with a talk from Theresa May.
At a press statement given after the summit,  President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker said:
“This is the only deal possible. Those who think that by rejecting the deal, they will get a better deal, will be disappointed.”

In the few days before the final vote, Spain threatened to “veto” the Brexit deal, even though there won’t be a vote on the progress made to date until if and after it’s approved by the House of Commons.
On the morning before the talks today, Prime Minister Theresa May penned an open letter published in most UK media outlets this morning, asking for the public to “back her Brexit plan”.
The deal “will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – so people can live their lives as they do now”, May asserted.

She continued:
“Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks’ time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal I hope to strike today.
It’s unsure whether May’s Brexit deal will pass in the House of Commons due to Brexiteers’ concerns about the Irish backstop, Scottish fishermen, Gibraltar and other issues.
One commentator described May’s deal as “Frankenstein’s monster, a broken, grotesque invention, stumbling around, half-alive, tormented by anger against its creator”.
Yesterday, at the DUP annual conference, prominent Tory politician Boris Johnson said that they should “junk the backstop”,sparking rapturous applausefrom the party that is propping up May’s minority government.

REACTING TO ARLENE FOSTER’S claim that the Good Friday Agreement could be altered to accommodate a final Brexit deal for the United Kingdom, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said “it is not up for negotiation”.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, the DUP leader said it was “deeply frustrating” that the European Union and anti-Brexit voters saw the agreement as sacred.
She said: “It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast Agreement. Things evolve, even in the EU context.
“There has been a lot of misinterpretation, holding it up as a sacrosanct piece of legislation.”
She also suggested that the discussion about how Brexit will affect Ireland was turning people off the idea of leaving the European Union.
“We haven’t been able to talk about the aspirations for the nation, we’ve spent so much time arguing about what’s happened,” she said.

“[How it's] going to be a disaster for Ireland in inverted commas…instead of actually focusing on what we can achieve in the UK with the Brexit negotiations.”
In a wide-ranging interview, Foster praised Boris Johnson’s “positive” vision for Brexit, saying she endorsed his “belief” and “spirit” and that she would work with him if he became Prime Minister.
The DUP leader – whose party supports the Conservative Party in the British Parliament under a confidence-and-supply arrangement – would not be drawn on which type of Brexit deal she preferred.
However, she did not rule out support for a Canada-style deal for Brexit if an agreement could be found on avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.
But she said she would have to see what any deal meant for Northern Ireland.
“All I can say to you is that whatever is proposed, we will look at our red line, we will judge it against that red line, and we will make a decision,” she said.
However, Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty hit back at Foster’s comments as “reckless”.
Speaking on RTÉ’sToday with Sean O’Rourke, he called on the Irish government to ensure that changing the Good Friday Agreement did not become an option, adding the the British government needed to “stop messing” and produce credible Brexit proposals.
Asking the Taoiseach to address Foster’s remarks in the Dáil today, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the Good Friday Agreement is not a “chip to be bargained with”.
She added that Foster’s words are “dangerous and reprehensible”.
“The Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct,” said McDonald.
Varadkar said the Irish government will defend the “primacy” of the Agreement, adding that it is a “co-defender” of the Agreement.
The Agreement is not a British piece of legislation – but an international agreement which was put to the people by a referendum. It can only be changed with consent of both governments and by consent of communities in Northern Ireland, said Varadkar.
“As far as this govt is concerned the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation,” added Varadkar.
Earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said on Twitter:
He added that the Good Friday Agreement was voted for by overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He said it has helped to end violence and “provided for the most prolonged period of peace and stability in Northern Ireland’s history”.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has asked for Brexit to be put on the agenda of a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg this September.
Reacting to events in London yesterday, where UK Prime Minister Theresa May lost Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis from her Cabinet, Varadkar said in the Dáil this afternoon that it is very much an “internal matter” for the British Government.
Varadkar said he discussed the possibility of upgrading the Austrian summit in September to a formal summit on Article 50 with the Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz when he was here last weekend.
Varadkar said the 28 heads of State are meeting in Salzburg on 20 September, which would be an opportune time to discuss Irish border issues. However, he said a decision will be made closer to the time.
He said he looks forward to reading the UK government’s White Paper which May is due to publish this week. He understands it will run to about 100-pages long, and said it will provide the much-wanted detail on how the UK sees its relationship with Europe working in the future.
Eager for there to be progress made, the Taoiseach said:
“If the United Kingdom was able to relax from some of its red lines, then the European Union could be flexible too. I think we are now entering into that space.”
He added:
Reacting to the news that Johnson had resigned from the UK Cabinet in protest, Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald said Boris Johnson is now running away from the mess that he helped create, adding that he will be “no great loss”.
Conservative Party fall-out
Today, May convened her cabinet in an attempt to keep control of her Conservative party in the wake of the high level resignations from the party yesterday.
Johnson warned in his letter of resignation to May that Britain was headed for the “status of colony” of the EU after it leaves in March, and said the Brexit “dream is dying”.
May responded that she was “sorry and a little surprised” by his decision but said she accepted it was necessary “if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom”.
She replaced him with Health Minister Jeremy Hunt, a Japanese-speaking former entrepreneur who unlike Johnson voted for Britain to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum.
Johnson’s dramatic resignation followed those of Davis and his deputy Steve Baker overnight over May’s plans to keep Britain economically close to the bloc.
Two parliamentary private secretaries — MPs who act as assistants to ministers — also quit their posts.
The departures, hailed by eurosceptic MPs in the ruling Conservative party, triggered speculation that May could face an imminent leadership contest.
But, appearing in the House of Commons, a confident-sounding Maydefended her Brexit proposals.
“This is not a betrayal,” she responded to one of several eurosceptic Conservative MPs who complained, insisting it was “the right Brexit deal for Britain”.
She later spoke to Conservative MPs in a closed-door meeting at which she reportedly received broad support.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, an influential Brexit hardliner, was quoted as saying that he would vote against May’s proposals but would support her in any confidence vote.
Rees-Mogg said he expected May to remain in office at least until the official date of Brexit next year.
But another Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said she believed May’s time as prime minister was “over”.
Davis himself said it would be “wrong” for his departure to trigger a major party rebellion against May.
‘Giving too much away’
May announced on Friday that her cabinet had finally agreed to a plan to follow EU rules for trade in goods, raising hopes that long-stalled talks with the bloc could progress.
The truce did not last the weekend after Davis quit on Sunday night, warning that Britain was “giving too much away too easily” in Brexit talks.

On Monday, when Johnson was supposed to be hosting a summit on the Western Balkans, Downing Street announced he had also gone.
The timing could not be worse, as Britain faces a fresh diplomatic row with Russia over a nerve agent attack, and ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit this week.
Brexit negotiations with Brussels are also expected to resume next week.
Downing Street swiftly appointed eurosceptic housing minister Dominic Raab to Davis’s job, and then later named Hunt as Johnson’s successor.
May said she now wanted to advance the Brexit talks, saying she had briefed EU leaders on her plan in recent days and received a “positive reaction”.
May has been balancing competing factions in her party for years, but with the clock ticking down to Brexit, had to make a choice.

Her proposal would see Britain adopt EU rules for trade in goods after Brexit, but maintain flexibility for its key services sector and end freedom of movement.
Brussels has repeatedly warned it will not accept “cherry-picking” of elements of its single market and it remains to be seen what the response will be in Brussels.
Following Monday’s resignations, EU President Donald Tusk tweeted: “Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain.”
“I can only regret that the idea of Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson. But… who knows?,” he added, wondering if Britain might reject the divorce.
‘Reluctant conscript’
But many eurosceptic MPs are outraged at May’s plan, and Davis’s resignation letter was also scathing.
May’s proposals for a “common rulebook” on goods “hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU”, he said.
Davis said his job required “an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript”.
Speaking to BBC radio on Monday, he said he hoped Britain would “resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions”.
As head of the Brexit ministry, Davis was the public face of Britain’s negotiating team but in reality has been overshadowed for months by Mayand her aides.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the cabinet ministers had “jumped the sinking ship”.
“For the good of this country and its people, the government needs to get its act together and do it quickly and if it can’t, make way for those who can,” he said.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has narrowly survived another crunch Brexit vote in parliament, as she struggles to unify her divided party around her strategy for leaving the European Union.
The Conservative government defeated an amendment introduced by its own backbench MPs to a future trade policy bill which would have kept Britain in a customs union with the EU if it fails to agree a free trade deal.
If the amendment had passed it would have thrown May’s Brexit strategy into disarray and increased pressure on the already beleaguered leader.
Government whips overcame the rebellion by a dozen Tory lawmakers – reportedly issuing last-ditch threats it would prompt a no-confidence vote in the prime minister – by just six votes.
It was bolstered by the support of four pro-Brexit opposition Labour Party MPs.
Ministers argued the amendment would put “massive restrictions” on its ability to forge “an independent trade policy” after Britain leaves the European Union next March.
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told parliament the government’s future trade bill was “an important bill providing continuity and stability”.
“It will be the confident first step that the UK takes in establishing itself as an independent trading nation,” he added.
The government lost another, less crucial vote on another backbench amendment calling for future participation in the European medicines regulatory network.
The entire trade bill passed by 31 votes and now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny before returning to the Commons for a final vote.
‘A total, complete mess’
May is battling to unite her Conservative Party around her Brexit blueprint formally unveiled last week following months of cabinet infighting.
It would see Britain ask the European Union for a free trade area for goods through a “facilitated customs arrangement” alongside a “common rulebook”.

Brexiteers believe that keeps Britain too close to the EU, while pro-Europeans think it fails to protect the country’s dominant services sector, among other gripes.
The backlash has seen the prime minister face persistent rumours Tory MPs are planning to topple her.
Two top pro-Brexit ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, quit in protest last week, while a string of junior walkouts have followed suit, including two more officials on Monday.
Today was also the second day running May faced revolt from backbench Tory lawmakers after they failed yesterday by three votes to enact changes to a crucial post-Brexit customs bill.
May averted defeat on the proposed legislation – part of a series of bills overseeing Britain’s withdrawal from the EU – by bowing to pressure from hardline eurosceptics in her own party.
The move infuriated pro-European Conservatives, sowing the seeds for today’s unsuccessful rebellion.
“I started the week intending to support the prime minister. Yesterday changed that,” MP Phillip Lee, who resigned as a junior minister over Brexit earlier this year, told lawmakers.
Despite this week’s legislative successes, two former British prime ministers spoke out today about the divisive impact of Brexit.
Describing the government’s approach as “a total and complete mess”, Tony Blair told AFP the only way out was to hold another referendum on the issue.
“Once this thing has been started by a referendum, it can frankly only be finished by a fresh vote,” Blair said.
John Major, who lost power in 1997 after years of Conservative dissent over Europe, also backs a second poll and said positions were more “entrenched” today.
“Theresa May is in a more difficult position than I was,” he told ITV News.
“Facing more committed and hardline opponents – and more of them – than I had.”
British voters in a June 2016  referendum chose to leave the European Union, and on Tuesday Britain’s official Brexit campaign, Vote Leave, was fined and reported to the police for breaking spending rules – another issue boosting calls for a second vote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/wetherspoon-brexit-beer-champagne-4069786-Jun2018/,"DISCOUNT PUB CHAIN JD Wetherspoon won’t be pulling any European drinks from its Irish pubs post-Brexit.
The firm, whose chairman Tim Martin is a vocal supporter of Brexit, announced it will switch to UK and non-EU providers in the run up to the UK leaving the EU.
It is switching from a range of drinks including champagne and wheat beers, which are produced in France and Germany.
Wetherspoon will replace champagne with sparkling wines from the UK; Denbies Sparkling Whitedowns Brut and Whitedowns Rose Brut as well as Hardys Sparkling Pinot Chardonnay from Australia.
Martin said: “This move helps us to broaden our horizons so that we create an improved offer for the two million customers who visit our pubs each week.
“It is the start of a review all products in the next six to 24 months, with the object of making our business more competitive.

“The EU’s customs union is a protectionist system which is widely misunderstood.
“We intend to honour existing contracts with EU suppliers, some of which have several years to run.
“However, we are starting to make the transition to non-EU trade now.
“Our biggest bottled cider supplier is the excellent Kopparberg of Sweden.
“Kopparberg has said that it will transfer production to the UK post-Brexit.”
However, a company spokesperson confirmed to TheJournal.ie that the changes will not affect Ireland.
The company owns four pubs here, aiming to open another 10 this year and has begun work on a hotel on Camden Street in Dublin. The €15 million investment will see 200 jobs created at the 98-room hotel.

This article was first published on the 30 June 2018. It has been republished to include the latest developments in Brexit negotiations.
IT’S NOT JUST trade and citizens’ rights that complicate any Brexit, it’s also the timeline that leads up to the UK’s departure from the EU.
The ordering of what happens in the months ahead is especially important in working out a solution for the Irish border problem. There has been little to no progress on the border in the past three months, despite across-the-board agreement that a hard border should be avoided at all costs.
As yet, no solution has been put forward to make sure that doesn’t happen.
The EU has had three summits since Article 50 was triggered, and with more talk about ‘sufficient progress’ and deadlines, we’ve compiled a timeline of important dates – past and future.
So let’s go back to where this all started to remind ourselves of how we ended up near the end of a two-year fixed period with no progress on how to avoid a hard border – and how likely it is that the timeline will be extended.

Tory Prime Minister David Cameron wins a 12-seat majority in the general election, based on a manifesto that includes the promise of holding a referendum on EU membership.
As well as being part of his manifesto, the EU referendum was also partly prompted by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, who had began to gain traction in local elections. Farage in particular, made frequent statements decrying the EU’s immigration policy.

The EU referendum is held. The final result sees51.9%vote to leave the European Union, with 48.1% voting to remain.
The populations of Northern Ireland and Scotland vote to remain in the EU, while England and Wales vote to leave. Cameron resigns as Prime Minister.

Nigel Farage resigns as leader of Ukip.
“I have decided to stand aside as leader of UKIP,”he told a London press conference. “The victory for the ‘Leave’ side in the referendum means that my political ambition has been achieved.”
He’s replaced with Paul Nuttall in November 2016,who resignson 9 June 2017 after his party fail to win any seats in the UK general election.

Although she campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, she was suspected as being a ‘secret’ Leave voter, and was instructed to campaign for a ‘Remain’ vote as a senior government minister (she was Home Secretary before taking the post as premier).
May also said before the referendum that whatever the outcome, the UK should leave the European Court of Human Rights, outlining problems she had with it as Home Secretary.

Theresa May tells the House of Commons that Article 50 has been formally triggered.
This set in motion a two-year timeframe which allows a member state to negotiate its withdrawal from the European Union (the scheduled Brexit departure date is 29 March 2019).

On 8 June, Theresa May loses her majority in Parliament. She had called a snap election in order to strengthen her hand in the House of Commons and in Brexit negotiations with the EU, and ended up in a minority government propped up by the DUP.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party did better than expected, despite a huge amount of criticism in the UK media.
After much speculation and a prolonged announcement, Enda Kennyannounces on 17 Maythat he would resign as Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael by the end of the day.

The EU and UK agree that there will beno hard border on the island of Irelandin what’s become known as ‘the backstop’, after a bit of back-and-forth with the DUP.
This was an agreement that in a worst-case scenario, where there’s no agreed solution to the Irish border question, there would be “regulatory alignment” between the EU and Northern Ireland to ensure there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland.
There’s been little clarification on what “regulatory alignment” means in practical terms.
Britain, who have pledged to leave the Customs Union and Single Market in order to pursue more lucrative trade deals with countries outside the EU, have said that technology could be used to scan products and track the movement of people across the border.
But many experts, EU leaders and members of the Irish government have said that this technology doesn’t exist yet, and want more detail from the UK. Although Theresa May and the EU have repeatedly vocalised their determination to avoid a border on the island of Ireland, in the two years since the Brexit vote there hasn’t been a comprehensive plan on how to do this.
The only way, it seems, that it could be achieved is for the UK to remain in the customs union (which the Brexiteers and British citizens don’t want) or Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union, while the rest of UK leaves (which the DUP doesn’t want).

The UK and EU agree ona transition phase which will last until 31 December 2020– this is conditional on both sides agreeing to a final withdrawal deal.
It also agreed the wording of thebackstop agreement.
European CommissionEuropean Commission
The transitional phase would mean that EU citizens arriving in the UK between the 29 March 2019 (when the UK is scheduled to leave) and 31 December 2020 would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit.
The same would apply to UK expats on the continent. The UK would be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period while remaining part of existing EU trade deals.
Northern Ireland would also stay in parts of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid a hard border.

The UK government publisheda document outlining its positionon post-Brexit customs arrangements.
Although it was welcomed by the Irish government, they said that more detail was needed in order to progress with talks. The EU reaction was even more harsh, with Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier saying it didn’t give enough detail and posed more questions than answers.

The document proposed allowing the whole of the UK to be part of the “regulatory alignment” backstop if an alternative solution couldn’t be found. The regulatory alignment was only suggested, however, to protect the Good Friday Agreement (and avoid a return to Troubles-era violence).
The customs document also proposed putting a time limit on the backstop, which was also dismissed as unworkable; both Varadkar and Barnier made separate statements saying that an “all-weather” solution was needed.

The European Council meeting was held.
This was the third and penultimate summit before the UK officially leaves the EU, but because so many issues were left unresolved, there’s talk of another summit being held between June and the final summit in October to iron out the remaining problems.
Those unresolved problems include the protection of citizens’ data after the UK leaves, and “geographical indicators” or a guarantee about where a product, like Scotch whiskey, is from.
In particular, the Irish question was expected to be discussed and perhaps finalised by the end of this meeting of EU leaders. The lack of progress by the UK has forced the Irish government to begin researching the reaction to a no-deal scenario, which it was reluctant to do before now.
EU negotiators are understood to be disappointed with the amount of progress made on the Irish question between March and June, but still are reluctant to entertain the idea of a no-deal scenario. Sinn Féin has said there should be a special summit in September to discuss the Irish border issue.

This was the Friday Theresa May gathered her Cabinet for a day-long discussion about what kind of Brexit they were going to ask the EU for.
MPs were instructed to hand in their phones at the beginning of the day so that reports wouldn’t be leaked to the media.
By 8 or 9pm, May publisheda video on Twitter briefly outlining the 12 pointsthat her Cabinet had agreed upon.
Most significant was the request for a “UK-EU free trade area with a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products”. The plan also reiterated its commitment to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Some UK media reported that May also sent a letter out to her ministers threatening to discipline them if they didn’t roll in behind this plan. The threat of being fired seemed to have an effect – as two senior Brexiteers were to resign.

The following Monday,Brexit secretary David Davis resigned from his role, saying he couldn’t endorse or fight for the Brexit deal outlined by the Cabinet.
“The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,” he wrote in his letter to May.
Later that day, at 3pm, Boris Johnson resigned as foreign secretary. In his resignation letter Johnson said: “Brexit should be about opportunity and hope… The dream is dying, suffocated by needleless self-doubt.”
Interestingly, Davis criticised Johnson’s decision to resign,saying“I had resigned because this was essential to my job… I’d have to be the champion of the policy. I don’t think it’s essential to the role of Foreign Secretary.”

The UK governmentpublishes its long-awaited White Paper on Brexit. The 104-page document outlines the UK’s proposals for Brexit, and gives an insight into its position on a number of policies.
The White Paper, although nowhere near a finished Brexit deal, would form a basis for future negotiations with the EU.
It proposed that the UK and EU would share rules and regulations around customs, agri-foods and fisheries, a proposal that could avoid a hard border but would be difficult for Brexiteers to stomach (the House of Commons must approve the deal before it goes though).

Theresa May visits Northern Ireland– including her first visit to the Irish border since becoming Prime Minister. She had been criticised previously for not engaging in issues in the North, in particular the collapsed Stormont Assembly.
During her speech in Belfast on Friday, she said that she wouldn’t accept the EU’s proposal for a backstop, saying that it lead to a partition within the UK and a border along the Irish Sea.
She said that no UK prime minister could accept that.

Following that statement from Theresa May, the Irish government and EU ramped up efforts to prepare for a ‘hard’ Brexit or no-deal scenario.
Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said that following May’s speech, it was looking“increasingly likely that there will be a no-deal Brexit”.

This was the date set by EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier to have a discussion about the Withdrawal Agreement – but of course,this didn’t happen.
There was disagreement over what the backstop, a plan B or safety net to ensure no matter what custom rules or regulations are in place, that a hard border will not return to the island of Ireland.
The UK was offered a “two-tier backstop” in an attempt to break the impasse: this would mean a backstop for the UK where they would be part of a customs union, and a backstop for Northern Ireland where they would remain in the Customs Union and Single Market.
An extension to the transition period, which was to run from the 29 March 2019 until 31 December 2020, was also offered, to give businesses more time to prepare for changes.
But as it stands, there’s still no agreement from within the Tory party over what kind of Brexit deal they want: some want to scrap the backstop altogether and go for a hard Brexit; while others like MP Anna Soubry want a second referendum.

On 20 October,hundreds of thousandsof people marched on Westminster to call for a second referendum on Brexit. Although this is thought to be the largest demonstration since the Iraq war protest in 2003, opinion polls show that the percentage of Remain voters is just 4 points ahead of those who wish to Leave the EU (which is the same percentage before the original vote in June 2016, by the way).
There’s been a lot of disagreement within Westminster about who should have the power to vote on the deal – it’s been decided that the elected House of Commons will be the ones to cast their vote on it before it’s approved.
At least 20 out of 27 leaders of the remaining EU member states need to approve the deal for it to progress.
EU parliaments have to ratify the deal before 29 March 2019, which is two years to the day after Article 50 was triggered and when the UK must formally leave the EU. After this date, and if a withdrawal bill is agreed upon, Britain would then enter a two-year transition period.
Another EU summit is planned for the 8 December – one had been provisionally pencilled in for mid November if enough progress on the Irish backstop had been made. But Barnier decided that they hadn’t progressed far enough to warrant this.

The UK officially leaves the EU – deal or no deal. This is why there’s such a rush to get a final deal on the table, as both elected members of the EU and UK must approve the final agreement and ratify it before this date.
Although the Brexit schedule has been set in stone so far, there’s been some talk of extending the negotiation timeframe to allow for more time to come up with a solution.
This isn’t the preferred approach by the EU or Brexiteers however – Brexiteers including Nigel Farage have said that it would be a betrayal by the UK government to delay Brexit.

The European elections are due to take place, meaning Ireland’s representatives in the European Parliament could change.
Already we know that Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy will be leaving the EP to run as a Dáil candidate in the next general election.
The elections will also see Ireland’s representation of MEPs rising from 11 to 13 because of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.

At the launch of RTÉ’s new season today, Tubridy announced he will do a once-off show in London with an audience of 1,000 people.
“Brexit has given us all a collective pain in our faces and we’re trying to figure out what we’re going to do particularly as it’s our nearest neighbour,” he told theJournal.ie.
“And really the point of it is to go over and celebrate the ties that bind, rather than the ties that upset. So it’s about culture and music and art and entertainment and everything that has brought Britain and Ireland together.”
He hopes the show will send a message – that “Brexit won’t tear us apart because there’s too much going on between us as a people”.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has deferred the House of Commons’ crucial vote on the Brexit deal, which was due to be held tomorrow.
May was facing the prospect of a heavy defeat on the deal struck between her government and the EU, which secures provisions such as the Irish backstop.
Sources began telling reporters in London this morning that she would cancel the vote and return to Brussels on Thursday looking for more concessions, particularly around the backstop issue, for Brexiteers in her party.
During her statement, May said she did not want to divide the House of Commons further with a vote.
Plans around Brexit have once more been thrown into disarray, as the House of Commons must have a final say on a Brexit deal at some stage.
Reacting to the reports of a delay, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it demonstrated “pathetic cowardice by a PM and government that have run out of road”.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government has decided that May’s deal “is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour”.
“We have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all world’s deal was going to be rejected by parliament because it is damaging for Britain,” he said.

Another parliamentary official explained that the main route to postponing the vote would be for the Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom to table a business motion removing the vote.
Leadsom is due to address parliament after May at 4.30pm.

The European Court of Justice ruled that Britain has the unilateral right to withdraw its plan to leave the European Union if it so decides before Brexit day at the end of March.
The EU has already offered Britain the “best and only possible” Brexit divorce deal and will not renegotiate it, the European Commission warned following the ruling.
“Our position has not changed and as far as we’re concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29th of March 2019,” spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters.
“We have an agreement on the table that was endorsed by the EU council in Article 50 format on the 25th of November. As president Juncker said, this deal is  the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate,” she said.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, with Minister Heather Humphreys and RCSI Chief Executive Officer, Professor Cathal Kelly.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the current deal agreed between the EU and UK is “the only deal on the table”.
He added that he had spoken to May on the telephone last night, but he had no confirmation on whether May was postponing the vote.
Varadkar said he did not want to divulge all aspects discussed, but said she updated him on the progress she was making in getting the deal ratified.
The Taoiseach told reporters that it was not possible to “reopen any aspect of the agreement”, adding that “a lot of concessions have been made along the way, including the [backstop] review clause.

https://www.thejournal.ie/increase-in-cost-of-groceries-brexit-3914394-Mar2018/,"A HARD BREXIT would increase the cost of living for all households in Ireland by 2% to 3.1% – an annual increase of €892 to €1,360 per household, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).
Costs would rise the most for lower-income households, as these spend a greater share of expenditure on food products, many of which are imported from the UK and would be subject to tariffs.
Households with the lowest incomes would face a 4% price increase in the highest-impact scenario, whereas households in the highest-income group would face a 2.4% price increase, the ESRI said.
The percentage increase faced by the poorest households would be 70% more than the percentage increase faced by the wealthiest households, according to the research.

The study was commissioned by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and examines the shares of imported products from the UK in household spending and estimates effects of a hard Brexit scenario, incorporating tariffs and other increases in costs of trade between the EU and the UK.
Cost of milk and bread
The research used a number of Brexit scenarios to examine the price increase of a range of imported goods. It found that if tariffs were introduced and other trade costs also increased following a hard Brexit, the price of bread and cereals could rise by up to 30%, while the price of milk, cheese and eggs could increase by 46%.
Martina Lawless, one of the report’s authors, said: “As Ireland imports a considerable amount of food products from the UK, a hard Brexit could have an immediate impact on the cost of living.
Isolde Goggin, chairperson of CCPC, added: “The implications of the research highlight an important opportunity for domestic businesses, particularly the food industry, in the form of import substitution.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-parties-brexit-4026966-May2018/,"SINN FÉIN, THE SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party have released a joint statement saying that Northern Ireland should stay in the single market and the customs union, and that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland.
The four parties have varying stances on a number of issues, making their joint statement on a hard border and customs union membership significant. The four parties won 49 of the 90 Stormont seats in last year’s Assembly elections,according to RTÉ.
“This is critical to protecting investment, jobs, trade and the hard-won peace,” the parties said, in a joint statement today.
Although the UK government said that it wishes to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also said that it will leave the single market and the customs union – two statements which appear to contradict one another.
A number of suggestions have been made by the UK government to appease concerns – the main one being to use technology to customs-check vehicles and people in a non-intrusive way.
Another option, called “maximum facilitation” or “max fac” for short, would mean delaying the process of leaving the customs union until the technology to do so has been developed.
The EU and Irish government have expressed concern at this suggestion, saying that there is no technology that would deem infrastructure on the border unnecessary.

Members of Theresa May’s own government and party have also expressed reservations about the options that have so far been given.
Today, the statement signed by the leaders of four parties in Northern Ireland draws attention to the issue once more, during a week when the British government is working on suggestions for dealing with more complex aspects of the Brexit negotiations – including trade arrangements with the EU.
There has been no government in Northern Ireland for over a year now; the Stormont Assembly dissolved last year after the resignation of the late Martin McGuinness over the cash-for-ash scandal.
This has made Brexit negotiations even tougher for Northern Ireland as it has less representation of its region’s interests as the EU and UK hammer out a deal. The majority of Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the referendum held in June 2016.
“The Joint Report of the EU and British negotiators published on 8 December last year reiterated its commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, including the effective operation of the institutions and bodies of the Agreement,” the statement says.
“The Joint Report also affirmed that North South cooperation is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement and Prime Minister Theresa May committed to protecting and supporting continued North South and East West cooperation across the full range of frameworks of cooperation, including the operation of the North South bodies.
“All of the outstanding issues relating to the Withdrawal Agreement will be considered in relation to Northern Ireland/Ireland and the future relationship.
“That the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, including North/South and East/West co-operation is critical to maintaining relationships within, and between these islands.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-3-4375064-Dec2018/,"A MAJORITY OF people believe that Sinn Féin should break its long-standing policy of not taking its seats in Westminster, so it can back the Brexit deal that guarantees no hard border in Northern Ireland
The deal agreed between Theresa May’s government and the EU has been hailed a good one for Ireland, offering crucial guarantees on a backstop that would prevent such hard border on the island.
However, the numbers currently don’t look good for the deal to be ratified by parliament as the crucial House of Commons vote looms on Tuesday.
According to a poll for RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live/TheJournal.ie by Amarách Research, 57% of people said they think Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats in Westminster so they can vote for May’s Brexit deal.
Of the 1,000+ Irish adults surveyed for the poll, 20% said the MPs shouldn’t, while 23% said they didn’t know either way.
Crunching the numbers
As it stands right now, Theresa May needs all the help she can get.
The House of Commons has 650 seats, with four of its members abstaining from voting – the speaker and his three deputies.
The Conservative party as it stands does not have a majority in the parliament in Westminster.

It has been backed up by the DUP since last year’s general election, as its 10 seats have supplemented the Tories’ 315.
It is highly unlikely that the DUP will back the deal.

So, on that alone, if all opposition parties voted against the deal – May would lose even if all her party members voted for it.
And, again, there’s likely to be a sizeable number of Conservatives voting against the deal.
May has been seeking to canvass support throughout the past few weeks, but her position is looking increasingly precarious as the vote looms.
Abstentionist
Given the current state of the numbers, it is not clear that Sinn Féin could sway the vote with its 7 MPs.
Republican abstentionism from elected office stretches back over 100 years.It is just over 30 years agothat Sinn Féin agreed to end its abstentionist policy from the Dáil by 429 votes to 161.
The long-standing practice of refusing to take up seats in Westminster continues to this day, with the party running candidates on the clear policy of abstentionism.
Voters are made aware that a vote for Sinn Féin in the House of Commons means they’re voting for a candidate who will not take up a seat if elected.
All MPs must take an oath to the Queen when taking their seats in Westminster, swearing true allegiance to the monarch. Sinn Féin opts not to do this.
Writing inthe Guardian in March, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said that sitting in the British parliament is “not what I was elected for”.
“We are not British MPs,” he said. “We are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland.
Maskey went on to say that the “people of Ireland will not find a solution to Brexit in the parliament that is imposing it”.
In a poll conducted by the same pollsters earlier this year, 67% of people said they thought Sinn Féin MPsshould take their seats to vote on Brexit issues.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-5-4389166-Dec2018/,"THE TÁNASITE AND Foreign Affairs Minister has said “there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on right now” in relation to Brexit but that Ireland has the European Union’s full support.
Simon Coveney also defended the inclusion of a backstop in the Draft Withdrawal Agreement.
Today he brought a memo to Cabinet on the contingency planning put in place in the scenario of a no-deal Brexit. It outlined that all government departments are to be prepared for “all eventualities” in the case of an “orderly” or “disorderly” Brexit.
Speaking on RTÉ’sSix One News, Coveney said: ”There’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on right now, the EU is absolutely solid in its solidarity with Ireland.”
Legal advice from British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, which was published after MPs found the government in contempt of parliament, warns that the terms of the backstop could trap the UK in “protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations” in the years ahead, the Guardian reports.
“No one’s looking to trap anybody anywhere,” Coveney said, adding that the draft agreement is the result of both sides working together for over 18 months.
He said the backstop is necessary as a last resort and “doesn’t threaten the UK’s economic or political integrity”.
The backstopaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.

Coveney added that, although plans are being prepared for a no-deal Brexit, he thinks such a scenario is “still very unlikely … despite all the political chaos we’re seeing now.”
May’s visit to Dublin
British Prime Minister Theresa May is set to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin tomorrow.
The two leaders will meet at Government Buildings tomorrow evening in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.Yesterday May confirmed she was postponing today’s crucial House of Commons vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she can go back to Brussels and ask for certain changes to be made.
Varadkar and Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, have both said the deal struck between the European Union and Britaincannot be renegotiated.
May told the House the current agreement “would be rejected by a significant margin” but stated: “I’m in absolutely no doubt that this deal is the right one.”
May today toldSky News: “There is no deal available that doesn’t have a backstop within it”, but said she wants assurances from the EU that, if it is used, it will be only be a temporary measure.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop – including MPs in May’s own Conservative Party, as well as members of Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up May’s minority government.
The DUP believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
There have been calls for no-confidence motions in both the British government and May to be put forward, as well as calls for May to resign – from outside and inside her own party.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-summit-explainer-4356799-Nov2018/,"HERE WE ARE on the eve of another EU summit – so what’s this one for and why does it matter?
After significant progress in Brexit talks in the past two weeks, the leaders of 27 EU member states are meeting tomorrow to decide on whether they’ll endorse the deal that was struck between the UK and EU negotiating teams after two years of talks.
The deal was a catalyst for the resignation of Brexiteer MPs, including Dominic Raab as Brexit Secretary (meaning he was in charge of Brexit talks in Brussels), who described it as “May’s deal” and added that they’d be better off within the EU than to leave under those terms.
One commentator described May’s deal as “Frankenstein’s monster, a broken, grotesque invention, stumbling around, half-alive, tormented by anger against its creator”.
Nevertheless, May has secured her Cabinet’s backing to the deal, and said that there’s no going back to no Brexit.
This means that two things need to happen next: the EU needs to endorse the deal, and the UK House of Commons needs to hold a meaningful vote too if this deal is going to pass and allow for a Brexit deal.
The first of those is happening tomorrow at 9.30am. The 27 leaders of the EU member states will decide whether or not to endorse the Brexit deal.
Although Spain’s Prime Minister threatened to veto the deal if they did not get enough say in what happens to Gibraltar, this isn’t possible at this stage. They can choose not to endorse it, but just a simple majority is needed from the European Council. They could, however, veto a trade deal once it’s agreed with the UK a few years down the line.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council (that’s the leaders of the EU 27), said that Brexit is a “lose-lose” ahead of the talks, acknowledging the concerns expressed by some member states including Spain, France and the Netherlands, about what’s been agreed so far.

Commitments to Ireland
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will also be at the summit, of course, and will be keen to get an agreement and the backing from other member states on the Brexit deal, which contains “strong language and commitments to Ireland”, as Tánaiste Simon Coveney put it.
Despite these concerns,which are sure to be aired during the two-and-a-half hour debate and meeting with Theresa May, the deal and political declaration on the future relationship are expected to pass tomorrow.
If that is agreed May starts the process of getting MPs to back the deal in the House of Commons: as it stands now, most are currently against it. The vote will take just over two weeks from now, before the parliamentary break that begins 21 December.
The EU treaties of Rome and Maastricht took around 40 days to be approved in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. There remain between 60 to 70 days of parliamentary session between Sunday’s summit and 29 March.
What happens after that?
If the House of Commons approves it, it then it goes to the European Parliament to be ratified. The members of the European Parliament will likely await the green light of the British legislature to launch their own ratification procedure.
The ratification vote should take place at the beginning of 2019 but it could theoretically wait until March 28, the last day of the parliamentary session before Britain’s withdrawal takes effect.
After its ratification by the European Parliament, the withdrawal treaty must be approved by the EU member states by so-called qualified majority: 72% of the 27 member countries representing 65% of the population of these countries.
This approval will be given by ministers from the 27 capitals meeting as the European Council.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tesco-stockpiling-food-4267298-Oct2018/,"
THE CEO OF Tesco has said that the grocery retailer will take action at Christmas time to stockpile food unless the UK government agrees a Brexit deal that ensures goods flow freely between Britain and Europe.
Dave Lewis was speaking as Tesco unveiled its results for H1 2018, with its purchase of wholesaler Booker helping to support its underlying performance while first-half net profits sank.
Profit after tax slumped 32% to £426 million (€479 million) in the six months to the end of August, Tesco said in a results statement.
That compared with £628 million in the same part of the previous year, which was boosted partly by a large gain on the sale of its Korean operations.
Speaking earlier, Lewis said that Tesco was cutting prices already as consumer confidence has taken a dive over the potential impacts of Brexit.
“The possibility of stockpiling fresh food is very, very limited,” he said, adding that the impact of a no-deal Brexit on deliveries of fresh food from Europe would be the “single biggest challenge”.
Lewis added that stockpiling of dry goods could be possible at Christmas time, as Tesco is engaged in discussing contingency plans with its suppliers.
“It really is a wait and see,” he said.

Results
In its results, Tesco said that its latest underlying operating profit jumped 24% to £933 million, helped greatly by the recent acquisition of British wholesaler Booker.
However this figure undershot analysts’ consensus forecast, contributing to Tesco’s share price tanking 8.3% to 215.70 pence on London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.4% overall.
Sales on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of new floor space, climbed 2.3 percent in the second quarter.
“We have made a good start to the year,” Lewis added.
He added that the second quarter was driven mostly by solid performance in the UK and Ireland.
Tesco bought Booker for £3.7 billion earlier this year, in a radical repositioning of the UK retailer that has been troubled in recent years by an accounting scandal – and fierce competition from supermarket rivals and discount chains.
Booker is Britain’s the country’s biggest cash-and-carry operator and sells goods to more than 503,000 customers – including grocers, pubs and restaurants across the country.
Tesco meanwhile recently launched a rearguard action against German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl with the launch of discount food store chain Jack’s.
The British supermarket giant has additionally finalised a purchasing alliance with French titan Carrefour to increase their leverage with suppliers – and enable them to slash prices on the supermarket shelves.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said she was “irritated” by speculation about a leadership contest as she slammed former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, seen as her most likely challenger.
The centre-right Conservative Party’s leader said she was focused on securing a Brexit deal rather than her own future, in a BBC television interview marking the six-month countdown to Britain’s departure from the European Union.
May blasted Johnson for using “completely inappropriate” language when he described her Brexit blueprint as putting Britain in a “suicide vest”.
Asked about her plans to stay in the job, she said: “I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future – this debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom.
“That’s what I’m focused on and that’s what we should all be focused on.”
The leader added it was important to ensure “we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK”.
Johnson, who quit the cabinet over May’s proposals to keep Britain close to the EU on trade, is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed May, ahead of interior minister Sajid Javid, eurosceptic backbench leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, environment minister Michael Gove and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
May’s Conservative minority government contains a sizeable bloc of hardcore Brexiteers headed by Rees-Mogg and would likely need the support of the left-wing main opposition Labour Party, or a chunk of their MPs, to get her Brexit proposals through parliament.

Labour weighs in
Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said any EU deal must meet Labour’s key Brexit tests, which include delivering the “exact same benefits” as Britain currently has inside the single market and customs union, to win their support.
In a letter published by The Sunday Times, he said they also could not back a loosely worded agreement: “A vague political declaration would not meet those tests. Labour will not — and cannot — vote for a blind Brexit.”

Meanwhile London Mayor Sadiq Khan added his weight to calls for a second Brexit referendum on the outcome of Britain’s EU departure negotiations.
Writing in The Observer newspaper, he said Britain faces either a bad Brexit deal or no deal.
“They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods,” he wrote.
The Labour politician said voters need to be given a new referendum.
“This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the government, or a vote on a no-deal Brexit if one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” he wrote.

IRELAND’S LARGEST PORT is making preparations for a hard Brexit and the divergence of customs and trade rules from those of the European Union.
Eamon O’Reilly, CEO of Dublin Port, toldMorning Irelandthat he had been told by a senior EU official the ‘Brexit backstop’, which guarantees “regulatory alignment” between the EU and the UK in the event of no other solution, does not extend to Ireland’s ports.
Because of this there has been “a lot of background work” going on for the past couple of months to prepare for Brexit, he said.
“That physical infrastructure is being prepared,” he said.
He said he didn’t have much concern “on the Revenue side of the inspections” because the type of inspections necessary were already happening to 200,000 units from the Far East.

When asked how many more customs officers he expected would be needed to carry out additional checks on goods coming from the UK, O’Reilly said that although it wasn’t his job to staff customs officers, he would estimate that it would be in the “tens, maybe low hundreds”.
He said he took “great solace” from what the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in relation to the number of custom staff he would hire in preparation for a hard Brexit.
Yesterday the Taoiseach and his Ministers met for a special discussion on Brexit preparations in Derrynane House in Co Kerry. Among the topics discussed, the Cabinet agreed to hire 700 extra customs officials for ports and airports, and 300 extra staff to check agri-foods and animals.
Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort will also need significant investment to update its infrastructure.
Speaking about the volume of trade that travels through Dublin Port, O’Reilly said that it runs on a 24/7 basis, with trailers ”rolling-on and rolling-off” ferries. Each year, around 850,000 units of freight are transferred between Dublin and Britain, and a further 100,000 units of freight between Rosslare and South Wales.
“The trade on Dublin Port is import-led, we’re an island economy. One of four waves of activity during the day,” he said.
The government is currently exploring the possibilities ofexpanding operationsat Rosslare Port to take advantage of opportunities that could be created by Brexit. But efforts to do so could be hampered by legal complications arising from the complex ownership structure of the port, which is the second largest in Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-varadkar-brexit-4340281-Nov2018/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has welcomed the withdrawal agreement made between the UK and the EU and said that given Ireland’s priorities going into the talks, it was a “satisfactory outcome”.
Earlier this evening, UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced she had secured Cabinet approval for the Brexit deal after being locked in hours of talks.
While there is no guarantee that May will be able to get the deal through parliament, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the agreement of the deal was a “decisive and crucial step”.
Reacting this evening, Varadkar said: “The legal text ensures that Ireland and the UK can continue to operate a Common Travel Area, and underpins the rights set out in the Good Friday Agreement.”
He said that Ireland never wished for Brexit to happen, and knew it would have negative effects on the island, but that at the outset the government had identified “national priorities” that must be protected.
The Taoiseach said that throughout the negotiations, it was clear a backstop was needed.

“This is now fully spelt out,” he said. “We have that if all other efforts fail to provide a better solution.”
He added it was crucial that any decision to withdraw from these arrangements must be made jointly between the UK and EU.
Acknowledging Theresa May will have difficulty in securing the deal in Westminster, Varadkar said it was impossible to predict how the House of Commons would vote.
He said he hadn’t spoken to either Theresa May or DUP leader Arlene Foster today.
Varadkar also said ample time will be given to discuss the matter in the Dáil in the coming days and weeks.
Concluding, the Taoiseach described his mood as pretty good.
“This is one of the better days in politics,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-raab-barnier-4194530-Aug2018/,"
LONDON AND BRUSSELS will start rolling Brexit negotiations in the final phase of talks as fears grow that Britain could leave the European Union next year without a deal, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said today.
Barnier and his British counterpart Dominic Raab said after talks in Brussels that key differences remained and it was important to “intensify” the pace of negotiations.
“The negotiations are now entering the final stage. We have agreed that the EU and the UK will negotiate continuously from now on,” Barnier said after meeting the UK’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab in Brussels.
“Dominic and I will meet regularly to take stock and move the negotiations forward.”
The Brexit talks have become stuck on fundamental issues including how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and the North after the UK leaves the EU’s single market, and on the future trading relationship.
The two sides have just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s divorce from the European Union — set for March 29, 2019 — must be forged in principle by October or November.
Raab — whose predecessor David Davis resigned in July over differences with Prime Minister Theresa May’s negotiating strategy — said that he would be back in Brussels next week for further talks.
“We have agreed that we need to step up the intensity of the negotiations,” he added.
“If we have that ambition, that pragmatism, that energy on both sides, I’m confident we can reach a deal in October,” he said.

‘Picking up the intensity’
Until now there have been separate “rounds” of Brexit talks every few weeks, but the pace has increased noticeably since Raab took over from Davis, who made just a handful of visits this year.
Leaving without a deal could hamper exports to the EU, Britain’s largest market, as it would end tariff-free trade.
Raab played down talk of a “no deal” scenario, saying only that Britain had to be ready for “all eventualities”.
“Our actions speak louder than words. We’re out here, I’m here seeing Michel again, I should be returning next week. We’re going to be picking up the intensity of the negotiations — we agree on that — at a political level,” he said.
Barnier said the main challenge in the coming months was to set the shape of the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU, saying it was a “partnership that has no precedent.”
May’s strategy calls for largely frictionless trade with the EU, but Brussels has warned that Britain cannot expect all the benefits of the single market without also respecting rules on free immigration within the 28-nation bloc.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was set today to once again warn that a Brexit with no deal could threaten the continent’s unity for a generation, according to his office.
“One of the biggest threats to European unity would be a chaotic no-deal Brexit,” Hunt was to say in a speech at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, according to excerpts provided by the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, British Trade Secretary Liam Fox urged Britain to look beyond Brexit as he unveiled the government’s future strategy to become an “exporting superpower”.
A key problem for Britain is its aim to stay part of the EU’s customs regime while also being able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.
“It’s really important that we don’t have such a narrow bandwidth that we only think about Brexit,” Fox told a business audience in London.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-eu-plans-4405140-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|19 Dec 2018

THE EUROPEAN UNION has adopted backup plans to protect air transport and financial markets in the event Britain leaves without a Brexit deal in 100 days.
And the bloc promised that British citizens living in Europe would continue to enjoy residents’ rights “provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK”.
EU officials insist the measures would not mean Britain can quit the union painlessly, but that it is important for “time-limited” measures to “mitigate” the harm.
“The best, if you talk in terms of the economy and avoiding disruptions, is to stay within the EU,” European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters.
“Then, if the decision on Brexit is taken, of course, withdrawal or Brexit with a deal is better than withdrawal with no deal,” the former Latvian prime minister said.
“In case of no deal scenario, doing some preparation to minimise damage is better than no preparation at all.”
Other measures include aviation rules, which Tánaiste Simon Coveney said tonight wouldn’t be “pretty”: it would mean that getting a connecting flight within the EU when travelling from the UK could mean additional checks.
In relation to a hard border, although the Irish government has said that they have made no preparations for a hard border in it’s contingency plan, the no-deal arrangements set out by the EU suggest there will have to be some infrastructure.
Although a specific Irish border, or plans to build customs checks in Ireland, aren’t specifically mentioned, the European Commission stated:
“In case of no-deal, simplified border controls (limited to documentary checks, forinstance) will apply to live animals and animal products coming from a MemberState but transiting through the UK.
UK driving licenses will continue to be recognised in the EU in a no-deal Brexit scenario, the Commission said.
‘Major disruption’
The European Commission said it was acting “to ensure that the necessary contingency measures can enter into application on 30 March 2019 in order to limit the most significant damage caused by a ‘no-deal’ scenario”.
The package covers 14 areas where a “no-deal” Brexit ”would create major disruption for citizens and businesses” including in financial services, air transport, customs and climate policy.

Brussels hopes it will not have to activate its plan if Prime Minister Theresa May persuades a sceptical British parliament to endorse a broad withdrawal deal she struck with European leaders last month.
But the bill’s passage is far from certain and today, Britain announced its own contingency plans to prevent shortages and economic instability in the event it crashes out of the bloc without a deal.
Under the plan, the European Union will allow UK-based financial operators to continue to access European markets for 12 months under a “temporary and conditional equivalence” period to prevent disruption.
Europe will allow British flights to continue to access the “Single European Sky” air traffic control area for 12 months and extend some aviation licences for nine months after 29 March.
There will also be measures to allow UK firms temporary access to the EU emissions trading market and new customs regulations to oversee trade with Britain as an outside party.
No-confidence vote
While Dombrovskis would not confirm the plans add up to what pro-Brexit politicians in Britain have started referring to as a “managed no-deal”, the decision will fuel the debate in London.
The announcement in Brussels came as May was under withering fire in London for delaying a parliamentary vote on the Brexit withdrawal deal that her negotiators hammered out over 17 months.
The Labour Party has demanded a no-confidence vote against May, while pro-European groups, including the Scottish National Party, seek a motion against the government as a whole.
Neither initiative is likely to come to a vote, meaning that the withdrawal plan will probably be put before lawmakers in mid-January.
May survived a separate confidence vote tabled by members of her own Conservative Party last week, but she came out of the process badly bruised and the Brexit vote could still go against her.
‘Watching in horror’
European leaders insist they will not renegotiate the terms of the divorce, and the deadlock in Westminster has raised the prospects of either a second referendum or of a no-deal Brexit.
Yesterday, May’s government announced no-deal plans, including drastic measures such as stockpiling imported chemicals to ensure safe drinking water and special flights to ensure supplies of medicine.
But Britain’s five leading business associations warned that companies have been “watching in horror as politicians have focused on factional disputes rather than practical steps that business needs to move forward”.

The lack of progress in the negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement has been very disappointing. We still need to see detailed proposals from the UK on how it intends to deliver on the clear commitments it made in December and March.”
The bloc’s 27 leaders meeting without Britain will largely work off proposals set down with great pomp by France and Germany, known as the Meseberg Declaration, after the site of a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron.
Europe’s twin engines of EU unity, France and Germany make up nearly half of the eurozone economy. But smaller members, led by the Netherlands, have voiced their irritation at having the EU’s future announced from on high by the bloc’s biggest powers.
Deep divisions are expected to surface over migration, with warnings that failure to act could fuel authoritarian and populist movements.
While the bloc has drastically curbed the flow of migrants since the 2015 crisis, it remains split over how to cut arrivals further, and over what to do with people once they do reach Europe’s shores.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-suns-front-page-brexit-4066454-Jun2018/,"A LOT OF people are talking about The Sun’s UK front page today.
Images of ‘classic’ British places and things feature on the newspaper’s cover, which is emblazoned with the words ‘Great Britain or Great Betrayal’. Even the Loch Ness monster features.
The SunThe Sun
The article in question is about Brexit, in case you didn’t guess, and the opening line reads: “Rebel Tory MPs could today destroy their Prime Minister, their Government and the Brexit the 17.4 million majority voted for.”
The House of Commons in London will later today vote on whether to give MPs a decisive say on the final Brexit deal struck between Britain and the European Union.
This morning Justice MinisterPhillip Lee resignedin order to voice his criticism of the Conservative Party’s approach to Brexit.
While today’s edition of the newspaper may become a much-wanted souvenir, particularly for pro-Brexiteers, others have criticised the cover.
Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston tweeted that The Sun’s “ignorant headlines & soundbites” may actually be what betrays Britain “when the consequences of a hard Brexit smash into people’s lives”.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, said newspaper editors who think they can “intimidate and threaten members of parliament” are “a real and present danger to our democracy”.

On 10 October 1957 a fire, the worst nuclear accident in Great Britain’s history, happened at the site. No one died as a direct result of the fire but it’s believed that more than 200 people may have developed cancer due to the subsequent radioactive contamination.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-backstop-ireland-4410279-Dec2018/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said that some legislators in Westminster “do need to remind themselves of why we’re talking about a backstop in the first place”, and the primary responsibility for the border issue now lies in London.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs was speaking today about the importance of the backstop which he said had become “the accepted solution” on the issue of the Irish border after long, protracted negotiations.
He said it would be foolish at this stage – with less than 100 days to go until Britain is due to leave the EU – to focus on alternatives “that are not easily found”, and that opponents of the backstop in Westminster have not put any forward because such proposals are “not credible”.
The backstop is the main sticking point for Brexiteers in the deal struck by Theresa May’s government with the EU.  The backstop would ensure that Northern Ireland stays “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
To avoid a border, it means there would have to be the same or similar custom rules and regulations for products, food, animals, people and vehicles between the UK and the EU – or Northern Ireland and the EU.
Prime Minister May cancelled a vote on her Brexit deal last week because it was clear that she wouldn’t win the vote in the House of Commons, such is the opposition to her deal and its backstop. The vote is now due to be held next month.

Coveney said that given the UK government had reached an agreement with the EU, the focus should now be on making this compromise work.
“For us to be talking about and exploring other options not easily put together is not wise,” he said.
Coveney was also questioned if Ireland’s relationship with the UK had become an “us vs them” style situation, given recent comments by the likes of Conservative MPs Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg.
The Tánaiste said: “I’m not going to get into commenting on Jacob Rees Mogg or the comments he makes, apart from saying the Irish government from the very outset saw the dangers and continues to see the dangers of the potential corrosive effect of border infrastructure in terms of upsetting the normality.
Coveney also defended Theresa May and praised her for being a strong advocate on the backstop, which he emphasised would only be temporary if it was ever used at all.
He said that the backstop was a fall back that would only be used if all else fails, and attempts to distract from its importance given the history of the island and the Good Friday Agreement wasn’t helpful.
He added: “Whether parliamentarians want to try gloss over that, and create a political narrative not based on reality… well that’s a matter for them.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-no-confidence-4389715-Dec2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is facinga vote of confidencebattle from within her own party, forcing her to leave the Brexit deal aside and fight to keep the premiership.
To trigger the vote, 15% of the parliamentary party, or at least 48 Tory MPs, needed to back holding a vote of no confidence, the threshold of which was reached last night. A ballot will be taken between 6-8pm in the House of Commons today, the result will be announced after 9pm.
For May to lose the vote, 158 Tory MPs need to vote against her (that’s half of the total number of 315 Conservative MPs) – but political analysts are saying that if over 100 or 120 MPs vote against her, although she would win the vote, it might force her to resign anyway.
So far, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove have said that they would back the Prime Minister (all possible successors to May as Tory leader).
But the vote of confidence will be held in secret, so it’s possible that those who come out publicly to support her will vote against her in private.
If May wins, another vote of no confidence cannot be held for another year.
However, if she loses it triggers a leadership battle which would be around 12 weeks long, and would be held between two candidates.
Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees Mogg, and Esther McVey have been suggested previously as possible candidates – they would need the backing of two MPs to be nominated.

If more than two are nominated, the shortlist would be whittled down by a series of secret votes until just two candidates are left (as was done after David Cameron’s resignation in 2016, directly after the Brexit vote).

On Monday, May announced that the UK parliament’s vote on her Brexit deal that outlines how it will leave the European Union would be postponed, so that she could seek additional assurances from European leaders on the Irish backstop.
She also wished to avoid a massive defeat that could have triggered a vote of no confidence and leadership challenge.
This angered some MPs, both within the Tory and on the opposite benches, as they wanted to vote against the deal to show their opposition to how the Brexit negotiations have been handled.
At the centre of all the disagreement, as it has been for a number of months now, is the Irish backstop. Brexiteers argued that it would unnecessarily tie the UK down and prevent them from striking new trade deals, but the EU and Ireland wanted it to secure the Northern Ireland Peace Process against any political uncertainty in the UK government (proven valid by today’s events, you’d imagine).
Theresa May had been meeting with European leaders including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
May was due to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this afternoon, but as she’s due to give a key speech to her party members just before the confidence vote (at 5pm), that trip has been cancelled.
Theresa May was also due to meet DUP leader Arlene Foster this afternoon.

So… what about Brexit?
In her speech given on the steps of 10 Downing Street this morning, May said that if a leadership battle was sparked now, that it would almost certainly delay or call off the Brexit process.
A new leader wouldn’t be in place by the 21 January, which is the final date by which the House of Commons can ratify (or approve) May’s Brexit deal, she argued.
If it’s any later than that, the Article 50 will need to be extended, which the EU has indicated it would only extend by a matter of weeks, and only if it was certain that a deal would be passed.

Lord Heseltine: ""What's the point of changing the singer if you don't change the song?""
In her speech, May also said that it wouldn’t be possible for a successor to renegotiate a new Brexit deal by 29 March (assuming the EU would want to renegotiate, its officials have repeatedly said they wouldn’t), meaning Brexit would have to be delayed or abandoned entirely.
At the moment, the most likely outcome is that Theresa May will pass the vote of no confidence, but will be significantly weaker afterwards.
If May does win the vote, asBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg puts it, both sides will be left in limbo as May won’t have the support to pass a Brexit deal and MPs won’t have the power to oust her for another year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-delay-vote-4400404-Dec2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said the crucial House of Commons vote on the Brexit deal will take place in the middle of January.
May, addressing the UK parliament this afternoon, said that MPs will be able to vote on the controversial deal in the week starting 14 January.
The prime minister returned meet her EU counterparts over the last week where she told MPs she received further clarity on the proposed backstop. The backstop would come in the form of a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement, with specific rules for Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, May postponed the vote on the deal as it appeared it was to be heavily defeated.

May also warned that a second Brexit referendum would do “irreparable damage” to British politics when she addresses the House of Commons today.
“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,” she is expected to tell parliament, according to extracts from her speech released by Downing Street.
“Anther vote… would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics and to our precious United Kingdom.”
May has long faced calls for a second referendum to resolve the impasse over the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
However, the British Prime Minister has argued that this would betray the 2016 result and undermine public confidence in politics.
Campaigners for another referendum believe that May’s comments demonstrate that the idea is being taken seriously.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-uk-cabinet-4401371-Dec2018/,"THE BRITISH CABINET is set to discuss whether the government should escalate its preparations for a no-deal Brexit when it meets this morning, the BBC is reporting.
Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said that preparing for a no-deal Brexit was the right course of action for the government despite the fact that they want to avoid it.
“I think it is right and proper that we maintain our work on preparing for a no-deal, however reluctantly,” he told BBC radio.
Thenewscomes after opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday tabled a non-binding no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Theresa May after she told MPs they will only get a delayed vote on her Brexit deal in the new year.
May said a vote on the deal – which was postponed on December 11 to avoid defeat – would be held in the week beginning 14 January.
Corbyn said the move was “the only way I can think of ensuring a vote takes place this week”.
The government must agree to the non-binding vote and even if successful it would not automatically trigger May’s downfall.
House of Commons authorities said the government will decide whether the motion is debated and voted on, but noted it is “parliamentary convention that any such request be granted”.
Alettersigned by 53 business leaders has been published in the Daily Telegraph today calling on May to “take her deal to the British people”.
“The prime minister abandoned the most important vote in the House of Commons for a generation because she knew she could not secure a parliamentary majority for her deal,” the letter reads.
May last week survived a party confidence vote initiated by her own Conservative colleagues opposed to her Brexit strategy, but emerged badly wounded after a third of her parliamentary party voted to oust her.
A vote of no-confidence from a majority in the House of Commons could leave her authority further weakened – and potentially prompt another vote in her entire government and a general election.
The UK is set to leave the European Union on March 29 next year, but the prime minister is struggling to persuade parliament to accept the divorce deal she struck last month with the bloc after 18 months of tortuous talks.
If parliament fails to approve the text, Britain could crash out of the EU with no deal – a prospect that experts warn could lead to serious trade disruption and trigger a financial crisis.

May insisted yesterday that she was continuing to seek “assurances” from the EU over elements of her plan.
However European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said “no further meetings with the United Kingdom are foreseen”.
The delay has angered members of her own party and Labour opposition politicians, who accused her of trying to “run down the clock” ahead of Britain’s withdrawal to increase pressure on them to back the deal.
“The prime minister has cynically run down the clock, trying to manoeuvre parliament into a choice between two unacceptable outcomes” – her deal or no deal, Corbyn said.
“It’s… unacceptable that we should be waiting almost a month before we have a meaningful vote on the crucial issue facing the future of this country.”
‘Another referendum’
May is again facing more calls for a second referendum to resolve the impasse, with dozens of MPs from all sides now supporting another poll and reports that May’s officials are considering the possibility.
But the prime minister has argued vehemently that this would betray the 2016 result and undermine public confidence in politics.
“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,” she told parliament on Monday.
“Another vote… would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics,” May said, adding that a second vote “would likely leave us no further forward”.
The issue provoked an extraordinary public clash on Sunday between May and former prime minister Tony Blair, a leading supporter of continued EU membership and of holding another poll.
May accused Blair of insulting voters and trying to undermine her government by meeting officials in Brussels.
Blair, who was premier between 1997 and 2007, in turn accused the Conservative leader of being “irresponsible”.

This is the view Boris Johnson will come out to in 20 mins. Packed.pic.twitter.com/sZUZGvmSoU
PROMINENT BREXITEER BORIS Johnson has appeared to rule out a leadership bid in the first few minutes of his much-anticipated speech at the Conservative Party Conference this afternoon.
Calling the Irish backstop “constitutionally abominable” and saying that the EU effectively wanted “to parade the UK down the street in manacles”, he called on Tory party members to “chuck Chequers” and come up with an alternative plan.
Hundreds gathered ahead of the former Foreign Minister’s address, to hear Johnson’s Brexit plan and what could become a leadership bid. Meanwhile, Tory leader Theresa May gave a speech on limiting migration in what was seen as an attempt to distract.
But Johnson ruled the leadership bid out almost from the offset, saying that the Chancellor’s prediction that “Boris Johnson would never be Prime Minister” is the only prediction the Treasury has had that has a chance of coming true.
He repeated the mantra “taking back control”, which was used by Leave campaigners during the 2016 referendum, calling for a desire for British sovereignty.
He said that it made sense in previous years that the UK would join the EU, but not now “when 95% of the world’s growth will be outside the EU”.
“Of course the EU will be of colossal importance to us,” he added.
Brexit speech

Johnson attracted rounds of applause for a number of statements he gave on Brexit and the possible trade deals they would get, with “chuck Chequers” gathering the loudest cheers.
“This is the moment to do that there is time to chuck Chequers – to scrap the Commission’s constitutionally abominable Northern Ireland backstop, to use the otherwise redundant transition period to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement, to invest in all the customs procedures we will need to ensure frictionless trade, and to prepare much more vigorously than hitherto for coming out on WTO terms.”
World Trade Agreement (WTO) terms are those that would be automatically imposed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
During his speech, he said that “banning diabetics from driving, banning vaping, all this nonsense we would have to implement” without ability to change it themselves, under May’s Chequers plan.

“It’s a constitutional outrage – it’s not taking back control, it’s forfeiting control.
He made criticisms of the EU and said that they wanted to punish the UK for leaving.
“What they want above all is to demonstrate is you cannot leave the EU without suffering the consequences,” he said, adding that the EU effectively wanted to parade the UK down the street in manacles.
“If we cheat the electorate, and Chequers is a cheat, we will escalate that sense of mistrust. We will give credence to those who cried betrayal and we will make it more likely that the beneficiary of Chequers is the far-right, possibly Ukip.”
Taking aim at the Labour party, Johnson said that the Tories cannot stand by and let a “cabal” of “Marxist apologists” reverse Brexit and takeover the country, calling Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn “a patsy of the EU”.
He also said that it was time “we brought back systematic stop-and-search that ends the politically correct nonsense, and to protect the people in our capital and elsewhere”.
Johnson resigned from May’s government after she revealed her Chequers plan for Brexit, which Johnson and other Brexiteers criticised as failing to uphold the values based on which people voted for Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/economy-ireland-4404109-Dec2018/,"THE RISING COST of living, the potential impact of Brexit and severe housing shortages are all a threat to Ireland’s economic future, according to a new report.
The National Competitiveness Council today published Ireland’s Competitiveness Challenge 2018 report, which looks at our international ranking when it comes to the competitiveness of our economy.
The report looks at a number of factors when determining the country’s economic forecast, and lays out the potential issues that will affect the country’s competitiveness in the future.
It finds that as economic conditions continue to improve in the country, Ireland remains “a competitive economy”.
However, Professor Peter Clinch, chairman of the NCC, said that against the backdrop of a worsening international climate, looking at the stats shows the “fragilities in the economy”.
“Ireland is facing a significant competitiveness loss as the economy heats up and prices and living costs rise,” said Clinch.

“The overall performance of the economy, and government finances, are dependent on a small number of firms in a small number of sectors.
“Moreover, the majority of Irish-owned firms export a small number of products to a small number of destinations.
Strongoutlook
The report finds, however, that despite the negative factors, Ireland’s competitiveness position “remains strong”, but the outlook is “less positive”.
“On closer inspection, there have been some very concerning developments this year, recognised internationally through Ireland’s fall in the major global competitiveness rankings,” the NCC said.
Issues identified by the NCC as having a negative impact on the country include:
The recommendations from the NCC state that the country should seek to ensure sustainability in the economic model and maintain cost competitiveness.

WE’VE HAD A good few moments during the past few months where Brexit has highlighted the ignorance of a number of British politicians about Northern Ireland.
Two of the most recent examples were when formerForeign Secretary Boris Johnson said that the Irish border problem was “a millenium bug”issue; another was whenNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradleysaid that when she was appointed, she didn’t understand why unionists didn’t vote for nationalist parties and vice versa.
So it came as a bit of a shock to people when they heard Labour MP Stephen Pound not only explain why Brexit makes the Irish border so problematic, but describe it with such passion.
Speaking to Channel 4 News, the Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland said at the Labour party conference that the border issue was “life and death to the people of Ireland”.
“If you look at the border, 302 miles long, if you think that a camera up a pole can actually provide a border security alert – that will become a target.
He rubbished claims that the Swedish/Norway border could be replicated in Ireland to solve issues.

“The Swedish/Norway border closes at 10 o’clock at night, and there are more crossing points between Monaghan and Northern Ireland than there are between the whole of Sweden and Norway.”
Sinn Féin Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond are among the Irish figures who praised Pound for his informed commentary.
“The tragedy of Irish history is that we have had so many English politicians like Jacob Rees Mogg and so few like Stephen Pound,” Mac Lochlainn said, who’s from Donegal.
Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was criticisedearlier this yearfor saying that the UK should “call Ireland’s bluff” on the border issue.
There’s been a ramping up in tensions between the EU and UK brexit negotiating teams in the past week after UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan was criticised as unworkable. May responded with a statement the following day saying the UK deserved to be treated with respect.
Media reports indicated that the British premier was blindsided by EU leaders’ criticism of her plan in Salzburg, while a similar volume of reports said that the EU were not concerned by her fiery response from 10 Downing Street, saying that it was posturing after being politically wounded.
May has promised to put forward the UK’s suggestion for a detailed, workable solution for the Irish border in the event that the UK leaves the Single Market and the Customs Union, as they have promised to do.
Depending on how the EU respond to those proposals, the final Brexit deal will be agreed and be put to a vote in the EU and in the UK House of Commons.
The UK is scheduled to officially leave the European Union on the 29 March next year, deal or no deal (more on the Brexit timeline here).

https://www.thejournal.ie/significant-increase-gardai-brexit-3951512-Apr2018/,"A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE in the number of Gardaí assigned to the border will be needed in light of Brexit, the president of the organisation that represents senior Garda officers said this morning.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Ireland, Noel Cunningham, President of the Association of Garda Superintendents, said that “crime corridors” had been created along the border with Northern Ireland in recent years.
The number of police in the area had fallen as a result of the peace process, he said, and rates of ordinary crime had risen as a result.
This, combined with the potential for a hard border or for different customs rules to exist in Ireland and Northern Ireland after the UK leaves the EU, means there’ll be a greated demand on garda resources, he said.
Any strain on resources created by Brexit will affect the whole country, he said.
“It’s not just across the border, this will have implications for all the specialist units, it’ll have implications for intelligence gathering units, it will have implications right down across the country.”

While the specifics of how the border will work after Brexit are not yet known, Cunningham is calling for a review into what the implications may be for crime and policing.
“A bit of strategic planning, a bit of pre-planning, will make sure the proper resources are in the proper places. We need a piece of work to look at what the implications may be and decide what exactly is needed.
The opening of the border, while welcome, has made it “easier for criminals to move forward and back,” Cunningham said.
“They will engage in criminal activity and it’s more difficult to police when the numbers on the border have decreased, as they have as a result of the peace process, and this is creating a difficulty for us.”
Rates of so-called “ordinary crime”, such as burglaries, have increased “exponentially” in the past 15 to 20 years, he claimed.
“There would have been no ordinary crime in the 1980s. We would have been dealing with the terrorist campaign. Now we have criminals coming from Belfast, we have criminals coming from both North and South of the border, we have criminals from Dublin, and they’re using the lower numbers of policing members on the border.

AMBER RUDD BROKE ranks among UK Cabinet ministers yesterday, and signalled a “plausible argument” could be made for a second referendum if the House of Commons is unable to agree a way forward on Brexit.
Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, the Work and Pensions Secretary said that while she personally did not support another referendum, she could understand why calls for one would grow if parliament remained at its current impasse.
“I have said I don’t want a people’s vote or a referendum in general, but if parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus, I can see there will be a plausible argument,” Rudd said.
She added that it was incumbent on MPs to find the centre ground and reach a consensus, and that she believed the British people didn’t want to be asked to vote again.
“I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again, much as it would distress many of my colleagues,” the minister added.

Her comments came amidst ongoing chaos in Westminster, following Theresa May’s cancellation of her Brexit vote in the House of Commons and repeated challenges to her leadership from in and outside her party.
This vote is due to be held next month, but it remains unlikely May will get it through given that she postponed the vote originally because the numbers weren’t there for her to win.
The backstop that would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland remains a crucial sticking point for hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative party and the DUP, meaning May is left bereft of a majority to get her deal through.
Given this impasse, the threat of a no-deal looms larger with less than 100 days until Britain formally leaves the EU.
Last night, the Irish governmentpublished its preparations thus far for a no-deal Brexit.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the plan makes for a “stark” and “sobering” read, and said that this wasn’t a plan to keep things as they are, but a “damage-limiting exercise”.
The British Cabinet also agreed this week to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, as that prospect looks increasingly likely.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-customs-union-3999262-May2018/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS described Britain’s post-Brexit customs plans as “crazy”.
A so-called customs partnership is one of the options on the table, and would involve the UK collecting import tariffs on behalf of the European Union (EU).

In an interview with theDaily Mail, the UK’s Foreign Secretary said the proposal would create “a whole new web of bureaucracy”.
Such a plan is reported to be backed by Prime Minister Theresa May. Conservative Party ministers failed to agree on a customs arrangement last week.
Speaking about the proposal, Johnson said: “It’s totally untried and would make it very, very difficult to do free trade deals.
“If you have the new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting the tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier.

“If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there’s nothing you can do.
“That’s not taking back control of your trade policy, it’s not taking back control of your laws, it’s not taking back control of your borders, and it’s actually not taking back control of your money either because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last week said there is a risk that the EU and UK willfail to reach a withdrawal dealbefore an October deadline. He said the “sands were still shifting” but that a lot of progress still needs to be made before Britain officially leaves the EU next year.

A NEW ANALYSIS of Brexit polling suggests that a huge amount of UK constituencies that voted to leave the EU would now vote differently.
The study of Brexit polls, conducted by consumer analysts Focaldata andseen by the Observer newspaper, concludes that as many as 112 constituencies that voted to exit the bloc would now reverse that vote.
Focaldata’s  study was jointly commissioned by Best for Britain, an entity campaigning against Brexit, and Hope not Hate, an anti-racism group.
The chief cohort of voters who have changed their mind are Labour supporters who voted against the EU but who now harbour significant doubts as to how the situation is being handled, according to the analysis.
Two of those 100 constituencies belong to Conservative MPs Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, two of the chief architects of the Leave vote.

It means that a majority of British constituencies would now vote to Remain were such a referendum to be held.
Negotations
Focaldata compiled the analysis by breaking down two separate YouGov polls of more than 15,000 people conducted both before and after UK prime minister Theresa May published her proposed Brexit negotiating stance last month.
That proposal eventually led to the resignation of many of her cabinet colleagues, including that of Johnson himself as foreign secretary.
The study shows that of the 632 seats in England, Scotland and Wales investigated by Focaldata, 112 have switched their allegiances. 97 of those that switched are English, with 14 in Wales.
Overall the model matches a YouGov poll released onthe same subject last week, with Remain emerging victorious in any prospective repeat referendum by a margin of 53% to 47%.
The poll suggests turbulent times ahead for May as she attempts to get her own shaky government to align coherently for the coming negotiations.
Lasw week her trade secretary Liam Fox suggested that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit now stands at 60%:40%.

https://www.thejournal.ie/liam-fox-brexit-deal-4165620-Aug2018/,"THE CHANCE OF a no-deal Brexit is growing, Liam Fox has warned, as he blamed the “intransigence” of the European Commission.
The UK international trade secretary put the chances of a no-deal departure at “60-40″.
Speaking to the Sunday Times, Fox said that he had previously not thought the prospects of a no-deal Brexit were “more than 50-50″, however, added that the risk of no trade deal had increased.
Pressure is growing on British Prime Minister Theresa May to win allies on the continent after her “Chequers plan” prompted two top ministers in her cabinet to resign in protest last month.
May has just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s divorce from the EU — set for 29 March 2019 — must be forged in principle ahead of a European summit in mid-October.
Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier has already shot down May’s proposed solution to keeping the frontier between the UK and EU member Ireland open without a “hard border”.

Under May’s proposal, a dual system of taxation would be introduced which would see taxes levied by each side of the Irish border for the benefit of the other.
Fox has said that he thinks “the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal”.
“We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it’s a bureaucrats’ Brexit – not a people’s Brexit – and then there is only going to be one outcome,” he said.
He added that Barnier had rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest plan, agreed by her cabinet, on the grounds that “we have never done it before” and argued that it “makes the chance of no deal greater”.
Fox then called on the EU to provide a solution of its own and “show us one that they can suggest would be acceptable to us”.
“It’s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission’s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies,” he said.
May met with French President Emmanuel Macron on the Mediterranean coast on Friday to lobby for her Brexit plan, which has divided her government and so far failed to win over EU negotiators.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-russia-4063095-Jun2018/,"
A MAJOR BREXIT campaign donor held two previously undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador before and after the 2016 referendum and was offered a deal on six gold mines in Russia, The Sunday Times reported.
Arron Banks, the outspoken founder of the Leave.eu campaign, was introduced to London envoy Alexander Yakovenko by Alexander Udod, a “suspected Russian intelligence officer”, the report said.
Banks has also reportedly admitted that he handed over phone numbers for members of Donald Trump’s transition team to Russian officials, after meeting with the US president-elect in November 2016 in New York.
Asked about the report at the G7 summit in Canada today, Prime Minister Theresa May said:
Senior cabinet minister David Lidington told the BBC today that the allegations were “serious” and should be looked into by the authorities.
The paper said the revelations raised “explosive questions about attempts by Russia to influence the referendum result” but Banks dismissed them as part of a “witch-hunt” against Brexit and Trump.
‘Family trip’ to Moscow
Banks, an insurance industry millionaire, has previously said he had “a six-hour boozy lunch” with Yakovenko at the Russian embassy on 6 November, 2015.
Citing email correspondence, the Sunday Times said that meeting was set up by Udod and that he was one of 23 suspected Russian spies expelled by Britain following the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March.
The paper quoted Andy Wigmore, a close associate of Banks who was present at the meeting, as saying that they did not offer “any information to (the ambassador) or any Russian any details of our campaign”.
The report said Banks and Wigmore met with Yakovenko again for a cup of tea on 17 November at a meeting that also included mining magnate Siman Povarenkin to discuss a deal involving six gold mines in Russia.
Banks, who is married to a Russian woman, then visited Russia in February 2016 at the height of the EU referendum campaign for what he said was “a family trip” that involved no meetings with Russian officials.

The paper said the Brexit campaigners subsequently invited Yakovenko and Udod to a drinks party in London’s Notting Hill hosted by Banks, and the Russian ambassador was also asked to attend their results party in Westminster.
Banks and Wigmore were invited back to meet Yakovenko after they, and Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage, met with Trump in November 2016 shortly after his election.
“The ambassador was obviously keen to know how our meeting (with Trump) went,” Wigmore said.
‘Bite me’
The Sunday Times report was based on emails passed to the paper by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghostwrote Banks’s memoir – The Bad Boys of Brexit – and is now writing a book on Russian attempts to influence British politics.
The paper said she came forward after she said her email accounts were hacked.
“Banks and Wigmore were shamelessly used by the Russians,” Oakeshott said in the Sunday Times.
But Banks told the paper:
He said nothing came of the discussion over the gold mine deal, saying:
He also told the paper that he had disclosed details of his contacts with the Russians to US officials.
“We actually saw the suits from the American embassy who introduced us to the State Department to explain what had happened and then we briefed the Americans on our meetings with the Russians,” he said.
Former FBI director Robert Mueller is currently investigating any possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 election campaign team and Russia.
Trump has branded the investigation a “witch hunt”.

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs has criticised a senior Tory Brexiteer, who claimed that the Irish border could be subject to inspections “just like during the Troubles”.
A video shared widely on social media shows Jacob Rees-Mogg saying that the issue of the Irish border after Brexit could be solved by continuing “historic arrangements”.
He said that Ireland would “not be a free for all”, even if no agreement is reached on trade and customs arrangement between the UK and EU.
The Brexit talks have been stuck for quite some time on a set of fundamental issues, including how a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be avoided and the future trading relationship between the UK and EU.

The MP for north-east Somerset said: “It would be possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people could get into the UK to leave us in just as bad a position as we are in.
These comments drew a withering response from Minister Coveney.
He said: “It’s hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill-informed about Ireland and the politics of the #Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these.
It’s hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill informed about Ireland + the politics of the#BrexitIrish border issue that he could make comments like these.

Rees-Mogg has become increasingly influential within the Conservative party since the Brexit vote, but has no cabinet post in Theresa May’s government.
He has repeatedly been in the headlines for his extremely hardline stance on Brexit.
Negotiations continued this week between the UK and EU, with October or November the latest a deal could be reached before the UK leaves in March 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ahern-blair-may-4398464-Dec2018/,"FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has ripped into Theresa May’s handling of the Brexit negotiations, saying that she had “no plan” when triggering Article 50.
Article 50 is the legal mechanism which begins the process of a country leaving the EU and Ahern said she shouldn’t have used it when she did.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Marian Finucane show, Ahern said that any sympathy he has for the British Prime Minister is on a personal level only.
“I do have some sympathy for Theresa May, but only on a personal level. I watched her there being lambasted, she tried to make a speech the other day, she was exactly 50 seconds into it when they started heckling her,” he said.
“Then she decided to ignore parliament and do a tour of the country. Last night she’s lecturing Tony Blair because she said they can’t abdicate the results of the decision. So I’m afraid Theresa May has made a lot of mistakes.”
Ahern went on to say that he’s “still worried” about Ireland’s position because “they game is still being played” and the backstop is under attack from Brexiteers.
“All the debates during the week and the attacks on Ireland and the backstop. The Brexiteers and some others as well, I see Niall Fitzgerald, formerly of Unilever, a prominent Irish business person, and others are saying the backstop, we have to go softer on the backstop,” Ahern said.
“The reason the Brexiteers are trying to get rid of it is because they have copped on late, I think our negotiators did a good job, but they’ve copped on late that they could be stuck with the backstop for a long time, but that’s the very point. The backstop has to stay until there’s something better and if there’s nothing better we have to hold the customs union, so we can’t give an inch on it.”

The spat that Ahern mentioned between May and Blair saw the current Prime Minister accuse the former of insulting voters and trying to undermine her government with calls for a second referendum.
“For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served,” May said in a statement issued late last night.
“We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision. Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for.”
Blair, who was Labour prime minister between 1997 and 2007, then today accused the Conservative leader of being “irresponsible”.
“The sensible thing is now to allow parliament to vote on each of the forms of Brexit canvassed, including the prime minister’s deal,” he said in a statement.
“If they can’t reach agreement then the logical thing is to go back to the people.”
He added: “What is irresponsible however is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out (of the EU) without a deal.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-northern-ireland-4095316-Jun2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is to visit Northern Ireland in the next few weeks, she told the House of Commons today.
During Prime Minister’s Questions today, the Tory leader said that the visit was related to Brexit and the collapse of the Stormont government.
“We are considering a number of issues in relation to Northern Ireland at the moment, in the context of both Brexit and the devolved administration,” she told MPs.
“We hope that the administration and the assembly will get back up and running.”
The Stormont Assembly collapsed 18 months ago after Sinn Féin withdrew its support for the Executive over the cash-for-ash scandal. After this, a series of negotiations and talks got underway to try and get a devolved government back up and running in Northern Ireland, but to no avail.
Civil servants are now making decisions to keep services in the North running – some of which are being questioned and reviewed. The absence of an Assembly means that no legislation has been put forward or debated.
Westminster has already passed a budget for Northern Ireland, but there’s talk of direct rule being implemented if the current political stalemate between Sinn Féin and the DUP, the two power-sharing parties in the north, continues.

The DUP is also supporting Theresa May’s minority government after a snap election in June last year.
Brexit
Reacting to the news of the British premier’s visit, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that May’s visit was in response to a request from his party.
“The DUP invited the Prime Minister to visit Northern Ireland once again and I welcome the confirmation today that she will be taking up that invitation in the next few weeks,” Dodds said.
The UK’s decision to leave the European Union has thrown the future of Northern Ireland into doubt. If the UK leaves customs union and the single market, and doesn’t strike a deal with the EU that would confirm similar customs regulation, then a border could go up on the island of Ireland to check products and goods.
If there is no deal struck between the UK and the EU (and remember that they need agreement on every issue to get a final deal) then the UK would go “crashing out” of the EU and a hard border would automatically go up.
The UK government has been criticised for repeatedly saying that it would leave the customs union and the single market, and also asserting that there would be no return ro a hard border, but without putting forward any proposals on how this could be achieved.
Today, Dodds said:
“Northern Ireland cannot continue in a vacuum. The Prime Minister’s visit will be a chance to reinforce the message that decisions must be taken in relation to our hospitals, schools and infrastructure. The imposition of red-lines on the return of devolution is impacting upon everyone who lives here.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-chequers-deal-brexit-4215908-Sep2018/,"CONSERVATIVE MP BORIS Johnson has hit out at Theresa May’s so-called Chequers plan amid speculation that he is mounting a bid to become Prime Minister.
The former foreign secretary, who resigned after the plan was announced,wrote in theSunday Telegraphthat “a victory for the EU” in ongoing Brexit negotiations was “inevitable” as a result of the proposals.
In July, May announced a government paper that Britain could leave the single market after Brexit, but also stay in a free trade area for goods and agri-foods through a customs deal and common rulebook with the EU.
However, the proposal met immediate opposition from May’s own party, with a number of MPs saying it would keep Britain too closely aligned to the bloc.
It sparked the resignations of Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, while EU leaders have repeatedly questioned its viability and said further compromises will be needed.

Writing in his column yesterday, Johnson said the plan was a “white flag fluttering”, adding that the EU had “so far taken every important trick” during Brexit negotiations.
“The UK has agreed to hand over £40 billion of taxpayers’ money for two-thirds of diddly squat,” he said.
Johnson also said the deal meant it would be “impossible for the UK to be more competitive, to innovate, to deviate, to initiate” and ruled out “major free trade deals”.
However,Sky Newsreports thata spokesman for May hit backat Johnson’s comments, saying there were “no new ideas to respond to” in the article.
The attack has come after a number of months in which Johnson has avoided discussing Brexit in hisDaily Telegraphcolumn.
However, the former foreign secretary’s latest remarks are being seen as preparation for a leadership challenge against May.
It also followed criticism of May by former Brexit secretary David Davis, who said the British Prime Minster was mistaken for admitting she would have to make compromises to the EU beyond the Chequers agreement.

EUROPEAN UNION CHIEF Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the thorny issue of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland could sink the negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union.
“The answer is yes,” he said when asked on France Inter radio if the Irish border issue could cause the negotiations to collapse.
“I believe we need a deal. I’m not yet sure we’ll get one. It is difficult, but possible.”
European Union leaders warned Britain yesterday they would offer no more concessions to break the deadlock in Brexit negotiations, but expressed confidence that a deal can be done before the country leaves the bloc next March.
A Brussels summit wrapped up without progress after British Prime Minister Theresa May offered no new proposals, beyond suggesting she could accept a longer transition period after Brexit.

May has been struggling since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU to reconcile the demands of her eurosceptic Conservative party with the realities of negotiating with Brussels.
Her difficulties were laid bare by the fury sparked back home at her suggestion that she could extend a post-Brexit transition period to address the Irish border issue.
Both sides have agreed there should be a legally-binding “backstop” arrangement to avoid frontier checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic if and until a new trade deal solves the issue.
This would come into effect after the transition ends – but both sides strongly disagree on its terms, and the issue is holding up the rest of the Brexit talks.
Britain crashing out of the EU without an agreement is viewed as potentially catastrophic as tariffs, customs and regulatory issues could severely disrupt trade.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER and Tánaiste Simon Coveney has given a cautious welcome to news that the UK has finally agreed a Brexit negotiating strategy after months of cabinet infighting.
Late on Thursday, Theresa May’s ministerial colleagues brought an end to a day of private negotiations at the prime minister’s private retreat, Chequers, with the finalisation of a 12-point ‘collective position’ for Brexit negotiations with the EU.
May has had a mighty struggle to reach this point, with the divisions in her cabinet between hardcore pro-Brexiteers and reluctant Leavers threatening to derail the process at every turn.
However, the common perception would now seem to be that Britain has agreed a framework to allow for a so-called ‘soft’ Brexit – that is, one in which trade deals can be agreed with the EU to make the process as economically painless as possible, and, for Ireland, maintain the lack of a physical border between the Republic and the North.

The UK is set to officially leave the EU at 11pm on 29 March 2019.
‘Detailed consideration’
“The UK statement last night needs and deserves detailed consideration,” Coveney said today.
The minister maintained that Ireland’s position is “that we want to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK”.
He said that Ireland must continue to push for the ‘backstop’ arrangement – one which guarantees a soft border on the island regardless of how exit negotiations proceed.
“What is needed now is for the negotiations to be intensified. Time is short. I am in regular contact with (chief EU Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier and my officials are working day-in and day-out with the task force team he leads,” Coveney said.
“Our entire focus now is on ensuring a withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is agreed. This will give businesses across our islands certainty in terms of planning for a status-quo transition when the UK leaves the Union in March 2019,” he added.

THE UK’S BREXIT Secretary has said Britain and the European Union have reached agreements on about 80% of issues relating to Britain leaving the EU.
However, the Irish border issue remains unresolved.
Dominic Raab today outlined plans for managing the fallout in the “unlikely” scenario of Brexit talks collapsing, warning that businesses faced more customs red tape and consumers risked higher card payment charges.
He also said Britain would adopt a series of EU rules in the case of a no-deal scenario to allow EU imports in, and urged Brussels to do the same for British goods.
Raab said Britain would continue to recognise batch testing and EU certifications for medicine to avoid disruption but said the government would in any case stockpile medicines for an extra six weeks on top of the existing period of three months.
Raab insisted he was “still confident” of reaching an agreement with the EU ahead of its planned departure on 29 March 2019 and said the failure of talks was “unlikely”.
“I remain confident a good deal is within our sights, and that remains our top, and overriding, priority,” Raab said at a speech in London as the government published the first of a series of “technical notices” to advise different sectors of the economy on how to handle negotiations collapsing.

Increase in cost of card payments
“If the EU responds with the same level of ambition and pragmatism, we will strike a strong deal that benefits both sides. But we must be ready to consider the alternative,” he said.
In the scenarios outlined by the government, Britons were warned of possible “increased costs and slower processing times” for euro transactions and told that “the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU will likely increase”.
Consumers may also have to pay more for online shopping and cross-border payments would also no longer be covered by a “surcharging ban” under EU rules, the technical notices said.
Surcharges, which were banned by the EU in January, cost Britons £166 million (€185 million euros) in 2015.
Another notice advised businesses that they could face additional customs costs and should consider buying appropriate software or hiring a customs broker.
The Brexit talks have been stuck for quite some time on a set of fundamental issues, including how a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be avoided and the future trading relationship between the UK and EU.
Earlier this week, Raab held talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels with the pair pledging to meet regularly in an attempt to move negotiations forward.
A no-deal Brexit remains a distinct possibility, with international trade secretary Liam Fox saying this monththe chance of this happening was “60-40″.
Raab is only new in the job, after taking the reins from David Davis who resigned from the post of Brexit secretaryover Theresa May’s proposed strategy.

EU LEADERS HAVE warned there must be more progress in Brexit negotiations, despite hearing a personal plea by British Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday, who said she was open to a longer transition phase to unblock the talks.
European leaders had hoped to hold a special summit in November to seal the divorce, but they refused to sign off on the plan yesterday, taking the bloc a step closer to the potentially catastrophic scenario of Britain crashing out in March without a deal.
May had earlier addressed her fellow leaders, indicating that she could accept extending the post-Brexit transition phase to take the heat out the deadlocked issue of the Irish border, officials said.
But she failed to respond to a call by EU President Donald Tusk for “concrete proposals” of her own to move the talks forward.
Speaking to reporters as she arrived for a second day of EU summit talks in Brussels this morning, May confirmed she was considering extending the transition period after Brexit for a few months to give time to agree a new trade deal with the European Union.
“A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at this stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months,” she said.
“But the point is that this is not expected to be used, because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020.
“I’m clear that it is possible to do that (deal) and that is what we are working for.
“And in those circumstances, there would be no need for any proposal of this sort and I’m clear that I expect the implementation period to end at the end of December 2020.”
When the other 27 European Union leaders met without her over dinner yesterday evening, they concluded that “not enough progress has been made” in the negotiations, an EU official said.
The senior source said the leaders agreed talks should continue but, for now, they are “not planning to organise an extraordinary summit on Brexit in November”.
This could see a draft Brexit deal pushed back to a December summit, leaving little time for its ratification by the British and European parliaments.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said EU leaders had asked the bloc’s executive “to work with even more vigour on a no deal scenario”.
Irish feelings
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters yesterday that he’s open to new suggestions on how to break the Brexit deadlock but said that an extension to the transition period “couldn’t be a substitute for the backstop” on the Irish border.
According to an Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll published this morning, almost three-quarters of people believe that Ireland should stick to its position of avoiding any sort of new border with the North.
While 72% supported the government’s position, 20% said it should be prepared to compromise if it would help achieve a Brexit deal.
Separately in the poll, 54% of people said they were “very concerned” that a Brexit border could damage peace in Ireland, while 17% said they weren’t that concerned or not concerned at all.
Nothing new
Expectations were low before this week’s summit in Brussels, once dubbed a “moment of truth” for Brexit, after a breakdown in talks between the lead negotiators at the weekend.
“I hadn’t expected a breakthrough, and there wasn’t a breakthrough,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said after the dinner.

“But I am still optimistic that we can find a solution for the Brexit issue in the coming weeks or months.”
Earlier, May had urged her fellow leaders to work with her to find a “creative way out of this dilemma” on Ireland, a British official said.
“I remain confident of a good outcome. The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides,” she said.
Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, said May offered them “nothing substantially new” to discuss.
Brexit limbo
But he said she was “not against” the idea of extending the transition, a position confirmed by the EU official.
Diplomats say EU negotiator Michel Barnier is willing to add a year to the already planned 21-month post Brexit transition period, when Britain’s relationship with the bloc stays largely the same.
But the idea is controversial among May’s eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who fear it is simply a way of delaying Britain’s exit.
British newspapers led on the story today, with the tabloid Daily Mail headlining: “Another year in Brexit limbo?”

Asked about the plan, a British official said there were no plans to propose a change to the transition.
As he arrived for the Brussels meeting, Barnier had said “we need time, we need much more time” for talks, vowing to work “calmly and patiently” for a deal in the coming weeks.
The idea of extending the transition would be to give more time to negotiate a deal on future relations and find a formula to defuse the Irish border question.
Negotiations are stuck over the issue of a backstop to keep open the border between British Northern Ireland and Ireland if and until a wider trade deal can be signed that avoids the need for frontier checks.
Britain has proposed staying temporarily aligned to the EU’s customs rules, but the bloc wants this to have no end date — something her eurosceptic MPs will not accept.
The EU is also insisting on its own backstop, which would see Northern Ireland alone stay aligned with the bloc’s customs union and single market – something Britain will not accept.

TheDaily Telegraphreported this morning that Rees-Mogg will lead a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic MPs in a protest that would see them board a fishing trawler and throw fish into the River Thames outside Parliament.
The dramatic demonstration is due to take place tomorrow as MPs voice their disapproval of the Brexit transition deal which will see the European Union maintain control of British waters until the end of  2020.
Pro-Brexit campaign group Fishing for Leavesaidthe deal is an “irrevocable surrender of Britain’s fishing for a second time”.

However the prominent Tory politician says he has no involvement with the proposed demonstration.
“I’m not throwing fish anywhere. I am not a fish-thrower,” hesaidon LBC radio.
“I think this has got slightly out of hand. There was a suggestion a fishing boat should go up the Thames in protest against the delay in leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, but I won’t be throwing fish anywhere.”
The proposed stunt would be reminiscent of the famous stand-off during the EU referendum campaign which saw Brexiteer boats clash with Remainer boats in the middle of London’s famous river.
The bizarre incident saw Sir Bob Geldof use a loud-speaker to heckle leave campaigner Nigel Farage. The Boomtown Rats front man labelled Farage a “fraud” and made a lewd gesture at the MEP.

The Irish frontman made the pledge in an article inthe Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaperas he argues for the future of the European project and warned about the rise of “extremist politics”.
He also felt proud about how European countries have “rallied behind Ireland” in Brexit negotiations.
Bono wrote that “Europe is a hard sell in Europe these days” and that “Europe is a thought that needs to become a feeling”.
“I’m guessing that even to a rock audience, waving an EU flag these days is either an annoyance, a bore, a kitsch reference to the Eurovision Song Contest but to some of us it has become a radical act,” Bono writes.
In the course of the article, Bono quotes John Hume and Winston Churchill and says that he loves Europe’s differences, “our dialects, our traditions, our peculiarities”, he writes.

The singer blames the loss of faith in the European idea on inequality:

Bono also speaks specifically about Ireland, saying that as a country it “has a special emotional connection to Europe.”
“Maybe it’s because Ireland is a tiny rock in a big sea, eager to be part of something larger than ourselves (for most things are larger than ourselves). Maybe it’s because we used to feel closer to Europe than we did to some of the people on our island.”
Bono also expresses his pride that other European countries have “rallied behind Ireland on the border issue” as part of the Brexit negotiations.

FORMER TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has said it’s incumbent on the British government to make sure Northern Ireland isn’t damaged by the Brexit “debacle”.
Giving the keynote John Hume lecture at the Magill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Ahern raised doubts that a withdrawal agreement can be reached by the October deadline.
Drawing laughter from the crowd, the former Fianna Fáil leader also said: “As good Irish people we’re always there to help and support the British in their hour of need.
Ahern was speaking at a time of great uncertainty about Brexit, with infighting in Theresa May’s Conservative government adding to growing concerns that the UK may leave the EU without key agreements on trade and other matters, including Northern Ireland.
On Friday, for example, May said in a speech in Belfast that he EU’s suggestion that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with EU customs regulations in the event of no other solution to the Irish border wasn’t acceptable, and wouldn’t be accepted by a UK prime minister or the House of Commons.
The EU and UK agreed in December to a Brexit backstop for Northern Ireland which means there would be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland, but that they would also avoid a border along the Irish Sea.
There has been much speculation on whether the UK will backtrack on the ‘backstop’ agreement or the ‘Plan B’ arrangement for the relationship between Northern Ireland and the republic in the event of no other solution. The Irish government has been clear that a backstop is essential in the event of a no deal scenario.
“I don’t accept that for one minute [that there is no backstop deal],”Tánaiste Simon Coveney said last week.

During his speech yesterday, Ahern spoke about how Northern Ireland agriculture sector and other sectors will need to be protected post-Brexit, as links to the EU provide a number of benefits.
He said: “It’s a very serious issue. All contracting parties will need to assess how to move these matters in a positive and constructive way.
The former Taoiseach said that EU governments must analyse the white paper issued by the UK government and “should not jump to an immediate judgement”. He said he welcomed the commitment in the white paper to maintaining a frictionless border with Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Ahern also praised EU leaders such as Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk for their support of Ireland in the Brexit negotiations, and said that Britain could not pick and choose elements of its membership of the EU to be retained after Brexit.
“The integrity of the internal market is not premised on countries seeking to participate in some elements of the internal market and not others,” he said. “It’s just not written in law.
He said he couldn’t envisage Sinn Féin and the DUP agreeing to restart the Northern Irish assembly until this Brexit “debacle” had concluded.
Ahern said it’s unlikely that the UK would have a rerun of the Brexit referendum given their reaction to Ireland rerunning the Lisbon treaty referendum.
“They slagged us so much in Britain for doing that, so it’s unlikely they’ll do that,” he said.
Ahern also praised John Hume in his lecture, saying that he deserves to stand alongside “giants like Parnell and O’Connell” in Irish history.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-sucide-vest-4226527-Sep2018/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2018

THE BRITISH CONSERVATIVE party was locked in a new row over Brexit today after Boris Johnson said the government’s strategy put the country in a “suicide vest”, with Brussels holding the detonator.
The former foreign minister’s remarks ramp up his criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May’s approach to leaving the European Union, amid speculation he is positioning to replace her.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Johnson repeated that May’s plan to follow EU rules on trade in goods after Brexit — a plan over which he quit his job in protest in July — were a “humiliation”.
And he condemned her vow to do whatever it takes to avoid border checks in Ireland, saying it was “insanity” and left Britain open to “perpetual political blackmail”.
“We have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution — and handed the detonator to (EU Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier,” he wrote.
“We have given him a jemmy (crowbar) with which Brussels can choose — at any time — to crack apart the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”
The EU has suggested that if no other way was found to avoid physical border checks between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, then the latter should stay aligned with the bloc’s trade rules.

May has rejected this as unacceptable, but the two sides are deadlocked as time runs out to agree a divorce deal before Brexit in March next year.
Johnson’s inflammatory language drew outrage from colleagues, with junior foreign minister Alan Duncan saying it was “disgusting” to compare May’s view to that of a suicide bomber.
“I’m sorry, but this is the political end of Boris Johnson. If it isn’t now, I will make sure it is later. #neverfittogovern,” he tweeted.
Johnson’s successor, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, wrote in a rival article in the Mail that “nobody else has a detailed plan” for Brexit, adding: “This is the moment to back the prime minister.”
Some commentators suggested Johnson’s remarks were intended as a diversion from speculation over his private life, after he announced this week that he was divorcing his wife of 25 years.
Sunday’s newspapers were filled with lurid details about Johnson’s alleged infidelity in the past.
They were said to be from a dossier compiled by May’s office in 2016, when she was competing with Johnson for the Conservative leadership.
Downing Street denied re-releasing the details to discredit him now.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-legal-advice-4373245-Dec2018/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has published the legal advice it has received on the Brexit withdrawal agreement made with the EU, after sustained pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May.
May faces a tough battle to get her Brexit deal through parliament, and had been pressed by unlikely allies DUP, Labour and figures from within her own party to publish the advice from her Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.
May has ruled out holding a second referendum, urging MPs instead to approve the deal she has made with EU leaders.
The deal has proved highly divisive and all the signs point to MPs rejecting in a crucial vote next week.
Arlene Foster’s former special advisor Richard Bullick told RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Irelandthat the DUP was among a number of parties who’d joined forces to try to press May to release the legal advice.
“We’re in incredibly unusual times and to some extent that will mean there will be strange, perhaps unholy alliances,” he said.
Despite the differences between the DUP and Labour, he said there is a “convergence of interests on this particular issue”.
The legal advice itself, has some stark warnings of the implications of Brexit which will make for grim reading for Brexiteers and remainers alike.
For example, it says that in the event that if the transition period before Britain fully leaves the EU is extended for any reason, the UK will still have to pay money to the EU.
“During any extended implementation period, the UK would not be within EU budget arrangements… So the joint committee would decide on an appropriate financial contribution,” it says.
On the issue of a backstop in Northern Ireland, it says that if an alternative is not found before the end of the transition period in December 2020, then the backstop could remain indefinitely.

The backstop will “continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements”,” it says.
May is addressing the House of Commons this afternoon, and she seeks to secure the support of her MPs for a Brexit deal that many find unpalatable.
Second referendum
The second referendum campaign has meanwhile gained momentum, particularly with the resignation of two ministers who have said another vote could be a way out of the current political impasse.
“There are no certainties in politics and in Westminster at the moment. But I am more positive and confident than I have ever have been since I’ve got involved in this campaign,” said Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter.
Around 100 anti-Brexit campaigners turned out for a demonstrations near Downing Street on the eve of the start of the parliamentary debate on the Brexit deal.
“This is for my grandchildren,” said Glenys Rampley, 74.
“It’s unfair for the young people of this country being deprived of the opportunities that the European Union offers,” she said.
Campaigners from the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave also turned out for a demonstration outside the British parliament.
At the protest, Harry Todd told AFP he was representing the 17.5 million people who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
“They are trying to sell off a Brexit which isn’t a Brexit,” he said, calling for a clean break with the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-3-4296096-Oct2018/,"“IF THERE IS no deal, is there a possibility that you would be forced to build a wall across Ireland.” That was one of the questions posed to Tánaiste Simon Coveney during a BBC Radio 4 interview this week.
Perhaps what is most telling is the five second delay before Coveney answered.
“No I don’t believe that is going to happen,” he replied.
A week can be a long time in politics, and no more so when it involves the UK leaving the EU.
Yesterday’s deadline summit came and went, and still no withdrawal agreement was signed. The sticking point? The Irish backstop.
Europe’s lead negotiator Michel Barniersaid todaythe Irish border could be the issue that sinks a Brexit deal.
But a no deal Brexit would be catastrophic, as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar put it this week, not just for Ireland but also the UK.
Speaking toTheJournal.iein Monaghan this afternoon at the Irish government’s latest Get Brexit Ready roadshow, Coveney said it is his job to be “polite but firm” to the UK media, British politicians and the UK public at large when explaining how UK-Irish and Northern Irish relations work.
Does he not get fed up of British commentators not being up to speed with Irish history and what is at stake for Northern Ireland?
“There are some in the UK who don’t seem to get it – my job is to be polite, respectful and firm in relation to these things, so that people understand what is at stake here,” said Coveney, adding:
https://www.facebook.com/journalpolitics/videos/559873274472812/
So, what’s the state of play as it stands?

Essentially, the UK wants a UK-wide backstop arrangement between the UK and the EU wants a Northern Irish specific backstop.
“I think there is a way of showing some flexibility, to give reassurances to both and that is what the negotiating teams are going to focus on,” said Coveney.
Despite rumours that solidarity with Ireland is wavering in some EU quarters, the Tánaiste said those rumours are not credible and solidarity between all EU members and Ireland remains strong.
While another EU summit was rumoured to be taking place in November, yesterday it was ruled out. Coveney said a meeting could still be held next month, but only if the two sides make significant progress.
“There will be a summit in November if it is needed. I think what EU leaders have sensibly said is there is no point in having a summit for the sake of it, if we don’t have a deal,” he said, adding:
Coveney said it could well push into December, but was firm that a deal must be reached by Christmas so as to ensure there is adequate ratification and preparation time.
“Of course it is possible this could go into December, but really this needs to be done before Christmas. Hopefully it can be done in November, to take the pressure off everybody and give people time and space and enough time to plan.”
However, Coveney said he is an optimist, and hopes a deal can be done in the next six weeks. But he said Ireland is also planning for a “worse case scenario” Brexit and he told businesses along the border to do the same today.

‘There’s a storm a comin’ seemed to be the Tánaiste’s message to businesses who packed out the conference rooms in the Four Seasons Hotel today.
However, whether the Brexit storm will bring gusts or just a slight breeze is still anyone’s guess.
While the political heavyweights try and get a deal over the line in Europe, it is is the small and medium businesses that have to prepare for all eventualities.
Coveney told the crowd today that “it is a little bit like preparing for Storm Callum”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/splits-cracks-and-a-fight-ahead-uk-front-pages-react-to-mays-cabinet-deal-2-4340411-Nov2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May last night received cabinet approval for a draft Brexit deal.
The next step on the road to the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union is for that draft deal to go to an EU summit at the end of November.
Following that, the UK parliament will vote on May’s draft deal. If it approves the deal, a draft EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be introduced.
Should parliament reject May’s deal, the UK government has 21 days to put forward a new plan. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has welcomed the draft Brexit deal, which includes avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.
With a deal approved by cabinet, the front pages of the UK’s newspapers have put their spin on developments.
The Daily Mail has a defiant UK PM but warns that “Tory rebels threaten coup to topple her in days.”

The Financial Times runs with: “May braced for backlash after winning ferocious Brexit battle.”

The Daily Express has: “It’s my deal…or no Brexit.”

The Times opted for: “May papers over the cracks.”

The New European went with: “May’s last gasp.”

The Guardian ran with: “May Brexit plan: a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation.”

The i’s front page reads “Cabinet split on whether to back PM” while The Daily Telegraph quotes the British PM saying “There will be difficult days ahead.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-simon-coveney-brexit-4417733-Dec2018/,"SIMON COVENEY HAS said discussing a united Ireland as part of the Brexit debate is “not helpful”.
The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said the issue could “create an even more divisive debate and atmosphere in Northern Ireland, which is the last thing we need”.
There has been speculation that Britain leaving the European Union could eventually lead to the unification of the Republic and Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said a “crash” no-deal Brexit moves the timeline for aborder poll on a united Irelandforward.
“In the event of a crash … certainly the issue of a referendum on unity would move, advance, very, very quickly,” McDonald said on 11 December.
Coveney said Sinn Féin’s calls for a border poll are a “hugely unhelpful intervention” done for “party political reasons”.
When asked about the possibility of a united Ireland in the next 10 to 20 years, Coveney said: “That’s a sensitive question at the moment given the pressures of Brexit. I try to be very careful with what I have said on this issue. We don’t really want a constitutional change and a debate around that to be part of the Brexit debate. It’s not helpful.
“That issue is dealt with comprehensively under the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) and under the principle of consent which we absolutely support.”
Peace process
The Tánaiste said the Irish government and nationalists need to “reach out to unionism in a more effective way than perhaps has been possible in recent years”.

“We are all neighbours on this island and we have to learn to live together. Unfortunately the threats of Brexit have caused a lot of tensions that we wish weren’t happening.
“So I think we need to take this step by step. What we are dealing with now is Brexit. What we are trying to do is to protect the peace process and the status quo rather than looking to change the constitutional arrangements on this island as a result of Brexit.”
Coveney added that the Irish government is “trying to accommodate different perspectives in the context of Brexit”.
“If we can do that we create a platform, hopefully, and a trust between unionist and nationalist parties – and of course the Alliance as well and the Green Party – that can hopefully allow us on the back of finding a way through Brexit get devolved government back up and running again so we have the mechanisms of the GFA functioning,” he stated.
Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017.
House of Commons vote
Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” in relation to Brexit.
Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Theresa Maypostponed a House of Commons voteon the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the deal. The vote is now expected to take place in January.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The Democratic Unionist Party believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of the official withdrawal date of 29 March.

A BREXIT DEAL in November is looking more and more unlikely, according to the Taoiseach today.
Speaking during his visit to Finland, Leo Varadkar said while he still thinks a deal might be able to be reached in November, with “every day that passes” it is becoming more unlikely.
He reiterated the point he made in the Dáil yesterday that the a backstop must be contained in the withdrawal agreement in order to ensure the that a hard border does not re-emerge.
Varadkar said a EU summit is penciled in December, but said it would not be good for negotiations to drag on.
“We do have one scheduled anyway for the 13th and 14th of December, so not getting it done in November doesn’t mean we can’t get it done in the first two weeks of December,” he added.
“But I think beyond that you’re into the new year which I think wouldn’t be a good thing.”
EU officials poured cold water on hopes of holding a special summit this month to seal a Brexit divorce, saying talks have made some progress — but not enough.
“Clear that more work is needed in Brexit negotiations. We remain determined to reach a deal,” the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted from Helsinki after meeting Finnish officials.

One source close to the negotiations with London told AFP: “I think the summit will be in December. For the time being not enough progress on Irish border question to have a summit in November.”
Another official would not categorically rule out a November summit, but admitted that even if there was an unexpected breakthrough in the coming days it could take up to two weeks to prepare one.
EU President Donald Tusk held a call with British Prime Minister Theresa May today, but there was no breakthrough and the official said “member states will need time” to digest any draft deal.
Britain is due to leave the 28-nation bloc on March 29 next year, but details of the withdrawal treaty have yet to be agreed and previous summits have broken up, sometimes in bitter rows.
Both sides say they want to avoid the emergence of a hard border that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement — but London does not want the province to remain in the EU Customs Union indefinitely.
May has said no British prime minister could agree to such a concession, but negotiators are reported to be working on language for a “review mechanism” that would govern the backstop.
Barnier has made it clear any talk on Britain’s future relations with the union must wait until the withdrawal deal is enshrined in a legal treaty.
And Tusk has said he would not call the summit that would approve such a treaty until Barnier had been able to report to him that “decisive progress” had been made towards agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/china-us-worlds-largest-economy-4409595-Dec2018/,"CHINA IS SET to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy by 2032, according to the 2019 edition of the World Economic League Table (Welt).
Last year the Welt predicted that China would become the largest economy in 2030 but the US is currently on track to retain the top spot for two years longer than previously expected, despite an increasing public debt burden.
The analysis has predicted that Brexit disruption will depress UK growth in 2019, helping France to overtake the UK to claim sixth place in the rankings.
As the dust settles after Brexit, the UK is expected to reclaim sixth spot from France in 2020 and even if Brexit leads to Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the UK, the rest of the UK is still forecast to be a larger economy than France by 2026.
India is expected to move past the UK and France, probably in 2019 but, if not then, in 2020. Ireland is placed 34th next year, but expected to drop to 45th by 2033.
The Welt is produced by international economic forecasters at the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr).
The 2019 edition is Cebr’s 10th annual world economic outlook report. It tracks the size of different economies across the globe and projects changes over the next 15 years, up to 2033.
This year, “the ‘feel-good factor’ in the global economy has largely dispersed and is replaced by renewed volatility and uncertainty”, the authors note. Trade tensions have come to the fore, with the US and China imposing substantial tariffs on each other’s export sectors.

US v China
So far, the US economy seems undeterred and 2018 has been another year of strong growth. This is in part due to the tax reform package passed in 2017, which has brought forward growth.
However, it leaves a serious budget deficit problem that is likely to balloon over time, the authors state. This means that in the case of an economic downturn, the US will have less fiscal headroom to use in order to avoid a recession.
“China, on the other hand, has had more problems as the trade conflict weighs on an economy already under strain. In 2018, China finally seemed to be making progress in weening its economy off the large volumes of debt that had been used to prop up growth after the financial crisis,” the authors note.
US President Donald Trump has announced that the US will impose tariffs on ever large volumes of Chinese goods. At the time of writing, the US had subjected US$200 billion (about €175 billion) worth of Chinese imports to a 10% tariff. China retaliated by levying tariffs on US$60 billion (€52.5 billion) worth of US imports, representing almost all of America’s exports to China.
“The trade war has impacted the Chinese manufacturing sector and the economy has slowed sharply. This is best seen in the data for exports to China from its trading partners – Australia’s exports to China, which grew by 21.8% in 2017, plateaued around the same level from April to August 2018,” the authors state.
Brexit
“The outcome of the Brexit negotiations still remains uncertain and all three possibilities (leaving without a deal, a soft Brexit or not leaving at all) seem possible,” the report’s authors note.
“This will give France (as well as India) the chance to overtake the UK in the ranking for 2019. But France has not really come to terms with reducing its bloated public sector and resulting high taxes.”
Other key findings in the 2019 Welt are as follows:
Speaking about the findings, Cebr Deputy Chairman Douglas McWilliams stated: “In 2003, the world’s five largest economies were the US, Japan and three European countries.
“The Asian economies, led by China, are still poised to catch up with – and in many cases indeed overtake – Western countries. But due to weaker currencies and the slowdown in China, which looks set to worsen in 2019, the rise of the Asian economies will be delayed.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-clarity-certainty-report-4384437-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Dec 2018
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has warned that parliament’s rejection of her Brexit deal could leave Britain in the European Union and bring the opposition Labour Party to power.
The embattled leader’s message came with her government fearing a heavy defeat on Tuesday of the draft withdrawal agreement she signed with Brussels last month.
Media reports said May is under pressure from her cabinet to delay the vote and fly to Brussels to secure more concessions ahead of a planned summit with 27 fellow EU leaders on Thursday and Friday.
But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC: “The vote is going ahead.”
May said Britain “would truly be in uncharted waters” if the draft struck after nearly two years of tough talks is voted down less than four months before the 29 March Brexit date.
“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit,” she told the Mail on Sunday.
“We have a leader of the opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country… I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”

‘Out of control’
May is facing her biggest crisis since coming to power a month after the nation voted by a 52-48 margin in June 2016 to leave the world’s largest single market after 46 years.
She is under attack from more strident Brexit backers in her own party as well as europhiles who want either a second referendum or a pact that maintains stronger EU-UK ties than the one offered by May.
Her comments today are aimed at tamping down the hardline Conservative Party revolt led by the likes of her former foreign minister Boris Johnson.

May’s team has been arguing for a number of days that her vision offers the cleanest break between the UK and EU that Brexit supporters can hope for at this late stage.
But Johnson used a column in the Sun on Sunday to argue that “the best way to get a great deal is to prepare for no deal” by rejecting May’s draft.
‘Fails to offer sufficient clarity’
May’s comments today come as MPs delivered a deeply critical report on her Brexit deal.
TheCommittee on Exiting the European Union reporton the UK government’s EU Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration outlines that May’s deal fails to offer sufficient clarity or certainty for the future of the UK.
The report states: “After 20 months of negotiations, we only know the terms of the UK’s departure but not the nature of the future relationship with the EU. The Prime Minister’s deal fails to offer sufficient clarity or certainty about the future.”
The Political Declaration is deemed “neither detailed nor substantive” in the report.
“What is clear from the Political Declaration is that the extent of our access to EU markets will depend on the degree to which we adhere to its rules,” the report says.
In relation to the Irish border, the MPs go on to outline that “there are no realistic, long-term proposals from the government to reconcile maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland with leaving the Single Market and Customs Union”.
The Withdrawal Agreement contains several contentious clauses that Brexiteers will find hard to swallow but perhaps the most controversial element is the ‘backstop’ plan which keeps Britain in a customs union with the EU until a trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for border checks with Ireland.
Today’s report states that “activating the backstop would result in immediate barriers to UK-EU trade in goods and services”.
“By July 2020 if the future relationship is not in place, or one/two years later if the transition/implementation period is extended, the UK could face the threat of significant economic disruption which would reduce its leverage in the negotiations,” it says.
Furthermore, the report states that it would be “unacceptable for the government not to publish the White Paper on immigration before the vote on 11 December 2018″.
It argues that “because of the large number of issues crucial to the future of the EU-UK relationship which are still to be decided”, the Brexit process will not be concluded by March 2019.

The chair of the committee, Hilary Benn MP, said: “It is because the government has refused to face up to the hard choices confronting us that this deal would represent a huge step into the unknown.
“It does not give the British people or our businesses the clarity and the certainty they need about our future trading relationship with the EU in five or ten years’ time. And with these negotiations having not even having started yet, this could take years to sort out.”He added that “it is now time for colleagues to decide on the Prime Minister’s deal”.
“Throughout this process, the Select Committee has always argued for Parliament to be given a full and proper role, and to vote on what has been negotiated. The opportunity to do that is now before us, and I hope this report, with its detailed analysis of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration, will help members of all sides of the House make their decision,” Benn said.
Second vote
Meanwhile, European officials have said they might be able to find a way to offer a token concession in Brussels that May could take back to London and show rebellious MPs.
But they added that such tinkering cannot alter the basis of the withdrawal agreement itself.
“Theresa May will come to the European summit on 13 and 14 December to ask for a renegotiation and the 27 will tell her no, the texts have been agreed,” an informed European source told AFP on condition on anonymity.
“They will then retreat and work on the (accompanying) protocol or clarify a point that is deemed important so that she can take it back to parliament.”
May would then be expected to submit the touched-up version for a second vote at an unspecified date.
The European Court of Justice could inject still more drama into the Brexit endgame when it rules on Monday whether Britain can unilaterally halt its split from the bloc.
The ECJ could also decide Brexit can only be postponed or suspended by unanimous agreement of the other 27 nations.
May has rejected the idea of putting the brakes on Brexit.

Postponed vote
Earlier today May confirmed she was postponing tomorrow’s crucial House of Commons vote on the Brexit deal so she can go back to Brussels and ask for certain changes to be made.
May admitted the current agreement “would be rejected by a significant margin” but stated: “I’m in absolutely no doubt that this deal is the right one.”
One of the main sticking points is the proposed backstop arrangement. Thisaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
In heated cross-party exchanges, May was accused of “pathetic cowardice” forpostponing the vote. When she said there is “broad support” for many of the key aspects of the deal, laughter erupted in the chamber.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar both said the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the European Union and Britaincannot be renegotiated.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has met with the grand secretary of the Orange Lodge Reverend Mervyn Gibson at Government Buildings this afternoon to discuss issues affecting its members in the Republic.
Speaking after the meeting, Vardkar said it is important to remember that “there are many people in our State that feel themselves to be both British and Irish. It’s something that we should accept too”.
“The Good Friday Agreement acknowledges that people in Northern Ireland have the right to be British, Irish or both, and accepted as such,” Varadkar said in a statement.
Reverend Gibson led a delegation of Orange Lodge members from the Republic to discuss matters relating to Protestant schools in the south, as well as the infrastructure and cultural needs of border Protestant communities.
Coming one day after the European Council agreed the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future relationship, the meeting also touched on Brexit.
According to a government spokesperson, they also discussed support for tourism projects including further development of the Battle of the Boyne site, the possibility of a Williamite Trail from Antrim to Aughrim, and Second World War commemorations.

During the summer, Varadkar became the first serving Irish head of government to meet with Grand Master of the Orange Lodge, Edward Stevenson, and took a tour of their venue in the North.
At the time, the trip to Northern Ireland has been described as a significant visit which aims to smooth over relations between the south and unionist leaders in the North, and reassure DUP members the Irish government has no “hidden agenda” amidst Brexit tensions.
Similar tensions have been reported in recent weeks, particularly as a Brexit deal comes down to the wire, and with DUP leader Arlene Foster stating yesterday that if the backstop is not removed from the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK, her party will not support it.
Speaking yesterday in Brussels, the Taoiseach said: “What’s on the table is the only deal that’s on the table.”
As the border issue became front and centre in Brexit negotiations, Varadkar was at pains to reiterate his respect and understanding for the unionist perspective, and using many of his speeches to reiterate that the south is not interested in a land grab.
Theresa May announced this evening in the House of Commons thatMPs will hold a crucial vote on 11 Decemberto approve or reject the Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders.
May must now navigate the deal through a divided chamber in which she holds the slimmest working majority – and where lawmakers oppose it on all sides.

LONDON MAYOR SADIQ Khan has said that the British public should have it say on the final Brexit outcome – either through a general election or a people’s vote on whether to stay in the EU.
Khan visited Dublin today, where he met President Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and addressed Dublin Chamber’s annual lunch.
The London Mayor has long campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, and has consistently said it would bad for the UK capital.

Speaking toRTÉ Newsthis evening, he went on the attack against Prime Minister Theresa May, ahead of the crucial vote on her Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week.
“We’ve got a choice of a bad Brexit deal or no deal whatsoever,” he said. “I think Theresa May has handled these negotiations appallingly.
Khan said it was the position of the Labour party – which he is a member of and is led by Jeremy Corbyn – that should May lose the vote as expected next week, then there should be a general election.
He said: “I think it’s time for the British public to take back control – either through a general election or a public vote.”
Despite Corbyn’s long history of euroscepticism, and the perception of him as a reluctant remainer during the original campaign, Khan said he had no qualms over his own position.
“I’ll be campaigning to remain in the European Union,” he added. “It’s really important we don’t make life harder for our grandchildren. I’m very confident – nationally – Labour will be campaigning to remain in the European Union.”

In theannual survey of Irish attitudestowards the European Union (EU), 44% of Irish people agree that Brexit will make a united Ireland more likely, while 44% of Irish people disagree that it will.
Those under 35 years of age were most inclined to say that Brexit makes a united Ireland more likely, while in the over 35s category only 39% agree that it is more likely.
When asked about the UK’s government’s red lines in the Brexit negotiations on leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union, 73% of people in Ireland said that the UK should remain in both. This figure rose to 83% amongst farmers.

Meanwhile, the majority of Irish people believe that Brexit is a mistake, with a total of 92% agreeing that Ireland should remain part of the EU. Support was greatest in the Dublin area (96%) and among 18 to 24-year-olds.
“People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long-term,” Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, said.
A total of 87% of people agree that, taking everything into consideration, Ireland has on balance benefited from being a member of the EU. 58% of people agree that Ireland should contribute more to the EU budget to continue getting these benefits.
Almost six in 10 people (59%) agreed that Ireland should be part of increased EU defence and security co-operation, with 62% of men and 56% of women agreeing. This shows an increase of 2% since April 2017, before Ireland signed up to Pesco, a European defence pact.
“The increase in the number of don’t knows from 3% in 2017 to 8% in 2018 suggests that there is a need for increased public awareness around Pesco and other elements of security co-operation,” O’Connell said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-citizens-rights-safe-in-no-deal-brexit-4379892-Dec2018/,"A FEW DAYS out from a crucial Westminster vote on whether to adopt Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal, the British Department for Exiting the EU has assured EU citizens that they can remain in the UK if there’s no deal.
The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has increased as a large number of Theresa May’s own party have indicated that they will vote against her deal on Tuesday next week.
If this happens, it’s not certain what the next step is: Brexiteers have indicated that they could renegotiate another Brexit deal with the EU – but the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, as well as May herself, have repeated that this is the only deal on offer.

To add to the confusion, a top advisor to the European Court of Justice has said that the UK would have the power to unilaterally revoke Article 50 and reverse Brexit – that means they wouldn’t need the consent of the other EU 27 member states. If this were to happen, the UK would most likely have to pay for the cost of two years of negotiations.
In a report published today on EU citizens rights, the Department for Exiting the European Union (or DExEU), wished to reassure citizens:
“To remove any ambiguity about their future, the UK Government wants to reassure EU citizens and their family members living in the UK that they are welcome to stay in the UK in the unlikely event of a ‘no deal’ scenario.
It said that this needed to be supported equally by the EU, who has also pledged to support EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in EU member states.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has warned that the deal taking Britain out of the European Union may inadvertently hamper trade between London and Washington.
“Sounds like a great deal for the EU,” he said at the White House, before adding that “we have to take a look at seriously whether or not the UK is allowed to trade”.
“You know, right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn’t be a good thing,” he said.
“I don’t think they want that at all. That would be a very big negative for the deal.”
He expressed hope that Prime Minister Theresa May will “be able to do something about that.”
The British leader on Sunday closed 17 months of painful talks with Brussels by sealing Brexit arrangements with the 27 other EU heads of state and government.
However, May faces a difficult task getting parliamentary approval for the deal.

‘I don’t believe it’
Trump also told reporters that he doesn’t believe his own government’s report last week warning of massive economic losses if carbon emissions continue to feed climate change unchecked.

“I don’t believe it,” Trump said at the White House, adding that the United States would not take measures to cut emissions if the same was not done in other countries.
Trump said he had read “some” of the report and that it was “fine.”
However, he rejected the central warning in the National Climate Assessment, which said there will be hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by the end of the century due to climate change “without substantial and sustained global mitigation.”
“No, no, I don’t believe it,” he repeated.
“You’re going to have to have China and Japan and all of Asia and all of these other countries, you know. It addresses our country,” he said.
According to the report, released Friday, climate change will “cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.”
The effects will spill into global trade, hitting import and export prices and US businesses with overseas operations and supply chains, it added.
Trump has long said he distrusts the consensus by nearly all the world’s respected climate scientists on the link between human activity and rising temperatures, as well as other damaging climate change phenomena.
Since becoming president in 2016 he has pulled the United States out of the international Paris Agreement on attempting to bring down global temperatures, and torn up a raft of environmental protection laws, saying the US economy needs the boost.
In October, Trump said during a visit to inspect hurricane damage in the southern state of Georgia that climate change “is going to go back and forth,” rather than be permanent.
He also gave a lukewarm reaction to publication of a major UN report warning in October of global warming-caused chaos, saying “I want to look who drew it, you know, which groups drew it, because I can give you reports that are fabulous and I can give you reports that aren’t so good.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-reports-on-eu-solidarity-corporate-tax-4244138-Sep2018/,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it was “verging on irresponsible journalism” to report that Ireland could have to increase its corporate tax rate in exchange for the European Union’s support on the Irish border issue.
On Monday,Bloomberg reportedthat some EU member states could pressure Ireland to reform its low corporation tax rate of 12.5%, which has made Ireland uniquely attractive for the headquarters of multinationals such as Apple and Google.
Ireland has constantly denied that its tax rate is unfair, and refused to change it; the government rebuked research that labelled Irelandas a tax haven this summer.
The story in Bloomberg quoted an anonymous EU official as saying that “solidarity doesn’t come for free” in relation to support on the complex Irish border issue that has threatened to collapse Brexit talks.
This morning, the Irish Independent carried the story on its front page. Coveney was being interviewed onRTÉ’s News at Onewhen he was asked about the reports.

“That is in my view, verging on irresponsible journalism quite frankly because I have spent a lot of time, as the Taoiseach has, travelling around EU capitals, ensuring that people understand why the Irish issues are so important on Brexit, why Ireland is so vulnerable and exposed to a potential bad outcome linked to Brexit.
“If we don’t have a backstop in place, it could potentially create frictions that undermine the Peace Process.
When he listed EU officials that weren’t referencing the corporate tax issue in relation to the Irish border, he was then asked “were other EU leaders making that linkage”, to which he replied:
“What happens on taxation is what has been happening on taxation for 20 years. Whereby there are some countries that want to see a more common approach towards the setting of tax rates and tax bases across the European Union. That has been there and will always been there for the foreseeable future.
Coveney said that there was “absolute solidarity” with other EU member states on the importance of avoiding hard infrastructure in Ireland; EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has listed it among his three priorities in Brexit talks.
Avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland has been the greatest stumbling block in Brexit negotiations; with neither side agreeing to the other’s proposals.
The most likely options to avoid a hard border aren’t easy to swallow: the UK will have to agree to follow the EU’s custom rules and regulations; or to allow a customs ‘border’ along the Irish Sea, which UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and her Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have said they won’t accept.

Backstop
The ‘backstop’ agreement is a Plan B measure to ensure that there isn’t border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.
In December last year, the EU and UK agreed provisional wording for the backstop, that there would be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland in the event of no other workable solution.
The UK government has clarified since that this cannot mean a customs border along the Irish Sea.
Tensions are rising as we approach the 19 October deadline, when a summit is scheduled for EU representatives to vote for or against the final Brexit deal, which as of yet isn’t completed.
In the event of no backstop agreement, there will be no Brexit Withdrawal deal, meaning the UK will go crashing out of the EU, and (most likely) resulting in an automatic reemergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee are meeting with officials this evening to assess the state-of-play with the Brexit deal.
Negotiators from the UK and the EU have reportedly reached an agreement that will see no hard border on the island of Ireland – but as of this evening the Irish government is maintaining that nothing has yet been confirmed.
The backstop would come in the form of a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement, with specific rules for Northern Ireland,RTÉ reported.
While the negotiations have not yet concluded, the text was “as stable as it can be”.
This text will also have a review mechanism.
Cabinet ministers in the Irish government are on standby to attend a possible Cabinet meeting tomorrow. There is also a possibility another meeting could be held later in the week to consider the draft Brexit proposals.
A government spokesperson said the situation is “fast-moving”.
However, it is understood that the Irish government’s position is that British ministers should be given time and space to consider the proposals.
UK media outlets are reporting that ministers are set to be summoned to 10 Downing Street this evening to a see the latest Brexit draft text.
Ministers will speak to Prime Minister Theresa May one-on-one,Sky News reported.
If – and it remains a big if – her Cabinet agrees to sign off on such an arrangement it would clear a path for EU leaders to also give their approval to the deal later this month.
Initially when the news broke that a deal on the border had been agreed, the Irish government appeared to be left in the dark.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: “Negotiations between the EU and UK on a withdrawal agreement are ongoing and have not concluded. Negotiators are still engaged and a number of issues are outstanding. We are not commenting further on leaks in the media.”
This was later echoed by a government spokesperson, who said that “nothing has been confirmed at this point… there is still no agreement at this point in time”.
“As far as I’m aware there are still a number of issues outstanding in the withdrawal agreement,” he said, adding that it is a “fast-moving” situation and that the Irish government is “very happy” with the representation of the European task force.

Irish government spokesperson says nothing has been confirmed and Irish government has not been officially informed of any developments. There are understood that a number of issues are ongoing.‘Nothing is agreed until everything agreed’
It remains Ireland’s position that the backstop must apply “unless and until” it is superseded by other border-free agreements.
“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he added.
Any such deal that may have been reached will have to be given consideration by the Cabinet, said the government spokesperson.
Explanation: What does all this mean?
Nothing much, really.
Based on the reports, UK negotiators seem to have given in on leaving the Customs Union in favour of “a first cousin” of the EU’s rules, and the EU has given in on its demand for a Northern Ireland-specific backstop in order to reach a deal.
The EU had pledged to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland as part of its three main priorities in Brexit talks;in December 2017 it was agreed that this would be done through thebackstopwhich would ensure “regulatory alignment” between the North and the Republic.
Brexiteers argued that the backstop wasn’t necessary to avoid a hard border, as they feared it would limit their trading abilities and “carve off” Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
In Theresa May’smuch-criticisedChequers Plan, she pledged to leave the Customs Union in favour of“a new business friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world”.
It’s not clear whether the UK-wide customs deal reported tonight would limit the UK from striking up non-EU trade deals in the future. If it’s so close as to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, it probably would limit their options.
If Theresa May and her Cabinet are against the draft proposal agreed by their negotiators, we’re back to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
Reaction
Speaking in the Dáil this afternoon on the reports of a possible border deal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had been in the chamber for the last couple of hours, adding:
“So I haven’t spoken to my officials, or been able to speak to any of my officials in the last two hours or so.”
Earlier today, the EU Commission publisheda limited number of contingency plansin the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In it, it says the commission will “support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses” in such a scenario.

THERESA MAY WILL warn MPs that a second Brexit referendum would do “irreparable damage” to British politics when she addresses the House of Commons today.
“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,” she is expected to tell parliament, according to extracts from her speech released by Downing Street.
“Anther vote… would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics,” she will say, adding that a second vote “would likely leave us no further forward”.
She will warn that another referendum would also “further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it”.
May has long faced calls for a second referendum to resolve the impasse over the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
However, the British Prime Minister has argued that this would betray the 2016 result and undermine public confidence in politics.
Campaigners for another referendum believe that May’s comments demonstrate that the idea is being taken seriously.

“A new public vote would be different from the referendum in 2016 because we now know more about what Brexit means,” said Margaret Beckett, an MP from the main opposition Labour Party and “People’s Vote” supporter.
“Any effort to force Brexit over the line without checking that it has the continued consent of the British people will only reinforce divisions,” she said.
Dozens of MPs from the main parties in Westminster also support a second referendum, as do former prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair.
There have also been reports that government officials are considering giving the public a vote.
Last week, May delayed a crucial vote by MPs on the draft Brexit deal until next month, leaving the political scene in limbo.
If parliament fails to approve the text, Britain will crash out of the European Union under a ‘no deal’ scenario – a prospect that experts warn could lead to serious trade disruption and trigger a financial crisis.
But former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit campaigner, said anyone considering a second referendum was “out of their minds”.
“A second referendum would provoke instant, deep and ineradicable feelings of betrayal,” he has written in his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph today.

A CONSERVATIVE MP has said Prime Minister Theresa May hasn’t got a “cat in hell’s chance” of getting her Brexit deal through parliament, and warned that she could face a no confidence vote in her as early as Monday.
The Prime Minister has hit back at her rivals, however, telling the plotters planning to overthrow her that their alternative Brexit plans would not make all the problems disappear.
Mid-Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorriestold Sky Newsshe wouldn’t be surprised if there already had been 48 letters sent in to trigger the no-confidence vote in May, and said that “most MPs” will vote against the Prime Minister.
Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg has led the charge calling for a push against May, and submitted a letter of no-confidence in the Prime Minister on Thursday saying: “It would be in the interest of the party and the country if she were to stand aside.”
The embattled occupant of 10 Downing Street managed to secure Cabinet approval for the Brexit deal following a lengthy meeting on Wednesday, but many of its provisions have proven unpalatable to those who supported Brexit and resignations from the Cabinet swiftly followed.
May insisted there was no better option on the table and any alternative plans would still not conjure up a solution to keeping open the border with the Irish Republic.
“People say ‘If you could only just do something slightly different, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away’. It would not. That issue is still going to be there,” she told the Daily Mail newspaper.
“It’s not everybody’s ideal deal. You were never going to get that.
“The job of prime minister is to make tough decisions which are not always black or white. I have to find a way through, what best suits everybody’s needs.”

Draft agreement
The585-page draft withdrawal agreementis essentially the divorce deal between Britain and the EU.
The agreement contains several contentious clauses that Brexiteers will find hard to swallow but perhaps the most controversial element is the ‘backstop’ plan which keeps Britain in a customs union with the EU until a trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for border checks with Ireland.
The draft agreement describes this as a “single customs territory”. It will kick in if there was no long-term trade agreement and no extension of the transition.
It will take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK.
Dorries is one of those vehemently opposed to the deal, and said that it made the UK “slaves” to the EU.
“I would call us a vassal state, an empty state, I’d call it serfdom, it’s appalling,” she said.
Speaking this afternoon from the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he “didn’t see much scope for changes” to this agreement reached between the UK and EU, given the tight timelines.
He said he would not deal in “hypotheticals” when put to him that the deal might not get passed by the UK parliament. Varadkar said it is now time to ratify the deal that has taken two years to negotiate. Once you start making amendments the whole thing begins to unravel, he said.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that Ireland will be ready to respond to the different challenges and risks that could be created in the scenario of a hard Brexit.
“If we find ourselves in a position where the draft protocol is not agreed by the United Kingdom and the European Union, we clearly face a far higher risk than we had before.
“Ireland will be ready to respond to that, we will do all that can be done,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-buffer-zone-4048078-Jun2018/,"Updated 6.15pm
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT is reportedly considering putting forward a proposal for a 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border in Northern Ireland.
It doesn’t, however, have the backing of the DUP which is helping to prop up Theresa May’s minority government in Westminster.
The UK’s Sun newspaper reports Brexit Secretary David Davis is currently working on a new plan to break the deadlock in talks. The buffer zone, which would allow for trade between local traders like dairy farmers, is among these proposals.
His plan also reportedly proposes operating a regime of both European and British regulations so the North could trade freely with both, without the need for checkpoints.
In a statement this evening, DUP MP Sammy Wilson called the proposals “contradictory”.
He said: “These convoluted arrangements only arise because of the [UK] government’s failure to make it clear to the EU that regardless of Barnier and EU negotiators’ attempts to keep us in the Customs Union and the Single Market, we are leaving.

Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins had earlier toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthat he didn’t believe the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) “would go for this”.
He questioned how workable the buffer zone would be and said he believes it is an attempt by the British government to “be seen to be bringing forward some kind of proposal” before the June deadline.
“I simply don’t think it’ll work,” he said.
Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson also described the proposal as an attempt to hide a hard border in a buffer zone. She said they do not take into account the reality of life along the border, particularly in areas such as Derry, Strabane and Newry which are essentially cross-border.
“The best way to protect trade, agriculture and the rights of people living in the north, as well as ensuring full protection for the Good Friday Agreement is for the north to remain in the customs union and single market and to have special status within the EU,” she said.
Across the Irish Sea, opposition politicians in the House of Commons have been scathing of the plan.
Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said the Conservative plans are sounding like “something out of Alice in Wonderland” while Labour’s Chris Leslie called the plans “both dangerous and impractical”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-hard-border-leo-varadkar-4407720-Dec2018/,"THERE ARE NO contingency plans for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today.
Yesterday theIrish government published a 131-page documenton its plans for a no-deal Brexit, should it happen. However, one glaring omission from the plans is any reference to what would happen to the border if Britain crashes out of the EU.
As things come down to the wire, with a no-deal Brexit becoming all the more likely,questions have been raised about the levelat which the Irish government is prepared for such an eventuality.
Quizzed about the issue today, Varadkar said:
“We are not preparing for a hard border. We have made no preparations whatsoever.”
‘The honest truth’
He later added that no plans have been initiated as he doesn’t want it to “become a self-fulfilling prophecy”, stating:
Advertisement
However, he was clear there is only one way to avoid a hard border, stating that it “can only really be achieved by a deal”.
“The best way to avoid a hard border is to have a deal, and there is a deal on the table. And I hope Westminster and the European Parliament will be able to ratify it in the new year. And we will continue to work with our European partners and the UK and our European guarantees to give assurances and guarantees on that issue.
“Obviously without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement itself. But we want to work with the UK and our EU partners to secure agreement of the Withdrawal Agreement which of course not only guarantees that there won’t be a hard border. It guarantees there will never be a hard border and that’s why it is such an important treaty,” he said.
‘Loathe to speculate’
On the issue of a no-deal Brexit, the Taoiseach said he always loathes to speculate on it, because “it is speculation and a lot of it raises more questions than I can give answers”.
He said the issue comes down to alignment, stating:
He said Ireland’s European partners understand that the border with Northern Ireland  isn’t a typical border, “that this is a border that goes through villages, goes through farms, goes through businesses and of course is a border that people fought and killed other people over as well”.
Varadkar said work to secure the ratification of the withdrawal agreement will continue, with a hope it can be signed off on in January ideally, but certainly before the UK leaves at the end of March.
“Obviously it’s a fact that no deal is a possibility. We don’t think it’s a probability, but it’s a possibility,” said the Taoiseach, who added that there will be more contingency information released in the middle of January.

Davis announced his resignationjust two days after warring factions in May’s cabinet approved a Brexit plan in a bid to unblock negotiations with Brussels.
Friday’s agreement, which came after marathon talks at the Prime Minister’s country retreat, would “make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real”, Davis said in his resignation letter.

His appointment was welcomed by Penny Mordaunt, international development secretary and a staunch Brexit supporter.
“Very welcome appointment of @DominicRaab to @DExEUgov,” she tweeted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/tom-clonan-islamist-terrorism-fears-4406265-Dec2018/,"DESPITE THE STRASBOURG Christmas Market shooting – in which five people have lost their lives so far – 2018 has been an extraordinarily good year in the fight against terrorism in Europe.
In December, the Irish Institute for European Affairs (IIEA) hosted the launch of the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) for 2018.
Published by the International Institute for Economics and Peace, the research on global terrorism covers the last two decades from 1998 to 2018. The principal findings make for very interesting reading.
As might be expected, there was a spike in deaths due to terrorism recorded in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
As the US and her allies went on to invade Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 respectively, the number of terrorist attacks world-wide – many of them perpetrated by so-called Islamist extremists such as Al Qaeda and subsequently Islamic State – steadily increased, peaking in 2014.
The majority of deaths from terrorism in 2014 took place in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Almost 35,000 Nigerian citizens, 25,000 Afghans and over 20,000 Iraqis were slaughtered in bomb and gun attacks in 2014 alone.
The majority of these victims were murdered by Islamist terror groups – the top four most deadly groups in the world being Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, the Taliban and Islamic State.
Most of the victims of Islamist terrorism are innocent Muslim men, women and children.
Genesis of terror
In Europe, deaths from Islamist-inspired terrorism attacks peaked in 2016 with a total of 827 fatalities across Britain and continental Europe.
The total number of European citizens killed in terror attacks dropped to 204 in 2017.
So far, in Europe – including the victims of the Strasbourg attacks – the total for 2018 is approximately 12 people.
According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, the total economic impact of terrorism dropped from almost $100 billion dollars in 2016 to $52 billion in 2017.
A further drop of approximately 50% of this figure is expected for 2018.
According to the research over two decades, the key causal factors for the genesis of terrorist groups and for increases in terror attacks can be attributed to two major stimuli.
The primary driver for international terrorism is involvement in conventional conflict – wars and invasions conducted by international states.
In the top 10 countries worldwide where 84% of deaths from terrorism occur – including Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria and Pakistan – the state is directly involved in conventional combat operations.
A similar correlation can be observed for European countries where terror attacks occur.  When a state becomes involved in foreign wars, there is a rise in internal terror attacks.
The same is true for the United States.
The second primary driver for terror identified in the Global Index on Terrorism is human rights abuses perpetrated by oppressive regimes worldwide.
Many of these regimes – such as Saudi Arabia – are backed financially and militarily by western powers.
The report suggests we should choose our allies and partners carefully if we are serious about the so-called ‘Global War on Terror’.
The report identifies other factors – particularly in developed societies – that assist in the radicalisation of young people. These include social alienation, lack of economic opportunity, and the involvement of the state in external conflict.
Advertisement
These factors would seem to underpin rising populism in Europe and the US and the growth in phenomena such as the ‘Gilet Jaune’ movement in France and the rise in right-wing extremism across Europe and the United States.
What about Ireland?
For Ireland, the terrorism outlook is also changing dramatically.
From 1945 until 2003, the primary threat to the security of the state in Ireland was identified as that posed by dissident republican and loyalist elements within Ireland.
This changed after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the primary threat to Ireland’s security was revised and identified as that posed by international Islamist groups who might attack Ireland or use Ireland as a logistics base or platform from which to launch attacks throughout Britain and the European Union.
As 2018 draws to a close, the threat posed by Islamist terrorism appears to be waning dramatically.
Worryingly, as Brexit approaches, the threat assessment for Ireland in 2019 will once again be dominated by the threat posed by organised crime and dissident republicans and loyalist elements on the island.
Specifically, the threat assessment for Ireland is significantly accelerated by the prospect of a border on the island.
Not just a ‘hard border’ – but any border, technological or otherwise, that divides the country into two separate, distinct, economic and migration/travel zones.
The existence of an economic divide on the island, post-Brexit would risk a surge in smuggling and other forms of criminality here.
Ireland would become the back door from Britain to the EU and vice versa – for people and goods, legal and illegal.
The organised criminal gangs that would exploit such a border – in whatever form it takes – would do everything in their power to thwart and frustrate the extension of normal policing to both sides of the existing land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The PSNI has already warned, that in such a scenario, their constables would become ‘Sitting Ducks’ for terror attacks in border counties.
If Britain crashes out of the EU, or if it exits with a deal that does not guarantee – indefinitely – special status for Northern Ireland within the EU Customs Union, a hard border is inevitable on this island.
If that happens, the EU will insist that the Republic police this newly reinstated, de facto land border between Britain – a third-party state – and Europe’s Single Market area.
The EU would not be in a position to ask Britain to operate border controls. This would be a game-changer for the Republic. The border has more than 300 crossing points and the Irish Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána are in no position to monitor the border effectively, let alone patrol it or control movement of people and goods across it.
The government has announced it is planning to recruit extra customs officers to manage such a scenario. Any customs posts or facilities erected along the border – or south of it – would be immediately targeted for attack by criminal elements and resurgent dissident republican groups. A similar threat would exist for mobile customs patrols along the border.
Any such infrastructure would have to be supported by armed Gardaí and army personnel – placing the Republic in the invidious position of being physically responsible for the border.
This is something we avoided during the Troubles – leaving the concept of permanent border installations to the British military.
Their attempts to control the border area are a case study in military and political failure. The British flooded the border counties with observation towers for armed and electronic surveillance – 13 in South Armagh alone, along with 3,000 military personnel. They established the world’s busiest helicopter port in Bessbrook Mill – ferrying police and customs personnel by air into the border area. At the height of the Troubles, there was one armed soldier for every seven civilians in the border counties.
PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
Despite this, the British never managed to control the border counties and 53 police officers and over 120 British soldiers were murdered there in what became known as the murder triangle.
Internationally, the biggest threat accelerator for terrorism is climate change and the forced migrations it will trigger.
Domestically, the biggest threat to security and peace on this island is the prospect of a hard border.
Both are almost entirely outside of our control.
Strong leadership is required for both scenarios.
The Irish government has shown some leadership and tenacity with regard to the border issue. Sadly however, there seems to be an absence of such leadership at this critical moment for Britain – and Ireland – in Westminster.

THE UNITED KINGDOM is reportedly set to throw its diplomatic weight behind a previously-unthought of third option for solving the conundrum of the Irish border post-Brexit.
British prime minister Theresa May faces a cabinet that is in open revolt against plans for a so-called ‘backstop’ border solution – one which would see the UK in full customs alignment with the EU in order to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
RTÉ this morning reportsthat the UK has come up with an unexpected third solution to the impasse – by taking the infamous paragraph 49 (that which gave rise to the idea of a backstop in the first place) of last December’s draft Brexit agreement literally.
At present May is caught between the rock of hardcore Brexiteers in her own party who don’t wish for Northern Ireland to be given special status in negotiations, and the hard place of the EU itself which is unlikely to grant exemptions that the UK would find desirable in order to get Brexit over the line with an actual deal in place.

Paragraph 49 states that in the absence of any other deal to avoid a hard border (hence the backstop nature of things), the UK would ‘maintain full alignment’ with the EU on trade in the spirit of supporting ‘north-south cooperation’.
By taking that paragraph literally, ie by aligning the entirety of the UK with the EU for an undetermined period of time, the British government hopes to, temporarily at least, remove the controversy surrounding the backstop deal.
RTÉ also reports sources that state such a deal would be acceptable to both the UK and the EU, with strict conditions.
Meanwhile, Mayhas announced plansto publish a Brexit white paper, setting out her priorities for Britain’s future relationship with the EU, ahead of next month’s crucial Brussels summit on the Brexit situation.
Up until now the prime minister has avoided committing to which Brexit border arrangements she will back.
With the publication of this 100-page white paper, which was signed off at cabinet this morning, it’s expected that she will finally descend from that particular fence.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR today became the first serving Irish head of government to visit the Orange Heritage Museum in Belfast.
During his visit, the Taoiseach met with Grand Master of the Orange Lodge, Edward Stevenson, and took a tour of the venue.
The trip to Northern Ireland has been described as a significant visit which aims to smooth over relations between the south and unionist leaders in the North, and reassure DUP members the Irish government has no “hidden agenda” amidst Brexit tensions.
“This is a fascinating place, well worth a visit,” the Taoiseach tweeted about his visit to the museum this afternoon.
Varadkar said he would encourage anyone to visit the museum “to learn more about the Protestant heritage”.
“I’ll be back for sure,” he added.

Speaking about the UK government’s Brexit paperpublished yesterday, he said his initial view is that “it is a step in the right direction, it is welcome but it does fall short”.
He added that it falls short as it only deals with the customary aspect of the border rather than the regulatory aspect.

Varadkar said it is to be welcomed that the EU task force now has something to negotiate around.
“That is something we have not had for the last two years so it is a step in the right direction. It is welcome. Even it does fall short,” he added.
The Taoiseach was also asked about UK Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson’s commentson Northern Ireland, where he said “it is beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog”.
“When I want to know what the view of the British government is, I ask the Prime Minister,” said Varadkar.
Féile an Phobail
Later today, the Taoiseach will meet with representatives of the broader business and community sectors in the North, and will also launch this year’s programme for the Féile an Phobail community festival in West Belfast.
Yesterday, he was criticised by some for launching the festival, with some Northern Ireland politicians stating  it was inappropriate.
DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was “very concerned” about it.

He said he will also set out the Irish government’s firm commitment to the peace process and north-south co-operation, stressing the need for parties to work together to restore power-sharing.

A LETTER OF no confidence in British Prime Minister Theresa May has been submitted by Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.
The move comes aftera number of ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, and MPs resigned today, citing their opposition to the draft Brexit deal agreed between British and EU negotiators.
Forty-eight Conservative MPs need to back the motion in order for a vote to take place, with a number of MPs already indicating they will support it.

In the letter Rees-Mogg, chairperson of Britain’s European Research Group, said the deal is “worse than anticipated and fails to meet the promises given to the nation” by May.

He wrote: “A few weeks ago, in a conversation with the Chief Whip I expressed my concern that the Prime Minister, Mrs Theresa May, was losing the confidence of Conservative Members of Parliament and that it would be in the interest or the Party and the country if she were to stand aside.
“I have wanted to avoid the disagreeable nature of a formal Vote of No Confidence with all the ill will that this risks engendering.
“That the Conservative and Unionist Party is proposing a Protocol which would create a different regulatory environment for an integral part of our country stands in contradistinction to our long-held principles.
“It is in opposition to the Prime Minister’s dear statements that this was something that no Prime Minister would ever do and raises questions in relation to Scotland that are open to exploitation by the Scottish National Party.
“The 2017 Election Manifesto said that the United Kingdom would leave the Customs Union. It did not qualify this statement by saying that we could stay in it via a backstop while Annex 2, Article 3 explicitly says that we would have no authority to set our own tariffs. It is also harder to leave this backstop than it Is to leave the EU. there is no provision equivalent to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
“The situation as regards the European Court of Justice appears to have wandered from the clear statement that we are taking back control of our laws. Article 174 makes this clear as does Article 89 in conjunction with Article 4.
“It is of considerable importance that politicians stick to their commitments or do not make such commitments in the first place.
“Regrettably, this is not the situation, therefore, in accordance with the relevant rules and procedures of the Conservative Party and the 1922 Committee this is a formal letter of No Confidence in the Leader of the Party, the Rt Hon Theresa May.
“I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip and although I understand that it is possible for the correspondence to remain confidential I shall he making it public.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/esri-unemployment-4253561-Sep2018/,"UNEMPLOYMENT IN IRELAND is set to decline to 5.1% next year.
Overall in 2018 to date, the unemployment rate has been 5.7%. It dipped to 5.1% in June and July but rose again to 5.6% in August.
Rising private consumption, increases in the amount of tax being collected and a decline in unemployment indicate the economy will continue to grow this year and next, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute.
The ESRI’s latest Quarterly Economic Commentary states that GDP is expected to grow by 8.9% in 2018, followed by 4.5% growth in 2019.
The ESRI said its forecasts for 2019 are Brexit-dependent and “subject to the technical assumption that an agreement along the lines of the European Economic Area will exist between the UK and the EU after March 2019″.
The organisation said growth is expected to be faster than previously predicted due to accelerated growth in domestic activity and multinational-related activity which has had “significant implications for the Irish trade balance”.

Consumer spending has strengthened throughout 2018 and construction investment has also accelerated. Housing completions of 18,655 units and 24,500 units are forecast for 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Budget
The report notes that a neutral Budget – one that neither contracts nor stimulates the economy – may be preferable next month.
The ESRI said the presence of “key infrastructural deficits in Ireland such as in the public housing area requires significant investment by the State”.
“Secondly, introducing an explicitly contractionary Budget, when the risks of a no-deal Brexit scenario are quite high, may amplify the potential fallout from an economic downturn and hence reinforce the shock on the economy rather than insulate it.”
According to a recent opinion poll, 64% of people would preferincome tax cutsand 34% would favour spending increases in the Budget. €800 million has been earmarked for Budget 2019 and there has been much speculation as to how the money will be spent.
Last month Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlined a number of measures people can expect. In short, he wantsa balance of spending and tax cuts. He said he wants the majority of any additional cash to go into improving public infrastructure rather than tax reduction.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-agreement-3986336-Apr2018/,"THE HEAD OF the European Union’s Brexit taskforce has warned the UK that there must be rapid progress on the outstanding border issues before the June deadline.
Speaking at the All Island Brexit Dialogue in Dundalk today, Michel Barnier said the UK has yet to propose any practical solutions as to how the border with Northern Ireland might work.
“We need to agree rapidly by June the scope of alignment…We want to succeed with the UK, not against the UK,” he said, adding:
“Together with the Irish government we are looking for practical solutions.”
The Tánaiste Simon Coveney was also keen to hammer home the point that the UK needs to, at the very least, begin to vocalise and set out concrete solutions.
There has been some commentary around the solutions for the border being pushed on to the October Council meeting. Coveney indicated today that all the details do not need to be finalised come June, but added that the UK must outline their position on the border solutions.
“I think we have use the time from now to June to find this operational solution for Ireland,” added Barnier, who said that until an agreement is reached, there will be no withdrawal agreement.
He added that the EU is willing to work with any solution put forward – but ideas need to be put on the table.

Earlier in the day, Barnier told reporters that there is a risk the Brexit talks will fail over the Ireland issue.
A “clear and operational solution for Ireland” needs to be included in the Brexit deal, he said, adding: “Until we reach this agreement, there is a risk”.
“June is a stepping stone for the withdrawal,” he said, but gave a clear warning:
“On Ireland let me clear. Only Irish specific solutions will work.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland remains united with the EU task force on the Irish issues.
Leaders of Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, who were also in attendance today, reiterated the points made that the UK needed to outline how it will avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.
Mary Lou McDonald said the “time is now” for the UK government to put forward real, tangible and workable solutions.
Meanwhile, Micheál Martin said he was concerned about terms such as “substantive progress” being bandied about by government. The Irish government needs to be clear and outline what it specifically needs to get from the UK government at the June EU Council meeting.
He said it was time for the Irish government to take a “firm” position at the next EU gathering.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nhs-shortages-brexit-4192357-Aug2018/,"THE GROUP THAT represents hospitals and ambulance services in England has warned that the NHS faces running out of drugs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In a leaked letter from NHS Providers,seen by The Times, it warns that on the first day outside the EU “the entire supply chain of pharmaceuticals could be adversely affected”.
Its chief executive Chris Hopson told NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens that “public health and disease control coordination could suffer”, in a no-deal Brexit.
The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and time is running out for both sides to conclude negotiations, with much left to be decided.

As the risk of the UK leaving the EU without trade and customs arrangements begins to look increasingly likely, Hopson said it was necessary for detailed contingency plans to be put in place to protect the health service.
He added, however, that there appeared to be a lack of national planning from the NHS on the matter.
“For as long as that risk remains it is important that detailed operation planning is undertaken across the NHS,” Hopson wrote. “Yet trusts tell us that their work in this area is being hampered by the lack of visible and appropriate communication.
If there is no such national coordination, he argued, it could mean both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices in individual hospitals.
The UK’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due to travel to Brussels this week for further talks with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, and he has said striking a deal is still the most likely outcome.
Despite this, a number of UK ministers have warnedthat a no-deal Brexit remains likelyin recent weeks and months.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-migrants-channel-4421651-Jan2019/,"THE BRITISH NAVY was today preparing to patrol the Channel in response to a wave of mostly Iranian asylum seekers seeking to cross from France in dinghies.
Two people have been arrested – a British national and an Iranian national – on suspicion of facilitating illegal migration across the English Channel.
Attempts to cross into Britain from France are said to have surged in the last three months, with a large number over the Christmas period.
But why the sudden increase? And what would Brexit have to do with it?
Some 539 people have crossed the Strait of Dover – the Channel’s narrowest part at 33 kilometres wide – last year in what is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Of these, 80% made the journey in the last three months, according to Minister Sajid Javid.
And the British government’s Home Secretary drew sharp criticism for comments he made yesterday about the matter.
Almost all of those who have made it to Britain have requested asylum, Javid said, before questioning whether someone who had left the safety of France could be a “genuine asylum seeker”.
Sajid JavidGareth Fuller / PA ImagesGareth Fuller / PA Images / PA Images
After two boats were intercepted last Friday, Javid declared the crossings “a major incident” and urged more cooperation with French counterparts.
This spike over the Christmas period has also been described as “deeply concerning” by UK Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes.
“Some of this is clearly facilitated by organised crime groups, while other attempts appear to be opportunistic,” she said.
And these crossings aren’t cheap for those aiming to make the dangerous journey.
A smuggler, who claimed to be a fisherman in Iran,told an undercover BBC reporterlate last year: “A boat, it’ll cost you £3,000 to £4,000. I am taking three people with me, they pay in cash. We get a boat and off we go.”
Separately, The Sunday Times newspaper, reporting from a migrant camp on the French coast, said a growing number of well-educated Iranians were attempting the Channel crossing.
It cited Ali, 34, a car salesman from Tehran, as saying his journey from the Iranian capital to Britain would end up costing £15,000, with payments in stages to a Kurd-dominated people smuggling gang.
Britain is reacting to the increased number of migrants attempting to make the trip by redeploying two Border Force cutters – large vessels – from the Mediterranean, with the HMS Mersey “available and ready” for deployment, a source told the Press Association news agency.

The rise in those attempting the journey by dinghy can be explained partly by how difficult it is for migrants to travel to the UK from mainland Europe.
Organised gangs are said to help facilitate migrants attempting to hide aboard trucks bound for Britain via sea or rail but this is very expensive.

Another potential reason for the increases seen in the past three months is the very real possibility that the UK may leave the EU without a deal on 29 March 2019.
The issues that would cause to the borders in Ireland are well known here, but there remains a fear that a no-deal Brexit could see the UK “shut up shop” when it comes to immigration for migrants.
Leonard Doyle, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration,told CNNthat smugglers could be using Brexit as leverage to convey to people that this could be their “last chance” to get into Britain.
“If people think the borders are going to change, [the smugglers] could be telling people that as a way of getting them to prop up the money,” he said.
CNN also spoke to Hadi, a 32-year-old Iranian migrant living in Dunkirk, who said that “once the UK has left Europe”, the crossing will get harder “with more policemen”.
A smuggler, also speaking to a BBC undercover reporter posing as an Iranian migrant in Dunkirk, said: “When [the] UK is out of Europe, the borders will be shut properly. The jungle will be cleared. They will put everyone in jail.”
An Afghan national who made a crossing attempt told the BBC that there is a “rush” going on at present.
“Everyone is talking about it saying we need to get in quick in case the security gets tighter,” he said.
All of those attempting the crossing that are picked up in British waters are brought to British ports. From there they can make applications for asylum.
In light of this, Lisa Doyle, director of advocacy at the Refugee Council charity, labelled Javid’s comments about “genuine asylum seekers” as “deeply concerning”.
“We are hearing time and again that the conditions in France do not make people feel safe, with migrant camps being razed from the ground and people experiencing violence from the authorities,” she said.
The opposition Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesman Ed Davey echoed the criticism, noting Javid had made the claim with “no evidence” and that it was “completely unacceptable”.
“Many of these people have fled war in Syria or persecution in Iran,” he added.
With the latest arrests in connection with a crossing attempt, and Javid’s comments yesterday, it appears that this issue will persist in the coming weeks at least.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that her cabinet have agreed a “collective position” on Brexit negotiations with the EU.
It comes after a day-long private meeting at Chequers, the country house of the UK Prime Minister. The phones of British Ministers were handed in before the meeting, to ensure May’s Cabinet didn’t leak any information discussed at the talks.
She said that the British cabinet has agreed to a “UK-EU free trade area” for goods.
“Today in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,” she said in a statement.
Here’s what they decided
Stefan Rousseau via PA ImagesStefan Rousseau via PA Images
In a video shared on theUK Prime Minister’s Twitter page, the 12 key principles the UK would approach negotiations with were outlined.
But the key principles are quite vague. They include“ending free movement”,“no more sending vasts sums of money each year to the EU”, and“a new business friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world”.
Interestingly enough in relation to the Irish border problem, the UK government is proposing a new“UK-EU free trade area with a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products”.
This would require the UK and EU to agree on what regulations it applies to goods – but the EU is unlikely to lower its standard of regulation of goods in order to create a customs arrangement with the UK post-Brexit.
It also reaffirmed its commitment to“no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.
May’s cabinet also agreedto leave the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy, and to leave the jurisdiction of theEuropean Courts of Justice.

Background
Just nine months remain until the UK is due to exit the bloc in March of next year. Despite this, a large number of issues remain unsettled in negotiations between both sides.
The EU and the UK are divided on a large number of issue, including customs and trade negotiations, the free movement of EU citizens and the issue of the Irish border.
Meanwhile, large divisions exist within May’s own Conservatives party and cabinet over what sort of approach the UK should take to Brexit.
EU leaders have warned Britain that they must present detailed plans soon or risk crashing out without a trade deal.
Split
The Cabinet is split between pro-EU and anti-EU ministers.
For example, Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond wants to retain close economic ties with the EU and its market of 500 million people.
Meanwhile, and pro-Brexit lawmakers like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson want a clean break so Britain can strike new trade deals around the world.
A powerful group of pro-Brexit Conservatives have also warned May she could be toppled by her own party if she opts for a compromise Brexit.
The border issue
The issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK remains one of the main issues facing the British government.
Last week while in Brussels Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that time was running out in relation to an agreement on Britain’s withdrawal being reached.
“Time is running out for the Withdrawal Agreement to be concluded satisfactorily by the October European Council,” he said.
Britain has promised to maintain an invisible border, free of customs posts and other infrastructure between the Republic and the North.
The proposal May presented to Cabinet today - dubbed a “facilitated customs arrangement” — calls for the UK to use technology at its borders to determine whether goods are bound for Britain or the EU, and charge the appropriate tariffs.
It would also commit Britain to keeping its regulations closely aligned to those of the EU.
That would not go down well with pro-Brexit ministers who say it would limit Britain’s ability to strike its trade deals with non-EU countries, so it is unclear if it will be accepted.
There is also a big question mark over whether the EU would accept any such proposals, with officials warning that Britain can’t ”cherry pick” benefits of membership without accepting the responsibilities that come with being in the bloc, including allowing free movement of EU citizens to the UK.

https://www.thejournal.ie/teresa-may-brexit-negotiations-4239477-Sep2018/,"THE FORMER BRITISH Foreign Secretary is warning of a car-crash style Brexit, if the so-called ‘Irish backstop’ is enforced.
In hisDaily Telegraph columnBoris Johnson, who recently stepped down from cabinet, lambasted the lack of progress on a deal, particularly on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland:
With the deadline for Brexit looming (the UK is set to leave the European Union on 29 March next, a mere six months away), the Irish border issue remains highly contentious. Johnson’s latest comments come as the BBC is set to air an interview with Theresa May tonight, in which she urges her cabinet colleagues to stick to the Chequers plan agreed in July.

The plan envisages a deal which would see common trade rules and the UK remaining close – but separate from – the EU. It also adheres to an agreement on the Irish border, known as the ‘Irish backstop’, which would see Northern Ireland remain in the EU if Brussels decides it’s not happy with the final exit arrangements.
In this latest interview with the BBC, Theresa May said there’s only one deal on the table that will avoid a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, her Chequers plan. The British Prime Minister said her government needs to ensure that the break from the European Union does not lead to the breakup of the UK.

The majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted in favour of remaining in the European Union but Johnson argues that keeping the status quo in order to maintain border-free trade would be unconstitutional:
As the British government enters the countdown phase of negotiations, May and the Irish government insist friction-free trade must remain between the two nations.
In this latest offensive, she says she’s working to ensure the people of Northern Ireland are not forgotten as her government works to agree on what a Brexit will look like.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-2-4285995-Oct2018/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Oct 2018
LAST-DITCH BREXIT talks between UK and EU officials aimed at reaching an agreement on trade rules for Northern Ireland have broken down this evening.
The talks were aimed at reaching an agreement before a crunch summit on Wednesday but the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted this evening that no deal was reached.
Failing to agree a deal at the summit would increase the chances of a disorderly and damaging British departure from the bloc.
Britain’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was in Brussels today for a previously unannounced meeting with Barnier.
“With several big issues still to resolve, including the Northern Ireland backstop, it was jointly agreed that face-to-face talks were necessary ahead of this week’s October European Council,” a spokeswoman for Raab’s ministry said ahead of the meeting.
Those talks have now completed with Barnier saying the Irish backstop remains an issue.
Rabb is reported to have left Brussels with no more meetings planned with Barnier tomorrow.
We met today@DominicRaaband UK negotiating team. Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for IE/NI to avoid a hard border. I will debrief the EU27 and@Europarl_ENon the#Brexitnegotiations.— Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier)October 14, 2018Michel Barnier/ Twitter
We met today@DominicRaaband UK negotiating team. Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for IE/NI to avoid a hard border. I will debrief the EU27 and@Europarl_ENon the#Brexitnegotiations.
The backstop arrangement to avoid a had border would see Britain leave the EU customs union while Northern Ireland remains in alignment with EU trade rules.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that her priority is to avoid such a situation and DUP leader Arlene Foster says her party would vote against any such deal in the House of Commons.
The DUP is propping up May’s slim Commons majority and the party has therefore has had an outsized influence on the negotiations, leading to Foster meeting Barnier last week.
Leaked emails following that meeting have shown that Foster reportedly sees a no-deal Brexit as the “likeliest outcome”.
Foster was said to be “deeply disappointed” with the outcome of her meetings with Barnier.
The Observer newspaper haspublished a private email exchange between senior UK officials on Foster’s thoughts following the meeting.
The exchange was based on a dinner Foster held with Conservative MEP Ashley Fox.
“She described Barnier as being difficult and hostile in her meeting today…,” the leaked email from an adviser involved in the Brexit talks says.
“AF [Arlene Foster] said the DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one.”
Foster is due to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin tomorrow to discuss Brexit and other issues.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has been informed about Foster’s stance, coming just as she faces an intense Brexit battle in the coming week.
May faces a fight on two fronts, battling to convince her own ministers and then Brussels as the Brexit talks come to a head.
She must see off the threat of a cabinet mutiny and then try to overcome a logjam in divorce negotiations at a summit in Brussels — with a breakthrough still seeming elusive.
Time is running out on Britain’s EU exit talks — and this week’s gathering of European Union leaders could prove decisive on the path to striking a deal between London and Brussels.
With Britain set to leave the bloc at the end of March, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker is demanding “substantial progress” this week, specifically on the border issue.
As for May, she not only has to win over her continental counterparts but also increasingly restive allies back home.
The hard work starts for May on Tuesday when she will rake over the Irish border issue with her cabinet, amid speculation that further ministers could quit if the PM ploughs on with her proposals.
David Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in July over May’s broad blueprint, wrote in The Sunday Times newspaper that her plans were “completely unacceptable” and urged ministers to “exert their collective authority” this week.
Border backstop
Neither London, Dublin nor Brussels wants to see checks imposed on the Irish border, but the problem persists of finding a way to square that aim with May’s desire to leave the European single market and the customs union.
Britain has proposed that it would continue to follow EU customs rules after Brexit as a fallback option to keep the border open, until a wider trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for frontier checks.
May says this will only be temporary, but her spokeswoman was forced to clarify the point after media reports that the final backstop arrangement will have no legal ending date.

‘Dodgy deal’
Writing in the Belfast Telegraph yesterday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the backstop would be “the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland”.
Meanwhile, leading Conservative eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said there were 39 like-minded Conservative MPs who “will not turn” from opposing the current plans.
Conservative Party vice-chairman James Cleverly told Sky News:
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC News that any customs backstop would be “time limited”, but did not say whether an expiry date would be written into the deal.
Some diplomats in Brussels have suggested the leaders could talk through the night on Wednesday and approve the outlines of an agreement while they are still in the Belgian capital for broader talks on Thursday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/business-brexit-chaos-4279192-Oct2018/,"DIRECTORS OF A number of Irish businesses have warned the Government they believe we are likely to experience another economic crisis in the next five years.
According to a quarterly survey of director sentiment by the Institute of Directors in Ireland (IoD), difficulty sourcing talent as well as Brexit and unattractive growth markets mean that the Irish economy is headed for more disaster.
The findings from the report found:
The survey of 273 IoD members, in early October 2018, involved chief executives, senior executives, non-executive directors and chairpersons, and showed that 82% believe that another economic crisis within the next five years is somewhat or very likely.
Over half (54%) believed that Ireland’s domestic economy and banking system are not sufficiently resilient or prepared for any crisis and 86% said that the Government needs to run a budgetary surplus to act as a buffer against future economic shocks.

Maura Quinn, Chief Executive, Institute of Directors in Ireland, said: “As the Irish economy faces significant risks going forward, both at a macro and micro level due to Brexit uncertainty, amongst many other uncertainties, business sentiment appears to have weakened in Q3.
“It is quite clear that Ireland’s business leaders are in a cautious mood and are concerned for the future of business in Ireland.”
Brexit and stagnating markets
As Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019 fast approaches, Irish business leaders said Brexit is the single biggest risk facing their organisation – up to 26% from 18%.
The UK is also seen as an increasingly less attractive market for growth.
The most significant opportunities for growth are expected domestically (39%) followed by the EU (22%). The US has dropped from 18% to 9% in Q3.
While a majority of businesses (57%) are experiencing increasing difficulties in sourcing talent, the same as Q2 (56%), 22% of the respondents state that the sourcing and retention of talent is the biggest risk currently facing their organisation, second only to the effects of Brexit (26%).

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-white-paper-4123822-Jul2018/,"Markus SchreiberMarkus Schreiber
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has published the UK’s plan for future ties with the European Union after Brexit just days after it prompted high-profile resignations from her cabinet.
May wrote in a foreword to the controversial policy paper, which calls for a free trade area and common rules with the EU for goods, that reaching a Brexit agreement with Brussels “requires pragmatism and compromise from both sides”.
Although the paper was initially described as a ‘soft Brexit’, the paper does propose taking the UK out of the single market, ending free movement of people, and ending the oversight of the European Court of Justice in the UK.
It also proposes a common regulations agreement on goods, agri-food and fisheries in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab announced the White Paper’s publication in the House of Commons just before 1pm, causing uproar among MPs who were “furious” that they hadn’t been given copies of it beforehand.
The speaker said that there was “considerable unhappiness” on both sides of the House that Raab was giving a statement on a Brexit paper that they hadn’t been given an opportunity to read yet.
He added that he won’t take points of order during the statement, but he waived a rule that would have prevented MPs who leave during the statement of asking a question.
So what does it say about Ireland?
A lot of the rhetoric used by Theresa May and most of her government in relation to Ireland and a possible border are repeated in the White Paper:
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson previously said that the Irish border problem was a millenium bug issue.Leon NealLeon Neal
The paper speaks of establishinga free trade area for goodsbetween the EU and the UK, which in theory would avoid a hard border.
This includes an agreement onagri-food and fisheriesregulations, which would “remove the need to undertake additional regulatory checks at the border – avoiding the need for any physical infrastructure”.
This would, however, mean that the UK would have to adopt the EU’s rules on all goods, a proposal that most Brexiteers turn their nose up at.
The White Paper claims that the arrangement “would protect the uniquely integrated supply chains and ‘just-in-time’ processes that have developed across the UK and the EU over the last 40 years, and will remain important given our geographical proximity, and the jobs and livelihoods dependent on them”.

Although the “country of origin” principle – where a company based in one EU country can broadcast into any other member state – will no longer apply, the UK’s commitments tothe provision of Irish language broadcastingin Northern Ireland by RTE and TG4, as set out in the Belfast (“Good Friday”) Agreement will be guaranteed, the White Paper said.
The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European UnionThe future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union
But the White Paper doesn’t include a shared agreement onservices and investment– as London is eager to protect its valuable services industry and doesn’t want to see the EU overseeing it through an authority in which it has no input (the European Courts of Justice).
It says that a new services arrangement will provide “regulatory flexibility, recognising that the UK and the EU will not have current levels of access to each other’s markets”.
Catherine McGuinness, head of policy for the City of London Corporation, said the proposals represented a “real blow” for finance firms.

The publication of the White Paper, eagerly awaited by the European Union and the Irish government, was thrown into doubt earlier this week after the UK’s chief negotiator David Davis resigned, followed shortly by Foreign Secretary and prominent Brexiteer Boris Johnson.
Reacting to the news of its publication this afternoon, a government spokesperson said:
“The government welcomes the publication of the detailed White Paper on the future EU-UK relationship. We will consult with our EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier and his team and our other EU partners.
“We look forward to negotiations intensifying over coming weeks. But equally, contingency preparations for all possible outcomes will intensify further.”
The British Irish Chamber of Commerce welcomed the document’s publication, adding that “there are many elements which will need refinement but the basis for a workable outcome are now on the table”.
John McGrane, its director general said:
Theresa May is due to meet US President Donald Trump today as he visits the UK.
Earlier, Trump seemed to criticise May’s White Paper at a press conference following a heated Nato summit:
“The people voted to break it up (Britain’s ties with the EU).

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-legal-advice-4372224-Dec2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is coming under increased pressure to publish the Attorney General’s analysis of her Brexit Withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU.
The UK’s AG Geoffrey Cox is to address the House of Commons today giving a summary of his advice, but his confidential comments to May are reported to be much harsher.
The DUP, who are supporting Theresa May’s Tory government, have teamed up with Labour to demand that the advice be published before the House of Commons votes on the Brexit deal.
Meanwhile,the Telegraph is reportingthat May’s chief Brexit advisor has warned her that the backstop provisions is a “bad outcome” for the UK.
Brexiteers are concerned that if they accept the current deal, it will lock the UK in a customs deal that they won’t be allowed to withdraw from until a new trade deal is agreed with the EU, which could take years to negotiate.
Theresa May is already struggling to convince British lawmakers to back her Brexit deal – formally signed off by EU leaders last weekend – in a key vote in parliament on 11 December.
If, as widely expected, it is voted down, what happens next remains highly uncertain. But the backers of a so-called “People’s Vote” argue it opens up an opportunity to ask Britons to think again.
On the BBC’s Andrew Marr show last night, Environment Secretary Michael Gove admitted that a second Brexit referendum was possible, but added that it would “rip apart the social fabric” of the country, and would undermine democracy.
“There is a growing momentum behind the campaign for a second referendum,” said Constantine Fraser, an analyst research consultancy TS Lombard.
The hopes of second referendum advocates were further strengthened by EU President Donald Tusk on Friday.
Speaking at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Tusk said a rejection of the deal by the British parliament would leave just two options – “no deal or no Brexit at all”.

Barriers to another vote
There are significant structural barriers to a second vote, according to analysts.
“You would need the government to actually table a proposal, have a vote in favour of it, which would require cross-party support,” Nick Wright, a fellow in EU politics at University College London, told AFP.
May has repeatedly ruled out halting Brexit or holding another vote, and it would be hard without her support.
“It’s not impossible,” noted Fraser.
“If it becomes clear that there’s political pressure for it in parliament, the government may have no other option politically.”
A cross-party group of MPs on Thursday laid down an amendment to May’s EU withdrawal legislation in a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit emerging as the default fallback option.
The proposed amendment would hand power to lawmakers if her plan is rejected in the House of Commons – and could potentially provide a legislative pathway for a referendum.
Labour’s Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said it had his “full support”, tweeting it was a “great amendment”.
Britain has legislated to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, after triggering Article 50 – the treaty mechanism used to exit the bloc – two years earlier.
It is unclear if the Article 50 process could be paused or reversed unilaterally by the government. Europe’s top court is expected to rule on the matter in days.
Britain could also try to agree a delay with the EU.
“Whether the EU agrees to extend Article 50 will depend on why the UK is asking,” said Fraser.
Some analysts think Brussels would be open to a delay for another referendum, but not for further negotiations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-good-friday-agreement-4263793-Oct2018/,"THIS MORNING, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement isn’t sacrosanct and can be changed.
This has provoked quite a reaction from politicians and commentators – mostly expressing concern at what her comments could mean in relation to Brexit negotiations and the Irish border.
Foster said to the Telegraph, in an article published this morning:
Bloomberg TVBloomberg TV
Speaking on Bloomberg TV from the Tory Party Conference in Birmingham, Foster elaborated on this statement, saying she didn’t know why her statement to the Telegraph had created a buzz.
When asked if she had a choice between a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and checks across the Irish Sea, Foster said:
“Of course there’s a border there at the moment: we have a different Vat regime, we have a different currency regime… The government has been very clear that the UK government will not be putting any physical infrastructure at the border.
“We support that because we want to continue to have a good relationship with our nearest neighbours and continue to allow people to flow in the way that they’re doing at the moment.”

None of the other EU countries would like it if the EU said: 'Do you know what, you can annex off a piece of your country to try and find a solution'.""— Gráinne Ní Aodha (@GNiAodha)October 2, 2018Gráinne Ní Aodha/ Twitter
Arlene Foster on Brexit backstop to Bloomberg: ""The EU don't understand that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK... None of the other EU countries would like it if the EU said: 'Do you know what, you can annex off a piece of your country to try and find a solution'.""
The Chief Whip of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson told Morning Ireland this morning that “if we get a no-deal outcome, that alters the way we do business on the island of Ireland… We are not seeking to alter [the Good Friday] Agreement. We are just reflecting reality.”
What’s in the Agreement
The Good Friday Agreement is seen as a political foundation for peace in Northern Ireland after decades of violence and uncertainty brought by the Troubles.
It passed after two referendums held in Northern Ireland and Ireland on 22 May 1998; the DUP opposed the agreement after walking away from negotiations.
It’s signed and guaranteed by both the British and Irish governments, and provides for the devolved government at Stormont (which has not sat for over 20 months now).
The Good Friday Agreementwas the first acknowledgement by Ireland that Northern Ireland was a part of the UK, and the Irish Constitution was subsequently amended to reflect that.
The agreement also enshrines the right of “every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation”. This allows citizens in Northern Ireland to apply for Irish passports.
Dr Ian Paisley (right) and Martin McGuinness in Belfast, March 2008.PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
The agreement is composed of three main strands: Democratic Institutions in Northern Ireland; North/South Ministerial Council; the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
It outlines the functions Northern Ireland’s devolved government has, and the role of Westminster, which can still pass legislation for the North.

It also includes a pledge of office for those elected to the Assembly, and the Code of Conduct for ministers; and outlines areas for North-South cooperation (which include agriculture, transport, waterways, and tourism).
Any significant changes to Northern Ireland’s status as part of the UK or in its affiliation with Ireland would have to be put to the voters first through a referendum in the North and the Republic.
“Foster is wrong to say the GFA is not sacrosanct,” Labour leaderBrendan Howlin said.
Can it be changed?
This is a difficult question to answer because Arlene Foster didn’t specify what aspect of the Good Friday Agreement would be open for change.

The two agreements Foster mentioned in the Bloomberg interview – St Andrews and Stormont House – are not amendments of the Good Friday Agreement, but are two separate agreements.
They form part of the North-South cooperation that is in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, but are not a part of it.
In short, the agreements formed part of establishing a Northern Ireland Executive between the DUP and Sinn Féin at Stormont. The St Andrews Agreement also pledged toset up an Irish language strategywhich has been a source of disagreement between the two parties in reestablishing an executive.
Although Foster did not specify what part of the Good Friday Agreement was open to change, the question Foster was responding to was about Brexit.
In this context, the Good Friday Agreement is referenced as something that needs to be upheld no matter what deal is struck, in order to protect peace on the island and the rights of citizens.
That’s a reference repeatedly used by UK Prime Minister Theresa May – especially in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop and the importance of avoiding a hard border.

“I want to reinforce my commitment to the Joint Report in its entirety, including reaffirming the UK Government’s view that the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement of 1998 must be protected in all its parts,” May wrote to European Council President Donald Tuskin March of this year.
She repeated her commitment to the Good Friday Agreement during her Belfast speech in July, and used it to reject the EU’s suggestion for the backstop:
Media reports indicated today that Theresa May is prepared to limit the UK’s ability to strike trade deals outside the EU after Brexit in order to reach a compromise on the Irish backstop issue.
“I have respect for Arlene, but she is wrong on this,” Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneysaid.
“We will defend and protect it through Brexit,” he said.
Responding to the DUP leader’s comments, Varadkar said the Irish government will defend the “primacy” of the Agreement, adding that it is a “co-defender” of it.
“As far as this government is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation,” added Varadkar.

The declaration on their post-Brexit relations sets out an “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership”, officials said.
The agreement now paves the way for a Brexit deal to be finalised this weekend.
European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU executive informed him it has agreed the political declaration on the future relationship with Britain.
“The declaration establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation” and other areas, according to a copy of the document seen by AFP.

British Prime Minister Theresa MayJack TaylorJack Taylor
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has gathered her divided cabinet to seek their support for her approach to Brexit, the day before she addresses EU leaders at a crucial Brussels summit.
Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union have stalled ahead of the summit, which had been billed as the deadline for a draft deal before Brexit day on 29 March.
May is still struggling to reconcile conflicting demands from Brussels and her own MPs, raising fears of a chaotic and damaging divorce.
Several of her senior ministers reportedly met last night to coordinate their approach over takeaway pizza, before today’s regular cabinet meeting focused this week on Brexit.
Media reports this weekend suggested several Brexit-supporting ministers were considering resigning if May compromised too much with Brussels.
Asked about the pizza meeting yesterday, May’s spokesman said: “Cabinet ministers are free to eat whatever they choose.”
But with a deal looking unlikely this week after the latest round of talks broke down on Sunday, the immediate threat of walk-outs appears to have reduced.
The prime minister will still go to the summit, where she will make her pitch to the other 27 EU leaders before they have dinner without her to talk about the next steps in the Brexit negotiations.
Another summit has been pencilled in for mid-November, although some leaders have said it will only go ahead if there is progress this week.
‘No deal more likely than ever before’
The European Union President Donald Tusk has warned that a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario is “more likely than ever before”.
British and European leaders insisted they could still reach a Brexit deal yesterday, despite the latest failed round of divorce talks.

May admitted there was still “disagreement” over how to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, although she said a deal was still “achievable”.
“We’ll just have to keep negotiating”, said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed “we can make progress”.

But Tusk said in a letter to members of the European Council that while he encouraged all involved to remain “hopeful and determined”, the EU must prepare for a ‘no deal’ scenario.
EU Summit
As noted above, May will update the other 27 European Union leaders before their dinner in Brussels tomorrow, with the summit kicking off on Thursday, her Downing Street office confirmed.
The EU’s Brexit spokesman Michel Barnier met his British counterpart Dominic Raab in Brussels on Sunday, but they failed to agree on a draft Brexit divorce arrangement as had been hoped.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said an agreement was now more likely in November or December.

Meanwhile, the DUP have warned that the impasse meant it was “probably inevitable” that Britain would leave the EU with no deal.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald warned the party that if a hard Brexit transpires, “then there will be an immediate demand for a referendum on Irish unity”.
‘Cool heads’
Meanwhile, May has also made a statement to the House of Commons to address what she called “inaccurate speculation” about the Brexit talks.
The Conservative leader said it was time for “cool, calm heads to prevail”.
“I continue to believe that a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and for the EU. I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable,” she said.
But the threat she faces was revealed by Sammy Wilson, the Brexit spokesman for the DUP, which props up her government.
He suggested there was no Brexit deal that would command the support of all British MPs, saying a ‘no deal’ scenario was “probably inevitable”.
European leaders insisted there was still time to resolve the outstanding issues before a possible emergency summit in November.
“We were actually pretty hopeful that we would manage to seal an exit agreement. At the moment it looks more difficult,” Merkel said, adding “we’ll just have to keep negotiating”.
In Paris, Macron said: “I believe in our collective intelligence, so I think we can make progress”, but added that the EU was “ready for all scenarios”.

TWO YEARS AGO, Ireland’s Department of Finance transposed the EU’s Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law.
There was some fear at the time that among those to suffer due to thenew directivewould be cross-border workers in Ireland – those living in the Republic but working in the North.
At the time the Central Bank confirmed thatthere were no legal impedimentsfor such workers being able to gain access to a mortgage. It also confirmed however that whether or not such a mortgage would be provided would be up to the lending institution in question.
Recently, Donegal woman Jennie Peoples and her husband called to a branch of Permanent TSB with a view to starting the ball rolling on acquiring a second mortgage on an investment property.
Both are in well-paying jobs. Jennie’s husband works in Donegal. She however works a short hop across the border in Derry city. She is paid in sterling. When the issue of salary and employment was raised at that meeting, a refusal was immediately delivered when her working situation became clear.
Immediate refusal
“We already own a house, but not with Permanent TSB,” she toldTheJournal.ie. “So we made an appointment with them, having seen all their advertising campaigns and that kind of thing, and having heard their rates are probably best at present. It’s something we’d been thinking about for a while (the couple’s current mortgage is in its fifteenth year).”
TheJournal.iequeried a number of mortgage-providing banks operating in Ireland as to their policy with such mortgages.
AIB (and its subsidiaries Haven and EBS) “facilitate mortgages for customers who reside in the Republic of Ireland but have earnings in sterling from employment in Northern Ireland”, a spokesperson said, adding that its policy “is consistent with” the Mortgage Credit Directive.
Ulster Bank also provides such cross-border mortagages “subject to meeting our credit criteria including affordability”, albeit income in sterling, or any foreign currency, must be “adjusted in bringing it into affordability calculations to allow for the potential for future exchange rate fluctuation”.

However, both KBC and Permanent TSB have a policy of flat-out refusal when it comes to cross-border lending, as Jennie found out.
“Permanent TSB does not offer mortgages in cases where the repayments are based on an income denominated in sterling,” a spokesperson said. “This was a commercial decision taken after the EU Mortgage Credit Directive came into force in Ireland.” A KBC spokesman meanwhile said that the bank “does not currently provide mortgages to individuals residing outside of the eurozone, or those who are earning their income in a non-Euro currency”.
Bank of Ireland failed to respond to our query.
Rollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
So there are options available to cross-border workers, albeit limited ones. And the banks are within their legal rights to refuse such mortgages.
“Brexit is just a sign of volatility, that anything can go wrong,” a mortgage-lending source says of the issue. “And currencies can move. It’s happened in other European countries, like in Poland where many people took loans in Swiss francs because it was cheaper. Then the franc hardened against the (Polish) zloty, and people’s payments doubled.”
Regarding the refusal of some banks to entertain the idea of cross-border mortgages, the source says that is something that comes down purely to “a commercial decision”. “There is no appetite for that risk. Such mortgages aren’t widespread either. There are only a handful of such cases you’ll see about the country.”
Fair?
But, legal though it may be, is such a refusal to lend fair to the consumer?
“To deny such mortgages outright is a very, very cautious approach,” Dermott Jewell, policy adviser with the Consumer’s Association of Ireland, says of the situation. “It suggests a concern over Brexit, a concern over sterling, a concern over the volatility of employment. That certainly feels like it’s overstepping the mark.”
“It’s as well that it should be flagged for clarity if nothing else,” Jewell added. “The banks have a licence to trade, but after that it looks like they make up their own rules.
“The two of us have grand salaries like,” says Jennie. “And Brexit hasn’t even happened. We’re still in the EU.”
“It’s just interesting to see, like, what if in the long-term we need a loan? This is before Brexit even happens you know? It’s a bit scary.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-debate-4361707-Nov2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has confirmed that she wants to have a head-to-head televised debate with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over her proposed Brexit deal, ahead of MPs voting on it next month.
Number 10 Downing Street yesterday refused to confirm that May would challenge Corbyn yesterday after rumours circulated that the pair would square off following an articlein the Telegraph.
But in an interview with the Sun today, May laid down the gauntlet to Corbyn, saying that she was ready to square off with the Labour leader over the proposed Brexit deal.
“I am going to be going out and round the country. I am going to be talking to people. I am going to be explaining why I think this deal is the right deal for the UK – and yes, I am ready to debate it with Jeremy Corbyn. Because I have got a plan. He hasn’t got a plan,”May told the Sun.
“Exactly how it might be done, if he takes it up, would be a matter for the broadcasters to determine.
Yesterday, a Labour spokesperson said that Corbyn would “relish a head-to-head debate with Theresa May about her botched Brexit deal and the future of our country”.
Why would they debate?
May today kicks off her national tour around Britain, during which she will try to sell the Brexit deal she reached with EU leaders on Sunday.
May crowned 17 months of painful talks with Brussels by sealing Brexit arrangements with the 27 other EU heads of state and government.
The European Council agreed with the progress made so far in the 500-page Brexit deal, which includes specific provisions to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and also endorsed a 26-page document on the future relationship.
May has repeatedly said that the deal on the table from the EU is the best deal available for Britain. But it has been met with fierce opposition in the UK, both from her own party and opposition figures.
The tour comes ahead of the fateful vote in the British House of Commons on 11 December, which will determine whether or not the parliament accepts what she has put forward.

With a large number of dissenters in her own party, her minority government supporters the DUP saying that they will vote against the deal, and the opposition set firmly against it, May has an uphill battle to fight.
Corbyn has been highly critical of the deal reached by May, saying it came as a result of “failed and miserable” negotiations, and has said his party will refuse to support it.
The two have a lot to gain (and lose) politically, therefore, by squaring off in a high-profile debate. For May, it will be a chance to speak directly to the electorate through the television and to sell her vision of Brexit, as well as hammer home the point that Corbyn “hasn’t got a plan”.
For Corbyn, it’s a chance to rally the nation behind the Labour Party and its refusal to accept the terms achieved by May, while also laying out his party’s vision for the future.
When will it happen?
According to the Sun, No 10 has set the evening of Sunday 9 December as the time for the debate to be held by the two leaders – ahead of the vote the following Tuesday.
But there’s one big problem with this plan: that Sunday is the final of the wildly popular I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here on ITV, and BBC One has a packed schedule of popular tv shows on the day.
As pointed out inThe Guardian:
The government might have to rethink their scheduling if they don’t want to annoy a populace already impatient and Brexit saturated populace.
What do the other parties think?
There are already are rumblings from opposition politicians that if a live televised debate is to go ahead, it should include all viewpoints.
Those in favour of remaining in the EU will want their views represented, as will people who are in favour of a no deal hard Brexit.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable he said he wants to be included if a debate goes ahead, as did leaders from the Greens, the Welsh Plaid Cymru party and the Scottish SNP.
Whatever happens, the debate promises to be divisive, contentious and hard-fought. A bit like Brexit, so.

TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that nothing he suggested in a BBC interview today is a “threat to unionism”, after his comments were met with an irate response from the DUP.
Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show today, Coveney rejected any proposals of technology being used at the border with Northern Ireland and said that a “political solution” should be found on the issue.
He also said that the Irish government had proven its own flexibility in Brexit negotiations, and expected Theresa May’s government to stick to what has been agreed to so far.
His comments were met with an angry response by the DUP, with East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson calling Coveney “belligerent, interfering and a Brit basher”,the Belfast Telegraph reported.
The Irish government has repeatedly taken the stance of – if the UK wants to sever trade ties with the EU by leaving the single market and customs’ union – the onus is on the British to find a solution for the border.
There are three ways this could happen: either the UK actually retains membership of the single market and customs union (which May has always ruled out), some kind of technological solutions are found to address the specific problems in Ireland, or that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market while the rest of the UK leaves.
The last choice is unpalatable to many UK politicians, particularly the DUP whose support is keeping May’s Conservatives in government. Last month, the EUroundly rejected the technological solutions put forward by the UK.
Speaking today, Minister Coveney said it would be “helpful” if the British government had some consensus around the concept of the border problem.

“Let’s not forget what’s been agreed in these negotiations to date,” he said. “Last December, there was a clear agreement that the British Prime Minister signed up to that there would be no border infrastructure of any kind on the island of Ireland and no related checks or controls.
Coveney said that the British government had made a clear commitment and that the Irish government now expected that promise to be kept.
The Tánaiste also said that, up to now, Ireland has been flexible and allowed wider negotiations between the UK and EU to move forward despite the lack of solutions agreed upon regarding the Irish border.
“Again in March, when the negotiations were stuck and needed to move forward, but were stuck again on an Irish border issue when a solution wasn’t taking shape we again showed flexibility and allowed the process to move on,” he said.
In response this afternoon, Wilson accused Coveney of using Brexit as an “excuse to break up the UK”.

“The fact is that the border issues can all be dealt with by technology but Coveney and co have stuck their heads in the sand refusing to even consider this solution because it doesn’t suit his aggressive republican agenda,” he said.
“Instead he tried to flog his pig in a poke solution to the EU negotiators and force it down the throat of the UK government.”
In a statement this afternoon, a spokesperson for the Tánaiste said: “Nothing the Tánaiste suggested to the BBC is a threat to unionism, quite the opposite in fact.
He said that the Irish government, the EU and the UK had recognised the importance of the negotiations in protecting the peace process in the North, and that efforts were being made towards that goal.

Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs ministers in Brussels today, Simon Coveney said: “Ireland fully supports the UK’s efforts to ensure the perpetrators of this heinous crime can be held accountable.
“All EU member states are in complete solidarity with the UK on this issue, which will be discussed at the European Council later this week.”
Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are in a critical condition after being exposed to a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury on 4 March, leading Britain to expel 23 Kremlin diplomats.
Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, has said Moscow “had nothing to do” with the attack.

Coveney said ministers attending today’s meeting will also discuss developments in North Korea, Syria and Iran, as well as the illegal annexation of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol by Russia in 2014.
Brexit
Coveney is also set to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, this morning.
A spokesperson for the Tánsiate said the EU has “been consistent that there can be no backsliding on any part” of an agreement reached by the Union and the UK in December. It stated that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic post-Brexit.
“This highlights the importance of the UK engaging meaningfully on all aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the fallback protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. The Tánaiste is looking forward to hearing Mr Barnier’s assessment of whether that is happening,” they added.

BRENDAN HOWLIN HAS said he hopes there will be a second Brexit referendum in the UK.
The Labour leader made the comments after the British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he is open to the idea of a second referendum if his party agrees to such a policy at a conference this week.
Corbyn toldthe BBC’s Andrew Marr Showthat Labour may choose to reject the Brexit deal agreed between the Conservative party and the European Union.
“We would vote it down if it didn’t meet out tests, in order to send the government – if it is still in office – straight back to the negotiating table,” he said.
Delegates at a Labour Party conference happening in Liverpool are expected to vote on Tuesday on the possibility of a second referendum.
Howlin, who is due to attend the conference, welcomed Corbyn’s comments.
“Let’s face it, two years ago, few people knew much about how the EU’s customs union or single market operate, never mind the more obscure agreements underpinning air transport or radioactive materials often used in our medical devices.

Howlin noted that recent opinion polls suggest there has been a shift in people’s views, with “the vast majority of Labour members in favour of a second vote, and indeed in favour of remaining inside the European Union”.
He added that, from an Irish perspective, “there is no such thing as a good Brexit, only damage limitation, as Ireland’s economy is so closely bound up with the UK’s”.
“Also, a hardened border in Northern Ireland would profoundly disrupt social and economic wellbeing there,” Howlin said.
‘Chequers’ deal
Pressure is mounting on Theresa May from eurosceptics in her Tory party to abandon the so-called “Chequers” proposal for a less ambitious one that would not maintain such close EU-UK ties.
The Daily Telegraph has reported that ministers intend to use a cabinet meeting tomorrow to call on May to develop a “Plan B” alternative to Chequers.
May insisted on Friday that there were only two options on the table: trying to find a compromise on her proposal or no deal at all. She added that it was now the EU’s turn to make a counter-proposal.
“We now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress,” May said.

BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY Jeremy Hunt today accused EU Council President Donald Tusk of “insulting the British people” by needling Prime Minister Theresa May in a viral social media post.
During the week Tusk posted a photo on Instagram of himself offering May a tray of cakes during a difficult EU summit on Brexit.
“A piece of cake, perhaps?” Tusk wrote alongside the picture. “Sorry, no cherries.”
View this post on InstagramA post shared by Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk)
A post shared by Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk)
The comment was a biting reference to accusations by Brussels that May was “cherry-picking” the best parts of EU membership while leaving the bloc.
Her divorce proposal envisions a UK-EU free trade area for goods through a common rulebook. But it would abandon the bloc’s right to the free movement of people and see Britain adopt its own migration policy.
The EU wants to make sure the remaining 27 members do not follow Britain’s example by trying to leave while preserving the benefits of free trade.
May’s plan was rebuffed in Salzburg on Thursday and Tusk’s post only added to what several British newspapers called her “humiliation”.
The prime minister tried to regain her footing by delivering a tough television address on Friday demanding that Britain be treated with “respect”.
That message was picked up and taken a step further by Hunt in an appearance on theBBC’s Todayradio programme today.
“Don’t mistake British politeness for weakness,” Hunt said.

Tusk issued a statement yesterday evening calling himself “a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May”. French President Emmanuel Macron had earlier mocked some pro-Brexit British politicians as “liars.”
‘Plan B’
How the two sides intend to move forward with the clock ticking down to the 29 March Brexit deadline remains unclear.
Pressure is mounting on May from eurosceptics in her Tory party to abandon the so-called “Chequers” proposal for a less ambitious one that would not maintain such close EU-UK ties.
The Daily Telegraph reported that ministers intended to use a cabinet meeting on Monday to call on May to develop a “Plan B” alternative to Chequers.
May continued to insist on Friday that there were only two options on the table: trying to find a compromise on her proposal or no deal at all. She added that it was now the EU’s turn to make a counter-proposal.
“We now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress,” May said.
But Hunt refused to rule out looking into an alternative to Chequers such as the deal Canada signed with the EU in 2016.
“I’m not dismissive of anything,” Hunt said.
Canada has a much looser free trade deal that does not remove non-tariff barriers to trade.
May said yesterday that a basic free trade agreement of that type would see Northern Ireland “permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK”.

TENS OF THOUSANDS of Pro-EU protesters took part in a march in London today, on the second anniversary of the Brexit vote.
The People’s Vote protest was calling for a second referendum on the UK’s final deal. The march started at Pall Mall and continued to Parliament Square. Organisers say more than 100,000 people attended.
A People’s Vote spokesperson said the past two years have been characterised by “arcane parliamentary manoeuvres about this amendment or that amendment” and that it’s time to take the issue “beyond Westminster and back to the people”.
It comes as Prime Minister Theresa May is coming under pressure from pro-Brexit ministers to deliver a hard Brexit.
May’s team is about to enter into the next round of negotiations with the EU, but is still to define exactly what it wants from Britain’s future relationship with the continent, particularly in the area of customs regulation.

Britain’s foreign minister Boris Johnson, who was the most prominent face in the campaign to leave the EU,  warned the Prime Minister against a Brexit that was “soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long” like toilet roll.

Writing in The Sun, Johnson urged against a “bog-roll Brexit”and called on May to “fulfil the mandate of the people and deliver a full British Brexit”.
He said the British people “just want us to get on with it”.
“Two years ago the people of this country recorded a verdict about themselves – that they had the guts to believe in Britain. They were right and will be proved right in the decades ahead.”
However, aviation giant Airbus warned on Friday it could pull out of Britain if it leaves the EU without a deal, while carmaker BMW also warned that uncertainty was affecting the investment climate.
Yesterday, a survey by ITV’s Good Morning Britainfound48% wanted a referendum on the final deal, against 25% who did not want another vote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-legal-advice-2-4376811-Dec2018/,"UK GovUK Gov
THE UK ATTORNEY General’s legal opinion on the current Brexit dealhas been published, after the House of Commons voted in favour of making it public.
MPs had argued that Prime Minister Theresa May would be held in contempt by not publishing AG Geoffrey Cox’s analysis in full ahead of the crucial vote that will be held in the House of Commons next Tuesday, 11 December.
The six-page long document was published today after over 300 MPs voted yesterday to publish the document, despite it being common practice to keep legal advice to the Prime Minister private.
Wanting a well-rounded knowledge before voting on May’s Brexit deal, and looking at the exact legal obligations backstop provisions in the deal places on the UK, are among the reasons why MPs wanted the document published in full.
There were also claims that the summary published by 10 Downing Street is a “watered down” representation of the harsh criticism from the Attorney General.
Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said that “having reviewed the Attorney General’s legal advice, it’s obvious why this needed to be placed in the public domain”.
There was a bit of confusion as reporters and MPs waited for the report to be published: of a panel of experts on Sky News, one person had read the report but couldn’t speak about it until it was officially published, another hadn’t read it but knew what was in it.
What does it say about the backstop?

In short, the Attorney General’s legal advice confirms that the backstop, referred to in the legal advice as “the Protocol”, will “endure indefinitely” and will mean that there will be more customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain than there are currently.
He says that these customs checks would take place at ports and airports between the North and Great Britain and would mean that “GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods”.
Cox says that there are parts of the deal that contradict each other, which means that it’s not clear whether the backstop is temporary.

“It is difficult to conclude otherwise than that the Protocol is intended to subsist when negotiations have clearly broken down,” the advice states.
He adds that giving Northern Ireland access to free movement of goods under the backstop splits the EU’s four freedoms, something that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said was a redline issue for him.
He says that this could pose “a difficult precedent” for the EU, as other territories could ask for special deals; the AG adds that the “Irish in particular” could find this special treatment for Northern Ireland – where they would be allowed to remain in part in the EU – “problematic”.

The DUP, unionists and Brexiteers have expressed particular concern at the following paragraph, saying that it lays a path to Northern Ireland remaining in the EU:
“…it would be open to the EU, under the pressure of factors set out above, if it considered negotiations had clearly broken down or were taking an unsatisfactory long time, to argue that Article 50 TEU no longer provided a legal base for a UK wide customs union. They could, therefore, submit a formal notification to the Joint Committee arguing that the Protocol was no longer necessary in part and that the GB elements of the customs union should fall away,leaving only NI in the EU customs territoryas the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives in Article 1.34.”
“No wonder they tried to hide the legal advice,” DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said.
Other concerns raised by the Attorney General include the fact that there’s no unilateral mechanism for the UK to leave the UK-wide customs deal provided for by the backstop.
Although there were no “security issues” contained in the advice – which the Prime Minister had cited as a reason why the AG’s advice shouldn’t be published – it has had a political impact.
The DUP, who are supporting the Tory government, said that the legal advice was “devastating”; reports had indicated that the Attorney General himself considered resigning over the issue.
SNP MP Stephen Gethins said that the provision “gives Northern Ireland full access for goods in the Customs Union”, which is a “concern for us because it puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage”.
“I think what it tells us is that you do have a differential deal for Northern Ireland, but I’d want to see the same for Scotland,” the Remainer MP toldSky News.
Prime Minister Theresa May defended criticisms of her deal based on the AG’s advice in the House of Commons:
“I have myself said on the floor of this House that there is no universal right to withdraw from the backstop,” she said, adding that she also said that there is no intention of either party that the backstop will be used – or if it is used, that it would be indefinite.
Home Secretary Sajid told the House of Commons, in response to Dodds, that some compromises are necessary as part of Brexit, and that the UK had a duty to uphold the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mep-seath-northern-ireland-4209146-Aug2018/,"IRELAND IS TO get two more European Parliament seats because of Brexit and Sinn Féin is calling on the Irish government to give them to Northern Ireland.
The call was made in aSinn Féin submission the Constituency Commissionwhich argues that citizens of the six counties of the north should continue to have representation in the European Parliament.
The majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU and the border issue has emerged as one of the key stumbling blocks during Brexit negotiations.
Of the current 751 MEPs, 73 are held by representatives of the UK and it’s been recommended that after Brexit 27 are to be filled by current EU members and 46 be kept vacant.
Ireland currently has 11 MEPs and it has been proposed thatthis will increase to 13 under the post-Brexitshake up.
Northern Ireland currently elects threeof the UK’s 73 MEPs.

The Irish government is currently engaged in areview of the European Parliament Constituenciesand as part of that process is considering the increase from 11 MEPs to 13.
Sinn Féin’s submission is made to that review and argues that consideration should be given to the fact that the review is only happening because the UK is losing MEPs.
“The very reason why the review of the European Parliamentary constituencies is happening is because of Brexit. That cannot be ignored in the deliberations of the Constituency Commission,” the document states.

Speaking today as the party launched its submission today, Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson said that voters in the south would not lose existing representation.
“We are proposing that the Constituency Commission consider the creation of an additional constituency, one for the north. It would have two MEPs, the two that Ireland are set to receive as Britain leaves the EU,” Anderson stated.
Sinn Féin’s submission points to comments from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil politicians indicating that citizens in the north should continue to elect MEPs after Brexit.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has previously suggested that Northern Ireland should continue to have representation in the European Parliament and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly has said that it is an idea “worth exploring”.

WORKERS FROM THE EU who are flooding out of the UK are looking to Ireland as an escape route – but a move to the Republic will only make financial sense for a select few.
Figures released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics show that the number of EU workers in the UK has dropped by the most on record.
Between July and September, roughly 2.25 million EU nationals were working in the UK, which is 132,000 fewer than the previous time period last year. During the same time frame, the number of non-EU workers increased by 34,000 to 1.24 million.
Data from jobs listings site Indeed shows the outflow of EU workers is part of a trend that began in the middle of 2015 when European workers started to “lose interest” in the UK, according to Indeed economist Pawel Adrjan.
The data also showed that there has been a drop in search traffic from workers in another EU country looking at UK-based rules. The largest decreases were among people currently based in Ireland, followed by Poland.
Adrjan said the trend started as economic prospects in EU workers’ home countries improved markedly, with wages in Poland growing more than twice as fast as British pay packets.
Morgan McKinley global foreign direct investment director Trayc Keevans toldForaher firm’s most recent employment monitor shows there has been a 12-month peak in the number of professionals registering for opportunities in Ireland.

EU workers scoping out Ireland is good news for Irish-based employers, which have seen the local talent pool dry up as the country approaches full employment.
Keevans said these workers see Ireland as a “safer bet”, but she added that when they do their homework on the movea lot of them are being scared offby the cost of housing.
“The higher-earning professionals that are coming in, they are not experiencing the challenges that we’re reading about (housing),” Keevans said.
“It tends to be the mid-level, those that are earning anything between €30,000 and €60,000, they are the ones that are really experiencing difficulty.”

She added that the narrative of around Ireland’s rental market is spreading across the continent.
“We’ve had a number of eastern European professionals that are concerned about making the move and wondering will they be able to secure housing.”
Keevans also said we shouldn’t expect too many senior professionals to be among those scoping out a move here.
“If monetary is their primary objective, then the personal taxation structure here is restrictive to them making that choice to move here.
“They usually have another reason for coming here, which is they’ve already made the commitment or have a related spouse and it’s a move for lifestyle reasons.”
Tech status
Keevens said that UK-based financial services and tech professionals were the largest groups showing an interest in Ireland, while those in similar roles from the continent were also likely to be weighing a move here.
“It’s a mixture of those that would have been going to the UK, which would have been their first choice, but now of the uncertainty they’re not. They’re focusing on Ireland because it’s English-speaking.
Adrjan said the flow of EU workers out of the UK is likely to cause skill shortages in healthcare and construction in the British labour market.
He noted that workers in these sectors are also demonstrating an interest in working in Ireland, based up on Indeed’s traffic. Nevertheless, Adrjan said it didn’t look like the migration trend would significantly affect the UK’s tech hub status.
“Indeed research shows that global jobseekers looking for jobs in technology have not been put off by Brexit just yet.
“This suggests that Britain could keep its position as a global tech magnet in a post-Brexit world, provided that the economy continues to grow, and migration policy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate an internationally mobile skilled workforce.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-a-united-ireland-is-a-realistic-possibility-now-so-we-need-to-prepare-for-it-4377409-Dec2018/,"For the first time since partition, reunification of Ireland has become a realistic possibility. The twin pressures of Brexit and demography have changed the political context.
To add to this, the failure of devolved government to create a financially sustainable Northern Ireland is encouraging people to consider different arrangements for future governance.
It is essential to recognise, though, that whatever governance structure is adopted for Northern Ireland, and whatever jurisdiction it is part of, the same underlying problems must be addressed. Northern Ireland is not self-financing, it is wasteful and it needs fundamental reform. It also remains a deeply divided society.
Those who argue for a united Ireland need to recognise these facts, otherwise they are engaged in a level of dishonesty that is similar to those Brexiteers who pretended that leaving the EU would be simple to negotiate on terms that were beneficial for the UK.
The challenges of a united Ireland are severe. At their heart is addressing the economic weaknesses that are inherent in Northern Ireland.
Subsidised
According to the UK Treasury, there is an annual subvention to Northern Ireland from the taxpayers of Great Britain of around £10 bn.
If you strip out the costs that would perhaps not transfer to a united Ireland, such as interest on government debt and the armed services, for example – then you might bring the amount down to about £5bn.
A much smaller, but still vast, figure. A realistic plan for reducing that would certainly help reunification. Achieving a more integrated society – particularly through integrated education – might shave around £1bn a year off that amount. But that is not a change that could be achieved at the flick of a switch.
Public Sector
Another difficult challenge is the reliance of Northern Ireland on public sector employment.
There are around 50,000 more people in the public sector workforce in Northern Ireland than there would be if it were the same size, pro rata, as that of the Republic or England.
A programme, conducted over a number of years, might reduce the size of the public sector, alongside increasing the size of the private sector.

Northern Ireland’s economic challenge is closely related to its unbalanced public spending. Public finances need to be re-prioritised, with much more allocated towards investing in skills and infrastructure, while addressing regional inequalities.
Productivity in Northern Ireland is horribly weak, which points to a lack of investment, insufficient skills and inadequate infrastructure. This needs to be corrected if the north is to have a vibrant economy and higher tax revenues.
Health
Reform is also needed urgently to Northern Ireland’s health service. Waiting lists and waiting times are too long. A proposal for fundamental change – the Bengoa report – is sitting on the shelves, waiting for a minister to implement it.
Yet, when you ask people in the north about a united Ireland, the Republic’s health system is cited as a major blockage.
Each system needs reform: integrating the two, based on the NHS principles of being free at the point of delivery, would improve the cost-effectiveness of both. The Oireachtas report on SlainteCare represents an important move by the Republic towards the creation of a healthcare system much more acceptable to people in the north.
Changes
Irish reunification is only possible if a majority in both jurisdictions want it. But it also requires changes to how those jurisdictions operate.
If the Irish state is willing to consider seriously the prospect of reunification then it would help if it could make some changes quickly.
They might include doing more to demonstrate that Ireland as a whole values the traditions, culture and contributions of people from Protestant, unionist and loyalist backgrounds.
There should also be a recognition by the UK government that any person born in Ireland, on either side of the current border, has a right to either Irish or British citizenship, or both. This would mirror in the Republic the settlement in Northern Ireland, as established by the Good Friday Agreement.
Creating greater cohesion between all communities across the island is the major priority, and will also take time. Simply achieving a united Ireland is not enough. It has to be an integrated nation, a new society, which brings people together and increases collective prosperity and well-being.
Attempting to achieve a massively difficult task too quickly is a path to confusion and failure.
Irish reunification must be a medium to long term project if it is to be successful. A ten year plan to achieve it will provide a strong foundation that can and should lead to success.
‘A New Ireland – a ten year plan’ by Paul Gosling is being launched today Friday 7th December, at 9am in Buswells Hotel, Dublin and at 2pm at The Europa Hotel, Belfast.

https://www.thejournal.ie/medicines-4155512-Jul2018/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has admitted that Ireland will stockpile medicines in coming months over concerns that supplies could dwindle in the event of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.
Last week, British health secretary Matthew Hancock said the country was set to stockpile medicines and blood supplies ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU.
Asked whether Ireland would be taking similar precautions before next March, the Taoiseach admitted plans were in place to do so, saying there was “a concern around medicines”.
But if Ireland isn’t leaving the EU, why does it have to worry about supplies of medicine? And what are the implications of stockpiling?
Here we do our best to explain…
Frank AugsteinFrank Augstein
It’s just under eight months until the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union on 29 March, but the type of Brexit deal the UK gets remains very much up in the air.
In the event that no arrangement is reached with the EU, the UK would exit the single market and customs union and resort to World Trade Organisation rules on trade.
That means significant tariffs would be imposed on goods entering the UK from the EU, and on goods the UK sends to the EU.
Among the vast array of products that would be affected in this so-called “no-deal” scenario are medicines and blood products.
370 million packs of medicine are imported by the UK from the EU every month, as well as blood plasma supplies and the radioactive isotopes used in X-rays.
Because the UK still doesn’t know which type of Brexit deal (if any) that it’s going to get, Hancock announced last week that stockpiling these products would begin in order to ensure the UK isn’t left in a situation where it ends up short.
MerrionStreetMerrionStreet
In short, Ireland could be affected by its place in the supply chain.
Currently, the NHS enjoys a free, unchecked flow of medicines from Europe, but many products that enter the UK later end up in Ireland. Sources in the health industry say that it is likely that the majority of medicines in Ireland have, at some point, been in the UK.
That’s because suppliers tend to send their products to the UK, the largest English-speaking country in the EU, to be packaged and labelled.
In fact, up to 60% of marketed medicinal products here share labels and leaflets alone with the UK.
For perspective, every month, 45 million patient packs of medicine are supplied from the UK to the EU27, and 37 million patient packs are supplied from the EU27 to the UK. That’s one billion medicines packs per year.
And because these products are exported to Ireland after they’ve entered the UK, a large number of companies simply view the UK and Ireland as one market.
So if there’s a disruption in the supply of medicines to the UK, it could have serious knock-on effects for Ireland.
According to Leo Varadkar, some companies may not bother dealing with Ireland at all if they think the Irish market is too small on its own, or believe that figuring out ways to supply the Irish market is too much effort.
If that happens, Ireland could be left without the medicines it imports from the UK.

The Irish Examinerquotes Varadkar as saying:
“Even in the event of a hard deal/no Brexit, it is not that it would be impossible to import from the UK.
“It would still be possible, but there would be restrictions obviously, so part of our contingency planning does involve making sure that we have a supply of medicines.”
It’s important to note that stockpiling is a contingency measure, rather than an all-out panic.
As the Taoiseach pointed out, getting medicines from the UK (or those the UK traditionally imports) won’t be impossible.
Instead, the plan is to prevent shortages in the long-term, not create them in the short-term.
Varadkar also said that many medicines were made in Ireland (in fact, pharmaceuticals are our biggest export), which could help mitigate against the threat.
For the time being, it seems unlikely that Ireland will experience a medicine shortage before or after Brexit, even in a ‘no-deal’ scenario.
Meanwhile, the Taoiseach also reassured the public that blood supply issues were “not a concern” for Ireland, despite the cross-border agreement we have with Northern Ireland.
The Irish Pharmacy Union said the uncertainty surrounding Brexit as a whole presented particular challenges for the industry, which will be among the “worst hit” next March.
IPU president, Daragh Connolly toldTheJournal.iethat “medicine shortages were a very real concern”, but that the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) was planning contingencies in the meantime.
A spokesperson for the HSE toldTheJournal.iethat it is working on contingency plans, which sources say include stockpiling or attempting other measures to “disentangle” the Irish medicines market from the UK.
“The HSE is working on contingency plans in a number of areas in relation to Brexit, including measures required to maintain patient services and continuity of supplies. This includes liaison with the Pharmaceutical Industry and distributors in relation to medicines, in order to identify risk areas regarding supply and to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place in the event of disruption arising due to Brexit.”
A spokesperson for the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association says that the sheer scale of imports and exports of medicine is “one measure of the importance of medicines for human health, facilitated by regulatory alignment and free trade”.
The association says that Irish customers must have access to medicines.
“Whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, it is critical that Irish patients, as well as patients across Europe, can continue to access their medicines without disruption. The integrated nature of supply chains for medicines across Europe, and the shared regulatory framework, mean that Brexit preparedness has been a priority for our industry, working closely with the relevant public health stakeholders.”
A no-deal Brexit is one that the IPHA has discussed with the HSE, Revenue and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
A HPRA spokesperson toldTheJournal.iethat it, too is planning contingencies.
“Medicines availability is at the centre of the HPRA’s Brexit strategy and we continue to monitor this closely as our priority is to ensure patients continue to have access to safe, high quality and effective medicines.
“The HPRA is actively planning Brexit contingencies and has established an internal working group to examine all issues under its remit relating to Brexit, including the ongoing availability of medicinal products. This group co-ordinates a number of ongoing HPRA actions related to Brexit.
“The HPRA is committed to minimising the impact of Brexit on the supply of medicines to the Irish market. In addition to maintaining existing marketing authorisations and joint packs with other markets, the HPRA will consider any specific concerns that arise in conjunction with Brexit and prioritise actions that can be taken to address these concerns.”
Stockpiling is happening, and sources say it’s just good practice. However, they say that a “doomsday” scenario is very unlikely to happen.
“In terms of will people be roaming the streets looking for vital medicines? I’d find it very hard to imagine,” said one.
“Whatever happens with Brexit, our authorities can’t let people go without the medicines they need.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-brexit-gra-3941689-Apr2018/,"BORDER GARDAÍ ARE “completely unprepared” for Brexit and have not once been briefed on the potential policing implications that a hard or soft border would cause, a garda representative has claimed.
Rank-and-file members are more than conscious that the border issue has not been resolved and are calling on Garda HQ to start disseminating contingency plans to local stations.
The division of Cavan/Monaghan is one of the worst affected, according to Garda Representative Association (GRA) member James Morrisroe. A lack of new recruits coming through their doors means that not only do gardaí have to contend with the unknown of Brexit, they are also dealing with a general lack of resources.
Morrisroe drew attention to the need for new recruits to boost ranks in his local division.
Probationer gardaí are the new graduates out of Templemore who are sent to stations across the country to get experience. A lack of new recruits has been an ongoing issue for gardaí over the last few years. The recruitment freeze adopted during the recession is over but its impact is still being felt.
Probationer gardaí can only be assigned to stations where appropriate supervision is available leading to a catch 22 situation for Cavan/Monaghan as well as a host of other districts.
Something which was brought up at the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) conference last week was the restrictions caused by a lack of sergeants based in stations.
There are just seven sergeants in Cavan’s Bailieboro district as opposed to 12 in 2010. The deficit is seriously impacting policing, according to Morrisroe.
“What you have at the moment is a lack of new recruits coming through. We can’t get the probationers coming because we don’t have the sergeants to supervise them so we’re stuck in limbo.
Advertisement
“Because you’ve no new members coming in -  morale is suffering. You look at Bailieboro especially. The morale there is very low in relation to previous inquiries.
“Local management is doing its best. But how can senior management in Garda Headquarters in Dublin not be conducting any succession planning (to maintain garda numbers)? They know we’ll need a certain amount of sergeants and gardaí in the near future yet nothing is happening. This also affects the allocation to specialists units which were decimated during the moratorium on recruitment.
But Morrisroe is not holding out too much hope. It is his opinion that the border region is somewhat neglected in relation to the allocation of resources.
“One only has to look at recent tensions north of the border to realise the importance of properly resourcing gardai in the border divisions and this is even without the added complicated issue of Brexit.”
Brexit pressure
It is his fear and the fear of his colleagues that when Brexit finally arrives, An Garda Síochána will be in no way prepared to deal with it. This is not the only major issue for gardaí.
Morrisroe said: “Brexit is a big example – in a year it’s here whether we like it or not. Even without Brexit we need more garda graduates. I know it’s said all the time but we’re at crisis point. What would it be like for argument’s sake if it’s a soft border with periodic checks? It’s not like they don’t know this was coming. Action is needed and quick. The bottom line is we are completely unprepared.
“I recall the foot and mouth and BSE crises of 1996 and 2001 where the border was sealed overnight. Hundreds of gardai were temporarily transferred from as far away as Cork for the duration of the operation. Is this the potential scenario that will unfold? One wonders if contingency plans are being drawn up at all.
Responding to the claims, a Garda spokesman said: “Local garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of garda resources, and the best possible farda service is provided to the public.
“Senior garda management is satisfied that an adequate policing service continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient policing service to the community. This situation is continually reviewed.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-court-of-justice-revoke-article-50-ruling-4374195-Dec2018/,"THE EUROPEAN COURT of Justice’s Advocate General has ruled that the United Kingdom can unilaterally revoke Article 50 without the approval of the European Union.
Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, who is the bloc’s top lawyer, published his written opinion this morning on a case to decide whether the UK can stop its exit from the EU.
The legal opinion states that“unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU” was possible without the need for the remaining 27 member states to agree.
“Unilateral revocation would also be a manifestation of the sovereignty of the departing Member State, which chooses to reverse its initial decision,” it adds.
The opinion is not legally binding, but the Advocate General’s opinion is often followed by the court’s 27 judges and provides a strong indicator of how they will rule in the case.

The case was brought by a number of members of Scottish parliament in Holyrood, who sought the court’s ruling on whether the UK could unilaterally stop Article 50.
The article was triggered in 2016, and will see the UK leave the EU on 29 March, 2019.
It comes the same day that the House of Commons begins a five-day debate on Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, which MPs will vote on next week.
May faces opposition on all sides of the House of Commons to the agreement, agreed last month, but will insist that the deal is the only option for a smooth Brexit in March.
“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted,” she will tell MPs.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-northern-ireland-2-4057104-Jun2018/,"LAST UPDATE|7 Jun 2018
THE UK GOVERNMENT has proposed that a “backstop” plan to be put in place should there be no Brexit border deal would end in 2021.
The issue had split the UK’s Cabinet with Brexit Minister David Davis favouring an end date and Prime Minister Theresa May favouring a more open-ended approach.
May had suggested that the UK remain in the EU’s  in the customs union until such a time as a solution to the border was reached.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this morning that any proposal could not be time-limited.
In a proposaldocument published this afternoon, the UK Cabinet outlined its plans for the backstop, or temporary customs arrangement, and says that it should be “time-limited”.
“The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland. The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest,” the document states.
“There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU.”
Channel 4 reportedlast night on rumours that Davis was considering resigning over disagreements in Cabinet in relation to the issue but this proposal could end those rumours, at least temporarily.

Northern Ireland and the border has emerged as one of the key issues for negotiators in Brexit talks, with all sides insisting that there can be no hard border between the North and the Republic post-Brexit.

The UK has committed to providing technological solutions to the issue of the border. May committed that if the EU did not accept these solutions, a backstop plan would be put in place that would avoid this.
The British proposals have to be agreed by the EU with its chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeting this afternoon that there are “three questions” that needed to be addressed.
I welcome publication of#UKproposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop.We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?— Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier)June 7, 2018Michel Barnier/ Twitter
I welcome publication of#UKproposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop.We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?
Speaking this morning ahead of the publication of the document, Varadkar also said the proposals must address specific questions.
An Taoiseach also said that any backstop would have to remain in place until such time that an alternative was found and he said that this makes a time-limit impossible.
“The principal that’s in the existing Irish protocol, the existing backstop which is supported by 27 EU member states including Ireland, is that it implies at least there’s an alternative in place. Until there’s a new arrangement between the EU and UK that prevents a hard border. So it’s not something that can be time limited by a date,” he said.

Speaking this afternoon, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald TD said she felt it was “decision time” for all parties involved.
“I think it would be very, very dangerous for the Taoiseach to think that he can outwit or outsmart the Tories in London,” she said.
McDonald said that she felt it was time for May and Varadkar to set out “in the clearest possible terms what the agreement is, if we have an agreement”.
“If we don’t have an answer in June I think the Taoiseach is absolutely duty bound to hit the pause button and to make it absolutely clear to the British that game-playing, that equivocation, that Alice in Wonderland fairytale thinking is not sufficient.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rees-mogg-brexit-4073122-Jun2018/,"TDS HAVE CRITICISED comments made by Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the UK should call Ireland’s bluff on the issue of a border.
Speaking to theIrish Times, he said he believes British Prime Minister Theresa May should “simply make it clear that we will not put up a border and that is our position”.
“And what would the Irish do if the EU insisted? I think that is a really interesting question. I think we should call that particular bluff.”
He also dismissed the EU’s argument that its rules demand it should police its external borders and protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union. He suggested that the European Union could ignore its own rules and make an exception in this instance.
Sinn Fein’s Brexit spokesperson David Cullinane said he believes Brexiteers like Rees-Mogg are “trying to pretend they can have their cake and eat it too and also trying to pretend the EU can essentially break the rules of the customs union”.
“Rules exist for a reason and once you’re in the customs union you have to abide by those rules – if not you are subject to checks and tariffs. He knows that.
“Nowhere in the world is there an a la carte approach to customs arrangements where you can ignore the rules, he’s scraping the bottom of the barrel.”

TD Lisa Chambers, who is Fianna Fáil’s spokesperson on Brexit, toldTheJournal.ieshe found the Tory MP’s language “unhelpful”.
“The Irish government has been trying its best to ensure the UK gets a good deal. There is a large amount of trade back and forth and we are very close neighbours, we have a lot of history. We appreciate that a bad deal for the UK is a bad deal for Ireland.
“But we are remaining inside the club and Mr Rees-Mogg is missing the point that it cannot be better to be outside it than inside it.”
She said his comments about simply telling the EU there will not be a border displays “a lack of understanding” of what his own government agreed to last December in the backstop agreement. This is a fallback clause that would see the UK remain in alignment with the EU’s customs union rules in the absence of another solution after the two-year Brexit deadline has passed.
Without the backstop agreement, there could be no withdrawal treaty and this would see the UK crash out of the European Union.
“That may be okay for him with the privileged position of no financial concerns but for many of his citizens in the UK that would be hugely detrimental in terms of the damage to the economy and financial hardship.
“Perhaps that is not a concern for Mr Rees-Mogg because he won’t be one of those people.”
When asked for its response to the Tory MP’s statements, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it did “not have any comment at this time”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/amber-rudd-resignation-3985579-Apr2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has accepted the resignation of her Home Secretary Amber Rudd this evening.
Downing Street confirmed the development with a No 10 spokesman telling theBBC: ""The Prime Minister has tonight accepted the resignation of the Home Secretary.""
Rudd telephoned May to inform her of her decision in response to the continuing controversy over the treatment of the so-calledWindrush generationin Great Britain.
It had emerged in the past 24 hours that she may have misled a committee of MPs over whether her department had targets for removing a certain amount of illegal immigrants from the country over a given period of time.

The Guardian published a memofrom Rudd to May which outlined how she had an “aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10% over the next few years”. She had told the home affairs select committee that her department did not work off targets.
Earlier this month, May's government was forced into a climbdown and apology over threats to deport Caribbean-born citizens who were granted the right to live and work in Britain after the Second World War.
The so-called Windrush generation began arriving in the UK from Commonwealth countries in 1948 to help rebuild the country after the Second World War, and were given indefinite leave to remain. Having lost hundreds of thousands of people, particularly working-aged men, during the war, the country needed labour and the Commonwealth provided the answer.
Because many were born in countries that were still colonies, they were legally British and granted leave to stay indefinitely.
While most lived without incident for decades, recent focus on immigration by Rudd's department changed that. In recent years, since a 2012 law change, a government clampdown on illegal immigration has begun to identify those without papers – scooping up many elderly people from the Windrush generation.
Numerous cases have been highlighted where those who lack the proper documents were told they need evidence to continue working, get NHS treatment or even remain in the UK.
Related ReadsWhat is the 'Windrush generation' and why did it lead to a major apology and a resignation?
At a meeting on 17 April, May told representatives of the 12 Caribbean members of the Commonwealth that she took the treatment of the Windrush generation “very seriously”.
“I want to apologise to you today. Because we are genuinely sorry for any anxiety that has been caused,"" she said.
“I want to dispel any impression that my government is in some sense clamping down on Commonwealth citizens, particularly those from the Caribbean.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-gone-4117532-Jul2018/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Jul 2018
BORIS JOHNSON HAS resigned as Foreign Secretary, dealing another blow to Prime Minister Theresa May in the wake of the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis last night.
It was reported yesterdaythat Johnson had described May’s latest Brexit proposals as “polishing a turd” in the course of the day-long meeting of ministers at the Prime Minister’s country retreat on Friday.
“This afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary,” a statement from Downing Street said.
Davis’s resignation, meanwhile, was announced late last night with the departing minister saying he no longer believed in the plan for the UK’s future relations with the EU, which was backed by the Cabinet at that Friday Chequers meeting.
Junior minister Steve Baker confirmed he had also quit, alongside Davis. Dominic Raabwas named as new Secretary of State for Brexitearlier.
The question of whether Johnson would follow Davis out the door had been unresolved all morning – his decision, publicly announced just half an hour before a scheduled Commons address by May, only adds to the growing uncertainty around the Prime Minister’s position.
In his resignation letter this evening, Johnson said: “Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic…
He said that crucial decisions had been postponed and that the current policy from May would deliver a “semi-Brexit” that would leave the UK forced to accept EU laws on a range of issues, rather than making its own.
Johnson said: “In that respect, we are truly headed for the status of colony – and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement.”
He also likened Theresa May’s negotiating strategy to “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering above them”.
Commons statement
Delivering her statement on Brexit, May began by paying tribute to Davis for his efforts setting up the Brexit department. She said Johnson had brought “passion” to his promotion of Britain abroad and welcomed Raab to the Cabinet.
“We do not agree about the best way of delivering our shared commitment to honouring the result of the referendum,” she said of her departing ministers.

Amid heckling from the opposition, she continued by summarising the plan signed off by ministers last Friday and insisting a ‘no deal’ Brexit could have profound consequences for the UK and EU.
The 12 key principles for Brexit negotiationsset out by Downing Streeton Friday included a new “UK-EU free trade area with a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products”.
The proposed plan (which can be read in full here) would avoid checks on the border while fulfilling domestic promises to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, control migration and allow Britain to establish its own trade policy.

‘Challenging for the EU’
There was laughter and more heckling when she said the Brexit plan would be “challenging for the EU”. The rumbles from across the aisle continued as she spoke of a “Brexit dividend” that could be used to help fund the NHS.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn went on the attack right away, telling the chamber that the Chequers deal had taken two years to reach and had lasted only two days.
How can anyone have faith in May reaching a deal with the EU when she can’t reach an agreement with members of her Cabinet, he asked.
Davis and Johnson, he suggested tongue-in-cheek, would have quit on the spot during the behind-closed-doors country house meeting on Friday had it not meant “a very long walk, no phone, and, due to government cuts, no bus service either”.
Speaker of the Commons John Bercow called for calm as members continued to shout and heckle in a packed chamber, telling MPs there was no need for them to “chunter from their seats”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/numbers-theresa-may-house-of-commons-brexit-deal-4362193-Dec2018/,"A VOTE IS SCHEDULED for the House of Commons on the 11 December – but what’s the magical number Theresa May needs to get her Brexit deal through?
There are 650 seats in the House of Commons; in June 2016, at the time of the Brexit vote, the David Cameron’s Tory party held 330 seats, which represents a slim majority.
After Theresa May took over as Prime Minister, she called a snap election for 8 June 2017, looking to increase her party’s majority to make passing legislation easier. But they actually lost their majority – winning just 315 seats.
This led to a “confidence and supply” agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party, which had 10 MPs after the election.
In exchange for their pledge to vote with the Tory government, DUP leader Arlene Foster got €1 billion in additional funding for Northern Ireland.
House of CommonsHouse of Commons
Of the 650 elected MPs,fourdo not vote. They are the speaker of the House of Commons and his three deputies (who have the titles of Chairman of Ways and Means, First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means).
There are also Sinn Féin’s 7 elected MPs, who won’t take their seat due to a long-standing policy of abstentionism. Since it was announced that the EU and UK struck a deal, it’s been argued that Sinn Féin should take the oath, which they are ideologically opposed, in order to vote in favour of the Brexit deal, which includes provisions for Northern Ireland that would avoid a hard border in Ireland.
But they have been steadfast in their refusal to take their seats, saying they could not pledge an allegiance to the queen, and that if they took their seats as a one-off this time, it would open up requests for them to take their seats the next time.

So that’s639active members of the House of Commons, making320the magic number that Theresa May has to reach. So will she do it?
As it stands
Baffled by what May is doing going around the country selling the deal. The people she needs to convince are in Westminster.— Ian Dunt (@IanDunt)November 27, 2018Ian Dunt/ Twitter
Baffled by what May is doing going around the country selling the deal. The people she needs to convince are in Westminster.
This was the take of Conservative MP Mark Francois, who wants May to step down as leader of the Conservative Party.
He outlined the reasons why he was opposed to the deal when he said: “No sooner is the ink dry than the Spanish are after Gibraltar and the French are after our fish.”
The inclinations of more moderate Brexiteers also hints that the House will vote against the deal: May can probably rely on the votes of 240 MPs; around 40 Tory MPs are predicted to vote against the Brexit deal (revised down from 80).
Labour’s 257 MPs are expected to vote against the deal in theory, but with its leader Jeremy Corbyn being seen as weak on Brexit, and with reports of May lobbying labour MPs earlier this year, chances are that she’ll gather the votes of a few members.
Passing the bill will also depend on winning over the 10 DUP MPs, which have said won’t back her dela because of provisions given only to Northern Ireland (the backstop).
There are also options such as theNorway Plus modelthat are being used to try sway Brexiteers in favour of voting for the deal.
On Tuesday, senior Tory backbencher Michael Fallon, who is considered to be largely supportive of May, said that her deal was “the worst of all worlds” and was “doomed”, adding that he would be voting against it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-leo-varadkar-brexit-4388679-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2018
Theresa May and Leo Varadkar pictured in London in September 2017.John Stillwell / PA Archive/PA ImagesJohn Stillwell / PA Archive/PA Images / PA Archive/PA Images
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is set to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin tomorrow.
The two leaders will meet at Government Buildings tomorrow evening in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
Brexit will, of course, be at the top of the agenda.
Today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney brought a memo to Cabinet on the contingency planning put in place in the scenario of a no-deal Brexit. It outlined that all government departments are to be prepared for “all eventualities” in the case of an “orderly” or “disorderly” Brexit.
A government spokesperson said this evening, that contingency planning has been taking place since the UK voted to leave the EU, however, the “planning phase” has now shifted gear to the “implementation phase”.
The Taoiseach told the Dáil today there are the contingency plans happening at European level, led by the Commission, and those that are specific to Ireland, which are led by the Irish government.
“The plans in Brussels will not be finalised until the middle of January but we are happy to make them public as we move forward. Indeed, it will be necessary to make them public because it will require the recruitment of staff, which must be made public, infrastructure at ports and airports, which will have to be tendered for and thus be made public, and legislation.
“In some cases it will be simple legislation to add words such as ‘and the United Kingdom’ beside the European Union and to make exceptions for the United Kingdom in certain circumstances. Again, that must be made public because we will be asking the Oireachtas to enact that legislation.It will also involve business supports, many of which are already well known.
“Additional supports around state aid might be necessary after 28 March. These things must be done in consort with Brussels. They must all be done together and they must not contradict each other,” said Varadkar.
It is understood government departments have been instructed to have legislative changes that may be needed from within their own departments ready, with time likely to be set aside in the Dáil and Seanad in the new year, if necessary.
However, while the government appears to be putting plans in place for increase supports needed at ports and airports, a government spokesperson this evening stated that “no preparations for a hard border” have been put in place.
Yesterday May confirmed she was postponing today’s crucial House of Commons vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she can go back to Brussels and ask for certain changes to be made.
Varadkar and Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, have both said the deal struck between the European Union and Britaincannot be renegotiated.

May told the House the current agreement “would be rejected by a significant margin” but stated: “I’m in absolutely no doubt that this deal is the right one.”
While the stakes appear to be getting higher with the visit of May announced late this afternoon, a government spokesperson said the government still believes a no-deal Brexit is avoidable, however, he added that government preparations have “intensified” due to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
One of the main sticking points is the proposed backstop arrangement. Thisaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal – including MPs in May’s own Conservative Party, as well as members of Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party – which is propping up May’s minority government.
The DUP believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
There have been calls for no-confidence motions in both the British government and May to be put forward, as well as calls for May to resign – from outside and inside her own party.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-threat-food-shortages-ireland-4381228-Dec2018/,"AS UK PRIME Minister Theresa May has just five days to try to rally support for her Brexit deal, a Tory MP has suggested using the possibility of food shortages in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit to encourage the EU to drop the backstop.
A government report,leaked to the Times of London, has indicated that there could be food shortages in Ireland in a no-deal Brexit scenario, and the economic impact on Ireland would be worse than in the UK.
This is based on the large number of food exports from the UK to Ireland (more than half of the total food imported to Ireland comes from the UK). In the event of a no-deal, trade rules would revert to those used by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but the UK would have to apply to become a member of the WTO to implement them.
At a Brexit event for local authorities held in Dublin this week, economist Dan O’Brien echoed those sentiments, adding that the threat of food shortages and supplies in a no-deal scenario shouldn’t be underestimated.
According to today’s article, the UK government report has indicated that there would be a 7% drop in GDP for Ireland, while the equivalent for the UK would be a drop of 5%.

Tory MP Priti Patel has told the paper that these warnings should have been used as leverage against Ireland to encourage them to drop the backstop.
“This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during negotiations? There is still time to go back to Brussels and get a better deal.”
Patelresignedas International Development Secretary last November after holding 12 meetings with Israeli groups and officials outside the proper protocol.
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeonreacted to the story, saying that “The sheer moral bankruptcy of the Tory Brexiteers is on full display today.”
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Ex-Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who is of Irish heritage, also reacted to the story, saying:
“…It amazes me that these expensively educated Brexiteers have literally learned nowt about the history of these very isles”.
Related ReadsWhat exactly is the Irish backstop, which could derail a final Brexit deal?
The backstop, a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland,is seen as being unnecessary and restrictive by Brexiteers, as it could lock the UK into a customs arrangement that would stop them striking new trade deals with other countries.
This would mean Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the customs union if there is no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
If there are different regulations or tariffs between the two jurisdictions, which would have to occur if the UK want to become more competitive than they are currently in the EU, then that would suggest products need to be checked as they go across the border.
Prominent British politicians, including the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg, have indicated that they would scrap the backstop if it were up to them (important to note if there is a Tory party leadership challenge).
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also indicated that the provision to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland should be scrapped, chanting “bin the backstop” to applause at his party’s conference.
Meanwhile, as May’s deal looks set to be rejected by the House of Commons in next week, there are reports in the UK media that she is looking at the possibility of a second referendum if the deal does fail.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/russia-ukraine-navy-4360551-Nov2018/,"AS INTERNATIONAL LEADERS and finance ministers prepare to meet in Buenos Aires this week for the 2018 G20 Summit, the Russian Coastguard has caught the world’s attention in a curious incident off the Crimean Peninsula.
Apart from its timing – immediately in advance of meetings between US President Donald Trump and the heads of state of many of his Nato allies and Vladimir Putin this week – the naval clash in the Kerch Strait is emblematic of the challenges that face both Russia and other world powers as the international world order enters increasingly choppy waters.
Russia, controversially and by force of arms, annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, the Russian Black Sea Fleet has consolidated its grip on the narrow strait of Kerch that controls access between the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea.
Indeed, in May of this year, Vladimir Putin himself opened the $3.69 billion (€3.25 billion) Kerch bridge which spans the strait and creates a permanent land-link between Crimea and the Russian Mainland. On Sunday, the Russians blocked the Kerch Strait to international shipping by simply anchoring a large supertanker under their shiny new bridge.
The Kerch Strait also controls access between Ukraine’s western and eastern sea ports. On Sunday, three vessels of Ukraine’s tiny navy – two armoured naval artillery gunboats and a naval tug – attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait on their way from the Ukrainian port of Odessa to the port of Mariupol, one of the last government controlled cities in eastern Ukraine.
This strategically important port is the closest access point by sea for the Ukrainian government to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, currently under the control of Russian separatists. Thousands of civilians and armed elements have been killed in the bitter pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine in recent years.
Russia has consistently denied any formal military involvement in the insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and Russian paratroopers and special forces there have been famously referred to as the ‘Little Green Men’ or the ‘Ghost Army’ in Donbass.
In Sunday’s naval incident however, the Russian Coastguard in clearly marked vessels, and in a confrontation that has been filmed,opened fire on the two Ukrainian naval gunboats, and rammed the naval tug that they were escorting.
Russian forces – under the control and direction of the FSB – then boarded the Ukrainian vessels and detained them. It is reported that some Ukrainian sailors were injured in the Russian operation.
This is significant in that Russian forces have acted overtly, in broad daylight, to intervene militarily and preemptively against Ukrainian forces in shared territorial waters agreed by international treaty in 2003. Regional and international reaction has been predictable.
Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko convened Ukraine’s National Defence and Security Council in Kiev and called for the imposition of martial law in the country whilst placing the armed forces on full combat mobilisation.
Both Nato and the German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, have called for ‘restraint’ and ‘de-escalation’. Both Ukraine and Russia have sought an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council for today.

Trump, Nato and Brexit
So, what next? From a purely military perspective, despite Kiev’s calls for martial law and combat mobilisation of its forces, they are no match for the Russian military. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet – with large bases in Sevastapol in Crimea and Nvorossiysk, close to the Kerch Strait – has dozens of fully operational warships and at least six submarines, along with approximately 25,000 sailors and marines.
Ukraine’s navy – now depleted by three vessels – has only one frigate and around 6,000 personnel. If Russia chose to do so, it could easily blockade the Kerch Strait – indefinitely.
Apparently however, Russia has re-opened the Strait to international shipping having effectively halted Ukrainian naval activity for now. For the moment, in advance of the G20 summit, the situation may remain as a tense stand-off – a state of affairs that has characterised relations between Kiev and Moscow for some time.
The Russian operation seems to have been carefully calculated and choreographed to create a military and diplomatic crisis without a dramatic loss of life. Given the disparity in forces in the region, the Russians could easily have sunk all three Ukrainian vessels with a large loss of life.
The manner in which the operation was mounted, and the fact that the Ukrainian ships and their crews are detained by Russia, suggest to me that Vladimir Putin is testing the resolve and coherence of Nato and the European Union in the face of armed aggression in eastern Europe.
He does so at a time when Nato’s principal partner, the United States, is openly questioning the alliance and its mutual defence commitments. In July of this year, at the Nato Summit in Brussels, President Trump harangued his Nato partners in what some described as a ‘rant’ in which he threatened “grave consequences” for Nato allies if they did not increase their military spending to 4% of GDP.
Since coming to office, Trump has consistently complained that the US is doing all of the ‘heavy lifting’ in terms of defence and security cooperation and that if its 29 allies do not increase their spending, America would ‘go our own way’.
Putin’s intervention in the Kerch Strait, in advance of the G20 Summit, whilst provocative, is yet another calculated risk on his part designed to rattle and test the transatlantic relationship between Washington and its European allies.
He does so as the Trump presidency – with increasingly erratic behavior at major international summits – continues to erode the political, diplomatic and military capital of the United States and the western alliance.
Russia’s military adventures under Putin and his wily Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov – including the invasion of Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, and covert Black Operations throughout Europe, along with their spectacularly successful intervention in Syria – have been largely beneficial to the Moscow regime. However, their military capacity and power projection through force is limited.
Russian military spending under Putin increased dramatically to a high of almost $90 billion in 2016, or 5.5% of Russia’s GDP. However, due to the economic pressures created by international sanctions, Russia’s military spending has dropped to 4% of GDP in the last year, with a commitment from Putin to reduce to 3% within five years in order to better fund Russia’s ailing domestic economy and healthcare programmes.
Hypothetically speaking, if a foreign power – with latent superpower aspirations – wanted to undermine the political, diplomatic and military power of the United States, and to disrupt and weaken the coherence of the European Union and the transatlantic alliance, they’d rejoice at the Trump presidency and Brexit.
Sadly, in reality, this is the de-facto realpolitik that provides the context to Sunday’s curious incident in the Kerch Strait. If cool heads prevail, the situation should not escalate. However, we do not live in a time of cool heads and calm, rational leadership. Let’s hope for the best.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-vote-dail-4353585-Nov2018/,"THE DÁIL HAS passed a motion supporting the draft Brexit agreement that has been reached between Britain and the European Union.
No formal vote was required as just nine TDs (of 158) opposed the motion and one abstained.
The nine TDs who opposed the motion were Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Paul Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry; Independents 4 Change’s Mick Wallace and Clare Daly; and independents Mattie McGrath, Maureen O’Sullivan, Thomas Pringle and Michael Collins. Independent TD Seamus Healy abstained.
The Dáil backing the motion is a symbolic, rather than binding, stance.
Proposing the motion to the lower house this evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the agreement was reached “after almost 20 months of intensive and difficult negotiations”.
“It is an agreement that fully secures the negotiating objectives we set out at the start. Most importantly, it fully protects the Good Friday Agreement, and ensures the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.”
The Taoiseach added that he was “pleased that Prime Minister May has secured her Cabinet’s approval for the draft agreement”.

May was in Brussels today for a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Afterwards May said “further progress” had been made and she announced plans to return to the city on Saturday for last-minute talks before a crucial European Council meeting on Sunday.
The Council is meeting with a view to its formally endorsing the draft agreement. Spain has warned itmay not back the dealif Madrid’s veto over Gibraltar’s future status is not guaranteed.
‘Regret but respect’
Varadkar told the Dáil: “It is worth restating that we have always said that we regret the decision of the UK to leave the EU.
“The UK is our closest neighbour and our friend. We are bound together by geography and by centuries of shared history, culture, kinship and trade.
“However, we respect the vote of the British people. We also regret that the British Government has ruled out ongoing membership of the EU customs union, single market and the European Economic Area thus limiting the scope for a solution. Nevertheless, we respect their decision to do so.”
Varadkar said Ireland’s “unique concerns” and priorities, such as protecting the Good Friday Agreement and maintaining the Common Travel Area, “have reached a satisfactory outcome” in the proposed deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/nhs-brexit-hospital-4102291-Jul2018/,"Simon Stevens said plans were drafted for every scenarioStefan Rousseau / PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Images / PA Images
THE HEAD OF the NHS in England has said that every hospital in England has been asked to “reach out” to EU nationals among its staff about the measures they may need to take to stay in the country after Brexit.
Speaking onBBC One’s The Andrew Marr show, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said it is now preparing for a “no deal” Brexit, which is looking increasingly like a possibility as internal conflict rages in Theresa May’s government.
As negotiations continue to drag on with no clarity on a number of issues, including the Irish border, Stevens said the NHS has needed to plan for an eventuality where the UK has no deals with the EU after it leaves the bloc.
“There is now significant planning going on around all the scenarios,"" says@NHSEnglandBoss Simon Stevens, including a no-deal scenario to ensure that medical supplies are not disrupted#marrpic.twitter.com/Io5yPctoX8— The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow)July 1, 2018
“There is now significant planning going on around all the scenarios,"" says@NHSEnglandBoss Simon Stevens, including a no-deal scenario to ensure that medical supplies are not disrupted#marrpic.twitter.com/Io5yPctoX8
He said: “There is immediate planning… around securing medical supply and equipment under different scenario. That will crystallise when it’s made clear later in the autumn what the UK’s position will be.
Stevens added that he wanted clarity for EU nationals employed by the NHS. According to a reportin February of this year, 62,000 NHS staff in England are EU nationals from outside of Britain, which is 5.6% of the overall number.
A large number – 13,016 -  are Irish.
He said: “Every hospital has now been written to, asking them to reach out to staff from the rest of the EU, providing that the home secretary has set a clear process by which people can apply to stay in this country which we hope they will do.”
‘Courage and leadership’
Meanwhile, just days after backbench lawmakers told Prime Minister Theresa May that its “departure must be absolute”, Business Secretary Greg Clark refused to rule out indefinitely extending a transition period out of the EU.
It's another stressful week ahead for Theresa MayStefan Rousseau / PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Images / PA Images
Under the current timetable the implementation period is set to end in December 2020, after Britain leaves the bloc next March.

“It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence,” Clark told Sky News.
“There are things that would need to (be) put in place, computer systems for example, posts at the border,” he added.
Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role to campaign on Brexit, delivered a letter on Friday to May signed by more than 30 Tories insisting the opposite.
Calling on her to show “courage and leadership”, the group said: “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.”
The British cabinet is also deeply divided on Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove last week physically ripped up proposals for possible post-Brexit customs arrangements with the EU favoured by May, according to reports yesterday.
Gove, a leading proponent of Brexit, was “livid” after concluding his concerns about the plans had been downplayed, the reports said.
Key meeting
May will gather together her warring ministers for a key Brexit meeting on Friday to thrash out a unified stance ahead of the release of a formal policy proposal the following week.
The cabinet, which has been dogged by public discord on various aspects of Brexit, is in deadlock over two options for customs arrangements after the 29 March 2019 withdrawal date.
A “maximum facilitation” model proposes using trusted-trader arrangements and technology to avoid border checks, while a “customs partnership” system would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods heading to the continent.
Two groups of cabinet members have been looking at each of the plans.
Gove was reportedly among the ministers examining the partnership model, largely opposed by Brexiteers, and was reacting to a summary report of their supposed position on it prepared by civil servants.
Downing Street declined to comment.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-taoisigh-ahern-violence-3972875-Apr2018/,"“THE IDEA OF us going back to any kind of border would be a disaster. I don’t think it will happen. You wouldn’t have to wait for violence – the communities on both sides of the border, with their bare hands, would pull down anything that was put up.”
Those were the words of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern this morning as he took part in a panel discussion on Brexit, Ireland and the Future of Europe at the Mansion House, Dublin.
The ex-Fianna Fáil leader’s fears about what a physical border could do to peace in Northern Ireland were echoed by his fellow panelists Brian Cowen and John Bruton.
Bruton noted that border posts would symbolise the partition of a country which people would be “disinclined to accept”.
The three former leaders, who ran the country between 1994 and 2011, all spoke of the need to retain good relations between London and Dublin, while allowing for  negotiations on Brexit to continue at European level.

“The amount of civil service and executive time being taken up by Brexit… up to Brexit day: the diversion of talent that Brexit constitutes is an unmitigated tragedy for Britain, for Ireland and for Europe,” Bruton, who was Taoiseach from 1994 to 1997, said in his opening remarks.

Cowen told the audience at the IIEA (Institute of International and European Affairs) conference that Ireland “does not have to have an acrimonious relationship with the UK” while standing its ground on certain questions raised by Brexit.
All three also lamented the possible loss of contact between Westminster and Dublin once the UK has left the EU, because much of the relationship is now conducted through European mechanisms.
Ahern pleaded for an alternative to be found – or that the current British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference structure, established during the peace talks of 1998, be rejuvenated for that purpose.
“Otherwise we lose 45 years of very good relations which has been meticulously built up by the civil service,” he warned. “That’s over [once the UK leaves] and that’s a big, big loss.
There were warnings too for current Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the British government.

Ahern, noting the art of compromise that is required in politics, advised against leaving any negotiations to the last hour.
“The government should try to conclude as much as they can in June,” he said. “Running it down to Halloween/October…. this would be my fear. If you come down to the last few days, my fear is that our Taoiseach would be called in by the French, Germans, the [European] Commission, [the] Presidency, and it would be put to them that the British are paying their €50 billion and ready to conclude on freedom of movement and ready to move on a number of issues, [that there is a] good trade agreement… and [told] we don’t think you should be pushing as hard and should compromise. That’s how it works.
“The Irish government is doing well … but they shouldn’t have a Halloween/October party of that nature at 2am in the morning.”
Meanwhile, Bruton predicted that the UK will regret its decision after 29 March 2019 – the official leave day. Noting that waiting times at Dover in the UK are three minutes for goods from the EU, but 45 minutes for non-EU hauls, he made clear that Ireland is not the only border problem for Theresa May.
“In a sense, Britain will never abandon the idea of Brexit until they have Brexited,” he said during a Q&A session with the attendees.
“Then they will see what they’ve done. Maybe they’ll reverse themselves then, if pride doesn’t stand in the way.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-brands-mays-brexit-plan-deranged-as-davis-describes-the-irish-border-issue-as-exaggerated-4261625-Sep2018/,"
EX-FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson has branded British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union “deranged,” fueling tensions as the ruling Conservative Party holds its annual conference.
Johnson told the Sunday Times that May’s Brexit plan won’t work, particularly proposals that would require Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs.
“It is entirely preposterous,” he said. “The idea that we could ask customs officers in Dubrovnik and Santander to charge British-only tariffs is deranged, and nobody thinks it can work. There will be economic and political damage to the UK”
May is under siege from members of her own party as the Conservatives open their annual conference today in the central England city of Birmingham.
While most conferences offer a chance for the leader to rally the troops, May’s goal at this four-day gathering is to survive amid deepening opposition to her Brexit plan and growing support for a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership.

May’s plan would keep Britain in the EU’s single market for goods while letting the country write its own rules on services and strike free-trade deals with third parties.
EU leaders have rejected that idea, saying the UK wants to retain the benefits of EU membership without accepting its responsibilities.
Hard-line Brexit supporters also oppose the prime minister’s plan because they say it would force Britain to follow rules set in Brussels, undercutting promises that the country would regain control of its own laws after Brexit.

May insisted that her plans, ratified by the Cabinet during a summer meeting at the prime minister’s country estate, Chequers, remain viable, despite its rejection by EU leaders.
“Where they have problems, let’s actually hear them. And it’s only then that you can actually identify what the issue really is, where there are issues that lie behind this,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr program on today.
Asked about Mr Johnson’s claim that her plan was “deranged,” May said: “I have just explained to you why I believe that the plan that we have put forward is a plan that is in the national interest.”
Meanwhile, former Brexit Secretary David Davis told Sky News this afternoon that he thinks the Irish Border is an exaggerated and oversimplified issue when it comes to Brexit negotiations.

“The people oversimplifying it are the Irish government and the commission.
“There is no acceptable sweeping political answer, what they have to do is look at the detail, the detail of tax on the border,” Davis told Sky News.
The former Brexit secretary added:
“It doesn’t matter whether you carry Euro or Pound, you can buy your drinks in Belfast in Euros and in Dublin in Pounds.
“It’s regulations which is the hardest one and it’s what they call rules of origin that is goods coming from the rest of the world going into Europe by a “backdoor” through Belfast. We can control that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-deputy-leader-abstentionism-4132131-Jul2018/,"SINN FÉIN DEPUTY leader Michelle O’Neill has hit back at suggestions her party’s Westminster MPs should take their seats.
The party has seven MPs elected to Westminster from constituencies in Northern Ireland but has long operated an abstentionist policy whereby it refuses to sit in the parliament.
While not swearing an oath to the British crown has long been party policy, some believe that Brexit and the narrow Conservative majority in Westminster changes the political reality.Last year, Micheal Martin called the stance “illogical”, leading to the then-Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to call him a “champion hurler on the ditch”.
Last night, British Prime Minister Theresa May bowed to pressure from eurosceptics in her ruling Conservative Party by agreeing to a series of amendments to a bill setting up a new customs regime after Brexit.

More than a dozen Tories rebelled on the two amendments, with the government pushing them through by just three votes.
However, O’Neill told RTÉ’s News at One that any suggestion her party should redress that balance was wrong.
“I’ve heard people make those comments, but it’s not a mathematical game here. The amendment on the Irish border went through. Sinn Féin MPs would not have made one button of difference.
“If we boil these down, what we clearly have here is a British government in disarray and doesn’t know what it’s doing. It’s about political point scoring. These are going to have ramifications for over a decade. These are things not to be played games with. As we reach this crunch time. The focus needs to be on the Irish government.
“The numbers don’t stack up. It’s nonsense. We need to protect the island of Ireland’s interest.”
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said his party was “proud” to have delivered the amendments to the bill, despite fears that they would make a legally operable backstop unlawful.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-passport-applications-4417749-Dec2018/,"THERE CONTINUES TO be an increase in the number of applications for Irish passports from people in Britain and Northern Ireland.
Stats released by the Department of Foreign Affairs show that 22% of all Irish passport applications for 2018 came from the UK.
This is up from 20% in 2017 and comes following four or five yearswhen applications from the UK remained static.
In releasing the figures, the department says that passport applications from the UK have “continued to rise since Brexit”.
In terms of numbers, this year saw 84,855 Irish passport applications from Northern Ireland and 98,544 applications from Britain.
Overall, this year was a record year for the number of Irish passports issued, 822,581 in total.
Of these, 529,673 were issued to adults and 292,908 were issued to children.
Outside of the UK, New York was the Irish consulate to receive the most amount of passport applications followed by Canberra, Pretoria, San Francisco and Ottawa.
DFATDFAT
During the busiest period in 2018, 6,500 passport applications were made in a single day and the department has again urged peopleapplying for a passport to do it online.
The number of online applications increased this year with the eligibility requirements for doing so expanded and a passport card for children also introduced.
Among online applications made in 2018, the oldest online applicant was 99 years old and the youngest was for a two-week old.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has also urged citizens to take care of their passport when at home and travelling after more than 7,000 passports were reported lost or stolen this year
“The Irish passport is a valuable document. My department continues to strengthen all processes to prevent fraud and maintain its integrity and security,” the minister said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-brexit-leave-voters-4275457-Oct2018/,"BREXIT LEAVE VOTERS in Northern Ireland are willing to see the end of the peace process to deliver Brexit, a new poll has claimed.
The Universities of Cardiff and Edinburgh’s The Future of England Study found that 87% of Northern Ireland’s leave voters would see the collapse of the peace process as an acceptable price for Brexit, theBelfast Telegraphhas reported.
It also found that 75% of Conservatives in England would support the collapse of the peace process as long as Brexit is delivered.
The polls were conducted by YouGov and Lucid Talk between 30 May and 4 June 2018.
With regards to the 2016 Brexit referendum vote, 44.2% of people in Northern Ireland voted to leave the EU, while 55.8% voted to remain.
In all, 51.9% of the UK voted to leave the EU, while 48.1% voted to remain.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, study author Professor Richard Wyn Jones said they used representative samples in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England during the study.

When asked if he was surprised by the outcomes of the survey, he said that “a lot of the general attitude to the Union didn’t surprise us because we’ve been following this … pretty closely since 2011″.
“As somebody who grew up with the troubles on television every night … I was shocked about the indifference to the Northern Ireland peace process,” Wyn Jones said.
“But the UK union, if you like, the indifference to the Union is not a surprise, and there’s kind of a consistent pattern that we’ve been identifying for several years now that even predates the Scottish independence referendum of 2014,” he said.
The survey comes as Northern Irish Unionists from both the DUP and UUP are set to meet the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today, with both parties pledging to argue against an effective border down the Irish sea.
DUP leader Arlene Foster and UUP leader Robin Swann will both meet with Barnier alongside their parties MEPs.
Foster’s party is propping up UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in the House of Commons and the DUP has refused to rule out voting against any Brexit deal it is not satisfied with.
Technical discussions resume in Brussels this week, with both sides racing to bridge their differences over the toughest issues of the Irish border and future trading ties.
The EU summit on 18 October has been characterised by the bloc as a “moment of truth” in the divorce talks, just months before Britain leaves on 29 March 2019.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May suffered a huge blow this morning as Dominic Raab quit as her Brexit secretary over the proposed EU withdrawal agreement.
Esther Louise McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and Shailesh Vara, a junior Northern Ireland minister, have also quit today over the draft accord.
Junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman also tendered her resignation, it emerged later this morning, and Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP said she had also resigned from her role asparliamentary private secretary.
May was preparing to start selling her Brexit deal to parliament, boosted by news that Europe is preparing a rapid summit to sign off on the agreement.
But the ground began to shift beneath her when Raab said he could not back the draft deal.
“I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto,” he said.

Raab, who had been in place since July, resigned less than an hour after Vara – who was first out this morning with his notice of quitting.
The pound lost nearly one percent of its value against the dollar following Raab’s resignation, wiping out gains since Tuesday as the draft agreement emerged.
Mayhad securedher cabinet’s collective approval for the agreement during a five-hour meeting last night, an important step that helped allay growing fears in the business community of a disorderly divorce.

Later this morning she’s due to set out the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement with the European Union to parliament’s lower House of Commons, which must approve the deal before Brexit day on 29 March.
European Council President Donald Tusksaid in Brusselsthat unless problems emerge as EU member states examine the deal, he will host a summit to sign the accord in Brussels on November 25.
‘Threat’ to UK unity
In quitting the cabinet, Raab said he believed the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presented a “very real threat” to the United Kingdom’s integrity.
Raab added that he was opposed to “an indefinite backstop arrangement” to guarantee the Irish border remains free-flowing, saying the EU would hold “a veto over our ability to exit”.
The outraged response by many MPs to the deal has heightened concerns that even when finalised, it will not pass parliament.
Hardline Brexit supporters have cried betrayal over the agreement’s vision of a close future relationship between Britain and the EU.
May insisted it “brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement (of people), protects jobs, security and our union”.
But she conceded there were “difficult days ahead” as she seeks to woo MPs.
Speaking in Brussels, Tusk said EU member states would have until Tuesday next week to examine the deal and to agree the wording of a parallel political statement setting out goals for the bloc’s future relations with London.
Ater that, preparations will begin for an EU summit on the following Sunday to sign the deal.
“As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, both for you and for us,” said Tusk.

The deal covers citizens’ rights, Britain’s financial settlement and plans for a post-Brexit transition period during which both sides hope to agree a new trade deal.
The most controversial element is the “backstop” plan to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU until a trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for border checks at the Irish border.
Many Brexiteers have said they fear this would leave Britain a “vassal state”, tied to the bloc indefinitely.
‘No Brexit?’
In a statement outside Downing Street late yesterday, May said her deal was “the best that could be negotiated”.
She said if MPs rejected it they faced Britain leaving without agreement, which experts says could lead to potentially catastrophic economic and legal disruption.
She also raised the risk of “no Brexit at all”, a warning likely intended for her eurosceptic MPs but which was seized upon with enthusiasm by campaigners for a second referendum.
A small but growing number of Conservative MPs back a second vote with the option to stay in the EU, although May has rejected the idea.

NIGEL FARAGE AND a number of other Brexiteers have thrown dead fish into the Thames today in protest against the EU maintaining control of British waters until the end of 2020.
The agreement was struck as part of the transition deal between the UK and the EU; some Brexiteers have expressed outrage at the delay and have called it an “abject betrayal” of Britain’s fishermen by British Prime Minister Theresa May.
Pro-Brexit campaign group Fishing for Leavesaidthe deal is an “irrevocable surrender of Britain’s fishing for a second time”.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who’s one of the leading figures in the Tory party and tipped as one of Theresa May’s possible successors, was reported to be leading the protest today – but yesterday he denied that he was taking part.

“I’m not throwing fish anywhere. I am not a fish-thrower,” hesaidon LBC radio.
“I think this has got slightly out of hand. There was a suggestion a fishing boat should go up the Thames in protest against the delay in leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, but I won’t be throwing fish anywhere.”
But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is a fish-thrower, apparently.
Christopher HopeChristopher Hope
One of the journalists who was aboard the boat, the Daily Telegraph’s Christopher Hope, said that the fish that were discarded were haddock, caught in the eastern English Channel.
The fish are being thrown in the sea because, according to campaigners, despite being caught in English waters it cannot be landed or sold in the UK because of EU rules, which is symbolic of a widespread problem they say.
Environment Minister Michael Gove announced last year that the UK would leave the London Fisheries Convention after Brexit, meaning EU and Irish boats wouldn’t be permitted to fish off the coasts of the UK.
It’s still unclear what exact implications this could have on Ireland’s fishing industry, but there are fears that it would lead to an influx of European boats fishing in Irish waters.

Hunttold BBC Radio 4“the thing that the House of Commons won’t accept is any risk of us being permanently trapped through the Northern Ireland backstop in the customs union” but that the only way to get it through is to have a version of the deal that the UK government has negotiated.
May had postponed the House of Commons vote on her deal after forecasts predicted it had no chance of being approved: some MPs expressed concern at the idea of the UK remaining in a customs deal with the EU indefinitely, and without having any unilateral power to withdraw from the backstop if the next round of talks fail.
She had thought that if the EU were to give additional assurances, that the deal might pass through the House of Commons; but she failed to gain any additional promises to time-limit the backstop or to give the UK more power to leave it in the future.

Hunt told the BBC that he believes a parliamentary majority for any form of Brexit is possible “with those guarantees that we need on the backstop”.
Following Friday’s summit in Brussels, May says that Britain and the EU will hold more talks in the coming days, denying reports that bloc leaders refused her plea for reassurances on her Brexit plan.
With May having promised to have something to offer MPs before they finally vote on the Brexit deal by 21 January, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said she would have to come up with proposals in the next few weeks if she wanted Europe’s support.
However, he said he would publish further plans on Wednesday to protect European businesses and citizens in case the deal fails, and Britain exits on 29 March with no new arrangements place.

THE CHANCES OF a Brexit agreement have grown in recent days, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said, after weeks of growing fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal.
With less than two weeks to go before a crunch summit in Brussels billed by the EU as the “moment of truth” for Brexit negotiations, Juncker gave an upbeat assessment of the chances of a deal.
The change in tone comes two days after EU Council President Donald Tusk gave London a stern warning that time was running out to strike a deal in time for Britain’s departure from the bloc at the end of March.
Deadlines in EU talks are notoriously elastic, and Juncker told Austrian media that if an agreement was not reached at the 17 and 18 October summit, he was confident it could be done in November.
“I have reason to believe that the potential for rapprochement between the two sides has increased in recent days,” Juncker said in comments reported by the Standard newspaper.

May has been invited to address the other 27 EU leaders over dinner on 17 October, to give her a chance to convince her peers that a solution can be found to the sticking points in Britain’s tortuous negotiations to leave the bloc.
Diplomats have suggested the leaders could talk through the night and approve the outlines of an agreement while they are still in Brussels for the broader 18 October talks.
At their annual conference this week, May urged her Conservative party – which is bitterly divided between Brexit hardliners and moderates – to unite behind her negotiating stance during what she warned would be the “toughest phase” of talks.
Juncker said the EU was determined to reach an agreement to avoid a “no deal” Brexit, which experts say would cause chaos for both sides.
“I believe that we must distance ourselves from this no deal scenario,” the former Luxembourg prime minister said.
“We are not there yet. But our will to reach an understanding with the British government remains unbroken.”

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has suggested that a Brexit deal could now be pushed out to December.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin today, he said:
“As regards to negotiations, they’re still ongoing. I know some people were optimistic about an agreement, a withdrawal agreement protocol this week, I have to say I always thought that was unlikely,” Varadkar said.
“We’re always open to compromise … but there are some fundamentals that we can’t compromise on and that really is  the need for the United Kingdom to honour its commitments made back last December, which is that we will have a withdrawal agreement and as part of that withdrawal agreement there must be a legally operable and legally binding assurance that, no matter what happens, no hard border will emerge on the island of Ireland,” he said.
He went on to add that he doesn’t want to “create the wrong impression” by suggesting December.
“That’s not what I’m saying. The possibility remains open to have an emergency summit in November if we can get to a deal, but if we don’t have an emergency summit in November, well then it will be a regular summit in December,” he said.
He said a no deal for the United Kingdom would be “catastrophic” and a “disaster”, while such a scenario would be “really bad” for Ireland and “relatively bad” for the EU.
Varadkar said he spoke to British Prime Minister Theresa May last night where he was assured of her commitment to “getting a deal done” and of the promises made previously that a backstop arrangement would be contained in the final withdrawal agreement.
Earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to honour the commitments the British government made in March and December.
He called the stalled talks between London and Brussels’ chief negotiators as “frustrating and disappointing”.
‘Frustrating’
Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg this morning, Coveney said, “I think we are frustrated, but we are still pretty calm about that. I think everybody would have liked to have seen clarity on the withdrawal agreement.
“Time is moving on, ratification mechanisms are going to take time, whether that is in Westminster or the European Parliament and so I think there was a real effort over the last ten days by the two negotiating teams to intensify engagement so they could have recommendations for political leaders this week, but that hasn’t proved possible.”
Yesterday it emerged the two sides failed to agree on a draft divorce settlement after stalling over the issue of the Irish border once again.
It comes just days before a make-or-break European Union summit takes place.
Britain’s Brexit spokesman Dominic Raab made an unannounced trip to the EU capital for talks with his opposite number Michel Barnier, briefly raising hopes that a deal might be in the offing.
But negotiations ended without a breakthrough, including on the issue of trade to and from Northern Ireland, which has emerged as a possible deal breaker.
Confirming that negotiations have been suspended, Coveney said the two negotiating teams have agreed to “disengage”, until after the this week’s EU Council meeting.
“That is frustrating and disappointing from an Irish perspective as the country that is more exposed to the fallout of Brexit than any other country outside the EU itself. We want to see an outcome that settles nerves that allows us to move ahead with a sensible Brexit. I still think it is possible to do that, but clearly it is going to take a bit more time than people had hoped,” he said.
Diplomatic sources confirmed that a meeting of the “diplomatic sherpas” – senior officials representing the leaders of EU members – that had been planned for Monday to review a draft deal has been cancelled.
“The commission informed the ambassadors that no deal was reached today. There will be no further negotiations until the summit,” one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Other sources familiar with Barnier’s meeting with EU ambassadors confirmed this, and one added that “certain countries insisted that preparations for a ‘no deal’ be accelerated”.
Raab’s department said “real progress” had been made in some areas, but admitted “there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop”.
“The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council,” it promised, referring to this week’s Brussels summit.

Coveney said all that is being sought is a follow through on commitments the British government made in December and March in relation to the backstop.
“We are not looking for anything new here,” he said, adding that last December it was agreed that in the absence of agreeing something better there would be a backstop in place. He said this promise was recommitted to in March when it was agreed that backstop would legally operate in the withdrawal agreement “unless and until something else is agreed”.
“In other words, no one wants to ever trigger the backstop,  but it needs to be there as an insurance mechanism to calm nerves that we are not going to see physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland,” said Coveney.
The Tánaiste said the Irish government is seeking “no more and no less than the follow through of those commitments and that is what needs to happen”.
Time limit
The idea that a time limit could be placed on the backstop is a new idea floated by the British side.
However, Coveney ruled out such a notion, stating that it was not included in the previous two agreements.

He said it was always the case the backstop would be contained in the withdrawal agreement, unless and until something else replaces it. “That is all we are asking for,” he added.
With Britain set to leave the bloc at the end of March, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker had demanded “substantial progress” this week, and Raab’s visit stoked optimism.
Collective authority
Yesterday’s flurry of activity came as May prepared to face what one newspaper cartoon dubbed “hell week”.
Tomorrow, she will rake over the Irish border issue with her cabinet, amid speculation that more ministers could resign if she ploughs on with her proposals.
David Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in July over May’s Chequers plan, wrote inThe Sunday Timesthat her plans were “completely unacceptable” and urged ministers to “exert their collective authority” this week.
On Wednesday, May goes to Brussels, still facing the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster will travel to Dublin today for talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin.
Toxic
It comes a day after leaked emails from Foster revealed that the DUP is willing to trigger a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, which the party now feels is the likeliest outcome from negotiations with the EU.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O’Neill will also travel to London to meet with May and British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald and Sinn Fein Vice President Michelle O'NeillBrian LawlessBrian Lawless
Those meetings will focus on Brexit negotiations and the lack of a talks process to establish the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.
Ahead of the meeting, McDonald hit out at the “toxic” confidence and supply arrangement between the DUP and May’s Conservative Party in Westminster.
“The DUP have aligned themselves with the hard right of the Brexiteers at the cost of imposing a hard border in Ireland, undermining our agreements and crashing out of the EU without an agreement,” she said.
“The DUP do not represent the majority of people in the north on Brexit, nor our economic interests and oppose the Good Friday Agreement.
“They cannot be allowed to set the pace for Brexit or political progress in the North.”
‘Probably inevitable’
Meanwhile, one of May’s Northern Irish allies has said it was “probably inevitable” that Britain will leave the European Union next March without any agreement.
Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP, spoke after last-ditch talks failed to reach an agreement.
DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy WilsonMichael McHughMichael McHugh
“Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner they’ve put Theresa May into, there’s no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons,” he told the Belfast Newsletter, a local newspaper.
“So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario.”
“I think that anybody looking at it objectively would say that what is on offer from the EU is a far worse deal than a no deal, and therefore she’d be mad to be railroaded into accepting it.”

THE IRISH BACKSTOP.
It’s almost been a year since the UK government and the EU agreed to a political safety net for Ireland, and we’re still no closer to agreeing the details of what it would look like.
Further than that, the UK government has created uncertainty over whether the final Withdrawal Agreement will include a backstop, which is why the EU and Irish government have been so staunch in repeating that it was a vital, “cast iron guarantee” of no border in a final Brexit deal.
Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who’s among the candidates to become the next Tory leader, has said that the backstop should be scrapped completely.
On the latest episode of theGuardian ‘Politics Weekly’ podcast, one contributor Jonathan Lis said that there needed to be “less illusion” at this “11th hour, or five minutes to midnight” about the backstop that Theresa May signed up to in December.
“Michael Gove, who is not a stupid man, and Boris Johnson and others have been falling over themselves to say that they didn’t understand what their own government signed up to in December. Now that is not acceptable.
So if you haven’t quite grasped what exactly the backstop is, you’d be forgiven.
Here’s what it is
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar (centre), Tanaiste Simon Coveney (right) and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee.PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
The backstop is a sort of Plan B, insurance policy, or safety net that would kick in if a better deal isn’t agreed in the second stage of Brexit talks, which will focus on trade (a part of the Future Relationship).
The backstop would kick in at the end of the transition period – which starts on 29 March and ends on31 December 2020- if a final deal is agreed.
European CommissionEuropean Commission
Put simply, the backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
To avoid a border, it means there would have to be the same or similar custom rules and regulations for products, food, animals, people and vehicles between the UK and the EU – or Northern Ireland and the EU.
“Regulatory alignment” is the guarantee, which is important: it doesn’t mean the regulations would be the exact same, but similar enough to avoid a hard border.
Until talks between the EU and UK on trade begin, it won’t be clear how many regulations and customs checks will be the same or different, and because of that it isn’t clear whether the backstop is necessary.

But almost immediately after the deal was struck, there’s been disagreement over what the backstop is. For example:
Should be for a limited period of time or not?The UK says it should be time limited, the EU responded by saying it needed to be an “all-weather” backstop, and would be pointless if it were temporary.
Would it apply to the UK as a whole, or just Northern Ireland?The UK wants it to apply to the whole of the UK until a better deal is made. But the EU say that it can only apply to Northern Ireland, as its whole point is to preserve the peace process. It also says that it’s less of a hassle for the backstop to apply to a small region than it would the entire UK.

If there’s no agreement on the backstop – as in, if they can’t agree on “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland that would mean no infrastructure is needed – then there is no Brexit deal and the UK will go crashing out of the EU.
Ironically, if the UK does go crashing out of the EU, it’s most likely that a hard border will automatically reappear on the island of Ireland anyway – which is something German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted to last week.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned EU leaders at the end of the October summit, that if a hard border does return to the island of Ireland, it could see a return to Troubles-era violence.
Political influence on the backstop
Theresa May and her colleagues sit with Arlene Foster and the Tory leadership, June 2017.PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
The backstop was first decided upon in early December 2017, but although the EU and UK came to an agreement, the final signing was delayed after the DUP said it was unhappy with the wording.
The party wanted an assurance that a border would not appear along the Irish Sea, which the backstop wording had remained helpfully vague on before the DUP’s input.
But last December, as the EU and UK were on the cusp of an agreed backstop, Theresa May flew out from Brussels to meet the DUP leadership to hear their concerns (as its 10 Westminster MPs are propping up her Tory government).
After this, the backstop included a line confirming that there would be “no new regulatory barriers develop (sic) between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.
If the EU negotiators thought that the UK’s stance on this would soften, they were wrong. Theresa May has repeatedly said that she wouldn’t accept a deal that would “carve off” Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and that she would preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom.
Barnier tried to “de-dramatize” the idea of customs checks on trade between Great Britain and Ireland, saying that it would simply increase the number of goods and vehicles checked at ports and airports.
But as recently as yesterday, May told the House of Commons: “Anything that effectively creates a customs border along the Irish Sea is not acceptable.”
Many theorise that the DUP is a major part of May’s inability to strike a deal: although there are already differences in social policies between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, unionists fear that if the EU were to treat the North as an exception for peace-keeping reasons, that it could eventually lead to a united Ireland.
So, what’s the latest?
British Prime Minister Theresa May.Francisco SecoFrancisco Seco
Among the discarded solutions to the Northern Irish border issue that have been shot down over the past year are “Oyster-card-like technology” to check the movement of goods and people; the Canada border which was dismissed by the Irish government as “efficient, but it’s still a hard border” anda backstop to the backstop.
Yesterday inthe House of Commons, May said that they were 95% agreed on a Brexit deal, but that there remained ”one real sticking point”. The backstop.
She said thatfour thingsneeded to happen now, just five months before her country leaves the European Union.
Firstly, she wants the UK and EU to agree to a temporary customs deal so that the Northern Ireland only proposal is no longer needed, adding that the relationship between the North and the UK was integral to the Good Friday Agreement and that “nothing we agree with EU under Article 50 should risk a return to a hard border”.
Secondly, and most importantly, she said that she wanted the option to extend the implementation period asan alternative to the backstop,despite describing an extension as “undesirable”.
“By far the best outcome for the UK, for Ireland and for the EU – is that our future relationship is agreed and in place by 1st January 2021… But the impasse we are trying to resolve is about the insurance policy if this does not happen.”
(The third point she made was that neither of these options could be indefinite, and the fourth was that Northern Irish businesses enjoy full access to Great Britain.)
“We have to explore every possible option to break the impasse and that is what I am doing,” she said. So for now, the ball is in the EU’s court.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-plans-4403473-Dec2018/,"THE GOVERNMENT WILL have to take €100 million from the 2019 Health Capital Budget as well as central government expenditure to fill the funding gap caused by the ballooning National Children’s Hospital budget.
Of that total, €50 million will come from the health capital budget next year and €50 million from central government. This is out of a total capital budget of €7 billion for 2019.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil today the new children’s hospital may cost even more than its latest €1.433 billion price tag.
This cost represents a €450 million increase on what the hospital was projected to cost in April 2017.
Of that figure, €319 million is accounted for in the rise of construction costs, while €131 million is attributed to the direct cost of staff as well as contingency money and design fees. €50 million is accounted to VAT.
In order to fill that gap, the government has said there will need to be a reallocation of capital envelopes for other departments.
What departments might lose out and what projects might be stalled will be determined by Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, who is carrying out a review of where the money will come from. He is due to report back to Cabinet in January.
While €100 million will have to be found next year, a government spokesperson confirmed some €390 million will be needed from additional Exchequer funding for the overall project delivery, while it is expected €130 million will also come from additional philanthropic funding.
Draining the health budget next year in order to fill some of the €450 million shortfall has raised concerns about other projects which could now be under threat because of the runaway costs.
It is understood the Taoiseach voiced his concerns at the rise in costs at today’s Cabinet meeting, while Health Minister Simon Harris said he would be keeping a “close eye” on the hospital’s budget going forward.
While Cabinet signed off on the substantial increase in the budget, it was also informed that a review of the existing oversight arrangements between all agencies is to be carried out to ensure there is adequate management and governance of the project.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will also carry out its own review to determine what contributed to the overrun. There will also be an analysis of the design team as well as other issues so as to determine if there are outstanding matters that need to be dealt with.
The Taoiseach faced questioning from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on the issue, who asked how the cost could have escalated from the figure of €983 million in September to €1.433bn now.
He also said that the cost was estimated at €485 million at the announcement, and at €650 million in 2016, after planning permission was granted.
“In the space of about six weeks it has gone from less than a billion to €1.4 billion apparently, which is extraordinary stuff,” said the Fianna Fáil leader.
Amid growing concerns over the runaway budget, Varadkar confirmed officials from the group overseeing the project will be made available for any Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee and the Oireachtas Health Committee.
Varadkar said the new hospital will  be the “biggest-single investment in the health of our children ever”.
“It may turn out to be one of the most expensive children’s hospitals in the world but it is also going to turn out to be one of the best,” Varadkar said.
Following the sign off on the project’s continuation today, Minister for Health Simon Harris said it will enable the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to instruct the current contractor for Phase B of the works.
“The new children’s hospital and the two outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital are long awaited and I am very pleased that the construction can continue now without delay. The hospital will facilitate the implementation of a new model of care that will have a profound impact on all paediatric services once the new hospital is open,” said Harris.
If the government finds the money from somewhere, when will the hospital be open to patients?
The main hospital construction is to be completed in 2022, while works at the Connolly care centre are on target for practical completion of the building in Spring 2019 with the opening scheduled for July 2019. Works at Tallaght satellite care centre are underway with a target handover date of July 2020.
These centres will provide urgent and outpatient care to children in the Greater Dublin Area, including Co. Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, said the minister.
It is envisaged the main hospital at St James’s will have 380 single rooms all with en-suite bathrooms and a parent’s bed. There will be 93 daycare bays, 22 operating theatres and procedure rooms, and 122 consulting rooms in total.

THE POST OFFICE in Pettigo, a town located between Co Donegal and Co Fermanagh, has seen a 15 fold increase in people from Northern Ireland requesting Irish passports, according to its postmaster.
James Gallagher of Pettigo Post Office toldTheJournal.iethat the increase has been over a two-year timeframe.
Pettigo is the only town on the island of Ireland that’s split by the UK-Irish border – the river that runs through the centre of the town marks the border line.
Since the UK voted to leave the European Union, there has been increased attention on the town, with many European journalists visiting the town in the past few months.
Speaking to this website, the Head of Passport Office Fiona Penollar said there was an increase in demand for Irish passports, and that included applications from people in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

“Percentage wise [the increase] is relatively substantial – it is between 15-20%, however numerically wise, and putting that in context of the 900,000 applications, it is very small.”
If you were born on the island of Ireland before 2005, you are automatically entitled to Irish citizenship. If you were born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005, your right to Irish citizenship depends on your parents’ citizenship and where they resided before your birth.
In a statement, the Postmasters Union said that although they didn’t have figures on whether this increase is representative in every post office along the border, overall “any new business is good for post offices”.
“While this may be a side effect of the current Brexit context, this would not constitute any significance in terms of long term business at post offices.”
Ina previous PQ from Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien, the Irish government said that since 2012, the number of passport application for a Republic of Ireland passport from Northern Ireland has more than doubled.
In 2017, passport applications from Northern Ireland increased by 20% which is 82,274 applications, and from Great britain it increased by 28% up to 80,752.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-there-are-parallels-between-irish-independence-and-brexit-4382440-Dec2018/,"KARL MARX ONCE said that all events of history occur twice, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.
Almost a century ago, the Irish War of Independence broke out. This culminated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 – which lead to a bitterly divided country and civil war.
In recent weeks, Theresa May has negotiated a Brexit deal that has produced deep divisions within the UK.
If these comparisons appear superficial at first, there are actually many parallels between the Irish independence movement and the British campaign to leave the EU.
To begin with, neither Ireland nor Britain was ever fully content within the larger political unit.
For the century or so that Ireland was a part of the UK, it always stood out as the least satisfied member of the union.
From O’Connell’s repeal movement of the 1840s to the Fenian campaigns and the push for home rule in the later nineteenth century, efforts were constantly afoot to weaken, if not completely sever, the connection between Ireland and Britain.
Likewise, the UK never really embraced the European project in the same way as its fellow members. The British only entered the EEC in 1973 but renegotiated the conditions of their membership in 1974.
They then held their first ever national referendum in 1975 on the question of whether to remain or leave.
The UK decided not to join the European Monetary System in 1979, while Labour campaigned in the 1983 general election on the promise to immediately leave the EEC.
Under Margaret Thatcher, Britain reluctantly joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1990, only to withdraw two years later.
Opinion polls since the 1990s have consistently shown the British public to be much more sceptical about European integration compared to their continental peers.
Popular Vote
The immediate onset of the crises that led to Irish efforts to break away from the UK and British efforts to depart the EU, both stemmed from plebiscites.
In the British general election of 1918, Sinn Féin won a decisive majority of Irish seats by promising to establish an independent Irish republic. As we all know the Brexit referendum of 2016 has brought the UK to the brink of departing the EU.
In both cases, however, there was considerable ambiguity about what exactly had been decided at the ballot box.
While Sinn Féin won a large majority of the seats in 1918, over 50% of votes cast were for home rule or unionist candidates. That said it must be noted that one of the reasons Sinn Féin’s tally was lower was because in 25 constituencies they were elected unopposed.
But did this election provide a mandate for rebellion against British authority? Did it suggest that nothing but an independent 32 county Irish republic was acceptable for the Irish people?
Such questions roiled Irish politics for the next decade.
By comparison, interpreting the 2016 referendum seems more straightforward. Brexit means Brexit after all. But the last two years have demonstrated that no one can say what exactly the British public meant when it voted to leave the EU.
Did they vote for a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit?
Did the referendum even reflect the true will of the British people, or did a decisive segment of voters carelessly choose ‘leave’ as a warning shot to their government, convinced that a ‘remain’ victory was a foregone conclusion?
Advertisement
That lack of clarity has paralyzed the British political system ever since.
Negotiating Agreements
Similarities can also be identified in the negotiation efforts that created the respective agreements.
Both Irish and British delegations had idealism in abundance, but they were negotiating with an opposition that held most of the cards.
In 1921, the British government had the option of escalating its military operations in Ireland in the case of negotiations failing.
EU representatives understand that the UK has much more to lose if an arrangement can’t be made on terms that suit Brussels.
The most contentious points of both arrangements were remarkably similar. Ireland was forced to agree to pay a portion of the British national debt in 1921, just as the United Kingdom will have to pay an exit fee for departing the EU.
Both agreements were interpreted as involving an unacceptable loss of sovereignty. Irish negotiators had to agree that Ireland would remain with the British empire and its representatives would swear an oath of allegiance to the monarchy.
May’s deal, meanwhile, may keep the UK trapped in the EU indefinitely, bound by its rules but unable to wield any influence over them.
Likewise both deals got stumped on the thorny question of Ulster.
Back then, partition was supposed to be temporary (with nationalists led to believe that the boundary commission would leave Northern Ireland with no choice but to join the south) but clearly wasn’t.
The Northern Irish backstop is apparently a contingency plan that will never be put into action, but it has the potential to become a permanent arrangement.
Hardline Brexiteers complain that this weakens the integrity of the UK. Their forefathers, however, were never quite so vexed about the integrity of the island of Ireland.
The Critics
No sooner was the ink dry on either agreement when the cutting backlash was unleashed.
Michael Collins felt he had signed his own death warrant and Theresa May certainly seems to have signed her political equivalent.
Jacob Rees Mogg doesn’t just bear a physical resemblance to Éamon de Valera, his strident opposition to the arrangement in question is remarkably familiar as well.
Despite the opposition, both agreements were accepted by the cabinets of the respective governments.
But the historical parallels may end there.
The Dáil ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty  – but Paddy Power bookmakers is offering odds of 1/10 that May’s deal will be rejected by the House of Commons.
Furthermore, it is possible that this issue will be resolved by a ‘Remain’ victory in a second referendum. There was no equivalent option in Ireland in 1921.
Still British observers would do well to note what happened in Ireland after the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed. Sinn Féin was torn apart and the political acrimony lingered for decades.
There is a real chance that the Conservatives, and possibly even Labour too, will suffer the same fate.
Regardless of the outcome of Brexit, a sense of anger and betrayal is likely to form the backdrop for British politics for some time to come.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-5-4214705-Sep2018/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has vowed to stand by her blueprint for future trade ties with the European Union, amid fierce opposition from Brexiteers and doubts from the bloc.
May in July unveiled a government paper that envisages Britain leaving the single market but staying in a free trade area for goods and agri-foods, through a customs deal and common rulebook with the EU.
Dubbed the Chequers plan after the country retreat where it was agreed by her cabinet, the proposal met immediate opposition from her own ruling Conservatives, who think it keeps Britain too closely aligned to the bloc.
It sparked the resignations of then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, while EU leaders have repeatedly questioned its viability and said further compromises will be needed.
Butwritingin this week’s The Sunday Telegraph, May said: “I will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest.”
Britain is set to leave the EU on March 30, and the two sides are entering a period of intense negotiations as they try to strike a divorce agreement by late October to give their parliaments enough time to endorse a deal.
Facing a strengthening campaign among Brexiteers against her plan, May reiterated she would opt for no deal rather than make further concessions to Brussels.

“For some sectors there would be real challenges for both the UK and the EU,” she said.
The prime minister again ruled out holding another referendum on EU membership in any circumstances, as pro-European campaigners continue to lobby for a so-called “people’s vote”.
“To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and a betrayal of that trust,” she said.
However, May suffered a new setback yesterday in efforts to unite her fractious Conservative Party around the Chequers plan after an influential Remain-voting former minister who previously backed the proposal announced he now opposed it.
Also writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Tory lawmaker Nick Boles said he “can no longer support this humiliation”.
Meanwhile, allies of Conservative election mastermind Lynton Crosby – who helped May’s leadership rival Johnson win two London mayoral campaigns – are reportedly helping Brexiteers plot to destroy the plan, according to The Sunday Times.
Eurosceptics are drawing up an alternative deal they hope Johnson and Davis will support when it is unveiled before the party’s annual conference later in September, reports said.

Describing herself as a proud unionist, she said that her party’s support of Theresa May’s Conservative government was about “much more than Northern Ireland” and attacked the claim that Northern Ireland’s relationship with the UK is more “take than give”.
In a statement responding to the speech, however, Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said that Foster had produced “no new thinking but more of the same old arrogance”.
Brexit
The DUP has repeatedly insisted it wants the UK to leave the single market and customs’ union after Brexit.
It also finds proposals to avoid a hard border that would see Northern Ireland remaining in these accords with EU, while the rest of the UK leaves them, as unpalatable.
A majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, but Foster said today that the UK voted as “one nation” in favour of Brexit.
“Unionists, throughout the country – those who voted remain and leave – accept that we must exit the EU in a way that causes no damage to the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom,” she said.
She said that it would be challenging for the British government to deliver on the referendum result but that she wanted to maximise the opportunities that may arise from the country’s exit from the EU.
“As a unionist I see no logic or rationale for a hard border being created between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,” Foster said. “Indeed we do not want to see that at all.”
She accused those “committed to unpicking the union” of “stirring up myths of border checkpoints”.

Foster added that “some” have sought to use the Brexit vote to sow division in Northern Ireland.
‘No bullet or bomb would dampen… our Britishness’
Foster began the speech by talking about her unionist upbringing and described how her father – a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary – was shot at the door of their home.
“I remember my father crawling into our kitchen with the blood streaming from his head,” she said. “I didn’t fully understand the Troubles at that time but I realised that the enemies of the Union had tried to kill my dad.”
Foster said that the experience shaped her thinking, and that like many others she was determined that “no bullet or bomb would dampen our loyalty, our unionism or our Britishness”.
She said that the relationship between unionists in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has been strained, and the latter has viewed the likes of the DUP as “being hard to understand or relate to”.
The DUP leader said it’s understandable that Northern Irish unionists appeared a little different as they “felt little loved and saw dangers at every turn”.
She added that Northern Ireland had come a long way since the Troubles and now unionists wanted to take the next steps.
‘Staggering position’
Sinn Féin’s Ó Muilleoir said that Foster’s comments were arrogant in “dismissing the entire nationalist population in this way”, and said her comments “don’t stack up to the reality”.
He said: “Where is the multi-culturalism for Gaelic speakers who are still being denied equal language rights by the DUP?
The South Belfast MLA accused the DUP leader of collapsing power sharing talks, but agreed with her that the issues which led to those talks falling down could be resolved.
He added: “Unfortunately, the only strategy we have seen from Arlene Foster is to do nothing other than prevent the restoration of the institutions on the basis of equality and there was nothing in her speech to indicate that any new approach is imminent.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/sup-labour-brexit-4372279-Dec2018/,"THE DUP AND the British Labour Party joining forces in a bid to force Theresa May’s government to publish its legal advice on Brexit has been described as a “strange, perhaps unholy” alliance.
Members of Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party are set to write a joint letter to John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, about the legal advice.
According to theDaily Telegraph, the letter will insist that the British government is in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish the full advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.
Foster’s former special advisor Richard Bullick told RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Irelandhe couldn’t confirm the reports but said it was “a sensible approach” to keep a number of options open.
“We’re in incredibly unusual times and to some extent that will mean there will be strange, perhaps unholy alliances.”
Despite the differences between the DUP and Labour, he said there is a “convergence of interests on this particular issue”.

Elements of the legal advice have beenleaked to the media. Cox is expected to make a statement on the matter in the House of Commonslater today.
The British government has said it will release a statement about the legal advice it received, citing Cabinet confidentiality.
Yesterday theSunday Timespublished a report about a letter Cox wrote in which he admitted that the UK would be trapped “indefinitely” in a customs union with the European Union if the backstop set out in the proposed deal comes into effect.
Second referendum
Bullick said he doesn’t think the DUP voting against the proposed Brexit deal on 11 December will necessarily mean the end of the Confidence and Supply Agreement between the Conservative Party and the DUP.
He said the outcome will depend on what May does after the vote in the House of Commons – try to renegotiate the deal with the European Union, call a general election or reconsider a second Brexit referendum.
Bullick said a second referendum is a “less than likely outcome” but added: “At this stage in the game a second referendum would be a better outcome than the present Withdrawal Agreement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/fishing-rights-northern-ireland-4237349-Sep2018/,"A WESTMINSTER COMMITTEE is urging the British government to enter to talks with its Irish counterparts over post-Brexit fishing rights.
Their report has argued that the UK government should threaten to stop the access of Irish fisherman to the waters of Northern Ireland unless a deal is done.
Under the informal 1964 Voisinage arrangement, fishing vessels from neighbouring countries are allowed to fish between 6-12 nautical miles within each other’s shores.
The agreement has never been given legislative backing in Irish law and the Supreme Court found it to be unconstitutional.
It was ruled that Northern Ireland boats were fishing formussel seeds in Irish waters without the proper permission– despite the fact that Irish-registered vessels are permitted to do so on Northern Ireland shores.

Now,a report by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committeehas said that this disparity must be resolved “as a matter of urgency” as Brexit approaches.
“While Irish fishermen have access to waters in Northern Ireland, fishermen in Northern Ireland have suffered hardship through exclusion from their habitual fishing grounds, ” the report states.
The report goes on to state that the Voisinage agreement has been “unilaterally suspended in Ireland” and that it needs to be made into law.
The government has been attempting to do just that but there has beenmet with political opposition.
The Westminster committee argues that if this is done that the UK should considering follow suit, but if not Irish boats should be prevented from fishing in Northern Ireland.
“If the Irish government does pass legislation to reinstate the Voisinage arrangement, then the UK government should consider whether the arrangement should also be put on statutory footing in UK law.”

In an interview with the Guardian, the man who led the unionists in the Good Friday Agreement negotiations said that the Irish government risks provoking loyalist paramilitaries over its stance on the border after the UK leaves the EU, and any “special deal” for Northern Ireland’s status put the 20-year-old agreement at risk.

The Irish government has always argued for no customs posts between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, and no physical border separating the two.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney has rejected Trimble’s assertions, saying the government is working hard to protect the “hard-won peace on the island of Ireland”, the Irish Times reported this morning.

AFTER THE UK parliament’s crucial vote on the Brexit deal was postponed, what’s next on the pathway to the UK’s exit from the EU?
Prime Minister Theresa May, after hearing repeated concerns from her Cabinet colleagues and fellow MPs on the Brexit deal before it reached the floor of the House of Commons, has returned to the doorsteps of EU leaders in the hope that they can add an assurance or a tweak to the deal that will make it more palatable for MPs back home.
Brexiteers, including the DUP leadership, have called for the backstop to be removed from the deal completely, as there are fears that it would hamper UK efforts to strike trade deals around the world.
But the EU, and the Irish government, have repeatedly said that there is no deal without a backstop provision. Further than that, they said that the current Brexit deal is not up for renegotiation.
So where does all that leave us?
On the backstop

As impossible as it may seem, there could be some compromise on the backstop.
The original plan was that the backstop would be Northern Ireland specific, but due to fears that this would anger the DUP and other unionists, the UK government interpreted it to mean UK-wide.
Advertisement
This would mean that after the transition period ends in December 2020, or beyond that if it’s extended, if there isn’t a deal that sufficiently ensures there will be no border on the island of Ireland, the backstop would kick in.
This would mean that the UK would follow whatever EU rules and regulations necessary that would ensure there’s no need for customs checks on the island of Ireland.
Some MPs are floating the idea that if an addendum was made to the deal to allow a House of Commons vote on whether they would stay within the backstop each year.
It’s possible that they could also reduce the backstop back to its Northern Ireland specific shape, meaning that in a worst-case scenario, Great Britain would be free to strike new trade deals around the world, and Northern Ireland would remain somewhat aligned to the EU.
The EU and Ireland have repeatedly emphasised that the backstop can neither be time-limited or include a clause where the UK can unilaterally withdraw from the backstop. That’s because of the political uncertainty of Brexit – no matter what types of trade deals the UK wants, or whether there’s a new Prime Minister or new party in power, there will still be a guarantee of no hard border on the island of Ireland.
Both sides have also repeatedly said that they don’t want to have to use the backstop, it should be added.
On the House of Commons vote

In short, we don’t know when the House of Commons vote will be now.
The UK parliament retires for a Christmas recess on 21 December. It’s difficult to see whether there would be any substantial changes to the mood of the House of Commons or the Brexit Withdrawal deal between then and now that would result in it being approved by 320 MPs.
The deadline by which the House of Commons must pass the deal or vote on it to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year is29 January.
It’s important to remember that the current Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has been rubber stamped by the EU and UK negotiating teams; the EU Council, which encompasses all 27 EU leaders; and the UK Cabinet (somehow).
Related ReadsWhat exactly is the Irish backstop, which could derail a final Brexit deal?
It’s also been reviewed by the UK’s Attorney General; although we are in uncharted territory here, you’d imagine all that would have to happen again if the deal was renegotiated, even slightly.
It’s also possible, after the European Court of Justice’s ruling yesterday, that the UK government could revoke Article 50 altogether, reversing the Brexit process. This wouldn’t do them any favours if there were to be a general election, however.
On Theresa May’s leadership
It’s difficult to see how Theresa May survives past January as British Prime Minister.
One of the reasons why it’s thought Theresa May pulled the vote is if she were to lose by a large majority (100 votes or so), then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would have submitted a vote of no confidence in her as leader.
Already, members of the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats have written to Corbyn pushing him to table a motion of no confidence in Theresa May.

NEWSNP, Lib Dems and others write to Jeremy Corbyn to push for no confidence motion(Which if falls - which might be likely - cd push Lab closer to backing second referendum)pic.twitter.com/Nk6vx6mC4S
But despite postponing the vote, it’s difficult to see how any Brexit deal can be approved by a majority of MPs, as there is a broad spectrum of views on what the Brexit deal should be.
So if there is a vote, no matter when it’s held, it looks as though the House will reject the Brexit deal; and if May doesn’t hold a House of Commons vote before 29 January, she will also face ousting attempts.
It’s important to remember too, however, that attempts to kick May out of 10 Downing Street have repeatedly failed; time before the Brexit vote will be a crucial factor in whether May stays in office.
Suggested for the role of Prime Minister (in order of likelihood) are Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

The British Prime Minister is seeking to downplay a warning made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond last week that such a scenario would cost £80 billion (€88 billion) in extra borrowing and have a negative impact on long-term economic growth.
TheGuardian reportsthat, speaking to reporters as she began a three-day trip to Africa, May cited remarks about Brexit made last week by Roberto Azevêdo, the director general of the World Trade Organisation, when making her comments.
“Look at what the director general of the World Trade Organisation has said. He has said about the no-deal situation that it will not be a walk in the park, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-9-4391939-Dec2018/,"IRISH POLITICIANS HAVE been told to stay out of UK political party leadership issues ahead of tonight’s no confidence vote result in British prime minister Theresa May.
Ministers, TDs, senators, MEPs and government spokespeople were told not to comment to UK journalists and outlets ahead of the Conservative motion in Westminster.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney refused to be drawn on the issue this evening, telling the media that he wanted to refrain from commenting for fear that anything he says might be misconstrued or taken out of context.
However, it is clear the Irish government’s position is it wants calm and stability to prevail, with May going on to win the backing of the House of Commons for the contentious withdrawal agreement.
At tonight’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Leo Varadkar said support for Ireland in Europe on Brexit remains “rock solid”.
He said the Irish government are holding firm to their position which led to last month’s withdrawal agreement.
He added that the withdrawal period could yet be extended and preparations here will continue for a potential no-deal scenario.
The Taoiseach was again accused of not preparing for a no-deal Brexit scenario today, with Fianna Fáil’s Micheal Martin stating that the public should know all the details.
He said a recent government memo which had been brought to government by the Tánaiste warned that a variety of challenges had arisen with the potential to impact on the country’s capacity to be Brexit-ready.
The memorandum sets out risks associated with site acquisition, potential lease-break rental options, statutory planning, procurement and construction issues at the ports and airports which will be most impacted by Brexit.

Ministers were warned that the scale of the problem facing the State was exceptional.
Quoting from the memo, Martin read:
“In the case of Brexit, the scale and likely cost of infrastructure required, and the short time frame required to gear up for Brexit are exceptional and fall well beyond the routine demands of the State, especially in the case of our ports.”
It further warned of detailed plans on the upgrading of Rosslare Harbour, Dublin Airport and Dublin Port, with significant issues identified regarding the capacity of Rosslare to be ready by 29 March 2019.
Withholding information from the public
“There has been a general tendency on the part of the Government to be coy and to withhold information from the public on contingency planning for Brexit, specifically a “no deal” Brexit, on the apparent basis that it would cause undue panic.
“I disagree with that view and believe the public should be made fully aware of all the implications of Brexit, irrespective of the scenario which ultimately emerges. The challenges and lack of preparation for Brexit should be shared with the public in full,” Martin told the Dail today.
Before stating that his party is willing to continue in the confidence and supply deal with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said there is still hope that the Brexit deal can be ratified, “because of the damage which any alternative will cause, the risk of a no-deal outcome has risen dramatically”.
“Circumstances have changed and we must respond accordingly.Ireland is now in a period of heightened danger for our economy and for a political settlement which has been a beacon of light in our modern history,” said Martin.
Martin made the ‘right decision’
Following today’s announcement by Martin that confidence and supply will continue, the Taoiseach told the Fine Gael parliamentary party members that Martin made the right decision.
He drew comparison to events in the UK and what has played out in Ireland today. Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the patience shown by Fine Gael since the talks began were worth it and added that it was the right decision for the right reasons by the Fianna Fáil leader.

BRITAIN SHOULD VOTE again on whether or not to leave the European Union Liverpool’s German manager Jurgen Klopp toldThe Guardianon Monday.
The 50-year-old — whose side face AS Roma at Anfield on Tuesday in their Champions League semi-final first leg clash — says the British people were sold short in the original campaign in 2016 in terms of the information they were fed.
Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016 but it was a close run thing — 51.9%-48.1%.
“When Mr (David) Cameron (the then Prime Minister) had the idea (of a referendum) you thought: ‘This is not something people should decide in a moment.’” said Klopp.
“The choice was either you stay in Europe, which is not perfect, or you go out into something nobody has any idea how it will work.

“So you give people the chance to make this big decision. And then it’s a 51-49 vote and you’re thinking: ‘Wow, 49% are not happy with the decision that’s going to change the country.’
“Let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information -– not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign.
“They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all.”
Klopp said history should teach people harsh lessons from the past when there has been division.
“When we split then we start fighting. There was not one time in history where division creates success. So, for me, Brexit still makes no sense.”
However, the charismatic German is adamant despite being touted by some for a future political career in Germany he will not be seeking to follow in the footsteps of present German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“Angela Merkel has two weeks off a year,” said Klopp, who credits Merkel as ‘doing an unbelievable job’.

“That’s less holiday than I have which means that’s absolutely not my target.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will visit Northern Ireland today as part of her tour to mark the one-year countdown to Brexit.
May will also travel to Scotland, England, and Wales during her day-long tour, aiming to rally support ahead of Britain’s EU departure on 29 March 2019.
“Today, one year until the UK leaves the EU and begins to chart a new course in the world, I am visiting all four nations of the Union to hear from people across our country what Brexit means to them,” May said ahead of her trip.
After visiting a textile factory in Ayrshire, western Scotland, May will travel to Newcastle in north-east England to meet a parent and toddler group.
Northern Ireland will be her next stop, for lunch with farmers near Belfast before a meeting with Welsh business owners in Barry, returning to London in time for tea with a group of Polish people.
“I am determined that as we leave the EU, and in the years ahead, we will strengthen the bonds that unite us,” May said.

While Britain overall voted by 52% to leave the European Union, pro-Brexit voters in England and Wales outnumbered those in Scotland and Northern Ireland who wanted to remain in the bloc.
There have been tensions between the devolved governments and London over May’s handling of the Brexit negotiations so far, with Scotland and Wales last week backing bills to ensure that powers brought back from Brussels go to their capitals.
But ahead of her tour, May vowed that the devolved administrations “will see an increase in their decision-making powers” as a result of Brexit.
Northern Ireland border
A further point of contention has arisen over the future of the Irish border after Britain leaves the European single market and customs union, with all sides in Brexit talks wanting to avoid imposing checks at the frontier.
May has agreed to Brussels’ plan to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union if no better solution is found – a proposition deemed unacceptable by the nation’s DUP party which props up the prime minister’s majority in parliament.
May said she has a responsibility to ensure “no new barriers are created within our common domestic market”, although the prime minister stopped short of detailing how the government will resolve the border issue.

https://www.thejournal.ie/carlingford-ferry-brexit-4087554-Jun2018/,"
THE CARLINGFORD FERRY was only launched a year ago but is already facing an uncertain future with a solution to the post-Brexit border problem still to be found.
The service has proved popular with commuters looking for a speedy crossing to work, but the potential imposition of time-consuming customs checks means it may be increasingly reliant on an underdeveloped tourism sector.
The project was 10 years in the making when Britain voted on 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union, but despite the setback, Frazer Ferries, which operates the service, has vowed to plough on.
“There is no clearly defined endgame for Brexit yet and we don’t know what it will ultimately look like, but we do feel very confident that we will adapt,” Paul O’Sullivan, director of Frazer Ferries, said.
The service, which can accomodate 10 cars, runs every 30 minutes across Carlingford Lough, an inlet of the Irish Sea.
There are no checks along the border but EU and British negotiators are so-far stumped on how to maintain the open border post-Brexit.
The quiet region around the lough is renowned for its idyllic, mountainous scenery, but remains somewhat isolated.
“A lot of people didn’t know this part of the world existed,” said Geoffrey Chestnutt, owner of a holiday resort on the Northern Irish coast, noting that the ferry had boosted business.
“They would have travelled directly from Newry (in Northern Ireland) to Newcastle, just missing it out,” added the 40-year-old. “It’s a good thing for both sides of the lough”.
Jobs
In addition to the 17 jobs directly created by the service, it also has the potential to provide a broader boost to the economy, O’Sullivan said.

The operator said a fishery based in the Northern Ireland coastal town of Kilkeel had been in touch about the possibility of making deliveries to the south.
“The ferry would obviously cut a 30-mile journey down to a couple of miles,” he said, explaining that the boat takes 15 minutes, compared with more than an hour by road.
Ticket-seller Nora McKee told AFP: “Most of our commuters are from the north side — a whole lot is travelling through to Dublin for work.”
But the return of a physical border could spell an end to the shortened journey for professional clientele.
‘Neglect’
The ferry is already trying to increase its tourist numbers, but the holidaymakers are still few and far between, according to Brian Mac An Bhaird, who blames a lack of investment.
“Look at today, this is the middle of the summer … there are no people. Where are the tourists?” asked the 71-year-old, noting: “You can’t even get a sandwich here.”
Paddy Malone, from the regional chamber of commerce, said Carlingford was hit particularly hard by the Troubles, and has “been neglected” since peace was achieved.
He partly blames authorities south of the border, whom he said “feel that if they get people up to the border, half of the money will be spent on the other side”.
Malone believes the area has “huge potential if we can manage Brexit”, but admitted that uncertainty hung over the border region and the future of the ferry.
On a more optimistic note, O’Sullivan insisted that if a physical border reappeared, “perhaps those cars would rather wait for these checks in the comfort of the ferry terminal overlooking Carlingford Lough” than take the motorway.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-uk-treaty-3912736-Mar2018/,"BRITAIN AND THE European Union have reached a landmark deal on transition arrangements that will last for nearly two years after the Brexit divorce next year.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier told a press conference in Brussels after negotiations with his British counterpart David Davis: ”We have reached an agreement on the transition period.
“The transition will be of limited duration.”
Backstop
As part of the withdrawal text (which can be readhere), Britain and the EU agreed on the so-called ‘backstop’ solution for the Irish border – unless or until another solution is found.
European CommissionEuropean Commission
Under this option, Northern Ireland will remain in “full alignment” with the EU’s single market and customs union in order to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
The backstop would, most significantly, see a commitment to no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The UK had already assured that there would not be a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit – it just hadn’t come up with a solution for leaving the single market and customs union but not having border checks.
The backstop optionwould mean alignmentbetween the north and south for customs, VAT, energy, regulations for the protection of the environment and laws governing agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also have to adhere to EU rules on State Aid and would be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in those aforementioned areas.
The backstop agreement wasknown as ‘Option C’with regard to the Northern Irish border – one of three options laid out in the Joint Report agreed by the UK and the EU in December.

It was not an option DUP leader Arlene Foster was happy with at the time:

At today’s press conference, the EU’s Brexit negotiator David Davis said that the UK and EU are committed to the draft report in keeping with the commitment to include a legal text detailing the solutions for the border in the north.
“But it remains our interest to achieve a partnership that is so close so as not to require specific measures for Northern Ireland,” he said, reiterating the need to avoid a hard border but to include some elements of the common travel area.
“The UK government remains steadfast in its commitment to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,” he said, mentioning this tweet from Simon Coveney earlier today:

“While there is as yet no agreement on the right … approach we know what we need to do and we are going to get on with it,” said Davis.
He said the government is confident that “a good deal for the UK and EU is closer than ever before”.
The new text of the withdrawal agreement produced by both sides says the transition will last from the day Britain leaves on March 29, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
“During that period, the United Kingdom will no longer participate in the European Union decision making process, because after that date it will no longer be a member of the EU,” Barnier said.
Davis told the news conference that the transition deal “gives the certainty demanded by businesses and citizens across Britain and the European Union.”

THE BREXIT CHOREOGRAPHY is set to continue today with UK Prime Minister Theresa May travelling to Brussels and a four-hour Dáil debate and vote being held here in Dublin.
May will today enjoy afternoon tea with the president of the EU commission Jean-Claude Juncker as European governments get their own say on Brexit this week.
Negotiations are set to continue right up to Sunday’s planned deal-signing summit.
Neither side has much wriggle room left to polish the withdrawal treaty or the political declaration on future relations that goes alongside it.

Last week, May won over her Cabinet on a planned Brexit deal which avoids a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (losing some ministers in the process).
Today’s Dáil debate will have little overall impact, given that negotiations are between the EU and Britain, but it will allow Taoiseach Leo Varadkar display a united front internationally in terms of the Irish political backing.
The debate and vote will also give parties an opportunity to debate the key sticking point in the talks – the Irish backstop.
All eyes will be on exchanges between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael today.
Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers has been accused by Fine Gael of conducting an “ill-conceived campaign” seeking to undermine the government’s approach to the withdrawal agreement.
She accused the government of championing the success of the deal and speaking out too soon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/big-issues-remain-brexit-negotiations-uk-4274884-Oct2018/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Oct 2018
NORTHERN IRISH UNIONISTS from both the DUP and UUP are set to meet the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels tomorrow, with both parties pledging to argue against an effective border down the Irish sea.
DUP leader Arlene Foster and UUP leader Robin Swann will both meet with Barnier alongside their parties MEPs.
Foster’s party is propping up UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in the House of Commons and the DUP has refused to rule out voting against any Brexit deal it is not satisfied with.
Technical discussions resume in Brussels this week, with both sides racing to bridge their differences over the toughest issues of the Irish border and future trading ties.
The EU summit on 18 October has been characterised by the bloc as a “moment of truth” in the divorce talks, just months before Britain leaves on 29 March, 2019.
Foster has said her party will reject any Brexit deal that would effectively have Britain leave the EU customs union while Northern Ireland remains in alignment with EU trade rules.
This arrangement is what’s referred to as the ‘Brexit backstop’ and May has said that her priority is to avoid such a situation.
Speaking today ahead of her meeting with Barnier, Foster said that her party’s “only red line” has been “no new borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.
“This red line is recognising that Great Britain is Northern Ireland’s biggest market. Over 70% of all goods leaving Belfast port are destined for Great Britain,” Foster said.
“Many who claim to respect the Belfast Agreement, fail to respect the principle of consent which was part of that Agreement. Indeed, they would happily redraw the border and annex Northern Ireland away from the rest of the UK.”
Last week, Fostersuggested that the Belfast Agreement could be changedin the context of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The DUP said on its website that Foster is to travel to Brussels for “an intensive three-day round of meetings” with Barnier.
The European Commission’s website lists one meeting between the pairtomorrow, alongside DUP MEP Diane Dodds.
Barnier’s schedule also lists a meeting tomorrow with UUP MEP Jim Nicholson. The party has said that its leader Robin Swann will also be present.
Speaking ahead of travelling to Brussels, Swann said that there is “a significant cross section of society in Northern Ireland” who are “deeply concerned about the proposed backstop.
“As unionists it is vital to us that the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom is preserved throughout this process, but it is also clear that in terms of the economic well-being of Northern Ireland any border along the Irish Sea would be as harmful as a no-deal Brexit,” he said.

Meanwhile, the UK government warned today that there were still “big issues” to resolve in Brexit negotiations with the European Union, even as hopes grow in Brussels of a breakthrough just days before a crucial summit.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said at the weekend that the chances of a deal are now rising.
British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said the government was “working hard for a deal this autumn and that continues at pace”.
But he added:
“There is a difference between people talking optimistically about a deal, and a deal including both the withdrawal agreement and the future framework actually being agreed,” he said.
‘Precise’ trade declaration
As months of negotiations come to a head, tensions erupted last month at a summit in Salzburg where the EU roundly rejected May’s plan for close economic ties after Brexit.
But she is sticking to her proposal, which she argues would protect cross-border trade while also resolving the problem of how to keep open Britain’s land border with Ireland.
The first sign of any common ground will come on Wednesday, when EU negotiator Michel Barnier will present the first draft of his proposed statement on post-Brexit economic and security ties to ambassadors of the EU’s other 27 member states.
A senior EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations told AFP that the document may be intentionally vague, in case Britain wants to change its red lines in the future.
However, May’s spokesman said Britain was seeking a “precise” declaration on the shape of the future relationship.
He noted that MPs in the House of Commons will have to approve the statement alongside the Brexit divorce deal, and would want to do so “on an informed basis”.
The divorce deal covers the issues of Britain’s financial settlement and EU expatriates’ rights, which are largely resolved, as well as the issue of Ireland.
London and Brussels agree they want no return to physical border checks between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, but disagree on how to achieve this.
Britain believes checks can be avoided through a new trade deal, but accepts the need for a fall-back plan — a backstop — to ensure this until that deal can be agreed.
London has rejected the EU’s proposal but has yet to put forward in full an alternative, promising only it will be published “shortly”.
The problem stems from Britain’s desire to leave the EU’s single market and customs union after Brexit, which would inevitably mean the reintroduction of checks in Ireland.

Tomorrow's front page: Donald Trump@realDonaldTrumpaccuses the PM of wrecking Brexit - and warns she may have killed off any chance of a vital US trade deal - full story HERE at 11pmhttps://t.co/JRrMjQDTBqpic.twitter.com/udCjYWQeeQ
THE WHITE HOUSE press secretary has said that US President Donald Trump “likes and respects” British Prime Minister Theresa May “very much” following an interview in which he said she has killed off any chance of a trade deal with the US post-Brexit.
The interview withThe Sunnewspaper came after Trump arrived in the UK yesterday for his first trip as President, where he is expected to hold talks with May today, as well as meeting the Queen.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has reiterated that Trump told The Sun that May was “a very good person” and that he “never said anything bad about her”.
In the wide-ranging interview, Trump said that Theresa May ignored his advice by opting for a softer Brexit strategy with the EU.
Trump attacked May’s much-maligned softer Brexit stance that has angered many Brexiteers.
He told the Sun: “If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal. If they do that, then their trade deal with the US will probably not be made.
Reaction
During the interview, Trump also said that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson –who resigned earlier this week– would make a “great prime minister”, and demanded that the UK and other NATO countries spend more on defence.
He went on the attack against London Mayor Sadiq Khan,with whom he has exchanged harsh words in the past.
Trump accused Khan of not standing up to terrorists and added that he felt “sadness” at feeling unwelcome in the UK capital where he is expected to face protests today.
A number of UK MPs have voiced their opinions of Trump’s interview on social media.
Labour MP Anna Turley said: “Trump is a racist and disrespects our nation. Why does he get to meet our Queen? And those Tories saying we should respect him simply because he is elected President – by that logic shouldn’t he respect our Prime Minister & London Mayor?”

MP for Central Ealing and Acton Rupa Huq said Trump’s comments were Islamophobic.
“Plus dash of Islamophobia lobbed at Sadiq Khan who he blames for terrorism. Awful stuff,” Huq tweeted.

Downing Street stayed silent but junior foreign minister Alan Duncan brushed off the row, saying Trump was a “controversialist, that’s his style”.
Emily Thornberry, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour party who has herself called May’s Brexit plan a “delusion”, said Trump had been “extraordinarily rude”.
“She is his host. What did his mother teach him? This is not the way you behave,” she told ITV.
Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP and chairwoman of parliament’s home affairs committee said: “Trump’s appalling behaviour makes me sympathise with Theresa May.
“[Until] I remember her desperate rush to invite him, her repeated reluctance to criticise his Muslim ban or caging of children, her chasing him for a bad trade deal…. For God’s sake Theresa, stand up to him today.”
Other MPs in May’s Conservative party rounded on the president for being “determined to insult” May.
Meanwhile,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Europe will stand up to Trump’s efforts to “destabilise” the EU and derail international cooperation.
He said on BFM  television that Trump “can’t tolerate that there is an ensemble called the European Union”.
“Europe will not let itself be destabilised,” he added.
Le Drian says Trump only believes in conflictual relationships and accused him of trying to destroy multilateral efforts to encourage trade, fight climate change and Iran’s nuclear activities.

THE SUGGESTION BY Britain’s Brexit secretary that a ‘change in government’ and the ‘strong influence’ of Sinn Féin have hampered exit negotiations has been broadly panned this morning.
Speaking at conference in London yesterday, David Davis said that he had “not anticipated” the “tough” approach to negotiations adopted by Leo Varadkar, according to a report in the Times Ireland Edition.
“We had a change of government, south of the border, and with a quite a strong influence from Sinn Féin, and that had an impact in terms of the approach,” he said.
When this train of thought was queried by a member of the audience (the Irish government hasn’t changed custodians in seven years) Davis replied: “Well you had a change of leader or a change in taoiseach.” “They’ve (Sinn Féin) been playing a strong political role which they haven’t done historically, that I hadn’t foreseen.”
Davis’s comments echo those often made in hardcore pro-Brexit circles in the UK – that is, that a strong Republican influence has been brought to bear on negotiations from the Irish side. However, such thoughts are rarely expressed via the British cabinet.

The statement has been greeted with derision this morning.
‘Wildly inaccurate’
“The suggestion that electoral issues in Ireland impact ongoing negotiations is wildly inaccurate,” Fine Gael’s spokesman on EU affairs Senator Neale Richmond said.
He added that he would not expect such claims (“a very common line from the Brexit wing of the Conservative party”) to be made by a member of the Cabinet.
“I wouldn’t have expected it from David Davis,” he said.
It shows that the average British MP doesn’t understand the nuances of the peace process. It’s very disappointing, completely inaccurate, and certainly not happening.
Meanwhile, UK Labour’s Owen Smith, formerly the shadow secretary for Northern Ireland, dismissed Davis’s words as “complete rubbish”:

https://www.thejournal.ie/fishing-brexit-deal-4339020-Nov2018/,"THERE ARE CONCERNS among Irish fishermen that the fish sector could be left out of the EU-UK customs arrangement currently on the table as negotiators try to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
Up until this week, a no-deal has seemed increasingly likely, as the UK and EU couldn’t agree to a backstop that would both satisfy the UK’s desire for sovereignty, and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
But now, it looks as thougha compromise has been draftedin the form of a UK-wide customs arrangement, which would be “a first cousin” of the Customs Union.
In the draft deal published last night, there aren’t new provisions made for fisheries, and will remain under EU rules “…unless an agreement on access to waters and fishing opportunities is applicable between the Union and the United Kingdom”.
“However, the Joint Committee shall establish the conditions, including in quantitative terms, under which certain fishery and aquaculture products brought into the customs territory of the Union… by vessels flying the flag of the United Kingdom and registered in Northern Ireland are exempted from duties.”
Sinn Féin Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, who represents fishing communities in Donegal, said that “fishing waters are part of the negotiation chips, to be crude about it”.
“I’m speculating that the Conservative party are trying to find the balance between the Brexiteers and Remainers, and if they throw in a constrictive deal on UK waters, that might swing it in favour of Remainers. So the can is being kicked down the road.”
What’s the problem, Brexit-wise?
The UK has announced it wants to“take back” its waters as part of Brexit: this includes leaving the Customs Union and the London Fisheries Convention 1964 (an arrangement incorporated into the EU Common Fisheries Policy).
The London Fisheries Convention allows other EU countries to fish in the 6-12 nautical mile zone off the coast of countries, and allows neighbouring countries to fish in the 0-6 mile zone (such as Northern Ireland and the Republic).
More than 50% of fish that have been caught in UK waters are by non-UK vessels last year. This is mirrored in Ireland, says Conor McCourt, a spokesperson for the Foyle Fisheries Co-Op. located in Greencastle on the edge of Lough Foyle.
“The UK import most of what they eat, and export most of what they catch,” McCourt says, adding that the UK exports a huge portion of its fish to EU member states.
For that reason, McCourt isn’t too pessimistic about what the final arrangement will be -  “It’s probably going to be a Brexit deal close to what’s in existence now” – but adds there’s still too much uncertainty at the moment to be sure.
Mac Lochlainn says that if the Brexit dealends up in the “nuclear option” and Irish fishermen have no access to UK waters, it would be “disastrous” in the context of the existing state of play. The industry would have to be compensated by the EU, he says.
“This is important: if that were to happen, we need to insist on reopening the Common Fisheries Policy. We give away a very large portion of Irish territorial waters, which is why we’re overly dependent on UK territorial waters.”

Fisheries and UK politics
Speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, May said that the UK would “take back control of our borders, our laws and our money,leave the Common Fisheries Policyand agricultural policy while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom”.
Ahead of a Cabinet meeting, a letter from 13 Scottish Tory MPs including the Scottish Secretary of State, was hand delivered to May warning against supporting a deal that didn’t protect fishing rights.
The letter states:
“[There are] expectations in the fishing industry that Brexit will lead to complete control and full sovereignty over domestic waters that we must deliver on.”
” At the end of the Implementation Period, we must be able to negotiate access an quota shares with the EU and other third countries independently on an annual basis, without any pre-existing arrangement being in force.”
They said that fishermen didn’t want to be in the Common Fisheries Policy beyond 2020.
Letter here 👇pic.twitter.com/FMoCBJV1GB— Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak)November 14, 2018Laura Kuenssberg/ Twitter
Letter here 👇pic.twitter.com/FMoCBJV1GB
One of the signatories, Ross Thompson MP, said:
“I will accept nothing less than full sovereignty over our own waters. That means being a fully independent coastal state, out of the Common Fisheries Policy, and like other coastal states deciding who fishes in our waters, what they fish and when they fish. All on our terms.”
McCourt says that his understanding is that nothing is agreed on the catching side or selling side of fisheries yet, and adds that “one of the UK’s strongest cards is fisheries”.
“We’re wondering if Brexit is ever going to happen, up until this week we didn’t think it was,” he says.
There’s great concern among fishermen that if the UK leave, it will have the power to decide who can fish on its shores and to control how much they catch.
Mackerel industry
The highest value fish is mackerel, according to McCourt.
Although you can catch it off Irish coasts, most mackerel is caught in Scotland because it has the right oil content at this stage of its life. “There’s a big fear for the mackerel industry if they can’t access UK waters.
Transportation of the fish to Europe is another issue: most trade goes from Ireland, through the UK, and then into France and Spain via Calais. “For us to send them to Rosslare would add a lot to the process,” he says, “we sell around 50% of our fish to the UK.”
And if the UK leaves with no deal and the price of 50% of their fish rises, what will they do?
Mac Lochlainn says: “If Brexit is terrible for agriculture, it is a disaster for fisheries.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-government-no-deal-brexit-plan-4406051-Dec2018/,"THE IRISH GOVERNMENThas publishedits preparations thus far for a no-deal Brexit.
The 131-page document lays out the plans under the headings: economic and fiscal; security; Northern Ireland and North-South relations; relations with Great Britain and sectoral analysis.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the plan makes for a “stark” and “sobering” read, and said that this wasn’t a plan to keep things as they are, but a “damage-limiting exercise”.
To prepare for Brexit, the government is buying up land atDublin Port and Rosslare Portin anticipation of additional customs checks. It’s not expected, however, that everything will be in place at the ports in time for a no-deal scenario.
grainnegrainne
In relation toaviation,Coveney said that “a skeleton arrangement”would be put in place: this would ensure that planes could fly out of British airports by maintaining the safety certification beyond 29 March on a temporary basis.
“It becomes a much more different business model for non-EU aircraft coming out of the UK… it is not a pretty picture,” said Coveney.
Non-EU airlines flying from Britain would only be able to fly in and out, or point-to-point (this means they could fly to Paris and back to London again, but not to Paris and onto Madrid).
For agriculture, a host of measures are being made for a sector that seems most susceptible to a hard or no-deal Brexit. The European Commission has suggested that there will need to be “simplified border controls” on animals and animal products travelling between the EU and the UK.
But Coveney conceded that there are no contingency plans for aborderon the island of Ireland; neither are there plans to preparefisheriesfor a no-deal.
Onsecurity, the government fears that a no-deal Brexit would limit access to classified information and extraditions, due to the absence of the European Arrest Warrant.
It’s also possible that emergency measures may need to be taken in critical areas ofmedicinesandfood supplies, but the Tánaiste affirmed that there would be no shortages of either.
Coveney also said that there isn’t a“no-deal deal”, and anyone who says it is a “millennium bug” issue, in that it won’t have an impact, is fooling themselves.

The reason why the deal on the table is so important, according to Coveney, is in terms of the backstop, which “does provide complex assurances to reassure people that border infrastructure will not be an unintended consequence to Brexit”.

Another complication is the amount ofchanges to Irish lawthat will need to take place to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. At least 45 legislative changes would be needed, including over 20 pieces of primary legislation.
In order to accomodate this in the Dáil schedule, Ministers have been asked toprioritise legislationso that it can be passed before March, as law changes relating to a no-deal Brexit would cause a backlog.
The Irish government’sgreatest concernsin the event of a no-deal Brexit are the difference in regulations between Ireland and the UK, a further drop in the value of sterling, and the “serious impact” it would have on security.
In relation totrade, the government said that many of the same preparations needed for a “central case” scenario, or Brexit with an agreed deal, are the same for a no-deal Brexit, but those measures would have to be rolled out much faster.

To date, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had announced that they were hiring additional customs officers and vets to carry out checks at ports and airports in anticipation of Brexit, which is scheduled to take place on 29 March next year. Varadkar said that there were no plans to hire additional gardaí.
In addition, the government has been encouraging and advising businesses on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit as much as possible. A no-deal Brexit could result in a 7% drop in GDP for Ireland, while the equivalent for the UK would be a drop of 5%.
Yesterday, the British Cabinet agreed to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, which is looking increasingly likely as the UK government and Tory party remains divided over the Irish backstop.
Those plans include having3,500 troops on standby and acquiring fridgesto stockpile six-weeks worth of medicines for the NHS.
Thus far, the Irish government and the EU have staunchly denied the need for no-deal Brexit preparations, saying that it could take the focus away from trying to strike a deal.
But the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement looks unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons; if that does happen a no-deal Brexit is increasingly likely.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-antidepressants-england-4350000-Nov2018/,"THE AFTERMATH of the Brexit referendum has been linked to a rise in antidepressant prescribing in England, a new study has found.
The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016, with 51.9% of people voting to leave.
While this finding is open to interpretation, the researchers suggest this trend may have been prompted by the increased uncertainty experienced by some sectors of the population, in the wake of the vote.
Evidence has suggested that major societal events can affect a nation’s mental health, and the researchers wanted to find out if the vote for Brexit might have had a similar impact.
In order to do this, the researchers compared official monthly prescribing data for antidepressants for all 326 voting areas in England with other classes of drugs for conditions less likely to be immediately affected by changes in mood.
These included drugs to treat anaemia, gout, insulins, thyroid problems, drugs to lower blood glucose and blood fats, and muscle relaxants.
Prescribing patterns were examined specifically for the month of July every year between 2011 and 2016 to capture the immediate aftermath of the referendum results.
To ensure they could compare the different types of drugs, they calculated a “defined daily dose”, or DDD for short.
The 326 voting areas were home to an average of 36.6 general practices (GPs), with an average population of 164,534 people in each area.
The number of DDDs prescribed was then divided by each voting area’s population to estimate average prescribing levels per person. This data was then combined with the referendum result for each area.

Referendum impact
The data showed that before the referendum, DDDs for antidepressants rose during the month of July year on year, as did prescribing for insulins and gout, anaemia, and blood fat and glucose drugs.
In the month after the referendum, DDDs for antidepressants continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace, but those for other drugs fell, having experienced a period of growth.
The only exception was prescriptions for muscle relaxants, which had already been in decline.
After the referendum, the volume of antidepressants prescribed increased by 13.4% relative to the other classes of drugs studied.
The researchers did note that this was an observational study, and as such, they can’t establish a cause.
Antidepressants aren’t prescribed to everyone, so the results can’t be taken to mean that the mood worsened across the whole of England, nor can they rule out that mood actually improved for some people, the researchers emphasised.
“Overall, while our findings point towards a relative increase in antidepressants prescribing as measured by DDDs per capita, results should be interpreted with caution, and further research is needed to examine whether there is any short-term relationship between the referendum result and mental health,” they wrote.
The researchers suggested that policies supporting mental health should be intensified in periods of uncertainty.
Policy makers may underestimate the potential costs of Brexit if they focus purely on the impact on the economy or immigration, and ignore any changes in psychological wellbeing that may ultimately affect economic performance and social cohesion, they added.
The study has been published in the BMJ.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-2-4363178-Nov2018/,"CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR a no-deal ‘hard Brexit’ were approved by Cabinet today.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the government has planned for two things – the scenario if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, which includes the transition period, a single customs territory and the backstop.
The second scenario is the no deal hard Brexit scenario, which Varadkar said the government does not think is likely.
“But we must prepare it for nonetheless,” he said.

In terms of recruitment of customs officers, 3,000 applications for 600 customs positions were received.
The Taoiseach told the Dáil today that there are assurances from Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that the necessary recruitment is under way. Varadkar said several hundred customs officials will be in place in time for the March Brexit deadline, and the rest will be in place after that.
What physical infrastructure might be needed at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort was also discussed today.
In Dublin Airport it would involve an upgrade to the customs and border services and at Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port it would involve physical infrastructure, such as parking areas for HGVs and examination stations.
“These preparations are very much under way,” said the Taoiseach, adding:

https://www.thejournal.ie/confidence-and-supply-eamon-ocuiv-4411662-Dec2018/,"NOT ONE TO shy away from criticising his own party, Galway TD Eamon Ó Cuív has said he was “very surprised” when he heard Fianna Fáil had renewed the confidence and supply deal with Fine Gael for another 12 months.
In an interview withTheJournal.ie, Ó Cuív said:
“I was very surprised, I think everyone was, because our understanding was they were in a review of the last confidence and supply. I think it would be fair to say, even though it wasn’t discussed at the parliamentary party, the vast majority of TDs accept it.”
Ó Cuív’s comments followharsh criticism from other Fianna Fail TDswho have questioned why – in the midst of health and housing crises – Micheál Martin would allow Fine Gael to keep running the show.
By signing up to another 12 months, Ó Cuív said his own party seem to be suggesting they could not do a better job of running the country.
Do a better job
“My fundamental point, and I think this would be accepted and absolutely standard in politics, is that the reason you don’t belong, in this case, to the government party, is because you believe your party in government would do a lot better.
“Now we seem to be saying that even if we are in government, things wouldn’t change, and I would hate to think that that would be true. We need radical change,” he said.
Martin said Brexit left him with no choice but to renew the deal, while also getting little in return for doing so, but Ó Cuív argues that an election at this time would not be destabilising – pointing out that the UK held its own election in the middle of all the Brexit drama.
“I think it [renewal of confidence and supply] is a matter that needs deep reflection over the next four or five months to see what happened, but the reality is elections should not be destabilising, they are part of democracy,” he said.
Despite what the polls might say, Ó Cuív believes Fianna Fáil has a shot at being the largest party after the next general election.
“The likelihood after the next election, if the present government did not get reelected, would be a Fianna Fáil-led government, that should not destabilise anything,” he said, adding that there is no reason to think that it would take two or three months to form a government again (last time around it took 70 days).
“I think parties that were reluctant to be part of government formation last time would be queuing at the door. At the end of the day, where I come from right across the spectrum I think this government are not doing a good job. I am talking about everyday things that people contend with,” said Ó Cuív, adding that he is in touch with “the realities of people’s lives”.
He said people are still dealing with residual debt issues, housing shortages, hospital waiting lists and broadband provision.
The Galway TD said the current government is not a “good” government, adding that in his view, they are not competent.
“I would like to see a change in government but Micheál has signed up, it seems the majority of the parliamentary party backed that and I accept the will of the majority.”

If an election was to be held and Fianna Fáil became the largest party, what other parties might it talk to? Ó Cuív rules out a grand coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.
‘Fine Gael are a right-wing party’
“I can’t see a coalition with Fine Gael, it is nothing to do with historical issues, but in my view, they are very right-wing – right-wing economics, right-wing attitude to people, they lack, in my view, the acceptance of people, the way people really are with all their issues. I would feel Fianna Fail would do a better job. We are not compatible [with Fine Gael].”
He added that this was the view of the party membership also.
What about Sinn Féin?
“Micheál has said they are off the table, so we’ll say no more about that,” adds Ó Cuív.
While Ó Cuív said he is not “privy” to the information as to why his party leader signed up for another year of the confidence and supply agreement, he said he hopes his party has solutions to some of society’s problems.
“I think I have answers to some of the problems,” he said, however, he admitted he has concerns about the move towards centralised power within his own party, and other areas of society.
“One of the things that fascinates me, in many organisations, not just Fianna Fáil, but including Fianna Fáil, is the centralising forces, it is a massive modern phenomenon.
“You see it in the health sector, but you also see it in Fianna Fáil and I don’t think that is good,” he said, pointing out that the GAA has managed to avoid centralisation with the county and club still being autonomous.
“This is a challenge in Fianna Fáil but I don’t think we are unique with this problem.”
While some might view Ó Cuív’s comments as the Galway TD sticking it to his party leader, he views it as voicing an opinion on Fianna Fáil’s path forward.
His relationship with Micheál Martin
There has long been talk over the years that Martin and Ó Cuív don’t see eye to eye on many subject matters, though Ó Cuív will not speculate as to whether the Cork TD will be forced to move on if Fianna Fáil fail in gaining more seats after the next election.
So what is their relationship like now, particularly since Martin removed him from the frontbench for his role in launching a local election candidate in the North without Martin’s say so?
“I think we always got on okay, but I think it would be true to say that we hold different views on many many different subjects, but I tend to work with all sorts of people who don’t share my view on a whole range of subjects.”
Having robust debate on issues “is what makes life interesting”, said Ó Cuív, adding that people having different opinions is good, otherwise things begin to stagnate.
One of the problems in modern politics is the lack of debate, the lack of challenging perceived wisdoms, the lack at looking at the thing that had validity last year or ten years ago and that doesn’t have validity anymore, because the world has moved on.
The full interview with Eamon Ó Cuív on what did happen with that local election candidate launch in North and why he says he did what he did for the “greater good” will be published at 9.30pm.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-irish-border-issue-4213336-Aug2018/,"
THE COMPLEX IRISH border problem could yet scupper a Brexit deal, EU negotiator Michel Barnier warned today after talks with his British counterpart, saying “urgent” work was needed to find a solution.
Avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after the United Kingdom leaves the EU’s single market has become a major obstacle to finding a deal.
After meeting the UK Brexit minister Dominic Raab in Brussels, Barnier hailed progress on some security issues but warned there were still major differences over protected geographical indicators like champagne and stilton – and Ireland.
“There is an urgent need to work on the text of an operational backstop and that’s why I’ve asked Dominic and his team to provide us with the necessary data for technical work, which we need now, on the nature, location and methods of the checks that will be needed,” Barnier said.
The EU proposes that Northern Ireland stay aligned with the remaining 27 bloc members after Brexit as part of a “backstop”, or insurance policy to avoid the reimposition of border checks and a risk to Irish peace gains.
This would mean that Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union and the single market to avoid a hard border returning on the island of Ireland, something Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he’s committed to avoiding.
But the UK has suggested instead that the whole country remain aligned with the EU in certain areas, only until the end of 2021, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May saying that neither she, nor any Prime Minister could accept a border along the Irish Sea.

The EU in turn opposes including the entire UK into the backstop arrangement, viewing it as a way of Britain trying to stay in the single market by stealth.
The two sides have just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s divorce from the European Union – set for 29 March 2019 – must be forged in principle by October or November.
Raab, whose predecessor David Davis resigned in July over differences with Theresa May’s outline of what she wanted from Brexit, said he was “stubbornly optimistic” that a deal could be reached.
“All in all I think the contours of an agreement and a deal on the withdrawal agreement are becoming clearer and clearer, which is a positive,” he said.
“The solutions [on Ireland] must be workable.
France’s Europe Minister cast doubt on May’s blueprint for future trade ties today, warning the current proposal was “not possible”.
Nathalie Loiseau said May’s plan unveiled in July, which envisages the UK leaving the EU’s single market but staying in a free trade area for goods through a customs deal and common rulebook, is unattainable.

BRITAIN’S NEW NEGOTIATOR Dominic Raab has pledged to intensify talks with the EU to secure a Brexit deal as fears grew in Brussels that time was running out for an orderly withdrawal next year.
Raab met his EU counterpart Michel Barnier for his first talks in Brussels where officials warned European Union member countries and businesses to “step up preparations” for Britain’s exit on 30 March.
“I look forward to intensifying, heating up the negotiations and making sure we’re in the best position to get the best deal,” Raab told reporters, standing next to Barnier.
Raab replaced David Davis, who was part of a government rebellion against Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, with the political discord alarming Brussels.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, urged “member states and private parties to step up preparations… for all outcomes” by the 30 March withdrawal deadline.
It said “there is still no certainty that there will be a ratified withdrawal agreement in place on that date”, even though the EU is working around the clock for a deal.
“The UK’s withdrawal will undoubtedly cause disruption – for example in business supply chains – whether or not there is a deal,” the commission added.
It highlighted checks at a new border, the validity of licences, certificates and authorisations issued by Britain as well as data transfers.
Britons voted to leave the 28-nation bloc in June 2016, but negotiations were only launched a year later and have bogged down frequently since then.
Stumbling blocks include the future of the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland against a backdrop of discord in London.
Raab is leading negotiations for the British side since Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quit last week over May’s Brexit blueprint, which would keep Britain economically close to the EU.
May is battling to unite her Conservative Party around her blueprint, formally unveiled last week following months of cabinet infighting.
It would see Britain ask the European Union for a free trade area for goods through a “facilitated customs arrangement” alongside a “common rulebook”.

‘Volatile’ situation
Barnier has warned that it will be difficult to conclude the negotiations by the October target, which would give parliaments on both sides time to endorse the deal.
“We have a lot of work to do with our teams,” Barnier said.
During “this short time”, he said he and Raab had to oversee efforts for a deal on future political ties as well as finalise a withdrawal agreement.
“We’re not there yet,” he said.
The EU aims to give Britain a transition period until the end of 2020 to give businesses and others time to adjust to a post-Brexit future.
The 16-page commission document warns “there will be no transition period and EU law will cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom on March 30″ in the event of no deal.
It also warned of possible disruption to transport, including aviation, as well as to the flow of goods as a result of customs checks.
Yesterday, the Irish government said it had stepped up preparations for Britain’s departure, including what it called the “unlikely case of a ‘no deal’ Brexit”.
These include Ireland’s plans for at least 920 new customs and veterinary inspectors at ports and airports to tackle changes in the trading relationship with Britain.
Barnier is due to brief the 27 European affairs ministers tomorrow about the latest in the Brexit negotiations.
An EU source said all the negotiators sought a withdrawal agreement as the cost is “disproportionately high” without one.
And with the situation so “volatile” in London, the source said, they will “try not to put oil on the fire”.

FORMER BRITISH FOREIGN minister Boris Johnson has urged the government to change its strategy for leaving the European Union, telling MPs in a rousing speech it was “not too late to save Brexit”.
He warned that Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for close economic ties – over which he and Brexit secretary David Davis quit last week – “is BRINO, or Brexit in name only”.
In his first speech to the House of Commons since resigning, where he was flanked by supporters including Davis, Johnson said May could still change course.
“It is not too late to save Brexit. We have time in these negotiations. We have changed tack once and we can change again,” he said.
But he added a deal must be struck now, saying it was “nonsense” that Britain could agree a compromise now that it could later unpick.
With May’s plan “we are volunteering for economic vassalage”, he said, adding that it would leave Britain in “miserable permanent limbo”.

He said May initially proposed a “glorious vision” for Brexit, which involved breaking from the EU’s courts, customs unions and the single market, and forging new trade deals.
But in the past 18 months, “it is as though a fog of self-doubt has descended”, he said.
“We dithered and we burned through our negotiating capital,” he said, noting the agreement to settle Britain’s financial affairs without the legal promise of a future trade deal.
Johnson demanded Britons “believe in this country”.
“There is time, and if the prime minister can fix that vision once again… then I believe she can deliver a great Brexit for Britain,” he said.

That’s the 1, 2, 3 on a list of The Most Important Non-EU Countries to the EU right now, according to former European Commission president José Manuel Barroso.
Obviously, that third position will be supplanted by the UK once they leave the union, he told an audience of mildly depressed (as per their own admission) business people and Brexit-interested parties at aconference in Dublin yesterday.
“There will be a crunch time when there will be no country more important than Britain,” he added, just in case the point hadn’t crystalised for the Irish in the room.
But, Barroso tells us, right now this whole Brexit thing isn’t even in the top three priorities for most other countries in the EU.
It’s not even noon and we’ve stumbled upon a contradiction.
Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen at the IIEA conference on Brexit at the Mansion House yesterdayRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
At the moment, we have backers in Europe. Loads of them. Michel Barnier – he’s on our side. Jean-Claude Juncker – a senior hurler. Macron. Merkel. Hell, even May makes the team sheet, saying she wants to make sure the island is ‘go han-mhaith’ after Brexit.
So, when it’s not a priority for anyone else – Ireland and Irish people are important. But when it’s crunch time – it will be the UK that’s the Numero Uno.
What’s next?
As a reminder of the timeline, the UK will be leaving the EU – deal or no deal – at 11pm on 29 March 2019. If it is to be an orderly exit, a legally solid agreement needs to be in place by October this year.
So squeaky-bum time is just six months away. And, in reality, Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney and their much-lauded civil servants don’t have the luxury of that half dozen.
“Running it down to October is dangerous,” according to former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who was giving his “tuppence of advice” to the Fine Gael negotiators at the same conference, organised by theIIEA in the Mansion House, Dublin on Monday morning.
“If you come down to the last few days, my fear is that our Taoiseach would be called in by the French, the Germans, the [European] Commission, the Presidency.”

In Bertie’s scenario, Leo would be told that the Brits have paid the piper. They have €50 billion on the table, along with a deal on freedom of movement and a decent trade agreement, as well as having made promising signals on the future relationship.
It’s 2am and the Europeans turn to us (and on us).
“We don’t think you Irish should push just as hard as you’ve been pushing… We think maybe you should give a bit of a compromise. That’s how it works. That’s how it always works.”
It’s a Halloween party that Ireland shouldn’t find themselves at, concludes the ex-Fianna Fáil man, no stranger to a European all-nighter.
“I think Michel Barnier’s team has been top class, they have really fought the Irish case. But [having] been there, done that, I know when it comes to the evil hour what happens in these things. I’ve seen it more times, and been part of it…
“What happens us? I’m not saying we’ll be abandoned, but the art of politics, the strength of politics is compromise. It’s not a bad thing, it’s not an evil thing (even though I’ve been accused of that over the years)… but it’s a good thing. I’m just saying we should be as far down the line as we can before, ultimately, it will come to the late night.
In Bertie’s scenario, the UK has taken its place on The Most Important Non-EU Countries to the EU list. And, in those minutes, it will be as Barroso predicted – “there will be no country more important than Britain”.
So by his estimations, Ireland’s negotiators have until June before they are no longer the priority, and Barnier removes the green cape.
The compromise
Ahern’s successor Brian Cowen agreed and repeated on numerous occasions throughout the morning that “progress in concrete terms” was needed, while his predecessor John Bruton was finding it difficult to muster up anything other than pessimism.
“I wish I could be optimistic and see a way through, but I can’t,” was part of his opener.
And, perhaps, this is why we always need a bit of Bertie.
He’s been searching for a way to sell a customs union and the single market to the Brits and along the way has managed to stumble on something even something to DUP likes.
Regulatory alignment.
“If regulatory alignment can bring us a solution that means there is not any change of substance between the present Customs Union/Single Market, then we can buy it. I don’t think there is much point in just beating the drum on the Customs Union. Let’s make regulatory alignment, as per the December deal, stand up.”
The Bertie twist? Just call it something different. Regulatory alignment by another name.

It’s the art of politics. The strength of politics. The compromise.
Barroso agreed. Lawyers and eurocrats can be creative, ingenious and imaginative with the rules and with the law, he promised.
And in the end, the Brits won’t really want anything else.
“In a sense, Britain will never abandon the idea of Brexit until they have Brexited. Then they will see what they’ve done,” said Bruton, noting that it takes three minutes for goods from the EU to get through Dover, while those non-EU hauliers wait the guts of 45 minutes.
Bertie Ahern with Barosso at the Mansion House yesterdayRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Later, his party colleague (leader of Fine Gael from 1987 to 1990) Alan Dukes stood up in the audience to add, “If we have an agreement that allows them to diverge, they’ll find that it’s an extremely bad idea.”
While Dominic Grieve – one-time Attorney General to the British government – wagered that in 10 years time, “we won’t have diverged on anything”.
Bertie would be serving them what they want.
May reportedly said as muchat the weekend, conceding that she’ll have to accept some permanent membership of a customs union. Wouldn’t it be handy to be allowed to just call it something else?
It’s a fun hobby for retired politicians, to walk down memory lane while dissecting how the young ones do it these days.
“As a former taoiseach, I wish the present one well,” said Cowen, during yesterday’s exercise.
“I don’t see how I can be of any more help to him. And certainly I’m not first on his list, I’m sure.”
Who knows, maybe Bertie is.

THE POUND HAS fallen sharply as a string of British government resignations appeared to put Prime Minister Theresa May and her draft Brexit deal in serious jeopardy, dealers said.
The UK currency was pummelled as a number of ministers, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, quit in protest against the EU exit deal which was mauled by all sides in Parliament.
May held firm, telling the house it was the best deal on offer, but it looked increasingly likely she could soon face a leadership challenge after leading Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg formally called for a vote of no confidence.
The pound plunged more than 1.5% against the dollar to a one-month low at $1.2777 and was trading around $1.28 in mid-afternoon.
It fell by about the same amount against the euro.

“The performance of the pound seems to perfectly reflect the mood in parliament and everywhere else right now. Even the weather is grey and gloomy,” Oanda analyst Craig Erlam told AFP.
“This departure (of Raab) could put at risk the Brexit deal and traders are selling the British currency due to growing uncertainty about the future of the UK,” said ActivTrades analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa.
‘Dead duck’
“The pound is under heavy pressure… as the UK-EU deal begins to look like a dead duck,” noted IG analyst Chris Beauchamp.
“As the steady drip of resignations hits the government, the UK’s deal with the EU appears to be dead in the water already.”
The pound was also hit by news that retail sales slid 0.5% in October compared with September.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-donald-tusk-brexit-4387028-Dec2018/,"LEO VARADKAR AND Donald Tusk have both said the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between the European Union and Britain cannot be renegotiated.
Earlier today British Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed that she was postponing tomorrow’s crucial House of Commons vote on the Brexit deal so she can go back to Brussels and ask for certain changes to be made.
May admitted the current agreement “would be rejected by a significant margin” but stated: “I’m in absolutely no doubt that this deal is the right one.”
One of the main sticking points is the proposed backstop arrangement. Thisaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
In heated cross-party exchanges in the House of Commons, May was accused of “pathetic cowardice” forpostponing the vote. When she said there is “broad support” for many of the key aspects of the deal, laughter erupted in the chamber.

In a statement issued this evening, Tusk, President of the European Council, said: “We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.
Varadkar and Tusk spoke over the phone today, the Department of the Taoiseach confirmed.
“They agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement is the best option and could not be renegotiated. They also agreed that preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome should intensify,” a spokesperson said.
EU leaders are set to meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
Calls to resign
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the deal – including MPs in May’s own Conservative Party, as well as members of Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party – which is propping up May’s minority government.
The DUP believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.

There have been calls for no-confidence motions in both the British government and May to be put forward, as well as calls for May to resign – from outside and inside her own party.
Pro-Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said May “must either govern or quit”.
“This is not governing, it risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into government by failing to deliver Brexit. We cannot continue like this,” he said.
Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the British government are “deluding themselves if they think Irish interests will be cast aside to facilitate their fantasy Brexit”.
She described the postponement of the House of Commons vote as “the latest chapter in the Brexit shambles saga”.
“There is no good Brexit for Ireland, north or south. What we have after two years is a deal which is the least worst option,” McDonald said.

THE BRITISH PRIME Minister Theresa May has already announced her new foreign secretary.
Last night Britain’s Brexit Minister David Davis resigned, whileBoris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretarythis evening. Junior minister Steve Baker confirmed he had also quit, alongside Davis.
Long-serving Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been given the job of foreign secretary, taking the reins from Johnson who earlier said that the “Brexit dream is dying” and that Britain is “headed for the status of colony”.

These resignations are a major blow for May as she struggles to unite her party behind a plan to retain strong economic ties to the European Union even after leaving the bloc.
After a marathon day-long meeting with her ministers on Friday, Theresa May outlined the UK’s stance to negotiations, which has been dubbed the Chequers agreement.
But the key principles are quite vague. They include “ending free movement”, “no more sending vasts sums of money each year to the EU”, and “a new business friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world”.
Brexiteers are unhappy with the stance, saying it doesn’t do justice to Brexit.
Parliamentary private secretary Chris Green, meanwhile, has become the latest member of the Conservative government to step down.
In his resignation letter, Tory MP Green said, “The direction the negotiations had been taking have suggested that we would not really leave the EU and the conclusion and statements following the Chequers summit confirmed my fears.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/as-the-spectre-of-facism-threatens-europe-once-again-learning-history-is-essential-4363912-Jan2019/,"ACROSS THE WORLD familiar themes are re-emerging.
As Russia flexes its muscles and starts to reassert itself on the world stage after its long hibernation, and the spectre of fascism threatens to spread across Europe once again, it is perhaps time to remember the words of the Italian philosopher, George Santayana.
It is only as the final members of a generation that lived through the horrors of a century ravaged by war are coming to the ends of their lives, that these familiar tropes are re-emerging.
As these people leave us and their first-hand experiences are lost, the study of history becomes all the more important. In light of this depressing reality, the announcement by Minister for Education, Joe McHugh, that there is to be a review of the decision to remove history as a compulsory subject for the junior cert should be met with relief.
The decision to remove history as a compulsory subject was taken in order to introduce an increased element of choice, to what is otherwise a rather rigid system.
While this is undoubtedly a commendable goal, it fails to appreciate the reality faced by many schools across Ireland.
If they are to ensure that subjects remain available, and for principals to justify the continued employment of teachers to oversee the delivery of the subject, history must remain a popular choice among the general student body.
False Narratives
While one would hope that Irish students continue to retain an appreciation of the importance of history even if it were not compulsory and that it would remain popular enough to be a choice in every school in Ireland, the pitfalls of a major decline in students studying the subject are too severe to take such a risk.
In any nation, an absence of a coherent understanding of history can be dangerous. The 20th century alone is littered with examples of the destructive power that a dearth of education can have.
In the modern era, Brexit has become a painfully tangible manifestation of the enduring power of idealised versions of history to lead otherwise well-meaning and right-thinking people astray.
As a near neighbour and a former colonial territory, Ireland has had a front-row ticket to Britain’s inability to come to terms with its colonial past.
This struggle is illustrated by the eternal popularity among a large section of the British public of Jacob Rees Mogg, who recently saw fit to launch a defence of thewonderful achievementsof the British Empire.
Advertisement
Other commentators in Britain also indulge fanciful notions about the good aspects of colonialism, with some evendefending the British Raj on the grounds that it gave India a railway system.
Rees Mogg’s defence of the empire came in response to a suggestion by the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that students ought to be taught some of the ‘grave injustices’ perpetrated by the Empire.
Never mind the tabloid response to Corbyn, even the fact that he had to suggest they should change their history curriculum reveals that what the British are currently being taught in school must be far from balanced.
The fury exhibited by some at the suggestion that Ireland should have a veto over Brexit negotiations also demonstrates that many have a scant understanding of the complex political history that unites and divides our two nations.
This lack of historical education can easily be exploited by politicians who play upon people’s nostalgic memories of a Britain that never existed, they cloak their real intentions in Nationalist rhetoric and march their people down dark paths.
Indeed, Jacob Rees-Mogg himself, once jokingly described on Have I Got News For You as ‘the honourable member for the 18th century’, is the physical manifestation of that flawed recollection of the ‘glory days’ of the Empire.
Given such a woefully inadequate understanding of their own history, is it any surprise that a man doing his best impression of a colonial administrator was able to convince millions of his countrymen to wrest back control from a malevolent European elite?
Banishing history
History isn’t something that can be easily banished. It shapes social attitudes and foreign policy long after those involved are gone and wounds are healed. Nor is it forgotten by simply refusing to teach it.
Nowhere is this more evident than in Ireland, where oral history has always been so pivotal to our national story.
Family legends of grandfathers who were involved in skirmishes with British soldiers and heroic tales of local rebel leaders endure passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth.
By ensuring that children study history in school we contextualise these stories and paint them in a wider context. We stamp out myths, biases and inaccuracies and attempt to convey both side’s motives.
It is only through the continued education of our students in the nuanced challenges posed by history that we enshrine the health of our democracy.
If it is true that those who forget their history are condemned to repeat it, then perhaps Brexit is a cruel case study of what happens to those who never learned it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tories-no-deal-brexit-4423830-Jan2019/,"MORE THAN HALF of Conservative Party members would prefer a no-deal Brexit rather than the draft agreement reached by Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Union, according to a new opinion poll.
When given a three options, 57% of Tory party grassroots members said they would prefer a no-deal scenario, 23% would back May’s deal, 15% would prefer to remain in the EU and 5% had no preference.
If not presented with the remain option, over six in 10 (64%) members said they would opt for a no-deal scenario, while 29% would prefer the draft Withdrawal Agreement.
The poll was carried out by YouGov for the Party Members Project, which studies membership of the UK’s six biggest parties and is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
Its findings are not good news for May ahead of a crucial House of Commons vote on the deal later this month.
In December, Maypostponed a voteon the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the deal.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.

The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s minority government, believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, in case an agreement is not reached ahead of the official withdrawal date of 29 March.
‘Get your act together’
Earlier this week, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” in relation to Brexit.
Juncker told German newspaperWelt am Sonntagit is “entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems”.
“My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want…
“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and [British Prime Minister Theresa] Mrs May.
“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-10-downing-street-4339706-Nov2018/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Nov 2018
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that her Cabinet has collectively decided to back her Brexit deal – the essential next step in attempts to secure an agreement with the European Union and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.
The EU’s Michel Barnier said this evening that a solution has been found “to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland”.
He said that if both sides can’t decide on the next steps by July 2020, this backstop would kick in securing regulatory alignment between the North and the rest of the EU.
May’s problems are not over, however, with rebels within her own Conservative party threatening to mutiny over the deal and the DUP almost certain to reject it.
She was due to meet DUP leader Arlene Foster this evening.
May gave an address outside 10 Downing Street this afternoon after briefing her Cabinet on the Brexit deal agreed between British and EU negotiators in Brussels.
“This is a decisive step that should allow us to move on,” she said. “These decisions were not taken lightly.”
She said that the text of the Brexit deal that has been agreed between her government and the EU “delivers” on the result of the referendum and was the only choice when everything is stripped away.
“I know there will be difficult days ahead,” the Prime Minister said. “This is a decision that will come under intense scrutiny.”
May said she would address parliament on the 500-page text tomorrow.
She added: “I firmly believe – with my head and my heart – that this is a decision in the best interests of all the United Kingdom.”
A Brexit deal has been put on hold for weeks because the UK and EU couldn’t agree to a backstop that would both satisfy the UK’s aim to strike up free trade deals with non-EU countries, and the EU’s pledge to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The deal
Published this evening, the agreement will see the establishment of “ambitious customs arrangements that build on the single customs territory”.
Advertisement
The text recognises and affirms the Good Friday Agreement and that it “should be protected in all its parts”, and guarantees the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Until a future relationship is established a “single customs territory” between the EU and the UK will be in effect.
Essentially, the backstop agreed will maintain “full alignment with those rules of the [European] Union’s internal market and the customs union which… support North-South cooperation, all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement, to apply unless and until an alternative arrangement agreed”.
This backstop will apply “unless and until they are superseded, in whole or in part, by a subsequent agreement”.
Both sides want to get any future deal over the line by the end of 2020 but, until then, this backstop would take effect.
May has been briefing her ministers on the current deal to see if it has enough support to be put before the House of Commons for a vote.
The DUP leader Arlene Foster said she still hasn’t seen the draft text, but has warned there will be consequences from any announcement May made about the deal.
The party will be irate at the provisions of the deal, and this feeling will be shared by hard Brexiteers as the agreement keeps the UK tied to a backstop with the EU.
EU reaction
Speaking this evening, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that citizens’ rights had always been a common priority, and this agreement secures these rights.
“All of these people will be able to continue to live their lives as before – to live there, study there and to be joined by their families there throughout their lifetime,” he said.
Barnier added the agreement was a “decisive and crucial step”.
Last night, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee met with officials to assess the state-of-play ahead of this morning’s cabinet meeting to update government colleagues on developments.
The Taoiseach told the Dáil today that the Irish government was holding back on making any statements about the proposal until the UK government had decided how it viewed what was being suggested.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-summit-4290659-Oct2018/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May faces a Brexit showdown with frustrated EU leaders today with talks to agree an orderly break-up at an impasse.
This week’s summit in Brussels was billed as a “moment of truth” for negotiations on Britain’s exit from the bloc – but it seems so far the truth is that the two sides just cannot agree.
“I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse,” EU president Donald Tusk declared.
But May, hemmed in by opponents in her own party and even in her own cabinet, has no such proposals.
“The prime minister set out her position and where she thinks the negotiations are yesterday,” a Number 10 spokesman said yesterday.
Even the choreography of today’s summit opening emphasises British isolation.
May will meet one-on-one with Tusk at 5.45pm (3.45pm Irish time) before briefing her 27 European colleagues. But then the rest of the EU leaders will leave to discuss Brexit over dinner without her.
Tusk has made it clear that if May and EU negotiator Michel Barnier do not offer signs of concrete progress towards a draft deal he will not call a November summit to sign it.
Instead, the whole circus could either be pushed back to December or – more dramatically – the EU could use the November weekend to meet on preparations for a “no-deal” Brexit.
Previously, both sides had agreed that Britain crashing out of the Union on 29 March next year with neither a divorce agreement nor a road-map to future ties would be an economic and diplomatic disaster.
But, after Britain’s refusal to accept an indefinite legal “backstop” to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, doubts are mounting.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: “Of course people were hoping we would have a deal later this week. I and the Taoiseach were, I think, urging caution at the end of last week that it was going to be very difficult to get everything signed off this week.
‘No optimism’
Back in Brussels, a stern Tusk said he had “no grounds for optimism” based on a report yesterday from Barnier and May’s appearance in parliament on Monday.
The main disagreement between London and Brussels is over how to keep the Irish border open after Brexit, but May is also fighting with her own MPs, who must ultimately approve the final divorce deal.

At a three-hour cabinet meeting yesterday morning, which included ministers with reservations about her strategy, May said a deal was possible if they all stood together.
“I’m convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this,” she said, according to her spokesman.

Arriving in Luxembourg to brief EU ministers, Barnier said: “We need more time to find a comprehensive agreement.”
EU diplomats have said this morning that Barnier has opened the possibility of extending the one-year transition period in an effort to unblock stalled talks.
Barnier told European Affairs Ministers yesterday “that one of the options was to extend the transitional phase by one year (to 2021)” in order to gain more time to negotiate trade deal, EU diplomats told AFP.
Addressing the possibility of extending the transition period, Coveney told Morning Ireland: “Britain has already signed up for a transition period, in principle at least … as part of that it has been agreed the transition period would carry on until the end of 2020, which is nearly two years.
No deal plans
Addressing MPs in the House of Commons on Monday, May had said a deal was “achievable” while sticking to her principles on the Irish border issue.
But a senior European official said the speech had only underscored for Barnier the uphill struggle he faces to get an agreement.
To solve the Irish question, Britain has proposed staying aligned to the EU’s customs rules until a wider trade deal can be signed that avoids the need for any frontier checks.
But her own eurosceptic Conservative MPs are demanding this “backstop” arrangement be time-limited, something the EU will not accept.
May said the EU was also insisting on its own “backstop” in case the London proposal did not work, which would see Northern Ireland alone stay aligned to the customs union and single market.
She says this would threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom – and it is strongly opposed by her Northern Irish allies from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
Economists fear “no deal” Brexit would greatly disrupt trade, travel and manufacturers’ supply chains in Europe, push Britain into recession and even have global consequences.
Yesterday, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Jerome Powell warned that a “disorderly Brexit” would slow the EU economy as a whole and have a knock-on effect on US banks.

The largest vessel in her class and the biggest roll-on, roll-off ship in the world, Celine, will bring substantial business for Ireland, particularly in light of Brexit.
Celine is going to carry cargo between Dublin, the Netherlands and Belgium and is seen as major coup for the port.
The significance of the event wasn’t lost on the many high-flyers in the ship-building business who attended today’s launch.

There was a wine reception, followed by music and spoken word performances by John Sheahan of The Dubliners, Colm Mac Iomaire from The Frames, and Lisa Hannigan.
Against the backdrop of impressive footage of the ship setting sail, Irish ballads and song specially commissioned for the occasion echoed through the vast ship.

MV Celine represents the next generation of super ferries servicing Dublin Port.
The 235-metre long ship was constructed in South Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Shipyard, before being setting sail to the ports of Zeebrugge and Rotterdam.
The new ship would not have been able to call into Dublin Port without development works on three kilometres of berths.
On-hand for the formal naming ceremony today was Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who said Celine will “strengthen trade links to Ireland”.

In light of theTaoiseach’s commentson the UK’s solutions to the border problem, and his push for Prime Minister Theresa May to come up with some sort of workable solution or else face the prospect of no Brexit withdrawal agreement come June, contingency planning appeared to be on Varadkar’s mind.

In the shadow of the ship, Varadkar said that in the event that Brexit “goes wrong”, Ireland will need more trade links with Europe.
He added that large-scale investments in Ireland’s maritime business will “help future-proof” the country against hard Brexit customs posts in Dover port, which he said might cause significant delays.
“The more direct links we have to places like Spain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium are positive.”

Christian Cigrang, CEO, CLdN (the ship’s Luxembourg-based owners) said his company opened two routes from Dublin Port when Ireland was in the depths of a recession in 2015.
He said this decision was underpinned “by believe of the capacity of the Irish people to fight themselves out of their hole – a belief that was fully justified”.

Brexit is an external shock of a”totally different nature”.
Turning to the Taoiseach, Cigrang said he understood that Brexit is causing Varadkar “a lot of headaches”.
“Let me take one away from you. In terms of maritime success to and from Ireland, we have got this. With the combined acumen and skill between all the actors and logistics chain, we will rise to the challenge and handle whatever it throws at us. Shipping will provide for us – it always does,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/an-irishman-in-brexit-britain-the-amosphere-has-changed-since-the-vote-3915451-Mar2018/,"AS A YOUNG(ISH) Irish immigrant to Britain, I am struck by the progress in Anglo-Irish relations that have made since my father’s time as a labourer here in the 70s. But with the drive towards Brexit, I wonder if that is about to change.
Whatever old tensions might be flaring up thanks to the Brexit negotiations, booking an Irish Catholic comedian to perform at an Anglican Church Hall in rural Surrey is probably a pretty good indication that the Troubles are well and truly over.
Indeed, the likes of Terry Wogan and Dara O’Briain have done a good job rebranding the Irish as light entertainers rather than beardy terrorists from a disloyal backwater. Perhaps someday a Palestinian comedian will be booked to perform at a temple in Tel Aviv, cracking wise about a conflict so far in the past that the jokes seem almost like nostalgia.
The ‘c-word’
Nevertheless, when I took the booking I knew that performing twenty minutes of stand up to roughly one hundred well-heeled, middle-aged English villagers in their local hall might be a tough gig.
On the day, the promoter advised me that I could say whatever I wanted, but I couldn’t use the “c-word”. The “c-word” he was referring to was left ambiguous. Given the demographics of the audience it might well have been “Corbyn”.
On the surface the Irish and English countryside seem very similar, but it’s only when walking around do you notice the little differences between an English village and the Irish equivalent. It’s not just the absence of a GAA club or parish priest; the difference is defined by the institutions that replace them.
A different social fabric
Here well-equipped cottages with expensive cars parked outside lined a quiet country road, looping around a stunning Anglican church in the centre. While the green fields and fresh air reminded me of home, the village’s social fabric reminded me I was somewhere else, somewhere with a very different class structure to where I grew up.
The show, it turned out, was perfectly pleasant. Though upper class, these were the sorts who voted for Tony Blair’s New Labour in their early thirties, before switching to David Cameron’s sensible ‘conservatism with a small c’ when the credit crunch landed.
Advertisement
They seemed largely appalled at the race to the bottom the Tories are currently engaged with, with Brexit deriving most of its electoral support from working class heartlands in the North, more so than isolated bubbles of bourgeois like this.
Irish in Britain
As I got my train back to trendy East London, it occurred to me that my experience as an immigrant in this country has been markedly different from those who came in the past.
While the stereotype of the Irish immigrant in Britain is of a man wielding a shovel on a construction site, today the Irish coming to London are more likely to be working inside cosy office towers rather than building them. In a relatively short space of time we’ve gone from smashing stone on building sites to smashing avocados in airconditioned canteens.
My father worked as a labourer in Hackney in the 70s under a foreman who held the Irish with open contempt. Telling jokes to posh pensioners in a church hall is probably an easy gig by comparison.
Atmosphere has changed since Brexit vote
Nevertheless despite the progress made, no one can deny the atmosphere has changed since the Brexit vote. It’s a subtle thing rather than something drastic, like when a relationship with a partner slowly deteriorates over time instead of a singular antagonistic event.
No mass deportations or hard borders will be mobilised in the morning. Rather the Brexit process will ploddingly unfold one frustrating, demoralising day at a time. And even if the British decide to backtrack, like a lover who’s instigated a break up and realised they’ve made a mistake after facing the realities of single life, the damage has been done.
The message is clear. A majority of the English public see themselves as something separate, something apart from their European neighbours, and the extent to which this will effect Anglo-Irish relations is yet still to be determined.
Indeed, while the Irish immigrant experience has evolved and progress since my father’s generation, the country we find ourselves in seems determined to lurch backwards. And that is everyone’s loss.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-politicians-4336217-Dec2018/,"IT’S BEEN A long road to Brexit – one made even more trying by the inaccurate statements made by British politicians about Ireland, politics, and the border with Northern Ireland.
There’s a lot of things in the Brexit process that are up for debate:whether the backstop is needed and what exactly it entails, being just one. But some things we’re quite sure of – like that Leo Varadkar and the Sinn Féin party are most definitely not in cahoots.
And let’s be clear: we’re not expecting British politicians to know every aspect of Ireland’s history – or any other country’s history.
But if you’re going to try to offer a solution to the Irish border issue or comment on Irish politics with an ounce of authority, you should be informed on the issues.
Here are some of the gems we’ve had since the process began.
No one uses the Irish border
Empics EntertainmentEmpics Entertainment
While still in the role as British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson was recorded talking about Brexit and foreign affairs at a private gathering. The audio was obtained by Buzzfeed News, who then published it in an article on 8 June, detailing all the questionable things he’d said about a whole spectrum of nations.
Among his comments, were that the UK government’s concerns about customs arrangements post-Brexit was“pure millenium bug”stuff. On Northern Ireland, he added:
“So few” is obviously a subjective term, so we’ll give you the figures here and let you decide on whether they’re worthy of the UK government’s attention.
There are around 208 road border crossings between the Republic and Northern Ireland: at least 30,000 people cross the border everyday. Trucks in the drinks industry alone make 23,000 border crossings a year.
The farming community has been repeatedly described as an “all-island” economy, meaning firms have assets both north and south of the border, and would be wiped out, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Added to that are fears that young people in Donegal will have their options for accessing third level education limited if a hard border was put up, as many students live at home and commute to Derry to study at the University of Ulster.
Let’s go back to the Troubles
Empics EntertainmentEmpics Entertainment
Usually when the phrase “just like the Troubles” is used, it’s in the sense that we shouldn’t go back to that era.
But not with Jacob Rees Mogg. On 25 August,the Conservative MP for north-east Somerset saidthat we should replicate the custom posts, officers and police we had along the border during the Troubles after Brexit:
Speaking of loopholes, here’s a few in that suggestion. Not everyone would be checked, says Rees Mogg, so how would you decide who to check? By how they’re dressed, or the colour of their skin?
Boris Johnson suggested in the audio mentioned above that there would be a system like an Oyster card or a Leap card, where you tagged in and out to get across the border. But there are at least two big problems with that: that isn’t a frictionless border, it’s just friction-lite, and the second being one or Leap card can be used by anyone freely, as there’s no name or photo ID on them.

When a border first went up in Ireland in 1924, it only had customs checks. But extremists saw it as a symbol of UK occupation in Ireland, a symbol of division, and began targeting custom posts. This led to police protection, and armed guards at the border.

In November 2017, a few days before the backstop was first mentioned, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smithappeared on Channel 4 Newsand said that Ireland was being tough in Brexit negotiations because of the presidential election.
It was then pointed out that an election was now off the table due to political developments (Frances Fitzgerald had just resigned as Justice Minister of the scandal unearthed bty garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe).
Duncan Smith continued:
Unionists don’t actually vote for nationalist politicians

This one is a little different in that it’s an admission of ignorance, rather than an assertion that is later proved to be incorrect.
In an interview withThe House, Karen Bradley said that she hadn’t realised how elections were fought in Northern Ireland prior to her appointment, and that her understanding of the region was from 1990s.
She also said that she didn’t fully understand the political climate in the North. At the time of her appointment, the Stormont Assembly had been absent for over a year.
“I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland, people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.
English people get Irish passports

Speaking toStephen Nolan’s show in October this year, Andrew Bridgen showed that he didn’t understand the difference between the Common Travel Area and citizenship.
The Conservative MP (there’s a pattern here) got confused when trying to explain how they would ensure that Northern Ireland wouldn’t be treated differently to the rest of the UK, but also allow them to apply for Irish citizenship, which would be EU citizenship.
“That’s the Common Travel Area,” Bridgen said.
When asked if he thought he was entitled to an Irish passport because he is English, he said yes, and when asked where that right comes from, he answered the Common Travel Area.
Nolan said that there was still a lot to be done before MPs vote on a final Brexit deal. His guest on the same show Ulster Unionist Party’s Steve Aiken, replied:
“The level of knowledge among MPs about Northern Ireland is shockingly low. I have to spend a lot of time doing, and it’s very unfortunate, is briefing UK government civil servants who should be much more aware of what happens in Northern Ireland.”
Speaking at a Hibernian Law Journal lecture about the legal implications of Brexit, Professor of Human Rights Law in London School of Economics Conor Gearty said that there was a “tremendous civic duty” on the Irish living in the UK to “educate the English”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-cabinet-2-4251116-Sep2018/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is set to face her Cabinet colleagues for the first time today,after last week’s rejection of her Chequers plan from EU leaders.
The embattled Conservative leader is facing pressure on all sides as it approaches crunch time in Brexit talks, with the possibility for further resignations from her Cabinet following the summer departures of Boris Johnson and David Davis.
Brexiteers in her Cabinet are expected to urge her to ditch her Brexit blueprint in favour of a simpler deal similar to the EU’s deal with Canada.
Such a trade deal raises concerns that a hard border and customs posts would return in Northern Ireland and, while the UK government has always said there won’t be a hard border after Brexit, May said on Friday Britain will do “everything in our power” to prevent a hard border.
A defiant May said she would be sticking to her Chequers plan in that press conference, adding: “I will not overturn the result of the referendum, or break up my country.”
She said that although both sides want a deal, they were currently at an “impasse” and that there were “two main issues where we remain a long way apart”: the economic relationship after Brexit, and the EU’s proposal for the Brexit backstop in Northern Ireland.

EU Council President Donald Tusk has said that the Chequers plan cherry-picked elements of EU membership and isn’t acceptable.
Tusk and French President Emmanuel Macron said it would fragment the bloc’s single market and “not work”, and demanded she come back with an alternative by an EU summit in mid-October.
The bloc also raised the stakes by putting on ice a special summit planned for November to seal a deal, saying it would only happen if there is progress next month.
On Friday, May said the EU’s plan for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area, effectively the single market without any say in the rules, would “make a mockery” of the 2016 vote for Brexit.
Meanwhile the alternative offer of a free trade agreement was contingent on a “backstop” keeping British-ruled Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules, which she warned risked the integrity of the UK.
This was “something no British prime minister would ever agree to” she said, adding: “If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”
She repeated that she would bring forward alternative proposals to the backstop, which would come into effect until a new trade deal is struck.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said that 80% of Brexit issues have been agreed; Tánaiste Simon Coveney qualified this progress by saying that a lot of the remaining issues – including the Irish border issue – relate to Ireland.
May will face her wider party next week again at the Conservative party conference.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has urged France and Britain to find an “amicable” solution after fishermen from the two countries clashed in the English Channel over a hoard of scallops.
Brussels insisted however that it could not get involved in the fight as arrangements for trawling for the prized shellfish were made between individual countries, not at a European level.
“We saw the reports of incidents involving French and British fishermen off the coast of Normandy,” European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario told a daily briefing in Brussels.
“Scallop fishery is regulated at national level and over the past years common management measures have been agreed between France, the UK and Ireland,” the spokesman added.

“So it is in the interest first and foremost of the fishermen that this agreement is in place. And we invite the national authorities to resolve any dispute in an amicable way as has been done in the past.”
As a years-long dispute boiled over, five heavily outnumbered British scallop boats sailed into battle with around 35 French vessels in the incident yesterday
Fishermen from both sides hurled stones and insults at each other while some of the boats also rammed each other, according to video footage.

The skirmish took place more than 12 nautical miles out to sea where the British are legally allowed to fish all year round.
But their French counterparts, restricted to fishing for scallops between 1 October and 15 May, have accused the British of depleting stocks and want them to face the same rules.
The issue is doubly sensitive given the uncertain future of arrangements for fishing in the area after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, particularly if Britain crashes out without a withdrawal deal.

THE UK HAS spent more than £100 million on chartering ferries to mitigate the risk of “severe congestion” at the port of Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to government documents.
The government has struck deals worth £107.7 million (€117 million) with British, French and Danish ferry companies that would allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to use other ports on England’s south coast to prevent a bottleneck at Dover, it added.
“This significant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s (DfT) no-deal Brexit planning,” said a spokesman for the department.
The DfT has signed contracts with French firm Brittany Ferries, Danish company DFDS and Britain’s Seaborne, saying the awards were “a small but important element” of its no-deal planning.
The additional services will provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity, which the government hopes will mitigate the extra time needed to perform customs checks on incoming and outgoing freight.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable called the move “complete madness”.
“The government has the power to stop ‘no deal’ at any time but instead is spending millions on last minute contracts,” he said.
The department also warned that increased border checks could “cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed”, and “significant wider disruption to the UK economy”.
British Prime Minister Theresa May secured an agreement with European Union leaders on 25 November that would see the UK leave the bloc on 29 March with continued close trade ties, but the odds look stacked against her getting it through a deeply divided British parliament.
The deal has been criticised from among May’s Conservative lawmakers by supporters of a cleaner break with the EU and those who want to keep closer ties.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-dup-brexit-4358544-Nov2018/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS said the UK is “on the verge of making a historic mistake” if it backs the draft Brexit agreement.
Speaking at the Democratic Unionist Party’s annual conference in Belfast today, the former British Foreign Secretary said the backstop would lead to the UK becoming a satellite state.
“Unless we junk this backstop, we are going to find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us: a satellite state,” Johnsontold the conference.
“In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road,” he said.
The pro-Brexit MP resigned from Theresa May’s Cabinet in July over her Brexit strategy.
He told the conference the EU had made Northern Ireland an “indispensable bargaining chip” in the Brexit negotiations. He said the DUP and Conservatives should work together, “backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us”.
At the same conference, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the backstop is “not in the national interest”.
The backstopaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republican and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.

The DUP has criticised the plan as the party believes it threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
‘A bit of an understatement’
In her speech, Foster recalled how she told a DUP conference two years ago that Brexit negotiations would be “tough”, adding: “That seems like a bit of an understatement now.”
Foster acknowledged May’s “hard work and determined efforts” to secure the Brexit deal, however she said the draft agreement “fails [May's] own key commitments”.
“In such circumstances, Northern Ireland alone would be aligned to numerous EU single market regulations while Great Britain would not. Such a scenario in the medium term would inevitably lead to barriers to trade within the UK internal market.
“Let me be very clear, that is not in the national interest,” Foster stated.
She said the DUP, which is propping up May’s minority government, will not back the deal as it stands.
The leaders of 27 EU member states aremeeting tomorrowto decide if they’ll endorse the draft Brexit deal.
The UK Parliament is yet to vote on the agreement. If the House of Commons approves it, it would then go before the European Parliament to be ratified.
The Dáilbacked the deal, a symbolic rather than binding gesture, during the week.

PRINCE HARRY, PRESUMABLY, has no overarching interest in meteorology.
Nevertheless, the recently-minted Duke of Sussex may have been exposed to several hundred conversations about the weather during his brief Irish sojourn.
Harry and the duchess formerly known as Meghan Markle are jetting home this evening after a little over 24 hours in Dublin.
The visit, their first official diplomatic engagement since they tied the knot back in May, took place at the request of the UK government and comes, of course, against a backdrop of uncertainty and concern over Brexit.
Their exercise in soft diplomacy essentially amounted to a custom version of a ‘highlights of Dublin’ city break trip as they took in sights like the Book of Kells, the Phoenix Park and the GAA Museum at Croke Park – engaging in small talk with half the city along the way.
The Prince and the Taoiseach discussed the scorched grass of Government Buildings and the ongoing drought ahead of their one-on-one meeting last night, for instance.
And this afternoon the weather was still a favourite topic at Trinity College, where a crowd turned out for the first main public event of the whistle-stop royal visit.
“You must have brought the weather with you,” one well-wisher observed, in the aftermath of a brief rain shower. A Trinity staff member who met the couple said they had also briefly discussed the recent dry spell.
Around a thousand people gathered at Trinity – some from as early as 9am – to try and catch a glimpse of the couple, including a large number of tourists and college staff. There were some hardcore royalwatchers amongst them – and plenty of locals who said they had just showed up out of curiosity.
Two German tourists who spoke toTheJournal.ie said they had no idea there were VIP guests in town and that they had only wanted to visit the library. The famous Trinity library was closed to the public for the duration of the visit. The Germans said that, on balance, they would have preferred if the royals weren’t here and the library was open.
BBC News/ YouTube
How about that England?
And if there’s nothing else to say about the weather, there’s always the sport, of course.

Newstalk reporter Henry McKean livened up proceedings considerably at the Áras reception this morning when he broke with protocol to yell a quick “is football coming home?” at Harry.
“Most definitely,” came the response.
The small talk, of course, is an occupational hazard of being a royal… Everywhere you go, well-wishers are falling over themselves to say hello … but … nobody really knows each other, and what is there to say really?
Harry had a slightly more serious message to deliver last night – tasked, as he was, with following in the diplomatic tradition set down by his grandmother and his father, Prince Charles, in recent years.
The Queen’s visit in 2011, when she remarked that there were some things in the history of the two nations that could have been done “differently or not at all” was regarded at the time to have marked a significant maturing of Anglo-Irish relations.
Michael D Higgins remarked on his reciprocal State visit to Britain in 2014 that: “We live in each other’s shadows; we shield each other, and rely on each other for shelter.”
Speaking to invited guests at the British Ambassador’s residence, Harry remarked that that sentiment was “as apt now as it was then, as we draw strength from one another as neighbours, partners and above all friends”.

Spectators who met them at Trinity College said the pair had acted as perfect ambassadors.
It’s a testament to the couple’s people skills that they managed to appear genuinely interested throughout a packed day of meticulously choreographed events.
“Have you taken a ball in the face – or have you put a ball in some else’s face?” Harry joked to a young Cork GAA player at Croke Park this morning – following it up with a more serious: “Is this the first time you’ve played on this grass? What does it mean to you?”
Diplomatic value aside, the photos and video clips of the royal pair will provide a massive boost to tourism too in the coming months.
In the wake of the intense interest in their wedding, the couple are global celebrities. Fáilte Ireland boss Paul Kelly said the visit would be of particular benefit to their efforts in the UK market where Brexit has been making things more than a little challenging.
The visit, he said, was “hugely positive” for Dublin and Ireland.
Of course, you may have another view if your bike happened toforcibly detached from its parking spottoday in the interests of removing potential hazards from the paths of the visiting VIPs.

ICONIC INDIAN-OWNED British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover today became the latest company to warn that new trade barriers with Europe could imperil thousands of jobs and billions in investment, as the government headed into a high-stakes meeting to decide the fate of Brexit.
A day before Prime Minister Theresa May convenes her warring cabinet to thrash out a common approach, aides said she had drawn up a compromise customs plan to ease trade with the European Union after Brexit takes effect in March 2019.
But the plan immediately ran into trouble, with Brexit Secretary David Davis reportedly telling May the proposal was “unworkable” and would not be accepted by Brussels.
With the government at loggerheads and the EU looking on anxiously, Airbus, BMW and Siemens have also warned in recent weeks that they could yank investment out of Britain unless any Brexit deal ensures cross-Channel trade continues to flow freely.
The chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, said its “heart and soul was in the UK”.
“However, we, and our partners in the supply chain, face an unpredictable future if the Brexit negotiations do not maintain free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market,” Ralf Speth said in a statement.

Ever since Britain voted in a June 2016 referendum to quit the EU, the government has been grappling with the intractable problem of what kind of Brexit to deliver.
May had vowed a clean break by quitting the EU’s customs union and single market, which have bound Britain to rules set in Brussels.
While such a drastic break would free Britain to build its own trading regime, it risks severe disruption to business and is opposed by many lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party.
Details of May’s new so-called “facilitated customs arrangement” were still lacking, but it takes elements from two existing customs plans — both of which have been rejected by Brussels.
And while opposition lawmakers seized on the Jaguar warning to underline the risks of uncertainty for British jobs, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was determined to ensure JLR can continue to invest.
For its part, the British Retail Consortium noted that fully half of Britain’s food is imported, mostly from the EU, and those supplies rely on intricate and fragile trading links.
Failure to reach a Brexit deal would have dramatic consequences for UK consumers as well as EU producers, it wrote in a letter to May and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
“It is likely that we will see food rotting at ports, reducing the choice and quality of what is available to consumers,” the BRC said, calling for no new barriers and flexibility from the EU during a transition period.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-border-cost-eu-4081890-Jun2018/,"THE EUROPEAN UNION has been working on estimations for what different types of borders for the island of Ireland could cost,TheJournal.ieunderstands.
Preparations are underway for a number of scenarios that could have been caused by Brexit, including a ‘Norway plus model’ border and a ‘no deal’ scenario, which would mean a hard border would automatically go up on the island of Ireland.
A “Norway plus model” would involve infrastructure on the border but would use technology to ensure that it wouldn’t disrupt the movement of people. A no deal or hard border scenario would likely involve checkpoints and border police.
Although officials from Ireland and the EU don’t like speculating on the likelihood of a no deal scenario, one official said that the chances of it happening “are not zero”.
When asked about whether the Irish government had estimations on how much an Irish border would cost, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs said:
“In December’s joint report of EU and UK negotiators, the UK gave a guarantee that a hard border, including any physical infrastructure and associated checks and controls, will be avoided.

It’s been a tense few months for those involved in Brexit talks; May’s team has yet to put forward a practical solution that would allow the UK to leave the single market and the customs union, but would avoid an Irish border. So far, the two suggestions put forward have been dismissed by Europe as unworkable.
One of those suggestions was thattechnology could be usedto track the goods that cross the border; UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonrecently citedpeople’s ability to tag Oyster cards on and off at train stations as ways of tracking people’s movements. But the EU has said that technology hasn’t yet been invented to track goods and products.
Last week Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that 12 Revenue staff “are dedicated to Brexit work full-time”; included in this is examining the range of scenarios that Brexit could produce and updating its IT systems.
But more detailed information on what Irish border Brexit preparations are being done is being closely guarded by officials due to sensitivities in Brexit negotiations.
This is crucial timing in those talks – the two sides have until October before they’re scheduled to vote on the final Brexit deal. Of all the issues that need to be debated, around three-quarters have been agreed upon – but the final issues are considered to be the ones most difficult to overcome.
The trade arrangement between the EU and the UK must also be finalised after it officially leaves in March 2019.
Tomorrow the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Junker will visit Dublin to discuss Brexit with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of next week’s European Council summit. He will be accompanied byPhil Hogan, EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s Chief Negotiator for Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/britain-eu-crunch-talks-brexit-4245225-Sep2018/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has clashed with EU leaders over who should make the next move to break the Brexit logjam, as the clock ticks down to get a deal.
EU Council President Donald Tusk opened a crucial summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg with a stark warning that Britain’s position on key issues must be “reworked”.
He warned negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union were reaching a “decisive phase”, amid fears that it could crash out in March next year without a deal.
While welcoming the “positive evolution” of Britain’s position on security ties, Tusk said that on the Irish border and post-Brexit trading relations, “the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated”.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who hosted the Salzburg summit, added that the EU was “ready to compromise but we also expect that from the UK”, calling for May to offer a “step forward”.
But as she arrived for the summit, May said that Brussels must also give ground.
“If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too,” she said.
She added: “I am confident that with goodwill and determination we can agree a deal that is right for both parties.”
The prime minister will deliver her message to the other EU leaders in person over dinner, before they meet without her tomorrow to discuss the next steps.
‘Hard border’
Officials on both sides of the Channel hope Salzburg will give new impetus to divorce negotiations ahead of a crunch summit in Brussels on 18 October.
That was originally viewed as the deadline for a deal, but Tusk is planning a last-gasp gathering in mid-November.
A key sticking point in the talks is how to avoid a “hard border” between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic when London leaves the EU single market and customs union.
There are fears that frontier checks would disrupt trade and could undermine the 1998 peace deal on the island.
Advertisement
But Europe is insisting on a fall-back plan, a “backstop”, that would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union under EU rules while a future trade relationship is negotiated.
London sees this as a threat to its sovereignty and refuses to countenance a de facto Irish Sea frontier.
Europe’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier this week indicated a shift in his position, saying any checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK could be away from the border.
May welcomed his recognition of “the need to find a new solution, because the original proposal put forward by the European Commission was unacceptable”.
She conceded that some checks were already carried out in the Irish Sea, for example on agricultural products.
May’s parliamentary majority depends on support from Northern Ireland loyalists bitterly opposed to any weakening of links with the UK.
Future ties
Despite continued hopes of a deal, both sides are also preparing for the possibility that Britain stumbles into a chaotic and damaging break-up.
Kurz said that failing to reach a deal “would be difficult for Europe but it would be terrible for the UK”.
Officials say that 80% of the divorce settlement is agreed, but that progress must be made quickly on Ireland and on the parallel political statement that will lay out a blueprint for future relations.
London wants a detailed outline of future trade ties in exchange for paying billions of euros the EU says it is owed in dues.
Brussels appears ready to fudge a plan to at least get the UK departure from the bloc out of the way, although this may not be acceptable to May’s restive MPs at home.
One EU diplomat told AFP that leaders in Salzburg wanted to give May something to take back home, ahead of a meeting of her fractious Conservative party next month.
They realise May is the only one who can seal a deal on Brexit and they do not want her to “go belly up”, the diplomat said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-extending-transition-period-northern-ireland-4290393-Oct2018/,"THE EU’S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR Michel Barnier is open to extending the Brexit transition period by a year in exchange for assurances on the backstop for Northern Ireland, according tothe Financial Times.
On the eve of a crucial EU Council Summit, EU diplomats told the FT that Barnier is willing to extend the transition period from 21 months, ending in December 2020 to a year later.
The reason for offering such an extension would be to ensure that a “two tier backstop” is in place as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement: this would mean a backstop for the UK where they would be part ofacustoms union, and a backstop for Northern Ireland where they would remain intheCustoms Union and Single Market.

Barnier said earlier today, on the record, that there isn’t enough time left to strike a deal; EU Council President Donald Tusk said that he “has no grounds for optimism” about tomorrow’s summit.
There’s currently a deadlock in Brexit talks over the backstop – a plan B to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. Although all sides want to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, neither side has suggested an agreement that could achieve this without compromising the integrity of either the EU or the UK.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” – meaning that if the backstop isn’t specified, then all agreements up until now amount to nothing.
She’s also said that any arrangement that “carves off” Northern Ireland from Great Britain would be unacceptable to the UK government. The DUP are supporting the Tories minority government since June 2017 when May called a snap election and lost her majority.
If the UK go crashing out of the EU, that would most likely mean the return to custom posts and a hard border in Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-rejoining-the-commonwealth-4174082-Aug2018/,"Sinn Féin party leader Mary Lou McDonaldPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
MARY LOU MCDONALD has said she is open to discussions on Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth.
In an interview withTheJournal.ie, the Sinn Féin leader said there must be an open debate in order to encourage unionists to participate in a discussion about a united Ireland.
McDonald said she cannot call for an openness, and then censor voices before the debate has begun.
“You can hardly make that call and then say ‘we are not going to discuss any particular item’. And there are some people who think that rejoining the Commonwealth is a worthy proposition.
“I think those that hold that view need to put that view forward, and I think it needs to be looked at, and debated, and it needs to be discussed.
“It is not a proposition that I would be advancing – but I am me. This is not all about Sinn Féin. This is much bigger than us. The debate has to have the capacity to put everything on the table and then the business of debate and discussion in a reflective way, not a divisive way,” she said.
The idea of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth has been floated by a number of politicians, such asFine Gael Senator Frank Feighanwho argues that it would promote Ireland’s values to a global audience, while strengthening and growing important economic and cultural ties internationally.
United Ireland
McDonald also said the Irish government needs to take the lead in the debate about a united Ireland and start making plans about how it might be achieved.
“I am firmly of the view that we are now on the way to a unity referendum. I think the genie is out of the bottle. I think the discussion around a new Ireland, how we might get there, and what it might look like is already underway.”
She said she is “conscious that Brexit is a very bad thing for Ireland”, adding that “for us to have a debate around the new Ireland and to have a referendum poll, obviously a chaotic Brexit is not the ideal music for that to happen”.
However, she added that she in no way thinks Brexit means a border poll should be put on the back-burner.
I am not arguing for a delay. I am an Irish republican, I am the leader of Sinn Fein, I want us to achieve Irish unity and I want us to do it as soon as we can and I know for that to happen we need space and the best atmosphere we can have in which to have that debate.

But, if the Tories insist on crashing out of Europe, and take the north of Ireland out of the European Union “in chaotic manner”, then the next question to be asked is the Constitutional one, said McDonald.
A border poll
Last week, she said “the time for a unity referendum is drawing near ”. This comment came justdays after an interviewwhere she commented that a “crash Brexit” would not be the time to look at a border poll or a united Ireland.
“The Constitutional question [of a border poll on a united Ireland] would have to be put – there is no way the Tories could inflict that level of disorder, of uncertainty, and damage on the island of Ireland and imagine that they are not going to put the Constitutional question.
“But it does not represent the optimal atmosphere in which to have the discussion and debate, so that was the point I was making,” said the Dublin Central TD.
Sinn Féin have already set out a five-year timeframe for when they believe a border poll should be held, but McDonald said she, nor anyone else, is in a position to guess the exact date.
Before a border poll takes place, detailed plans and discussions need to be organised, something the Irish government must act on now, said the party leader.
The government in Dublin have a particular responsibility for that. We have argued for a long time that there ought to be an Oireachtas committee on Irish unity, that we need to see a green paper on Irish unity. The time for planning and really putting the ideas on that table is now and the government here needs to lead on that.
Her comments come just a few short weeks after the former leader of the DUP Peter Robinson said he believed Northern Ireland should prepare for the possibility of Irish unity, though he said he did not think Northern Ireland will want to leave.
The voices of unionism
McDonald said it is “very important that unionism finds its space, finds its voice and follows the advice of Peter Robinson and takes its head out of the sand”.
Unionism needs to set out “their wishes, their ideas, their ambitions – all of that needs to get underway”, she added.
McDonald denied some of the comments made by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil politicians that a border poll would be divisive.
“The change is in the air, and coming this way, it cannot be ignored, it can’t be denied, it can’t be delayed, in my view. I have heard a lot of people say that the poll on unity would be divisive, it would be dangerous, it is one of these issues that is ‘too hot to handle’. I don’t accept that,” said the party leader, adding that she believes the debate will be “liberating” and  “invigorating”.
“We have to ask, in the national interest, in the interest of people right across the country, what is the next move and the next move post-Brexit is to re-fashion Ireland on a 32 county basis.
“It is big challenge, it is a huge job of work, it is a job for all of us.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/sir-john-major-brexit-4387816-Dec2018/,"FORMER UK PRIME Minister John Major has called for London to revoke Article 50 as a matter of urgency.
Speaking at an event in Dublin this morning, he said it was time for British politicians to turn to “reality and not fiction”.
Remarking on Theresa May’s decision to call off today’s ‘meaningful’ vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons, Major said:
Politicians, he urged, need to protect the economic wellbeing of the British people
“We now need to revoke Article 50 with immediate effect,” Major said. The clock must be stopped, he said, “we need time”.
The UK, he said, will find a way through the present morass.
May is to visit Germany’s Angela Merkel today as she works to salvage her Brexit deal.

Earlier this week, she dismissed the idea of abandoning Brexit after the European Court of Justice ruled that the Article 50 process could be stopped without the UK seeking approval from Brussels.
The court’s ruling fueled calls for a second referendum on Brexit. But May said that halting Article 50 would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave in 2016 and would mean  “going back on the vote of the referendum and remaining in the EU”.

Major, who led the mid-90s Conservative government, is in Ireland for a series of events marking the 25th anniversary of the Downing Street Declaration – one of the landmark agreements of the peace process which helped pave the way for the Good Friday Agreement five years later.
Building on the progress of talks between Gerry Adams and John Hume,the 1993 agreement between Major and then-Taoiseach Albert Reynoldssignalled that republicans and loyalists could attend talks on the future of of the North if paramilitaries handed over their arms.
Speaking at the inaugural Albert Reynolds Memorial lecture in Co Longford yesterday, Major said there had been ”breathtaking ignorance” from unionists who opposed the Brexit backstop.

Answering questions from the audience at this morning’s event at the Westin Hotel, he said we should not forget the murders of customs officials at the border in the early days of the Troubles.
The hard-won peace in the North shouldn’t be taken for granted, he said – adding that he was yet to meet anyone who lived in the border region who was not perturbed by the prospect of a reimposition of a hard border.

There are figures within loyalism and republicanism who would be only too willing to exploit the target of a border infrastructure, he warned.
Major said it was a risk “that should not be taken”.
Asked whether he thought a united Ireland was now more likely to happen and whether it would give him grief if Northern Ireland left the UK, he said “of course it would give me grief”.
“You cannot do that sort of thing without broad consent,” he said – stressing that harmony north and south and free-flowing trade were the most important priorities for the island.
We field north-south teams in rugby and cricket, Major says. To laughs, he adds, ""although in cricket if they're very good players we steal them"". It is an ancient tradition, he says... If they are good then they are English. Much lols (as these things go) here at Westin.— Daragh Brophy (@DaraghBroph)December 11, 2018Daragh Brophy/ Twitter

Asked if he thought Brexit was irrevocable and if he envisaged the UK might now instead remain in the EU he said that in the present situation “I don’t think anything is impossible”.
He said he thought the remain outcome could only come about if there was a second referendum and people voted conclusively to stay in the EU.
As other options fall by the wayside it becomes more possible, he said – but that doesn’t mean it’s likely. “It’s certainly not impossible,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/stockpiling-food-brexit-4157700-Aug2018/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has ruled out the need for Ireland to stockpile food in the case of a hard Brexit.
During the week, Varadkar admitted thatIreland will stockpile medicinesin the coming months over concerns that supplies could dwindle in the event of a crash-out Brexit.
On Monday, the British Sandwich Association warned that there could be problemsgetting ingredients like tomatoes and lettuceinto the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
However, while the Irish government are assessing other items, food stockpiling will not be necessary, said the Taoiseach.
“We don’t think food is going to be an issue though,” added the Taoiseach.
“The other is around oil reserves. Under European law you have to hold a certain amount of your oil reserves in other EU countries. This is all in one of the documents we produced after Derrynane. For example if that was held in the UK it would no longer be in the European Union, so there’s lot of things like that.”

Ireland can be flexible
Elaborating on Brexit issues with reporters yesterday, he said the Irish government could be “flexible” on the backstop.
The backstop, which was a bone of contention, but ultimately agreed between the EU and UK last December, provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic of Ireland and the North if there was a hard Brexit and is a last resort option to avoid customs checks and a border.
“When it comes to the backstop, our position has always been what matters is not the detailed legal text, it’s the outcome, and so what we want the backstop to achieve is a guarantee that there won’t be a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” said the Taoiseach.
“I know the UK will say that can be achieved through the future relationship [between the UK and the EU], but it could take years to negotiate that future relationship treaty and we don’t know for sure if that future relationship treaty will be ratified because it is likely to be a mixed treaty and any one country in Europe could potentially hold it up by not ratifying it,” he said.
Northern Ireland
On the issue of the political stalemate in Northern Ireland, Varadkar said if clarity around Brexit is provided in October, he believes there is an opportunity for the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive to be up and running by the end of the year.
When asked about the issue of a border poll – something Sinn Féin has been criticised of pushing out this week – Varadkar said it is definitely not the time for one.
While he said some believe it could be a close result, having a border poll now would be “divisive and unsuccessful” in his view, particularly in the current context of Brexit and the fact no political institutions are working in the North.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-richmond-4226562-Sep2018/,"FINE GAEL SENATOR Neale Richmond today revealed that the number of British people becoming Irish citizens has grown exponentially in the last year.
Figures obtained by the senator showed how 529 British people became Irish citizens in the last year.
Richmond said that the result of the Brexit referendum is the only obvious reason behind the big increase.
He said: “Already we’ve seen a massive increase in applications for passports by eligible citizens living in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.

“Now, figures released to me by the Department of Justice have shown that increasingly British nationals living here, who don’t qualify for a passport through lineage, are applying for Irish citizenship.
“In 2014 just 51 UK citizens became naturalised Irish citizens. In 2015 this increased marginally to 54 before nearly doubling to 98 in 2016, the year of the Brexit vote.
“However, the number of British nationals becoming naturalised Irish citizens in 2017 has jumped massively to 529.
“Such a spike is clearly tied to the Brexit referendum and the uncertainty that has prevailed since the vote.
“There over 300,000 British nationals living in the state and it is estimated that about a third of these would not qualify for an Irish passport through lineage.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/bank-of-england-warns-pound-could-crash-and-economy-shrink-under-no-deal-brexit-4365517-Nov2018/,"THE BANK OF England has warned that a no-deal Brexit would trigger a financial crisis in Britain and that the pound could plunge by 25%.
Speaking today, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that- in the event of no transition period between the UK leaving the EU – Gross Domestic Product could shrink by 8% and that unemployment could nearly double, while house prices could fall by almost a third.
A recession on that scale would be Britain’s deepest in modern history and far beyond the one experienced after the global financial crisis a decade ago, the bank has said, under its forecast for a “disorderly Brexit.”
The bank assumed a number of worst-case scenarios in its prediction, including the imposition of tariffs and other barriers to trade on all trade with the EU.

The Bank’s analysis comes after Chancellor Phillip Hammond said that the UK will be worse off after leaving the EU than if it had stayed in – regardless of what sort of trade deal it manages to strike.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is currently on a national tour around Britain in an attempt to drum up enthusiasm for the Brexit deal she reached with EU leaders on Sunday.
May crowned 17 months of talks with Brussels by sealing Brexit arrangements with the 27 other EU heads of state and government.
The European Council agreed with the progress made so far in the 500-page Brexit deal – which includes specific provisions to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland – and also endorsed a 26-page document on the future relationship.
May has repeatedly said that the deal on the table from the EU is the best deal available for Britain. But it has been met with fierce opposition in the UK, both from her own party and opposition figures.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-government-house-of-lords-hard-border-brexit-3991364-May2018/,"THE UK’S HOUSE of Lords has voted to give parliament powers to reject any Brexit deal that would include a hard border in Ireland, in another significant blow to Prime Minister Theresa May’s government.
The vote in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill was passed 309 votes for and 242 against – the 10th defeat for the government on the significant Brexit bill.
The amendment would prevent the UK government agreeing to a Brexit that could be interpreted as threatening the Good Friday Agreement.
The Guardianreports that senior Conservative Chris Patten said Brexiteers in his party are “playing with fire” and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland “that is sometimes clueless”.
Liberal Democrat leader in the upper house Lord Newby said:
Speaking in the House of Commons earlier today, May repeated that Britain wanted to develop its own independent trade policy and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

These two things clash, however: the first requires leaving the customs union meaning custom checks would be needed between Ireland and the North; and the second would mean any physical infrastructure is ruled out.
She said that she wanted to ensure as frictionless trade as possible with the rest of the bloc, without outlining how this could be possible – something for which she has been criticised for repeatedly by EU representatives and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
She did reveal today that there were “a number of ways in which that could be delivered”, with her spokesman adding:
“Work has been ongoing on two options. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along.”
But Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group of up to 60 Conservative MPs, said one of the proposed options was “deeply unsatisfactory”.
Earlier today, Leo Varadkar told the Dáil that there was a risk that the EU and UK wouldn’t strike a deal by October.
He added that the “sands were still shifting” but that a lot of progress still needed to be made before the UK officially leaves the EU next year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/impact-of-brexit-on-smes-4151748-Jul2018/,"CONCERNS HAVE BEEN raised about how difficult it is for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to avail of a scheme that aims to minimise the impact Brexit will have on businesses in Ireland.
To date just 10 SMEs have secured funding from the Brexit Loan Scheme.
The figures were released to Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Maurice Quinlivan, in response to a parliamentary question.
“These loans total just €2.49 million, less than 1% of the total value of the €300 million scheme, a shockingly low figure,” Quinlivan said.
“Since the Brexit Loan Scheme was launched back in March, just 151 applications have been received. With less than 7% of these actually obtaining funding, it indicates that this scheme is of little to no use to the vast majority of SMEs in Ireland,” he added.
Neil McDonnell, Chief Executive of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association (ISME), said the scheme is “simply too difficult for the majority of SMEs to avail of”.
He said the conditions relating to research and development are particularly difficult for SMEs to achieve. As setout here, at least 80% of the loan received must be spent on “research and innovation activities with the remainder on costs necessary to enable such activities”.
McDonnell said some businesses are also put off by the “burdensome” application process.
“While the rates at which the funding is provided are attractive, many businesses which simply needed further working capital to tackle Brexit issues would likely be unwilling to commit this level of time to the application process,” he toldTheJournal.ie.
‘State of chaos’
Quinlivan said the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation needs to “examine whether excessive red tape or unreasonably strict criteria is preventing SMEs from accessing” this and other similar schemes.
“With the Brexit negotiations remaining in a state of chaos, and the possibility of a hard Brexit increasing, Irish SMEs exposed to the effects of Brexit need to avail of these supports now, to ensure they are insulated as much as possible for all potential outcomes,” he stated.

When asked about the Brexit Loan Scheme in the Dáil recently, Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said it “provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be Brexit impacted and meet the scheme criteria”.
She said €23 million in Exchequer funding – €14 million from her Department and €9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine – has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to €300 million.
“The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme,” Humphries said.
She added that the application process “requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form”.
Applicants must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.
Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers – Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.
‘Satisfied’
“The Department is pleased to say there has been a steady stream of applications and are satisfied with the uptake to date,” a spokesperson told us.
They noted that 132 of the 151 applications received as of 30 June have been deemed eligible for a loan under the scheme and, of those, 10 have been progressed to receive funding.
The spokesperson said that, while Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have participated since the scheme’s launch, AIB has only been open for applications since 25 June.
“As a result, there may be businesses that have been deemed eligible, but which are still engaged in the application process with their respective banks.”
The spokesperson said the SBCI has been “actively promoting” the Brexit Loan Scheme at various events, as well as through a media campaign.
They added that the scheme is “only one of a wide range of State supports on offer to businesses to prepare for Brexit”, stating: “In the first six months of this year alone, 43% of the most exposed firms backed by Enterprise Ireland received grant-aid.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-eu-turn-brexit-3972742-Apr2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May could have to row back on her earlier statement that the UK would leave the customs union after Brexit.
UK media (including theGuardian, Independent and Times) are reporting that May could face a cabinet revolt over her comments affirming that they would leave the EU trade arrangement and wouldn’t join a similar one.
Although that stance has been consistent from most Brexiteers, that government position suffered a blow in the House of Lords on Wednesday, putting the government strategy in the spotlight.
On Fridaythe Daily Telegraph reportedthat the European Union has roundly rejected proposals from the British government for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.
In one meeting attended by Oliver Robbins, May’s chief Brexit negotiator, government officials predicted that while some Cabinet Brexiteers such as the Environment Secretary Michael Gove and the Brexit Secretary David Davis would accept an about-turn, Johnson and Fox would likely quit.
Johnson has previously said that staying in a customs union would be “worse” than remaining in the EU.
Leaving the EU’s single market and customs union are cornerstones of Britain’s Brexit plan, designed to ensure an end to unlimited EU migration and give London the power to sign its own international trade deals.

But there are growing concerns about the impact of cutting ties with Britain’s largest trading partner, and the possible risk to peace in Northern Ireland by introducing an Irish border in the event of a ‘hard’ Brexit.
Yesterday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin said that the future of the North was “being decided in Brexit negotiations”.
“Reports show a complete lack of progress and a rising belief that there is no breakthrough likely in the coming months,” he said.
What was voted on
An amendment to a key piece of Brexit legislation, requiring ministers to explain the steps taken to negotiate Britain’s continued participation in a customs union with Brussels, was passed in the unelected chamber.
Lords voted by 348 to 225 in favour of the amendment, one of several defeats the chamber is expected to inflict on the government in the coming weeks as they debate the EU Withdrawal Bill.
The EU Withdrawal Bill debate will inform the biggest battle over Brexit, expected in October or November, when lawmakers vote on the final deal negotiated with Brussels.
Lawmakers will have to decide whether to back the government or reject the agreement — with the risk that Britain could crash out of the EU next year without any deal in place.

https://www.thejournal.ie/meaningful-vote-explainer-4381293-Dec2018/,"THIS TUESDAY, THE 11 December, MPs will vote on whether they approve of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, in what’s being called “the meaningful vote”.
MPs voted in favour of the House of Commons having a final say on the Brexit deal negotiated between the EU and the UK over the past two years.
After Theresa May struck a Brexit deal with the EU, and getting the approval of her Cabinet ministers (somehow), it was decided that the meaningful vote should be held on 11 December at around 7pm.
Ahead of the vote, Theresa May has travelled around the country to try to rally public support for her deal – possibly in the hope that this would put pressure on MPs to vote for the Brexit deal. There have also been five days of debates in the House of Commons on whether the Brexit deal should pass or not.
Right now, it doesn’t look likely that the deal will pass. Some British newspapers reported yesterday that the deal would be defeated by as many as 100 votes.
It took the European Council, which is headed by Donald Tusk and comprises of all EU 27 member states’ leaders, just 38 minutes to approve the deal last month.
There was also talk of delaying the vote to allow Theresa May the time to explain how the UK could leave the Irish backstop under the current deal.

Why is the deal so disliked?
The deal struck between the EU and UK pleases neither side of the Brexit debate.
On one hand, it suggests that the UK leaves the Single Market to allow the UK to limit the freedom of movement of people. The UK would be in favour of keeping the freedom of goods, services and capital (particularly to protect London’s booming financial sector) but the EU has said that it will not split the four freedoms – it’s either all or none.
The deal holds provisions for an Irish backstop, which theUK Attorney General saidcould “endure indefinitely” and leave the UK permanently in a customs arrangement with the EU.

The AG’s advice also said that it was possible that Northern Ireland could remain in the EU customs territory under the deal, and Great Britain could fall outside it, if negotiations broke down or took “an unsatisfactory long time”.
This has fired up the DUP, who are supporting the Tories in government but look dead-set against voting for the deal (they have 10 MPs in Westminster). The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds called the AG’s advice “devastating”.
Brexiteers have argued that if the deal is voted down, they could return to Brussels to negotiate a better deal, despite assertions from May and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that this was “the only deal”.
Those calling for new negotiations include Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit Secretary after May got Cabinet to back her deal, despite the fact that he was leading negotiations on behalf of the UK.
Remain politicians are also hoping that if the deal is voted down, it could lead to the reversal of Brexit or a second referendum on EU membership.
Labour has also pledged to hold a motion of no-confidence in Theresa May if the deal fails in the House of Commons, which could lead to a general election.
What MPs are saying ahead of the vote
Treasury chief Philip Hammond told MPs that it was “simply a delusion” to think that a better Brexit deal can be renegotiated and that a no-deal Brexit would be “too awful to contemplate.”
“We need to be honest with ourselves. The alternatives to this deal are no deal or no Brexit,” he said. “Either will leave us a fractured society and a divided nation.”
Home Secretary Sajid Javid told legislators on Wednesday they should back the Brexit agreement to safeguard Britain’s vital security relationship with the EU.
“No one can pretend that this deal is perfect in every sense,” Javid acknowledged. But he said the alternative was “an uncooperative no-deal” Brexit that would shut Britain out of EU security tools and EU data-sharing organisations.
But the Labour Party’s Chris Bryant said the agreement’s vision for future relations with the EU was “no more deliverable than a letter to Santa Claus”.
“How could a serious member of Parliament vote for nothing more than a wish list?” he said.

A LARGE SCALE survey of the UK population has found that the majority of British people think that Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn would have handled Brexit negotiations worse than Prime Minister Theresa May.
May has been criticised by Johnson and Farage for reneging on the wishes of the people who voted for Brexit in June through her ‘Chequers plan’, which sees the UK leaving the EU but staying closely aligned to it to protect small businesses and prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Corbyn has also been critical of May’s approach to the talks, telling parliament that they’re going nowhere and that the PM has given “empty statements” on Brexit.

Tonight, in the largest survey since the Brexit vote, 20,000 people across the whole of the UK and were asked number of questions on behalf ofChannel 4, including “who would have handled the Brexit negotiations better than Theresa May?”

The panel was also asked how they would vote if the referendum were held again: 54% said they would stay in the EU if the 2016 referendum were held tomorrow.
Polls before the referendum indicated that 52% of the population would remain in the EU: in the final vote, 51.9% voted to leave and 48.1% voted to remain.
Those results were broken down further by region. They indicated that the percentage of those in Northern Ireland who want to leave now is 42% – down two percentage points from the 2016 referendum vote, which was 44%.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-speech-2-4246616-Sep2018/,"EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT President Donald Tusk said today that there would not be a Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop for the Irish border, reaffirming support for Ireland in wake of reports.
He was speaking as European leaders – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – were meeting in Salzburg, Austria, to discuss Brexit and the Irish border issue.
The Brexit ‘backstop’ for the Irish border is still without agreement after months of to-ing and fro-ing between the EU and the UK negotiating teams. Without it, there will be no Withdrawal agreement and the UK will go crashing out of the EU in March – which will most likely lead to a border reemerging on the island of Ireland.
Tusk said that the UK’s Chequers’ plan, which prompted the resignation of David Davis as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, wasn’t acceptable as a whole, and cherry-picked elements of European Union membership.
But shortly after Tusk spoke, British Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that the only workable proposal for an Irish backstop was the one put forward by the UK.
This suggests including the entire UK in the backstop deal, which was proposed for Northern Ireland alone, and delaying a withdrawal from the single market and the customs union until technology is invented to carry out checks without building a hard border that would affect the frictionless trade and the movement of people.
During her speech in Salzburg, May responded to criticism of her Chequers plan and concerns that there was still no Irish backstop:
“I’m negotiating hard in the interest of the British people, to deliver on what the British people voted on, and to stick to commitment we made… but we also need to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
She then took aim at the EU’s proposal for a backstop, which proposes customs checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and the island of Ireland.
She said that the UK understood the need to protect the integrity of the EU’s custom rules and regulations, but that she would not accept any proposal “that carves Northern Ireland away from the UK”.
She added that there would not be a second EU referendum, and that it was essential to deliver a deal for all the people of the UK – including those in Northern Ireland – and if that deal wasn’t possible, then there would be no deal.

De-dramatise
Meanwhile, answering questions from reporters this morning, Coveney said that he believed it was likely that a final deal would be done, and that the EU negotiating team were working to “de-dramatise” the proposed regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland.
“The onus is on all of us to find a way through, try to find a Withdrawal Agreement.”
He said that Barnier believed that they were 85% agreed on the final Brexit deal, but Coveney said that the remaining  15% “involves Irish issues” – and that the most difficult of these is the Irish backstop.
“Commitments were already made last December, and committed to again in March in writing [to an Irish backstop].
He said that work was ongoing to make the regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland (or a border along the Irish Sea) to “de-dramatise minimal amount of practical checks” so that the backstop is more palatable for the UK negotiating team.

“I do believe that the Prime Minister is genuine in her commitment to a backstop,” Coveney said.
He said that they were open to compromise and being flexible, but added:
Playing chicken
However, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald accused May of “playing a game of chicken with Irish interests”.
The Dublin Central TD said following the summit meeting:
“Once again the British Government turned up to an EU Summit meeting with no workable solutions to their Brexit problem and no care for Irish interests, our rights, our agreements and our economy.
“Theresa May is engaged in a dangerous game of brinkmanship.  This week’s summit has been marked by bad faith from the British Government and disregard for deadlines.
She said that with less than six months to go to the Brexit deadline, “the Irish Government and the EU must remain resolute in the face of British arrogance”.
She added:
“The people of the North voted to remain and we cannot allow a situation develop which sees them dragged out of the EU, out of the Customs Union and out of the Single Market against their wishes.”
Taoiseach meeting
This morning, the Taoiseach met with UK Prime Minister Theresa May at Salzburg for a 40-minute meeting before the informal summit.
Speaking to Sky Newsafter the brief meeting this morning, the Taoiseach said:
“I had a very good meeting with Prime Minister May and her team. Time is running short there are proposals for another summit in October and then November. Ireland wants to avoid a no-deal scenario but we are preparing for that.
When asked if it was inevitable that there would be a border either in Ireland or along the Irish Sea, Varadkar said:
“We have a border already in the sense that there’s a political border and a different currency is used in Northern Ireland, so a political border does exist.
“But what we want to avoid is new barriers to trade, new barriers to the movement of people. Think of all the people who cross the border every day to work or study, think of all the businesses that trade across the border.

It was expected that there would be a final Brexit deal to vote on at the current summit in Salzburg, but because of outstanding issues, it’s expected that there will be another summit organised for mid-November.

A BILL ENACTING Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has become law after months of debate, the House of Commons speaker announced this afternoon, to cheers from eurosceptic lawmakers.
Speaker John Bercow said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which repeals the 1972 European Communities Act through which Britain became a member of the bloc, had received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II.
The bill transfers decades of European law onto British statute books, and also enshrines Brexit day in British law as 29 March 2019 at 11pm – midnight Brussels time.
Prime Minister Theresa May said the approval was a “historic moment for our country, and a significant step towards delivering on the will of the British people”.
The bill has undergone more than 250 hours of acrimonious debate in the Houses of Parliament since it was introduced in July 2017.
Eurosceptics celebrated the passing of the bill through parliament last week as proof that, despite continuing uncertainty in the negotiations with Brussels, Brexit was happening.

‘Stronger negotiating hand’
“Lest anyone is in any doubt, the chances of Britain not leaving the EU are now zero,” International Trade Minister Liam Fox said.
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch Brexit supporter, said: “The legal position is now so much stronger for a clean Brexit.”
“Crucially this makes the prime minister’s negotiating hand much stronger.”
Another eurosceptic Conservative MP, Dominic Raab, said May would go to an EU summit later this week “with the wind in her sails”.
The government had a tough time getting the bill through parliament and was forced to concede some power to lawmakers over the final Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.
Further battles are expected in the House of Commons in the coming weeks, when MPs debate two bills on trade – with pro-Europeans seeking to force the government to keep close ties with the bloc.
May has yet to set out her plans for customs arrangements after Brexit, which have become a major stumbling block in talks with Brussels.
She will gather her top ministers after the EU summit, which starts on Thursday, to thrash out their differences with the aim of publishing a Brexit blueprint shortly after.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-marriage-breakdowns-4283312-Oct2018/,"A UK PSYCHOTHERAPIST has said that Brexit is contributing to marriage breakdowns, saying it when the relationships broke down, it continued to “disentangle it further”.
Patricia Hunt, the Vice Chair of the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told the Irish Council of Psychotherapy that they had been documenting the reported feelings associated with the vote.
This includes the effect it’s had on relationships.
“It’s also had profound effects on families because of a split in the voting – generational splits particularly. The majority of young people voted to remain, whilst the majority of over 65s voted to leave. ”
She said that there was a clinic in London that had been set up specifically to deal with the fears of people who live in Britain but might not be able to stay because of Brexit.

“They are completely overwhelmed by demand,” she toldTheJournal.ie.

Hunt said that the fractured nature of Brexit could lead people to connect that with a sense of being cut off that they may have experienced elsewhere.
“What does Brexit symbolise for people? To what extent do they feel like they belong, or they don’t belong?”
She said that the sense that it was “irreversible” makes people feel powerless, and feel a sense of grief or loss as a result.
“People hadn’t realised the sense of their identity and their persona was based on their sense of their nationhood until it became challenged by the vote, and that gives people a sense of insecurity.”

EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS GET their own say on Brexit this week as they debate future ties with London in the run-up to Sunday’s summit to sign papers for the agreement.
Ministers from the other 27 EU member states, including Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister of State for Europan Affairs Helen McEntee, are in Brussels at the start of what Prime Minister Theresa May calls “an intense week of negotiations.”
The British leader has said she will be in the city herself later in the week to meet the head of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for last-minute talks.
“The focus this week will be on the future relationship,” Maytold Sky News.
“We won’t agree the leaving part… until we’ve got what we want in the future relationship, because these two go together.”
Specifically, London wants to lay out in as much detail as possible how to get to a free trade agreement before the end of a 21-month post-Brexit transition.
Brussels, meanwhile, insists Britain cannot have the same privileged access to the single market as it did as a member state after Brexit on 29 March next year.
This morningRTÉ reportsEU Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly has called on the European Commission to publish a document it has that sets out all of the areas of North-South cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement that are at risk.
The European Commission and the British government had refused to publish it because they said negotiations around the Irish backstop were so sensitive. However a case was taken to the Ombudsman’s office on public interest ground and O’Reilly said there is “no obvious reason” it can not be published.

Extending the transition
European negotiators plan to publish their version of the statement on future relations tomorrow, after their ambassadors met over the weekend.
According to diplomatic sources yesterday, the document was fleshed out from just over six pages to around 20 as more details were agreed.
They also discussed an EU proposal that the draft withdrawal agreement be amended to extend the post-Brexit transition to the end of 2022.
No decision was taken on this, however, and members are wary of re-opening the document and allowing British hardliners to restart a debate on its terms.
Meanwhile closer to home for May, a group of cabinet ministers is to meet about the possibility of renegotiating some parts of the draft deal the Prime Minister presented last week.
May will speak to business leaders today where she will tell them that this withdrawal agreement will stop EU migrants “jumping the queue”, BBC reports.
“Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer,” she is expected to say at the CBI business lobby group annual conference in London.
She will also tell the conference that she is not willing to reopen discussions with Brussels over the withdrawal agreement.

Sky NewsSky News
UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has repeated her stance in Brexit negotiations and on the Irish backstop during her closing speech at the Conservative Party Conference.
She ruled out a second Brexit vote, saying that it would be undemocratic, and said that she wouldn’t allow Northern Ireland to remain in the EU in order to avoid a hard border.
In one part of her speech, May made reference to Pettigo, a village that straddles the border between Co Donegal and Co Fermanagh.
“If you live in Pettigo on the Irish border, you need a Brexit that keeps it frictionless, and communities connected. These things matter to you, so they matter to me.”
She began by mocking her speech from last year, by asking people to excuse her if she coughs during her speech, and that she was up all night gluing the sign behind her to the backdrop, and danced onto the stage to the tune of Abba’s ‘Dancing Queen’.

On Brexit, May said that they “seek a good trading relationship” with the EU. “They are our close friends and allies and we should ensure it stays that way. It’s what we promised in our manifesto.”
May prompted applause by pledging to limit migration.
“The free movement of people will end once and for all… It’s in the national interest.”
She said that migration will continue in the UK, but it will be based “on what skills you have to offer, not on what country you come from”.
She said this would reduce the numbers of people coming into the country, and would be “an incentive to train our young people and give them an opportunity to invest in technology”.
She also ruled out another vote on Brexit: “A second referendum would be a politicians’ vote. Think of what it would do to democracy… Politicians telling people they got it wrong and to vote again.”
The rest of her speech
The theme of her speech focused on opportunity: “with freedom comes responsibility… with security comes opportunity… the opportunity to dream and strive and to achieve a better life”.
“…The opportunity to know that if your dad arrives on a plane from Pakistan that you can become Home Secretary.”

This is referring to Sajid Javid, who is tipped as the possible next Tory leader.
She also defended the Tory’s record of funding the UK’s health service: “One of my most important jobs as Prime Minister is to secure the NHS for the future.”
She also repeatedly attacked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, making reference to reports of anti-semitism within the Labour party, and his stance on defence measures.
May also addressed the Salisbury poisoning, praising the cross-support she had from Parliament, and took aim at Corbyn again.
He says Britain should disarm its defences in the hope that others should follow suit. I say no, we should keep our defences to keep our country safe.
In her speech, the Tory leader is expected to address accusations of a lack of confidence in Britain’s future by senior figures such as Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister.
“I passionately believe that our best days lie ahead of us and that our future is full of promise,” she will say, according to pre-released extracts of her speech.
Johnson’s speech
Johnson attracted hundreds tohis speech on the future of the partyand his vision for Brexit, in what was suspected to be an attempt to become the next Tory leader.
After criticising Theresa May’s Chequers plan, saying it didn’t deliver on what voters wanted, he asked Tory members to support May in going for a better deal which prompted a weak response from the crowd.
May’s Chequers plan,which outlines what the UK government wants from Brexit negotiations, has also been criticised by senior figures in the EU, such as European Council President Donald Tusk and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Last year, May’s closing speech to her party was a bit of a disaster (click here if you’d like to relive it).
During her speech, the letters from a “Building a country that works for everyone” sign on stage fell apart gradually, she was hit by a fit of coughing and had to be handed a strepsil, and a protester handed her a P45 form.

She was alsomildly criticisedfor wearing a bracelet of painted images of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, who was a prominent communist and a close friend of Soviet politician Leon Trotsky at the biggest Conservative event in the country.
May’s speeches have been criticised as being repetitive, particularly on the subject of Brexit: “strong and stable government” and “Brexit means Brexit” are the most commonly repeated mantras.
Her speech today is hoped to indicate some room for compromise on Brexit; and how likely a leadership bid is – Johnson’s denials of premier ambitions aside.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-scared-irish-christmas-rather-than-a-blowout-expected-this-year-4378011-Dec2018/,"IRISH CONSUMERS PLAN to spend this Christmas but remain cautious as Brexit looms, according to the latest KBC/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index.
The latest study shows a slight financial improvement in November – in part down to Budget 2019 measures – meaning that, while Irish people aren’t in “panic mode”, Brexit uncertainty did “hit home” last month.
Improvements in household finances coupled with Black Friday sales, however, have boosted consumer spending with the monthly index rising to 96.5 reversing October’s monthly drop to 93.5.
That is still “well below” recent peaks seen in January and July, the report notes.
By comparison, consumer confidence in neighbouring economies remained on a downward trend, the study notes, with Euro sentiment readings largely influenced by a poor French reading.
In the UK, consumer confidence registered the largest monthly decline in seventeen months. Prime Minister Theresa May is currently seeking approval for her draft withdrawal agreement with the EU.

‘Gain in confidence’
Consumer outlook on the jobs market in Ireland has declined, according to the latest KBC/ESRI index, representing “a slightly larger increase in numbers expecting rising unemployment than in those expecting lower joblessness.”
The difference between job growth in Dublin and elsewhere was notable in November, however.
In 2017, numbers at work in Dublin increased by 2.3% – a slower pace than elsewhere in the country.
In 2018, however, employment has increased by 5.8% in Dublin compared to a rise of 2& elsewhere.
A boom In Ireland remains unlikely, the latest survey showing a “pause” following increased economic worries over the last few months with consumer attitude now reflecting “a Brexit-scarred rather than a blowout Christmas.”
Reacting to the latest figures, ESRI’s Philip Economides said that “the approaching festive holiday season likely contributed towards the gain in confidence.”
“Though consumers’ outlook on the general economy continued to decline, November’s loss of confidence are notably less than the previous three months.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-irish-backstop-uk-eu-colony-4279113-Oct2018/,"PROMINENT BREXITEER AND former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said that the Irish backstop would make the UK “a permanent EU colony”.
He said that the backstop “closes off” the UK’s options, and effectively means that no deal and the ‘SuperCanada’ deal aren’t possible – leaving Chequers as the only possible option.
Last week,Donald Tusk saidthat the ‘Canada plus plus plus’ deal was still on offer, all the UK had to do was accept it.
“This is an important moment,”Johnson tweeted this afternoon.
“Clearly No 10 are negotiating a ‘backstop’ that makes the UK a permanent EU colony. We cannot escape EU laws & European Court of Justice until they allow us to – which they may never do. That’s not what the biggest majority in our history voted for.”

This backstop closes off our options. It means we cannot have no deal / WTO or SuperCanada. Under either our rules could differ from the EU’s – so they will keep us in the backstop instead. It means, in fact, that the only possible deal is Chequers 3/4— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson)October 10, 2018Boris Johnson/ Twitter
This backstop closes off our options. It means we cannot have no deal / WTO or SuperCanada. Under either our rules could differ from the EU’s – so they will keep us in the backstop instead. It means, in fact, that the only possible deal is Chequers 3/4
The backstop is a safeguard to ensure that a hard border does not reemerge on the island of Ireland and to safeguard the Northern Ireland peace process, as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, which is internationally recognised.
The wording of the backstop, agreed in December 2017 and again this March, provides for “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
The EU has suggested that this would mean leaving Northern Ireland in the Single Market and Customs Union, which are separate but very closely linked. The UK has argued that this would be putting a border down the Irish Sea.
The UK has suggested the ‘max fac’ option: this would mean waiting until technology is created that would carry out customs and regulatory checks without requiring border infrastructure. The EU has argued that it isn’t practical to wait until something may or may not be invented.
Johnson has always been against the provision of a backstop for Northern Ireland, saying previously that it’s “a millenium bug” issue. There’s been a fear that despite the UK’s commitment to a backstop, that they would withdraw their support for it due to political pressure.
The EU has repeatedly assured the Irish government that there will be no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop being agreed upon.
With just weeks left to make a deal, and with little progress made on the backstop, fears are growing that both sides will fail to reach a deal and the UK will go crashing out of the EU.
EU leaders are to meet in Brussels next week to discuss the outstanding Brexit issues, including the Irish backstop. If enough progress is made on this issue during those two days, another summit will take place in mid-November to finalise a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fail-government-4391121-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2018
FIANNA FAIL HAS committed that it will not bring down the Fine Gael minority government next year, ruling out an election in 2019.
Leader Micheál Martin confirmed in a speech in the Dail this afternoon that the party will continue to prop up Fine Gael through the confidence and supply agreement until 2020.
After the 2016 general election, Fianna Fáil eventually agreed to support Fine Gael in power for three budgets, by committing to not bring down the government or vote against it on key votes, as long as Fine Gael upheld its end of the bargain.
After the last budget, both parties were in negotiations over extending the confidence and supply arrangement further, but no decision had yet been reached.
Martin said today that despite his misgivings with Fine Gael’s record, his party would be extending the agreement as a result of the uncertainty posed by Brexit.
Speaking in the Dáil, Martin hit out at UK Conservative politicians over the current Brexit impasse, saying that the leaders had “extreme Europhobia” and that the party had “descended in open warfare between rival factions”.
As things stand in England,Prime Minister Theresa May faces a motion of no confidencethis evening from her own party over her attempt to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU.
In a statement released after Martin’s announcement, a spokesperson for Fine Gael noted that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar wrote to the Fianna Fáil leader in August “setting out an ambitious programme as part of an extension of the current Confidence and Supply Arrangement, and seeking an agreed election date for the summer of 2020″.
The spokesperson welcomed Fianna Fáil’s commitment to extend the confidence and supply agreement, saying this “further strengthens Ireland’s hand in negotiating a successful outcome to Brexit, and securing all that we have achieved to date”.
“Our programme focuses on Brexit, job creation, investment in infrastructure including health and housing, and meeting the needs of hard-working Irish families. We are determined to ensure that the social and economic progress made since 2016 can continue,” they added.
No deal
Martin also accused Fine Gael of not being properly prepared in the case of a no deal Brexit scenario, which he said would have a strongly negative impact on the Irish economy.
He said that the government had not made the proper provisions to protect the country from the impact of Brexit.
“The situation is that Ireland is facing a major threat and great uncertainty,” he said.
He said that because the uncertainty his party had sought a review of various matters to do with the government and that it had shown a “complacency” on its part in many areas.
“In normal times this would cause an election… but these are not normal times,” Martin said.
Martin said that Fianna Fáil was determined that “political chaos in London not be allowed to spread to Ireland”.
For that reasons he said the party would continue their arrangement with Fine Gael until the certainty around Brexit was resolved.

Going into more detail with the media this afternoon, Martin said that an election is now likely in Spring 2020.

If it weren’t for the Brexit situation, the confidence and supply deal would be dead, he said, adding that Fianna Fáil still has “huge issues” with the delivery on housing and health.
However, Martin could not provide any specific measures he sought from the Taoiseach in exchange for his support going forward, other than the passage of some legislation his party are keen to see progressed.
Martin said affordable housing is something his party will be seeking progress on.
‘These are not normal times’
When asked byTheJournal.iehow he planned to sell this extension to the grassroots of his party, Martin admitted that some within the party will be unhappy the deal has been extended, however, he believes the public will be happy.
He reiterated that the threat of a no-deal Brexit overshadows everything. Martin said it was a “very challenging decision” to make, adding that he believes the majority in the parliamentary party will support the decision he has taken.
Martin said the public could not face into six weeks to two months of uncertainty if an election were to be held, stating that in the last number of weeks the public have been getting increasingly anxious about the threat of Brexit.
“These are not normal times,” he said, adding that Brexit left him with “no choice”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney this evening thanked Martin for extending the agreement with Fine Gael stating that it will now allow the government continue making plans for what could be an uncertain future.
He would not state that Fine Gael had essentially been given a free pass by Fianna Fáil.
Coveney said there would be no additions to the confidence and supply document, adding that the two parties will continue to work off the same paper it agreed to in 2016. He added that there was still lots to do.

“This deal is a mature, sensible decision,” he said, adding that there was no threat or pressure from Fine Gael or the Taoiseach last night.
Coveney could not state whether the deal would be extended for another year after 2020, neither could he give a guarantee that an election would not be held sooner, stating that these things cannot be predicted. However, he added that Fine Gael does not have an appetite for an election. Coveney said the public did not have one either.
Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald spoke after Martin’s speech, strongly criticising both the Fine Gael government and Fianna Fail for supporting them.
Dubbing the parties “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” she said Fianna Fáil continued to fail in holding the government to account.
Labour’s Brendan Howlin called on the confidence and supply documents to be published.
“Over a number of weeks detailed talks were held with input from civil servants, and a review of policy developments and failures in most departments.
“It is essential for full public transparency that those documents are now released, and clarification provided on what concessions were made to secure a one year extension of the minority government.
“Across health, housing, and in the provision of broadband this Government is clearly failing. The Labour Party is ready for an election. The people deserve better than a further 12 months of ‘do little’ government,” he said.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS announced that it will hold four major events during the month of October to inform people of how to prepare for Brexit.
The four events will be held in counties Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin on four days in October, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said at the launch of the government’s Getting Ireland Brexit Ready strategy.

“The series will begin on 5 October in Cork, followed by Galway on 12 October, Monaghan on 19 October and Dublin on 25 October,” he said.
The announcement was made this morning, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with other European leaders in Salzburg, Austria to discuss Brexit and the Irish border issue, which is the largest stumbling block to a final Brexit deal.
The aim of the four events will be to make citizens and business owners aware of the difficulties Brexit could present so that people can prepare ahead of time.
“The most crucial and reassuring aspect to our contingency planning remains that, after Brexit, Ireland will continue to enjoy all the benefits of being a full and valued member of the European Union,” Coveney said.

BRITISH PEOPLE WHO oppose Brexit packed the heart of London today for an anti-Brexit protest organisers said drew more than half a million people.
The police gave no figures for how many showed up for the massive march and rally outside parliament aimed at pressing the government into holding a second Brexit vote.
But the 570,000 turnout figure reported by campaigners would make the demonstration the largest since 750,000 showed up against the war in Iraq in 2003 according to police figures.
“This feels like a party,” said Liverpool university student Lucy Dogget as she squeezed past a volunteer dishing out bowls of beans on a leafy square facing Westminster Palace.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called it “an historic moment in our democracy” that united “every corner of our country and every section of our society”.

‘Misled’
The marchers came in buses and trains from across Britain and even other parts of the EU.
They chanted and whistled while marching in support for causes ranging from women’s rights to Britain’s beloved but underfunded NHS healthcare system.
Some wore blue French berets decorated with the golden stars of the EU flag. Others stuck up signs lampooning Prime Minister Theresa May’s negotiating efforts.
Many of the posters featured variations on the famous “I have a cunning plan” line from the popular 1980s British comedy ‘Blackadder’.
Yui MokYui Mok
Their point was that May seemed to have none at all just five months before Britain is to split from the EU with or without an agreement of how future trade between the two will function.
And all seemed united in a simple message: the Brexit its supporters promised ahead of the June 2016 referendum that set the divorce in motion looks nothing like the one being negotiated today.
“I think people were misled in various ways,” small business owner Peter Hancock said while tightening an EU flag around the neck of his huge bearded collie.
“We want to stay European,” added his wheelchair-bound wife Julie.
An online petition demanding a binding vote on any deal agreed before the March deadline had been signed almost 950,000 times by the time the march kicked off under sunny skies.

Divided nation
May has made it abundantly clear that she has no intention of allowing a Brexit do-over.
“They now want a second referendum to go back to the British people and say ‘Oh, we’re terribly sorry – we think you’ve got it wrong,’” she told parliament on Wednesday.
But with negotiations between London and Brussels deadlocked, it remains unclear what deal, if any, her government can deliver.

As Britain’s planned departure in March next year draws closer it faces the prospect of leaving without any agreement, or remaining in a transition phase for several years with few changes but notably losing its decision-making seat at the EU.
Neither choice is appealing. Recriminations over how Britain got here are leaving May looking increasingly isolated and weak.
And European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron are openly wondering if a second British vote might yet make the mess go away.
Polls show support for a second referendum evenly split – the same as with Brexit itself.
The 2016 Brexit poll was backed by 52% of voters on turnout of 72%.

But some think MPs may rally around another poll at the last moment to avert complete chaos once they see what Britain might be forced to sign up to – and they must approve.
The last big march on parliament demanding a second vote in June saw an estimated 100,000 gather on and around Parliament Square facing Westminster Palace.
Organisers expect this one will be bigger and involve supporters of all major parties from every corner of Britain – and beyond.

Fiona Godfrey represents a group of British immigrants in Luxembourg. She came to London because Brexit would put up big hurdles to her ability to go back home with her new German husband.
“We would have to meet minimum income rules and I am self-employed,” the 53-year-old said.
The speakers set to take the stage outside parliament where the march concludes include London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
A group of celebrities led by Gary Lineker – a retired football star familiar to just about every Briton – will also pipe in video messages of support.

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-priti-patel-starvation-4382733-Dec2018/,"IRELAND’S EU COMMISSIONER Phil Hogan has criticised the Tory MP who suggested using the possibility of food shortages in a no-deal Brexit scenario to encourage the EU to drop the Irish backstop.
Yesterday, former ministerPriti Patel told the Times of Londonthat the severe economic strain that Ireland would face should be used to encourage Ireland and the EU to back down on their insistence that there needs to be a backstop.
She told the Times, which had seen government papers that reported the forecasted effect Brexit would have on Ireland:
“This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario.
The report that Patel is referring to seems to be one released in February this year, that said Ireland’s GDP would grow by 7% less in a no-deal scenario than it would otherwise.
The report says: “In this case, the UK and the EU will impose tariffs on each other’s goods where these are not bound by existing plurilateral agreements or arrangements… As in the previous scenarios, the introduction of border inspections add customs costs.”
Patel’s comments were criticised by the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, other elected British figures, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald.

“I think that statement was, for obvious historical reasons, very distasteful and insensitive and gauche. It also belies, really, a very reckless and almost juvenile mentality,”McDonald said.
Patel later tweeted out that her comments had been taken out of context.
It is clear my comments on‘ No Deal’ have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels & get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws & money.— Priti Patel MP (@pritipatel)December 7, 2018Priti Patel MP/ Twitter
It is clear my comments on‘ No Deal’ have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels & get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws & money.
Speaking at a gathering of the European Association of Journalists, Hogan was asked about his response to Priti Patel’s comments.
The EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development said that 43% of Ireland’s agricultural products are sent to the UK (2015 figures).
The UK’s largest EU trade surplus was with Ireland, and was worth £12 billion in 2017 (a trade surplus is when a country’s exports exceeds the cost of its imports).
In the same year, the UK exported £274 billion of goods and services to other EU member states. This is equivalent to 44.5% of total UK exports.
On Patel’s comments that a second, better deal can be done, Hogan addressed this when he said that there wasn’t a plan to go back to negotiations from the EU’s perspective: “There is no Plan B on the side of the EU – the Withdrawal Agreement is what it is.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/denis-naughten-fine-gael-dail-4282416-Oct2018/,"A WEEK IS a long time in politics, as the saying goes. So too is a day, just ask Denis Naughten.
The embattled Communications Minister resigned on Thursday after the Taoiseach asked him to reflect on his position the night before.
Pressure had been mounting on Naughten following revelations about a dinner he had with the head of the only remaining group bidding for the National Broadband Plan (NBP) contract – details of which were first reported by The Times.
Naughtenadmitted to attending a dinnerwith David McCourt – head of the Granahan McCourt consortium – in New York in July. During the week it emerged the minister had also facilitated a lunch in Leinster House for McCourt’s daughter in April.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Members of Fine Gael have defended junior minister Pat Breen for also meeting McCourt, saying he has no role in the NBP. You can read more about the series of eventshere.
Announcing his resignation, Naughten told the Dáil he had offered to pass over the NBP process to Breen or another minister, but Leo Varadkar refused.
“The Taoiseach does not have confidence in me,” Naughten said, before leaving the Dáil chamber and his ministry.
Crunching the numbers
So, what does this mean for Fine Gael? The party has been leading a minority government since the 2016 general election, with the backing of Fianna Fáil and the support of a number of independent TDs including Naughten.
The slight majority enjoyed by Fine Gael has become even more wafer-thin in recent weeks – Louth TD Peter Fitzpatrickleft the partyearlier this month.
So while the government may not fall just yet, passing legislation has become more complicated. With Fitzpatrick now an independent, Fine Gaelhas 49 TDs in the Dáil- justfour more than Fianna Fáil’s 45.
There are 157 TDs voting in the Dáil, excluding Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl (Fianna Fail). If Fianna Fáil abstains from voting in confidence and budgetary matters, as set out in its Confidence and Supply agreement with Fine Gael, that leaves 113 votes remaining – meaning the government needs at least 57 votes to pass legislation.
Denis NaughtenLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
It has the support of four Independent Alliance TDs, each of whom are either ministers or ministers of state, and independent minister Katherine Zappone.
Former minister Sean Canney quit the Independent Alliance earlier this year butpledged to continue to support the governmenton budgetary matters and in confidence votes. Independent TDs Michael Lowry and Noel Grealish also generally support the government but that’s not set in stone.
Naughten and Fitzpatrick both said they would deal with the issue of supporting the government on a case-by-case basis.

When asked about Dáil arithmetic yesterday, Varadkar told reporters: “Obviously it is a fact that we’ve lost one or two TDs, TDs who were supporting the government and now are not or at least aren’t all the time.
He said the “next test will be on Tuesday”, when the Dáil is due to vote on whether or not to ratify the ministerial appointments the Taoiseach makes on foot of Naughten’s resignation.
Election time?
There has been plenty of speculation about a general election taking place this winter – well before Naughten stepped down.
Indeed,Tuesday’s Budgetwas deemed an ‘election Budget’ by many – but Varadkar downplayed this in an interview withTheJournal.iejust hours before Naughten resigned.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says#Budget19is not an election Budget.He said that other parties were asking them to borrow more, to spend more. ""What we tried to do was get the balance right.""

Brexit is one of the main reasons many people think calling an election in the coming months would be foolish.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin yesterday wrote to Varadkar asking that such a scenario be avoided until at least after a deal has been reached between Britain and the EU, given the current uncertainty about the situation and how it could affect Ireland.
Fianna FáilFianna Fáil
“The Irish people would, I am sure you agree, be rightly concerned at any risk that a general election campaign would have on [Brexit] talks at such a crucial period and an uncertain post-election situation.
“An election during this critical time would create dangerous instability during a period when the Brexit deal would be derailed by the constantly changing situation in Westminster,” Martin wrote.
Opinion polls
Opinion polls are another factor likely to impact when the government will decide to go to the people – unless, of course, events overtake them.
Fine Gael has regularly topped recent opinion polls, meaning the party may favour having an election sooner rather than later in a bid to capitalise on this and strengthen its mandate.
However, the results of a pollreleased yesterdayindicate that Fianna Fáil is closing the gap in support between the two largest parties.
1,000 adults were interviewed over the phone between 3 and 10 October for a Red C poll carried out on behalf of Paddy Power. The findings show that Fine Gael retains the highest level of support at 32%, down one point from last month.
Fianna Fáil increased its support by five points, up to 27%. Sinn Féin is unchanged on 14%, while Labour dropped one point to 5%. Independents are down one point to 12%, while the Independent Alliance are also down one point to 3%.
Solidarity/People Before Profit are unchanged at 2%. The Social Democrats are down one point to 1% and the Green Party is up one point to 3%. Others are unchanged on 1%. The margin of error is 3%.
Many politicians may want to avoid an election for now – particularly if the outcome would do little to affect the makeup of the Dáil. They will, of course, say that opinion polls are just that, and the only poll that matters is on election day – whenever that may be.

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-prices-myhome-ie-end-of-year-4419349-Jan2019/,"
HOUSE PRICES ARE expected to rise by around 5% in 2019 after stabilising in the last quarter of 2018 according to an end-of-year report.
The MyHome.ie report predicts that demand and rising incomes will continue to push house prices higher this year – as long as the uncertainty caused by Brexit is resolved.
While asking prices nationally fell back by 0.9% and were unchanged in Dublin in Q4 – as per normal seasonal trends – the annual rate of inflation nationally was 6.1% while it was 3% in Dublin.
This means the median asking price for new sales nationally is €266,000 down €2,000 from the last quarter while the price in Dublin remains unchanged at €375,000.
Newly listed properties are seen as the most reliable indicator of future price movements.

The author of the report, Conall Mac Coille, Chief Economist at Davy, said the overall picture is that the recent slowdown has evened out, housing supply is slowly picking up – even if it remains well short of demand – and liquidity is slowly improving off a low base.
“Suggestions that the tightening of the Central Bank lending rules would cause the market to stagnate have also proved to be well wide of the mark.”
“We estimate that the value of transactions in 2018 is up by almost 20% and will finish the year just below €18bn versus €14.9bn last year. This represents close to 5% growth in the number of sales. While the tightening of the CBI lending rules has been successful in taking some of the heat out of residential sales, one serious side effect is that this heat has been transferred to the rental market with rental inflation set to remain buoyant.”
The Managing Director of MyHome.ie Angela Keegan said she believes 2018 will be remembered as the year when the stock of both new builds and second-hand homes turned the corner.
“There are over 21,700 homes listed for sale on MyHome.ie at the moment. While this is still far too low to meet demand, it is an increase of 15% on last year. In Dublin there are 5,000 homes listed for sale, up 44% on the 3,500 this time last year.
“The underlying picture is that homebuilding is picking up. In total over the past 12 months planning permissions have been granted for 29,500 units – 70% higher than the current level of homebuilding. However, this is still short of the 35,000 we estimate is needed to meet demographic pressure.”
“Meanwhile the average time to sale agreed remains relatively stable at four months nationally and three months in Dublin.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-sme-sentiment-4186451-Aug2018/,"ALMOST SIX IN ten small-to-medium sized businesses believe Brexit will have a negative impact on their future business, but only 6% of businesses have a plan in place to deal with the fallout of the UK leaving the EU.
The AIB Brexit Sentiment Index for the second quarter of this year also highlights that 70% of businesses believe that Brexit will have a negative wider economic impact on the country.
Since the index began, the feeling of Irish businesses has been overwhelmingly negative about Brexit and that hasn’t changed with this latest index, as uncertainty reigns over what kind of deal will exist between the UK and EU.
The rhetoric from some sections of the UK government has been thatit is likely it will leave the EU without essential deals on trade and customs arrangements, which would further heighten barriers for business.
The AIB index said: “The prevailing uncertainty is clearly feeding back into business sentiment among many SMEs in both jurisdictions (Ireland and Northern Ireland), each of which have their own unique concerns.”

On the other hand, a large number of firms say that Brexit isn’tcurrentlyaffecting their business.
AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said: “Around three-quarters of SMEs in [Ireland] and two-thirds of firms in Northern Ireland state that Brexit having no impact on their business currently.”
Mangan said it is the tourist trade that is the most clearly impacted to date in Ireland while the food and drinks industry has been most affected in Northern Ireland.
According to the survey, 32% of businesses in Ireland believed there could be a hard border after Brexit and businesses were encouraged to draft plans for how their business would cope in every Brexit scenario.
AIB’s Catherine Moroney added that it is “critical to plan for the worst now”.
The survey was conducted by Ipsos MRBI among 500 SMEs in Ireland and 200 in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-economy-brexit-risks-4070501-Jun2018/,"THE IRISH ECONOMY is growing but Britain leaving the European Union poses a “major threat”, the Central Bank has said.
In its first Macro-Financial Review of 2018, the organisation notes that the domestic economy is “growing substantially”, but that this in itself gives rise to potential risks.
The assessment takes into account progress made to date in reducing private and public debt and non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector.
The Irish economy is projected to grow, in  gross domestic product (GDP) terms, by 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2019.
“Business sentiment has been improving over recent quarters and increased building and construction is contributing to investment growth,” the report notes.
It adds that, while Brexit is “a key risk to the Irish economy, there is also a concern that as the economy approaches full employment, upward pressure on wages and skills shortages, as well as infrastructure deficiencies, could threaten competitiveness”.
Changes in international corporate taxation rates “could affect foreign direct investment and economic performance more generally”, it adds.
The review highlights that Brexit-related risks to the Irish economy include:
Sharon Donnery, Deputy Governor of Central Banking, said: “The risks arising from Brexit, especially a ‘hard’ or disruptive Brexit, are far-reaching for Ireland.

High levels of household and public debt
The review also outlines other risks to the wider financial system and economy, such as high levels of household and public debt. These risks include:
Mortgages
The report states that the household sector “continues to benefit from improving labour market conditions and the low-interest rate environment”.
“A large number of households remain in late-stage arrears. Both residential property prices and rents are growing strongly, with a shortage of residential units contributing. While there are signs of increasing construction activity, the supply of new units remains below housing demand,” the report notes.
It adds that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears continues to fall.
In December 2017, there were 70,488 principal-dwelling home (PDH) accounts and 22,461 buy-to-let (BTL) accounts in arrears, down from 2013 peaks of 142,892 and 40,396 respectively.
The percentage of loan accounts in arrears for over 90 days remains higher among BTLs (14.9%) than PDH accounts (6.6%). Arrears rates also vary by region, with PDH rates ranging from just under 5% to close to 10%, with the lowest rate arising in Dublin.
Potential risks
Donnery said that, while the domestic economy is performing well, this in itself “gives rise to potential risks”.
“Stronger growth could add to overheating pressures if not managed prudently. The array of risks facing Ireland, coupled with the fact that we are a small and open economy naturally prone to volatility, make it hard to predict what the future holds.
“What we can do is to ensure that the banks and financial system are sufficiently resilient to withstand unexpected shocks.
“As such, it is right that we now give active consideration to using all of the tools available to us to help maintain sustainable and balanced growth,” she stated.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-extraditions-brexit-4248416-Sep2018/,"
EU COUNTRIES SHOULD continue extraditing criminal suspects to Britain until it leaves the bloc, the union’s top court ruled on Wednesday, rejecting a bid by a murder suspect to use Brexit to avoid facing justice.
A man suspected of murder, rape and arson challenged a European Arrest Warrant issued by Britain after he was detained in Ireland, arguing that the UK’s decision to leave the EU meant it was not clear that his rights would be guaranteed.
But the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave had no bearing on such warrants so long as it remained part of the EU.
“The notification by a member state of its intention to withdraw from the Union in accordance with Article 50 (of the EU treaty) does not have the effect of suspending the application of EU law in that member state,” the court said.

The “principles of mutual trust and mutual recognition” continue until Brexit day – 29 March next year, it added.
The European Arrest Warrant system allows EU countries to request the extradition of suspects from other member states, with very few reasons allowed for refusal.
The suspect in the current case, identified only as ‘RO’, was arrested in Ireland in 2016 on the British warrant and appealed to the Irish High Court on grounds including issues related to Brexit.
The Irish court then asked the ECJ to rule whether it should refuse to surrender the suspect due to “the uncertainty as to the arrangements which will be put in place after the UK’s withdrawal”.
The ECJ said courts should only refuse an arrest warrant from a state leaving the EU if there are “substantial grounds” to believe there is a risk of the suspect being deprived of his or her rights.

ANOTHER MEMBER OF Theresa May’s government has resigned, after universities and science minister Sam Gyimah stepped down last night over what he said was the Prime Minister’s “naive” Brexit plan.
He becomes the seventh member of May’s government to quit since she brought back the draft Withdrawal Agreement from Brussels last month.
Gyimah, who voted to remain in the EU, said the deal was “not in the British national interest” and argued that voting for it would set Britain “up for failure”.
“Britain will end up worse off, transformed from rule makers into rule takers,” he wrote on Facebook.
“It is a democratic deficit and a loss of sovereignty the public will rightly never accept,” he added.
He did not rule out the possibility of supporting a second referendum, saying “we shouldn’t dismiss out of hand the idea of asking the people again what future they want”.

Future contracts
Gyimah said Britain’s exclusion from the EU’s Galileo programme because of Brexit was a “clarion call”, saying it was “only a foretaste of what’s to come” in negotiating a future relationship with the bloc.
“I have seen first-hand the EU stack the deck against us time and time again,” he said.
Britain in June revealed that it had been formally excluded from future contracts for the programme, intended for commercial uses such as logistics as well as for armed forces and emergency services.
Brussels has said it will deny London access to Galileo’s encrypted signals after Britain’s EU departure next year, despite its estimated £1.2 billion (€1.3 billion) investment.
May has said Britain would look to build its own system.
Gyimah, a former aide to prime minister David Cameron, praised May’s “grit and determination”, but his resignation highlights the daunting task of getting the deal through parliament.
Both Remainers and Brexiteers in her own party have vowed see it defeated in a crucial vote on 11 December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-brexit-white-paper-4139810-Jul2018/,"
THE EU’S TOP negotiator Michel Barnier has expressed doubts over Britain’s new Brexit blueprint for future trade ties with the European Union, as he called for “rapidly” settling outstanding issues like the Irish border.
But Barnier also welcomed good points in London’s fresh proposal, such as plans for a free trade agreement, after he discussed it yesterday with Britain’s new Brexit negotiator Dominic Raab. Raab took up the job following a rebellion against Prime Minister Teresa May’s Brexit proposal.
But before talk of future ties, Barnier said the priority should be on clinching a Brexit divorce deal over the next weeks, with 20% of the so-called withdrawal agreement still to be achieved.
Britain is set to leave the bloc on 30 March, but the two sides want to strike the divorce agreement by late October in order to give parliaments enough time to endorse a deal.
“On the future economic partnership, the white paper (blueprint) raises three sets of questions for which we are expecting answers,” Barnier told a press conference after consultations with EU ministers.
He said he wanted answers on whether the offer met EU guidelines, including on the free movement of goods, capital, people and technology.
He also sought to know whether the blueprint supported the integrity of the EU single market and the autonomy of European decision-making.
He cited concerns about border controls, potential fraud and unfair competition.
“We need choices and decisions, clarity and legal certainty,” the French negotiator said.
But he said the blueprint contained “several elements for a constructive discussion”, including on security cooperation.
Britons voted to leave the 28-nation bloc in June 2016, but negotiations were only launched a year later and have bogged down frequently since then.
Barnier and others are concerned about the slow pace of talks against the backdrop of political discord in Britain, including the rebellion against May over her blueprint.
May’s blueprint for the future would see Britain ask the EU for a free trade area for goods through a “facilitated customs arrangement” alongside a “common rulebook”.

Brexiteers believe that keeps Britain too close to the EU, while pro-Europeans think it fails to protect the country’s dominant services sector, among other gripes.
13 weeks
“We must rapidly find an agreement on all the subjects that are still open in the withdrawal agreement,” Barnier said, recalling there were just 13 weeks left.
He listed as a top concern the lack of progress on the future of the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland stay aligned with the bloc after Brexit if no other solution to the hard border can be found.
Under its guidelines, the EU stipulates there should be no “hard border”, such as customs checks, in order to preserve the gains of the Irish peace process.
“This requires, in particular, a legally operative backstop,” Barnier said after recalling May’s commitment to a backstop in March.
“We cannot afford to lose time on this issue,” he added.
Barnier said that is why he had asked his British counterparts next week to work on the backstop, which he calls an “all-weather insurance policy”.
But London is concerned the EU proposal would break up the UK.
It has suggested instead that the whole country remain aligned with the EU in certain areas, only until the end of 2021, but Brussels knocked that idea back.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, published a document yesterday urging the remaining 27 member states and businesses to “step up preparations” for all outcomes, including the lack of a deal.
It warned of disruptions, including to business supply chains.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that US President Donald Trump told her to “sue the EU” instead of negotiating.
May was speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr programme about private advice the US president gave to her about Brexit negotiations.
In aninterview with The Sun newspaper, Trump had said he gave May a suggestion about how to handle Brexit talks but that it may have been “too brutal”.

“I think she found it maybe too brutal, and that’s OK. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I could fully understand why she thought it was a little bit tough,” Trump said.
In this morning’s interview, May was asked about what this “brutal” advice was.
“He told me I should sue the EU. Not go into negotiations with them, sue them,” May said.
May is facing a rebellion by Brexit hardliners against her proposals to retain strong trading ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc.
In his interview with The Sun, Trump suggested such ties could make a new US-UK trade impossible.
But speaking in another interview with the Mail on Sunday, Trump said a “great trade deal” could still be possible if the UK is free to make such agreements.
“We would make a great deal with the United Kingdom because they have product that we like,” Trump said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-theresa-may-withdrawal-agreement-4298360-Oct2018/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is to tell Britain’s parliament today that Brexit negotiations are “95%” complete but that she cannot accept the European Union’s Northern Ireland border proposals – as she faces down an increasingly mutinous faction within her own party.
May has been on the receiving end of a furious backlash from Brexit hardliners in her own party after indicating at an EU summit last week that she could accept a longer post-divorce implementation phase than previously envisaged.
Her shift aimed to break an impasse in negotiations between London and Brussels over how to keep the Irish border open after Brexit, by giving the two sides more time to agree their future relationship.
But it infuriated Brexiteer colleagues who fear remaining tied to the EU for years after Britain’s formal departure next March.
Several Sunday newspaperssaid rebellious MPs were preparing a fresh bid to topple her leadership this week, many carrying colourful off-record quotes from the plotters.
In a bid to calm passions, May will address MPs in the House of Commons today where she will say the divorce deal with Brussels is nearly done.
“95% of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled,” she is to tell parliamentarians, according to a partial transcript released by her office last night.
Highlighting progress in the year-long talks, she will say agreements have now been reached across a broad range of issues including with Spain on the status of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, and with Cyprus on the UK’s military bases there.
“We have broad agreement on the structure and scope of the future relationship, with important progress made on issues like security, transport and services,” she will say.
Busted backstop
But on Ireland, she will seek to reassure MPs in her own party that she will not bow to the EU’s current proposals.
“As I set out last week, the original backstop proposal from the EU was one we could not accept, as it would mean creating a customs border down the Irish Sea and breaking up the integrity of the UK,” she will say.
“I do not believe that any UK Prime Minister could ever accept this. And I certainly will not.”

The so-called backstop is a proposal to keep either Northern Ireland or all of Britain in a customs union should future trade talks end in deadlock.
Talks have stalled over how to stop its land frontier with the Republic of Ireland becoming a hard border again.
London believes customs and other checks can be avoided through a new trade agreement with Brussels but accepts the need for a fallback plan until that deal is agreed.
However, the two sides have so far been unable to settle the terms of this so-called backstop.
Despite rumours that solidarity with Ireland is wavering in some EU quarters, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveneysaid on Fridaythat those rumours are not credible and solidarity between all EU members and Ireland remains strong.
While another EU summit was rumoured to be taking place in November, it was ruled out last Thursday. Coveney said a meeting could still be held next month, but only if the two sides make significant progress.
“There will be a summit in November if it is needed. I think what EU leaders have sensibly said is there is no point in having a summit for the sake of it, if we don’t have a deal,” he said, adding:
Coveney said it could well push into December, but was firm that a deal must be reached by Christmas so as to ensure there is adequate ratification and preparation time.
“Of course it is possible this could go into December, but really this needs to be done before Christmas. Hopefully it can be done in November, to take the pressure off everybody and give people time and space and enough time to plan.”
Despite voting in favour of a split from Europe, the British public remains deeply polarised on Brexit.
On Saturday, more than half a million anti-Brexit protesters hit the streets of London, the largest demonstration since 750,000 people showed up against the Iraq war in 2003.
Meanwhile, later today the two-day British Irish Parliamentary Assembly begins in London, with sessions held in Canary Wharf and the Palace of Westminster.
Today, the assembly will hear from Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley and Ambassador of Ireland to the UK Adrian O’Neill.

AHEAD OF THE summit between EU member states and the UK on the issue of Brexit, there isn’t much optimism that the UK will put forward a solution to the Irish border issue.
Ireland’s EU Commissioner Phil Hogan told journalists yesterday that the EU and Irish government “were waiting patiently” for a solution, or a suggestion, but that “time and patience” was wearing out.
“Everybody signed up to the backstop in December, everybody wants a frictionless border, it’s just we don’t know how the UK proposals are going to meet those objectives,” he said.
Just months before the EU parliament and UK House of Commons are scheduled to vote on the final Brexit deal, EU negotiators aren’t as advanced in negotiations as they would like to be.
The UK officially leaves the EU in March 2019, two years after Article 50 was triggered.
It’ll then enter the two-year transition phase of negotiations where trade will be debated (as of now, a new trade arrangement cannot be discussed as the UK is still technically an EU member state).
But despite this limited timeline left to hammer home a deal, the UK and EU haven’t been able to agree to workable proposal for the Irish border issue. On the 28 and 29 June the EU member states are gathering for their third major Brexit meeting.
This week also marks the two year anniversary since the Brexit referendum vote.
EU agriculture commissioner and former Fine Gael minister Hogan said “I don’t think that the British are in a very coherent position at the moment in terms of what they want”.
He added: “Time is getting shorter and patience is wearing out.”
Hogan also added that “I have never seen such solidarity on any issue” the way EU member states are towards Ireland on Brexit.
Fine Gael MEP Sean Kelly said that he didn’t believe that the EU would leave Ireland behind at the last minute, saying that EU leaders “would lose face” if they threw a small country like Ireland under the bus over an issue as sensitive as the Irish border.
London MEP Charles Tannock agreed with this assessment.
“There was shock in the UK to the solidarity expressed in Europe on the Irish issue.”
He said that there could easily be a special solution for Northern Ireland to allow them to work inside the EU customs union, a suggestion that the DUP have vehemently rejected.

“The DUP are very inconsistent,” Tannock said, citing its call for different VAT rates for the North to make it more competitive with Dublin, and its different social policies such as abortion and gay marriage.
“If the DUP were sensible and smart on this issue they would embrace having an alignment along the lines of the backstop… which would make them a magnet for investment and less reliant on Westminster and the United Kingdom as a whole for handouts.”
An ardent and prominent Tory ‘Remainer’, Tannock said “you couldn’t put cigarette paper” between his views and Labour MEP Seb Dance’s views on “the shambles and the tragedy of Brexit”.
“I think Brexit is a selfish and destructive act untangling 45 years of building a project together and done on a slim majority where on other issues you need a constitutional majority to make it binding.”
He was particularly harsh on members of his own party and their view on what a possible solution to the Irish issue could look like.
“But I have heard that mentioned quite loudly by members of my own party I’m afraid to say.”
Background
The UK government has so far put forward two suggestions for how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland – both of which have been dismissed by the EU as unworkable.
Plan A involves a new customs union arrangement between the UK and the EU, which is unworkable because the EU must treat all ‘third countries’ equally.
Plan B would see technology monitor the movement of goods across the border, but the EU has said that the technology to do this hasn’t been invented yet.
The Plan C option is the backstop – basically if there is no agreement on what to do on the island of Ireland in terms of trade and customs, that there would be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland.
The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Bill between the EU and the UK, so if there is no deal, there is no backstop and a hard border would automatically go up between the Republic and the North.
There have been reports that British officials have been briefing EU member states’ governments in an attempt to convince them that the Irish border question isn’t a red line issue.
Around three quarters of the total number of issues that pertain to Brexit have been agreed upon; the problems that remain, however, are some of the most difficult.
Once a final deal is agreed, members of the European Parliament will vote whether to approve it in October; members of the UK House of Commons will do the same.
Although there’s been talk of pushing the deadline for this vote back to November or even December, the European Parliament needs three months to debate, vote on and ratify the deal, and it needs to be done before March 2019, when the UK leaves the EU.
This leaves very little time to push back the crucial, and possibly final, Brexit vote.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-4-4422013-Jan2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that the government is looking at legal opportunities for Ireland after Brexit, saying that it could be possible for Ireland to take some business from the UK.
After the first meeting of the Cabinet of the New Year, Varadkar said that ministers had decided to prepare Brexit legislation in detail over the next two weeks, but that any no-deal legislation wouldn’t be introduced to the Dáil until March, if at all.
He said that the government agreed to explore post-Brexit opportunities for legal services.
“A partnership with the Bar Council and the Law Society, they take a view that one of the areas that could benefit from Brexit are legal services, on the basis that Ireland could… take some business from the UK.”
Varadkar also said that he had a 40-minute phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which Varadkar called an opportunity “to brainstorm a bit” on the ways in which they could help Theresa May in passing the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons.
He added that although the Irish government was happy to give assurances on the deal, but wouldn’t accept any proposals that would alter what had been agreed by the British government so far in the Withdrawal Agreement, particularly in relation to the Irish backstop.
“Remember, the UK wanted the UK-wide element [of the backstop], we were happy to accept the Northern Ireland-only element… and they also wanted the review clause.”
These two issues have proven problematic for MPs, who are concerned that they could end up in an indefinite customs arrangement with the EU.

Brexit money
The Taoiseach also said today that the Cabinet had discussed freeing up emergency aid that would be used if there was a severe Brexit outcome, in order to help businesses, farmers and fishermen to survive in a new economic environment.
“If we do face a hard Brexit or no-deal, largely what we will be looking for is State Aid clearance, which will be to use our own money to support companies, businesses and potentially farmers as well who are adversely affected by Brexit.”
“The kind of thing we will be seeking is State Aid clearance to make the transition from trading with the UK to trading with other countries.”
The Taoiseach also suggested that there were no current plans for Ireland to stockpile food or medicines, although drug wholesalers already stockpile their products.
He said that Minister for Health Simon Harris was “working closely with his department” to check with wholesalers in relation to stockpiled medicines, and said that a large amount of generics come from UK, which was something Ireland could need to prepare for.
On stockpiling food, Varadkar said that he’s “not hugely concerned”, as Ireland is an exporter. “The kind of foods [that could be limited after Brexit] are prepackaged foods from Marks & Spencer… but nobody is going to go hungry.”
“[Post-Brexit preparations are] something we’re all struggling with… Ultimately, I hope it’s going to futile,” he added.
Meanwhile, leading Brexiteer and Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg tweeted out today: “If we leave without a deal the main culprit will be the obdurate Irish Government’s threats about the phantom border issue.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-taoiseach-british-planes-irish-skies-4137889-Jul2018/,"
THE TAOISEACH LEO Varadkar has been criticised in the UK for a comment he made about UK airplanes potentially not being able to fly in Irish airspace after Brexit.
The criticism – mostly from Brexiteers, including the Sun newspaper which has taken a strongly anti-EU editorial stance – says that the Taoiseach threatened to deny British planes permission to fly in Irish skies as a way to get revenge for some of the fall-out for Brexit.
The claim:The Sun said that Leo Varadkar “threatened to block British planes flying over his country” as a “tit-for-tat response” if Theresa May cut Irish fishermen’s access to British waters after Brexit.
The background:
The direct quote from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was:
Today, the UK’s Sun newspaper’s front page carried the story; “Irish PM: I’ll ban British planes as revenge for Brexit.”
Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country.https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5G— The Sun (@TheSun)July 19, 2018The Sun/ Twitter

“The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made bizarre suggestion the UK ‘can’t take back your waters and then expect to take back other people’s sky’,” it wrote.
Conservative MEP for East England David C Bannermansaidthat Ireland would also lose out if this were to happen.
The most profitable routes for all European airlines are transatlantic routes through British airspace. They would be bankrupted if no aviation deal is done. Ryanair & Air Lingus would also be grounded. Stop this shameful blackmailhttps://t.co/Pv5w6DX49j— David C Bannerman (@DCBMEP)July 18, 2018David C Bannerman/ Twitter

Those defending Varadkar have said that the quotes were twisted out of context and that he was simply stating a fact, rather than threatening to cut relations with the UK.
Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmondwrote on Twitterthat the Taoiseach was “reiterating a factual statement that Philip Hammond [the British Chancellor for the Exchequer] also made earlier this year.”
“A crash out scenario sees the UK crash out of the EU-US open skies agreement,” Richmond wrote.
“Sighing very deeply at the number of Brexiteers (including some MPs) who have taken this as some kind of threat,” TV3′s political correspondentGavan Reilly said, ”rather than a simple acknowledgement that a no-deal Brexit means withdrawing from airspace agreements. Nobody’s blind to the effect that has for Ireland either.”

So what was the context?
Brian Lawless via PA ImagesBrian Lawless via PA Images
Varadkar and his Cabinet ministers went down to Derrynane House, Co Kerry, for a special meeting about preparations for Brexit, particularly a hard Brexit which would cause complications for the border and the Irish economy.
The government decided on a number of actions to safeguard the Irish economy against the many different forms Brexit could take, including hiringmore customs officersfor additional checks at ports and airports.
Aside from trade and tariffs, there are a number of other questions that are being addressed as part of the overall Brexit talks: the UK has said it would leave the London Fisheries Convention, which would impact the Irish industry; the defence and security implications of Brexit haven’t yet been realised; and the travel implications for those visiting the UK haven’t been agreed yet.
Among the uncertainties is the use of UK and EU airspaces, which the Taoiseach was asked about by reporters on Wednesday.
He was asked whether there was scope for an emergency treaty to ensure open airspace if the UK leaves the EU without a transition arrangement.
He was again asked if there were plans to avoid this.
What is the Single European Sky?
The Single European Sky looks after the management and regulation of airspace across the European Union. According to theEuropean Commission, the Single European Sky aims to “reform air traffic management in Europe in order to cope with sustained air traffic growth and operations under the safest, most cost- and flight-efficient and environmentally friendly conditions”.
Although the issue of aviation regulation hasn’t been at the heart of Brexit discussions, nor does it represent the reason why many British citizens voted to leave the European Union, if there’s no Brexit deal the UK would automatically go crashing out of all EU agreements, including the Single European Sky.
CONCLUSION
The UK’s Sun newspaper’s front page states: “Irish PM: I’ll ban British planes as revenge for Brexit.”
The Taoiseach was answering questions on whether there were preparations for an aviation treaty in the event of a hard Brexit, or a no-deal scenario. After being pressed on whether they were already underway, he said that there was a focus on a Brexit deal between the EU and the UK.
His comment about “using other people’s sky”, was in reference to the Single European Sky policy, and the rules that would be implemented in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Although it would be possible for the UK to leave the European Union but remain in the Single European Sky, this would have to be agreed as part of a final Brexit deal, and would also be reliant on all other issues to be agreed upon to be implemented.
The Taoiseach told RTE One’s Six One News this week that the Irish government accepts that Brexit is going to happen. He said that while a ‘no deal’ Brexit is an unlikely scenario, the government had to prepare for that possibility.
The Taoiseach was not making a threat on behalf of the Irish government, but was stating the policy of the European Union, of which Ireland is a member state. Therefore we rate this claimFALSE.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-rees-mogg-row-4013290-May2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May confronted Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg at a party meeting designed to break the deadlock over what form the UK’s future customs arrangements with the EU might take,the Times of London reported this morning.
With less than 11 months to go until Britain officially quits the union, London has yet to set out a detailed plan for trade.
Cabinet ministers are openly arguing about the government’s two proposed options on trade, which are intended to reduce the need for customs checks, particularly on the Northern Ireland border.
After a meeting two weeks ago broke up without agreement, May divided her top ministers into two groups to work on the proposals, forcing ministers to assess the merits of each idea.
Their findings will be discussed at a ministerial Brexit meeting today – but the Prime Minister met privately with Conservative MPs yesterday to discuss the government’s proposals.
The Times reports that the confrontation between May and Rees-Mogg, a hardline Brexiteer, developed after the backbencher said the UK should keep an open border with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.
May, it’s reported, suggested that Ireland would be obliged to construct border infrastructure by EU rules and warned against any move that might anger moderate nationalists.

Rees-Mogg said that he believed the UK would win any futureborder pollin Northern Ireland (citing the result of the Scottish independence referendum).
May responded, according to the paper:
Writingin the Daily Telegraph last night, Rees-Mogg suggested May “ought not to take Brussels too seriously about the Irish question” when seeking a customs deal.
Jacob Rees-Mogg and Theresa MayPA ImagesPA Images
Hardline pro-Brexit MPs have been vocal in refusing to compromise their demands for a clean break with Brussels so as to “take back control” of Britain’s laws and borders.
They have criticised May’s preferred customs plan, in which Britain would effectively collect tariffs on behalf of the EU – a plan Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has blasted as “crazy”.
They favour the “maximum facilitation” proposal, which would use technology to ease cross-border trade, while allowing Britain to set its own customs rules.
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney reiterated the Irish government’s position on post-Brexit arrangements at the weekend. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he rejected any proposals that technology be used at the border with Northern Ireland and said that a “political solution” should be found on the issue.
He also said that the Irish government had proven its own flexibility in Brexit negotiations, and that he expected Theresa May’s government to stick to what has been agreed to so far.
Related ReadsAn Irishman in Brexit Britain: 'The atmosphere has changed since the vote'
Coveney said it would be “helpful” if the British government had some consensus around the concept of the border problem.
“Let’s not forget what’s been agreed in these negotiations to date,” he said.
“Last December, there was a clear agreement that the British Prime Minister signed up to that there would be no border infrastructure of any kind on the island of Ireland and no related checks or controls.
Coveney said that the British government had made a clear commitment and that the Irish government now expected that promise to be kept.
The Tory eurosceptics wield significant influence in Downing Street, but when it comes to a vote in parliament commentators put their numbers at no more than 100 MPs – less than one third of the Conservative party.
Both the Houses of Commons and Lords will have to sign off on any final Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.
Although the findings of May’s two ministerial teams will be discussed today, a final decision is not expected this week.

GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA Merkel today said there has been progress on Brexit ahead of a crunch summit but warned that the “devil is in the detail”.
Merkel’s cautious assessment comes one week before EU leaders meet in Brussels for what might be the last chance to seal a deal on Britain’s divorce from the European Union.
“There is progress,” Merkel said during a press conference with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, but “everything is solved only when everything is solved”.
“I hope for progress next week. We are pleased that there are intensive discussions, but the devil is in the detail,” the German leader added.
Merkel stressed that the other 27 EU countries were “very united” and that they “very, very” much trust the union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.
Rutte said meanwhile that he was “cautiously optimistic” about a deal at the summit.
“I think we can be very cautiously optimistic next week that we can take steps there,” Rutte said. “A lot depends on the conversations in the coming days.”

Border
The details at stake are mainly over how to avoid the return of border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, amid fears they might put the Good friday Agreement at risk.
Barnier today said a deal was “within reach” but that Britain had to accept some customs controls between Northern Ireland and the UK, in order to protect the integrity of the EU’s single market.
The EU fears that without such controls, goods coming from post-Brexit Britain not subject to the union’s rules might slip into Ireland and then the rest of the bloc.
British Prime Minister Theresa May and the DUP reject any encroachment on British sovereignty.
May is due in Brussels on 17 October for a last-ditch appeal to EU leaders, while frantic negotiations go on round the clock in Brussels.
The EU has said that without “decisive progress” by next week’s summit they will not go ahead with a further meeting in November to finalise a Brexit deal.
That would see Britain crashing out of the EU in March 2019 with no customs or trade arrangements with the bloc, leading to potentially disastrous economic consequences.

FEARS HAVE BEEN raised about the impact that Brexit could have on Ireland’s alcoholic products – particularly smaller brewers.
Checks along the border could end the free-flowing supply chain, delaying the packaging process and increasing costs.
Since 1759, Guinness has been brewed at the St James’s Gate brewery, a vast brickwork complex on the River Liffey. Tankers then bring the stout across the border to be packaged in Belfast before they’re shipped abroad.
“The Irish drinks market is completely an all-Ireland economy,” Patricia Callan, director of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland told AFP in a Dublin pub roaring with trade.
This week, representatives of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland met with the EU Commission’s Taskforce Article 50 to discuss their concerns.
“Tariffs on our cross-border supply chains would add significant costs to Irish and Northern Irish whiskey distilleries and breweries, damaging cost-competitiveness and threatening sales and jobs,” Callan said.
This all-island economy business-model isn’t unique to the drinks industry either: the farming community in Northern Ireland send 40% of sheep to the south, and milk in Northern Ireland is sent to factories in the south where it’s then turned into cheese (more on how this works here).
The road to Brexit
Both the UK and Irish governments have pledged that no hard border infrastructure will interrupt trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.
But the UK and EU are locked in a stalemate over the “backstop”, which both sides agreed in December would ensure there would be no hard border in Ireland through agreeing “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland if no other deal is agreed.
Little progress is being made and, as the 29 March divorce date approaches, the spectre of border checks is vexing the Irish drinks industry – which makes 23,000 border crossings yearly, according to Callan.
“Any delay at all to that, even an hour’s delay, would work out at about €100 per truck cost,” she explained.
Guinness is owned by global drinks goliath Diageo, which with 2017 net sales in excess of €14 billion, holds coffers likely capable of absorbing economic shock.
Around 35% of the company’s beer including Guinness and other brands are produced at St James’ Gate, according to 2014 figures. Three million pints of “the black stuff” are brewed here every day.
But Diageo chiefs have told how they sit at the top of a supply chain of hundreds of smaller more exposed companies providing the key ingredients with no thought for border crossings.

A no-deal Brexit could result in a range of new tariffs on the drink industry’s cross-border supply chains (although there are no tariffs on beer itself):
“For us having kind of a frictionless border where you can move people and goods is incredibly important,” John Kennedy, the president of Diageo Europe, said last year.
“We’ll figure that out as a big company, but then you add the supply chain of medium and small companies that we work with who multiply that number significantly – it could be a big burden if crossing the border became onerous for them.”
Seamus Leheny of Northern Ireland’s Freight Transport Association said Brexit turbulence could cause complications for Diageo’s Northern Ireland plant.
“They’re just treating it as business as usual but I know they’re concerned,” he said.
Those remarks were echoed by Vince Cable, the leader of the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats opposition party, at the start of November. He said Diageo brands like Guinness and Baileys face being “seriously disrupted”.
But in its2019 Interim Results release, published on 31 January 2019, Diageo said that it had no plans to change its supply chain.
Guinness is the eighth largest beer export in Europe, valued at €273 million in 2017 according to October figures from the Irish Brewers’ Association.
But Guinness bound for abroad could be doubly exposed to post-Brexit border checks, as after it is packed in Belfast it heads south once more to be shipped from Dublin port.
Trickle down costs?
While the business and political elites are trying to forecast shifting trade winds, it is the end consumer who could feel the pain of any trickle-down increase in costs.
The prospect is unwelcome at The Gap O’ the North, a rustic pub built into the verdant hillsides of Jonesborough, Northern Ireland.
The pub is just half a kilometre away from the border on the busy motorway link between Dublin and Belfast.
“This pub’s known for a good pint of stout,” veteran landlord John Fearon told AFP.
The 65-year-old publican said he feared that any uptick in price could have already hard-up drinkers up in arms.
This article was updated on the 8 February 2019 to include a statement from Diageo’s interim report, which contradict other third party statements that the company’s supply chain would be “seriously disrupted”.","7.30am, 10 Nov 2018",
https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-northern-ireland-4059290-Jun2018/,"UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Boris Johnson has said that he thinks the concerns about the negative effects Brexit could have are over exaggerated, and said that it’s “beyond belief” that relations in Northern Ireland are dictating the debate.
In an audio recordingobtained by Buzzfeed News, Johnson said that concerns about the Irish border were “pure millennium bug stuff” and referenced “planes falling from the sky”.
We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.”
The UK government has said that it wants to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and that it will honour the Good Friday Agreement. But it has also said that it will leave the single market and the customs union, which would warrant customs checks and passport verification on traffic between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit.
This has prompted the European Union, the Irish government and other political commentators to ask how the two could coexist. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has repeatedly called for the UK to suggest a proposal – yesterday they published a legal text that aims to solve the customs arrangements between the North and Republic. (Initial criticisms of the text have called it unclear.)
Reacting today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the UK Brexit paper published yesterday is a “step forward”. He said essentially the paper outlines that there will be a temporary customs arrangement “until something better can be agreed”.
While the UK government has proposed that a “backstop” plan be put in place should there be no Brexit border deal would end in 2021, Coveney said it is not a definitive end date.
He added that it is an “aspirational date”.

Technology at the border
UK negotiator David Davis has suggested that technology could solve the border issue through tracking the movement of people and goods, but critics have said that that technology doesn’t exist yet.
Johnson compared the ability of people to use Oyster cards to tag on and off as a possible solution to the Irish border issue.
In other parts of the audio tapes recorded at a private gathering, Johnson said that it was worth considering how controversial US President Donald Trump would approach negotiations with the EU.
He said that his admiration for Trump had grown and that he’s of the opinion that “there is method in his madness”.
Leo Varadkar is visiting Northern Ireland today, and is scheduled to visit the Orange Order Museum and launch theFéile an Phobail festival. This is his sixth visit to the North as Taoiseach and the first visit by a serving Taoiseach to the Orange Order Museum.
Brexit talks have reinvigorated discussions around a united Ireland, as it would allow the North to remain in the European Union. (Northern Ireland benefits hugely from EU funding and grants, mostly for the agriculture sector.)
A BBC News opinion poll has put support for a united Ireland at 42.1%, with 45% wanting to remain in the UK and 12.7% saying they don’t know.

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-brexit-2-4042909-May2018/,"Updated 1pm
JUSTICE MINISTER CHARLIE Flanagan has told rank-and-file gardaí that they do not need to be concerned about the prospect of policing a sealed border between the north and south of Ireland, but he has no ruled out the possibility of a hard border.
Delegates at the annual conference of the Garda Representative Association (GRA) today referenced the sealing of the border during the BSE crisis and questioned how the force would manage if that happened again and was permanent.
In his speech this morning, Flanagan said there will not be a sealed border,but he did not rule out the possibility that significant resources would have to be deployed to the border after Brexit.
“One of the greatest challenges being faced by the country at the moment is the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. I was at a border station recently in Dundalk with members of An Garda Síochána. I realise the challenge that is Brexit. I’m in contact with garda management to ensure contingency plans are in place for Brexit,” he said.
“It’s too early to say where the ball will actually land but I believe it’s important that gardaí are Brexit ready.”
Yesterday, gardaí stationed in border areas said they were concerned that there will be a surge in crime in the event of a hard border. They said garda management still has not told them what kind of resource support they will receive to deal with the Brexit aftermath.
Garda James Morrisroe, who represents members in the Cavan-Monaghan division, said he is not aware that there is any contingency plan now for a proposed hard border.
“If the border comes to fruition, by my estimation, there are 208 crossing points north and south, so if you just add that up you’d be talking about 1,000 extra permanent gardaí to be based on the border and that’s the conservative estimate because you have 500km of border between Northern Ireland and southern Ireland. That’s a lot of resources and even at the moment we’re struggling for resources along the rural hinterland that is the border,” he explained.

His colleague Brendan O’Connor, Central Executive Committee member for Donegal gardaí, also pointed out that security services in the North and in the UK have acknowledged that discussions around Brexit and the possibility of any sort of border “is driving young disaffected youth”. He said there they are seeing an increase in recruitment in subversive groups.
“Any infrastructure put on place that is a symbol of that division is a focus for those people who are of that persuasion.”
He said symbolically, a border between the north and south would be “going back to a time we had moved away from” and that has the potential to prompt increased activity from these subversive groups on both sides of the border.
Donegal borders the north-west and it has been acknowledged that there’s a significant number of dissident Republicans operating in the north-west of Northern Ireland so by default our members who are out on country roads on patrol are going to encounter those people and they’re exposed to that danger. He said there is a need for armed back-up for officers working along the border.
When asked about policing a hard border, Acting Garda Commissioner Donall Ó Cualáin said “the outcome of the political discussions is for the politicians”.
“All I can do and I have tasked Deputy Commissioner (John) Twomey with ensuring that we are looking into all possible outcomes and that we are preparing for whatever one might land.
“That means that we have a team working internally looking at all scenarios and also that we cooperate fully with the external police services in the north and also across the Irish sea.”
He said until they see what the political agreement is, they can’t really plan in any great detail.
“At the end of the day, the government have committed to increasing our strength to 15,000 members which will be the highest in the history of An Garda Síochána.
“It is our job to ensure they are deployed in the most efficient way. That includes all of the challenges we face.”

THERESA MAY says that Britain and the EU will hold more talks in the coming days, denying reports that bloc leaders refused her plea for reassurances on her Brexit plan.
The British Prime Minister welcomed a statement issued by the other 27 EU leaders restating their position on arrangements for the Irish border, which has caused MPs in Britain to threaten to reject the deal.
“As formal conclusions, these commitments have legal status and therefore should be welcomed,” she told reporters after a Brussels summit, but added that MPs would require further assurances.
It follows talks between May and EU Council President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and others in Brussels this afternoon.
“I note there has been reporting that the EU is not willing to consider any further clarification,” she said.
“The EU is clear – as I am – that if we are going to leave with a deal this is it,” she said.
“But my discussions with colleagues today have shown that further clarification and discussion following the Council’s conclusions is in fact possible.
“There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK parliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.”
Reaction ‘unsurprising’
May, meanwhile, confirmed her government would be “talking further” about its preparations for the possibility Britain leaves the EU on March 29 with no agreement in place.
“I believe it’s better to leave with a deal, with a good deal and I believe the deal we have is a good deal,” she said.
DUP leader Arlene Foster – whose party is propping up the Conservatives in the House of Commons under a confidence and supply deal – hit out at both May and the EU following the meetings.

“The reaction by the EU is unsurprising,” she said in a statement.
“They are doing what they always do. The key question is whether the prime minister will stand up to them or whether she will roll over as has happened previously.
“This is a difficulty of the prime minister’s own making. A deal was signed off which the prime minister should have known would not gain the support of parliament.”
After meeting May, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that while some of her suggestions “made sense”, others were “difficult”.
Varadkar said the EU might be able to give Britain “a greater assurance” that speedy talks on a new UK-EU trade deal would mean the backstop would never need to be used.
Deal ‘a trap’
With May having promised to have something to offer MPs before they finally vote on the Brexit deal by 21 January, Juncker said she would have to come up with proposals in the next few weeks if she wanted Europe’s support.
However, he said he would publish further plans on Wednesday to protect European businesses and citizens in case the deal fails, and Britain exits on 29 March with no new arrangements place.
May told EU leaders they must help her “change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK cannot escape”, adding: “Until we do, the deal — our deal — is at risk.”
“With the right assurances, this deal can be passed. Indeed it is the only deal that is capable of getting through my parliament,” she told them.
But while an early draft of the summit conclusions had said the EU “stands ready to examine whether any further assurances can be provided” on the backstop, this was removed from the final published version.
Juncker did offer one olive branch, promising that talks on the future trading relationship – a deal on which would undermine the need for the backstop – would start as soon as MPs and the European Parliament approved the Brexit deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/getting-ireland-brexit-ready-4407811-Dec2018/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS spent just under €200,000 on its six “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready” events throughout the country.
As Ireland’s close proximity and links to the UK leaves it particularly vulnerable to any kind of Brexit, the government said it was hosting these events so businesses could be informed on how they’ll have to adapt after the planned date Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.
Earlier this month, the government published its plans for dealing with a no-deal Brexit as the risk continues to heighten that the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal.
Responding to a parliamentary question last week by Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said these events were set up to “inform and advise about Brexit preparedness, and the range of support measures and resources the government has put in place”.
Those took place were in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Letterkenny, with a total attendance of around 2,500 across the six events.
Over a dozen agencies and government departments were brought together “under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses”.
The events gained coverage in the UK, as noted by Coveney in his response. Sky News reporter Faisal Islam attended the roadshow in Galway, and said there is “nothing like this in the UK” for its businesses to get Brexit-ready.

Coveney added that the Department of Foreign Affairs’ dedicated Brexit website had been viewed 26,000 times.
Outlining the costs involved, Coveney said “every effort” was made to keep them to a “necessary minimum”.

Venue hire, catering and related costs amounted to €66,884.22
Event staging and audio-visual equipment cost €55,183.96, while advertising and design cost €37,729.75.
In all, the events cost the government €198,288.20.
There are no further events planned at this time.
The pressure is expected to ramp up again in the New Year, with Theresa May hoping to win parliament’s support for her already-delayed vote on the Brexit deal her government has agreed with the EU.

Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Marian Finucane Show, Varadkar said that anything that pulls the two communities apart undermines the Good Friday Agreement.
The Good Friday Agreement is seen as a political foundation for peace in Northern Ireland after decades of violence and uncertainty brought by the Troubles. A detailed analysis of the agreement can beread here.
The Irish border has proved to be one of the major sticking points in Brexit negotiations to date.
“Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and it is fraying the relationship between Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar said.
“Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement, and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship,” he said.

Yesterday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Britain’s Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said they “hoped and expected” that Brexit negotiators would secure a final agreementin the coming weeks, adding that both sides are very close with getting it over the line.

The Tánaiste said a number of things are still required, stating that negotiators on both sides still have no basis as of yet to indicate political sign off if an EU summit is called.
At yesterday’s meeting, it was agreed “top level summits” alternating between Ireland and Britain each year would be held between the two government, and these would be backed-up by close bilateral work between ministers.
Lidington said such meetings would be “vital” to maintain the close links between the two countries, due to ministers and leaders not being able to meet regularly at EU summits, as is typically the case.
Stormont deadlock
Varadkar also went on to say he has a good relationship with DUP leader Arlene Foster.
He said the DUP and Sinn Féin need to come together and come to an agreement to get the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running again.
He added that if there was some clarity on Brexit in the next couple of weeks or months, there would be an opportunity to get the Executive up and running again.
The government in Northern Ireland collapsed in January 2017 following the DUP’s and Sinn Féin’s failure to agree on a number of issues.
Since then, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government has resisted pressure to impose reform on Northern Ireland, arguing that decisions are best made in Belfast.

But as much as we’d like to, we just can’t run away from our past. So we endeavour to move on, to progress.
If we can’t forget the past then for the sake of our children we must forgive it. They shouldn’t have to relive all that hurt and bitterness, not of their making.
But that’s exactly what Brexit is threatening to do, to drag us all back down a dark memory lane kicking and screaming to a non-abating time when every man, woman, fox and child played endless games of ‘catch me if you can’ with gardaí, RUC and customs men.
For the families of the missing, this is what a hard border looks like and feels like – regardless of its physical dismantling some 20 years ago in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement.
The local bog, where children worked summers, was a makeshift twilight zone where British helicopters would illegally fly into unapproved airspace and as an unwitting lookout, you would alert the bog boss, (a deaf IRA man in hiding who lost his hearing in some botched backwater petrol station bombing) about the threat overhead.
And as he scurried off like some cornered rat into the nearest hedge we’d make hay, grabbing the un-surveilled few moments to partake in our own turf war, throwing sods at each other, boys against the girls.
That was our projection, our way of dealing with having to visit burial houses of our fathers’ friends – blown up while out tending to their cattle because they’d refused to pay protection money – still an unfortunate and wholly deceptive racket of a term.
But that’s what fear, anger and hate does, it makes people, including families, turn on their own like disturbed ferrets that eat their young.
In the forgotten unapproved village of Mullan on the Armagh border, a stone’s throw from our family home in Emyvale, Co Monaghan, we’d cross a little bridge on foot (as no cars had access) and torture the little blind woman who owned the Crow’s Nest, a shop-cum-sibin for sweets that weren’t available in the south.
Advertisement
Like braille, she would slowly rub the coins between her fingers to read the currency to decipher if it were punt or sterling she had just been handed.
At the Co. Tyrone border checkpoint in Aughnacloy, 4km away, theCharlie and the Chocolate Factorytwist continued with the high rising ironclad watchtowers that dominated the borderland skies and doubled as a giant free for all sweetshop.
Here young soldiers would fire packets of crisps into our car with foreign brands and flavours never to be found in the south, Golden Wonder Sausage & Tomato, Beef & Onion.
That random act of kindness would soon bear a bad taste though, sullied by the shooting dead of a young footballer on his way to a GAA match.
Suspicion and confusion were rife. As children, we didn’t know who we were but we knew who we were supposed to be for. With identity crisis came shame, shame for preferring the side you shouldn’t – because it offered more colour, more fantasy.
Children innately seek out colour during dark times, sometimes it’s the only protection available when a country’s at war and rightly or wrongly, north of the border with its rebellious red white and blue kerbed streets had more of a lure for a southern child.
There they had fairytale weddings with real princes and princesses but for every Charles and Di poster that hung from a northern telephone pole, different kinds of posters hung from the southern poles that year.
As much as you tried not to look at the emaciated, embattled, hunger striker images of Kieran Doherty during that scorcher of the summer of 1981, you couldn’t help but look and in an instant, all fantasy and hope would die off.
Brexit, like every other issue of national interest on this island, starts with a conversation we can all relate to and bring something to – but as soon as the political heads get their spin on it we’re down another rabbit hole, warbling away about customs unions, single markets and phase twos.
The power struggle we are witnessing this week is all about political careers and not one bit about people’s best interests. The human thread is long cut from the conversation.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-2-4359763-Nov2018/,"LAST UPDATE|26 Nov 2018
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said whether the UK holds a second Brexit referendum is a matter the country would have to decide for themselves.
He told reporters in Dublin today that he did not want to speculate on the prospect of a second referendum, stating that he respects the decision the British people made to leave the EU.
Whether the UK holds another referendum is something the British public will have to conclude themselves, rather than have “outsiders pushing” it, said Varadkar.
He reiterated the points he made in Brussels yesterday, stating:
“It is this deal or a no deal scenario.”
The Taoiseach was also asked to outline what contingency plans are in place for a no deal Brexit. He said he did not envisage there would be such a scenario, but added:
“We are preparing for two scenarios. One is call the central case scenario which is pretty much the deal that’s been done. The second is a hard Brexit, cliff-edge, no-deal scenario.
“In many ways, it’s the same thing, it’s just a graduated response upwards. We are making those preparations. But we need to be realistic here. There’s no country in the European Union that can be fully prepared for a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit. That’s why it makes sense to agree to this deal.”
He added that the EU Commission has in recent weeks been releasing the measures that would need introduced, such as changes in aviation regulation.
Varadkar also said that Sinn Féin politicians who refuse to take their seats at Westminster should consider resigning their seats. Sinn Fein argues that its members were elected on an abstentionist policy, and will not take the oath of allegiance to the Queen.
The Taoiseach said there is an “option now of resigning their seats and allowing people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster”.
“Bear in mind there are 18 MPs in Northern Ireland, eight of those 10 including Lady Sylvia Hermon are in support of what the UK government are proposing. But seven of those eight because of Sinn Féin aren’t going to show up,” he said.
Speaking earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said there is no second deal on offer to the British government if the House of Commons votes down the Brexit deal agreed between the UK and the EU.
No second deal on offer
Speaking onRTE’s Morning Ireland, Coveney said it was made very clear to leaders at the summit in Brussels yesterday that a deal has been reached, and a second deal is not on offer.
He said UK Prime Minister Theresa May now has to make it very clear to her parliament that the deal will give her country an “orderly, managed Brexit”.
“There is no second deal on offer if the UK decides to reject this,” he said.
A contingency plan will have to be put in place in the case of a no deal Brexit, said Coveney, however, he ruled out the prospect of a hard border in a crashout Brexit scenario.
He acknowledged that it would make it a lot more “complicated” to avoid a hard border if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.

Coveney said it would be “very foolish” not to use the solution which has taken both sides over two years to negotiate.
Speaking at a press conference after all 27 European Union leaders endorsed the Brexit deal at a summit in Brussels yesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said:
“There isn’t a plan B. The truth is what we have here is the best deal that is available both for the United Kingdom and for the European Union.
“We have a backstop in place but we all agree that that’s an insurance policy that has to be there, but would only need to be invoked under certain circumstances.”
DUP leaderArlene Foster has saidthat Prime Minister May will need to remove backstop provisions in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement if she is to count on her party’s support.
Coveney pointed out today that the agreement signed up to includes some of the same provisions agreed to by all parties in December of last year, including the DUP.
The deal
The agreement sealed yesterday prepares for Britain’s smooth exit from the European Union on 29 March 2019, and sets out a vision for “as close as possible a partnership” afterwards.
It covers financial matters, citizens’ rights, provisions to keep open Britain’s border with Ireland and arrangements for a 21-month post-Brexit transition phase.
The lengthy, legally enforceable divorce deal is accompanied by a short political declaration setting out hopes for future ties, including security, trade and migration.
Following yesterday’s summit, the focus now shifts to the UK Prime Minister who is beginning an intensive campaign to sell the Brexit deal to her parliament.
May is expected to convene her Cabinet and update parliament on the newly-agreed Brexit deal today.
But she faces a big battle to win MPs’ approval ahead of a vote next month, with many opposed to the deal, including some in her own party.
“We can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future,” May will tell the House of Commons, according to excerpts of her planned remarks released by Downing Street.
“Or this house can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one.
“It would open the door to more division and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail,” she will warn lawmakers.
She will now embark on an intensive nationwide campaign promoting the plan — and the dangers of no-deal — ahead of the vote by lawmakers on or around 12 December, according to reports.
“I believe our national interest is clear,” she will tell MPs Monday.
“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country whichever way we voted.”

Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin told reporters earlier today that he has heard a “very dangerous” suggestion is being made in Europe that the Irish backstop issue should be deferred.
He told the Dáil that he has been speaking to his European colleagues in other Labour parties who suggest the Irish backstop issue might be postponed.
“It’s only a suggestion at this stage. But it would be deeply dangerous for Ireland’s interests. And any such suggestion must be resisted,” he said.
Coveney dismissed any such suggestion, stating that at no point during his conversations with other EU leaders is anyone is questioning or undermining the Irish position.
He said solidarity has been pledged by all 26 foreign ministers as well as Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator for Europe.
The Tánaiste said he is in Brussels a lot more than Howlin, and solidarity is “as strong as it has ever been”.
“I am not sure what sources Howlin is getting his information from,” Coveney told reporters in Luxemburg today, adding that Howlin’s sources are not as credible as the pledge of solidarity he got from Barnier in an hour-long meeting this afternoon.

A government spokesperson has said there is “no basis” for Howlin’s suggestion whatsoever.
Ireland is most vulnerable to exposure post-Brexit, said Coveney, who said the EU negotiators and member States remain supportive of the Irish position.
He said it remains the case that the backstop must be included in the withdrawal agreement “unless and until” another solution is found. No one wants the backstop to ever be used, but Ireland needs it to be in the agreement as an insurance mechanism, said Coveney.
Tomorrow is the deadline set down for a withdrawal agreement to be signed off, however it is expected it will not get over the line.
Coveney said he accepted that “more time” is needed to allow the UK and EU teams to re-engage. Another summit is expected to be held in November or December if an agreement is not struck tomorrow.
The European Union President Donald Tuskhas warned that a ‘no deal’Brexit scenario is “more likely than ever before”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil today that a no deal Brexit remains unlikely, however, he said Ireland has been preparing for such a scenario.
The Tánaiste said a lot has been agreed so far, but reminded people today that many of the choices are difficult “because of the choices that Britain have made” and are not due to the choices the EU has made.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rbs-planning-worst-brexit-4215058-Sep2018/,"
THE ROYAL BANK of Scotland, which owns Ulster Bank, has warned that it is planning “for the worst” amid increased talk of no deal over Brexit.
Chief executive Ross McEwan said RBS is setting up a new European subsidiary in Amsterdam to serve customers on the continent, but is awaiting for approval of its licences.
With Britain and the European Union yet to agree on what their future relationship should look like, McEwan told the BBC that RBS may lose business without a deal.
“If we don’t get the right licences, and we don’t get them in time, that could create major problems for our customers and for the bank,” McEwan said.
McEwan said RBS had already deployed 150 staff to Amsterdam, and if regulators failed to approve trading licences for the operations, it would stop offering services to some of its European customers.
“In the next couple of months, we’re going to have to make some decisions… we’re going to have to think about which European customers we may not be able to bank,” he said.
Leaving the EU
Britain is set to leave the EU on 30 March 2019.

The two sides want to reach a divorce deal by October or November to give their parliaments time to endorse it.
In July, Prime Minister Theresa May put forward a blueprint for future trade ties that envisages a free trade area for goods, agriculture and food through a customs agreement and common rulebook.
But the plan calls for looser ties in banking and financial services, which the City of London said would deal a “real blow” for the hugely important sector.
May’s vision has also attracted fierce opposition from her own ruling Conservatives, who think it keeps Britain too closely aligned to the EU.
It sparked the resignations of former Brexit Secretary David Davis and then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Davis criticised the proposal again today, saying May’s plan was “actually almost worse than being in” the EU and vowed to vote against it if it goes to parliament.
Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox dismissed warnings from Chancellor Philip Hammond over the long-term impacts of a no-deal Brexit on government borrowing and gross domestic product.
“This idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow,” he told the BBC.
“I don’t believe it is possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions on GDP,” he said.

She made the commentdays after an interviewwhere she commented that a “crash Brexit” would not be the time to look at a Border poll or a united Ireland.
McDonald made the remarks this afternoon during her keynote speech at the National Hunger Strike Commemoration in Castlewellan, Co Down. While there, she said that the process of building a new and united Ireland must involve a dialogue which includes unionists.
She also said that the Irish government has a responsibility to lead an informed and respectful discussion on the matter.
Speaking at the event, McDonald said that a referendum on a united Ireland is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.
“The need for a referendum to end partition is writ large. The time for a unity Referendum is drawing near,” said the Sinn Féin leader. “It is not a question of if a unity referendum will happen but a question of when.”
“So too is the urgent need for dialogue to manage the change that is coming. That dialogue must involve unionist political leaders. Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition.”
The party has previously stated that a vote on Irish unificationshould happen within five yearsbut McDonald has said it should not be pushed through.
Today, she said that the Irish government in particular “has a responsibility to lead an informed, reasoned and respectful public dialogue on this issue”.

“We are entering a defining period in Irish political history,” said McDonald. “Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively. A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.”
Speaking specifically about Brexit, McDonald said:
“As Britain turns away from Europe, the appeal of being part of a new and outward-looking Ireland will, I believe, prove ever more attractive to some within the unionist community.”
Regarding Sinn Féin’s vision of a United Ireland, McDonald said it “will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation.”
She said her party is committed to re-establishing the Northern Irish Executive and Assembly, which collapsed in early 2017.
“The Irish and British governments have said there will be a new round of talks in the autumn. That is welcome,” she said. “However basic rights, respect and equality cannot be disregarded, they are not bargaining chips. They are for all in society. Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone. Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.”
McDonald said that it is “not sufficient” for the two governments to only call a talks process. “They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full,” she said.
“The way to unlock the political process is to make clear that rights enjoyed in the rest of Ireland and across Britain will be implemented in the north.”
She said that they are dealing with a British government “that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office”.
“That is why we need a strong Irish government leading on these issues,” she concluded.

AFTER A BUSY day of Brexit manoeuvring, the Taoiseach and DUP leader Arlene Foster met in Dublin this evening.
The meeting came after the UK Prime Minister told the House of Commons that the EU is looking at the possibility of including the entire UK under the backstop – but that there’s not enough time to explore the detail of this option in the time left to strike a deal.
According to a spokesperson for Leo Varadkar, “there was a very pleasant atmosphere and a good discussion” around Brexit, devolution in Northern Ireland and the need to get power-sharing back up and running in Stormont.
“Both parties emphasised that no matter what happens, it’s vital to have real and mutual understanding across the border and to maintain north south cooperation,” continued the spokesperson’s statement.
Also on the list of topics discussed was the cross-border congenital heart disease network board, upcoming commemorations, transport and tourism cooperation and the Belfast-Dublin rail link.
Brexit
Earlier today, May said that the EU wanted “a backstop for the backstop” as a solution to this: their suggestion was that Northern Ireland would be included in the customs union and single market until a more complete deal with the UK is agreed.
She said that this wasn’t acceptable to the UK.
“We cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our precious union,” she told parliamentarians.
During her speech to the House of Commons this afternoon, May aimed to calm concerns about what kind of Brexit deal her government is actually negotiating, saying that she wouldn’t accept a deal that would “carve off” Northern Ireland from the UK under a different customs arrangement.
She said that a Canada style deal was only on offer for Great Britain, and not for Northern Ireland, but that it “doesn’t guarantee frictionless trade” on the island of Ireland either.
She said that there were a number of customs solutions for Northern Ireland had been explored: including one that would involve customs posts “that would become targets”; one that would offer a level of surveillance that would be unacceptable for the people of Northern Ireland.
She said that they also wouldn’t accept a backstop agreement that would leave the entire UK within the customs union indefinitely, or that would restrain it from making trade deals with other countries outside the European Union.
May told the House of Commons that there were only two outstanding issues (prompting laughs from parliamentarians): what territories would be included in the backstop, and whether it would be indefinite or not.

The statement prompted a series of questions, and laughter in some cases.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that “this really is beginning to feel like Groundhog day”: “Another ‘nothing-has-changed’ moment from the government.”
“The Chequers plan is dead in the water,” he said as May shook her head.
One parliamentarian questioned why the statement was being given now, and said that for the people of Ireland, “Brexit means borders”.
Another parliamentarian questioned whether they would need to extend Article 50 to give them more time to negotiate a deal.

The British premier announced that she would make a statement to parliament this afternoon after reports of an impasse over the backstop agreement for Northern Ireland.
The statement comes before EU leaders convene this Wednesday and Thursday for the European Council summit on Brexit, to discuss the outstanding details to a final deal. The major stumbling block is still the Irish border issue.
According to reports in the British media, the deadlock in talks is a ruse by the UK government in order to push Brexiteers in the Tory party to back a deal with the EU.
The Irish government, meanwhile, denies that a no-deal scenario (which would automatically result in a hard border reemerging on the island of Ireland) is the most likely outcome. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said, however that a Brexit deal could be delayed until December.
“We are at a sensitive phase and I know some people were optimistic about an agreement on the withdrawal protocol this week, I have to say I always thought that was unlikely, I figure November or December is the best opportunity for a deal.”

Speaking this afternoon in Dublin ahead of a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that “the whole of the United Kingdom” must leave the European Union together.
Calling for “a sensible Brexit”, Foster reiterated her position that there should be no barriers between Northern Ireland and the UK.
Foster said that “the way forward” was to have no internal barriers between Northern Ireland and the UK.
Following a meeting with Foster this afternoon, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that Northern Ireland has the opportunity to get the “best of both worlds” post-Brexit.

Staying within the EU customs union while still having access to the UK market makes sense, Martin said, “given the relative underdevelopment of Northern Ireland”.
The Fianna Fáil leader added that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging and that “everyone you talk to wants to avoid” it.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-europe-visit-4387299-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2018

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is to visit Germany’s Angela Merkel today as she works to salvage her Brexit deal, the day after delaying a parliamentary vote on it to avoid a crushing defeat.
May will first go to The Hague for talks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte before meeting Merkel in Berlin, as she struggles to unite MPs behind her faltering plan.
The embattled leader is facing a rebellion in her own party and from parliamentary allies that threatens to sink both the agreement and her leadership.
“I will now do everything I possibly can to secure further assurances,” May told mutinous MPs yesterday on her planned dash to Europe ahead of an EU summit later this week.
“I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this house has expressed,” she said.
But European Council president Donald Tusk warned the bloc would not reopen the agreement secured in November after months of negotiations, with Brexit looming on 29 March.
“We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.
EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker agreed with that sentiment when he said there’s “no room whatsoever for the renegotiation” of the Brexit deal.
I will meet@theresa_maythis evening in Brussels. I remain convinced that the#Brexitdeal we have is the best - and only - deal possible. There is no room for renegotiation, but further clarifications are possible.— Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU)December 11, 2018Jean-Claude Juncker/ Twitter
I will meet@theresa_maythis evening in Brussels. I remain convinced that the#Brexitdeal we have is the best - and only - deal possible. There is no room for renegotiation, but further clarifications are possible.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthis morning, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the EU Council would seek ways to reassure the British parliament that the backstop is “nothing to be feared”.
“There’s no ulterior motive here, the backstop is an insurance mechanism to safeguard the peace process. The backstop is not something to be feared by the British parliament.”
But he also said that there wouldn’t be changes to the current deal:
“There were hard-won compromises on both sides, as outlined by the UK. To renegotiate a deal that took two years to negotiate doesn’t seem realistic.”
Coveney said that he would bring a detailed paper to Cabinet today the contingency plans for the “central case scenario” – which means if there is a deal.
Although the government has been making preparations for Brexit on the assumption that there would be a deal, Coveney said that the focus will shift slightly towards no-deal Brexit preparations.
“I still think a no-deal Brexit is unlikely… [but] if the worst were to happen that Ireland would be ready.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tuskspoke over the phoneyesterday, the Department of the Taoiseach confirmed.
“They agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement is the best option and could not be renegotiated. They also agreed that preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome should intensify,” a spokesperson said.
Tusk said the other 27 EU leaders would discuss Brexit at a special meeting on Thursday, at the start of a pre-planned summit in Brussels which May will attend.

Lawmaker outrage
MPs in the House of Commons were due to vote tonight on the deal with Brussels, which covers the terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union after 46 years.
But facing a huge rebellion of her own Tory MPs, primarily over the backstop clause designed to keep open the Irish border, May conceded she expected to lose and delayed it.
The decision sent the pound plunging, and both sides said they would step up preparations for the potentially disastrous scenario that Britain leaves with no deal.
The delay also prompted outrage among lawmakers, with one leading Conservative rebel, Brexit-supporter Mark Francois, accusing the government of having “hidden in the toilets”.
In a sign of the uproar, an opposition Labour MP was ejected from the House of Commons after picking up the ceremonial mace in protest at the government’s conduct.
The mace – a symbol of royal authority required to sit in its place for parliament to pass laws – was last taken from its place in protest in 2009.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is facing calls to table a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, secured an emergency debate for today on the decision to pull the vote.
“The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray,” he said.
Labour added it would hold off on trying to unseat May for now.
“We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful,” a party spokesperson said.
Political chaos
Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, expressed his disbelief at the political chaos engulfing Westminster.
“After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote,” he tweeted. ”It’s time they make up their mind!”
May spoke at the weekend to Tusk, Merkel and Varadkar, raising speculation they offered some hope of further concessions.
EU leaders have repeatedly warned they have no appetite to reopen a divorce deal.
But some bloc officials have mentioned the possibility of changes to the accompanying political declaration on future trade ties.
Anand Menon, European politics professor at King’s College London, said May needed Brussels to make it “absolutely clear” no major concessions are on offer – no matter who is prime minister.
“What they might do is add some language to the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement,” he added.
“I imagine they’ll add some language saying that both sides remain convinced that we’ll never need to use the backstop”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/london-embassy-brexit-4377741-Dec2018/,"IRISH CITIZENS LIVING in the UK have expressed fears over where they will stand after Brexit, with some expressing doubts that the British government would be able to provide the clarity and answers they sought.
With uncertainty over Brexit persisting right through the year, many concerned Irish citizens reached out to the embassy in London to clarify their rights after the UK leaves the EU.
One such email sent to the embassy remarked how there’d been a marked change towards Irish people since the Brexit vote that was more akin to how citizens were treated in Britain during the Troubles.
In many cases, the response from the embassy was to assure people that no matter what form Brexit takes, they should retain their right to live and work in Britain after 29 March 2018.
It’s been a busy year for the embassy in London, as it continues to issue tens of thousands of Irish passports to those eligible to receive one. Since the Brexit vote, applications for passports have increased sharply.
After issuing 65,678 Irish passports through the London embassy last year, a further 47,217 were issued in the year to the end of September.
Indeed a number of correspondence released toTheJournal.ieunder the Freedom of Information Act include those with Irish grandparents who were seeking to know if they were eligible for an Irish passport.
As well as issuing passports to those who qualify for an Irish one, the embassy has also fielded queries from concerned Irish citizens about the fallout from Brexit.
In all, the Irish Embassy in London received correspondence from 82 Irish people based in the UK, who expressed their concerns and fears over where they’d stand post-Brexit.
From students recently arrived asking about their own status to those who’d lived in Britain for decades, people were keen to understand if and how their rights would be affected when the UK leaves the EU.

One wrote: “I have been receiving updates from the UK home office with regards EU citizens living in the UK, the advice given excludes Irish citizens – as such I’m none the wiser of my status in the UK. Can you provide any guidance?”
With the subject line “the diaspora and Brexit?”, one person wrote:
Correspondence included a doctor who was born in Ireland, has an Irish passport, but has been an NHS doctor for 25 years. This person was asking if they should seek “settled status” or UK citizenship.
This was echoed by a number of people who were unsure if they should seek “settled status” so they could stay in the UK.
One woman wrote: “I’m an Irish passport holder but have lived in the UK for 38 years. Will I need to apply for settled status due to Brexit? I have been married to an English man for 36 years, gold help me *smiley face*.”
Another was planning to visit New Zealand during the period that Britain leaves the EU in March and was worried they wouldn’t be able to allowed back into the UK when they got back.
One wrote: “Hi there, just wondering whether you will be providing advice to Irish in GB on how to prepare for hard/no deal Brexit (e.g banking, property rights, voting, healthcare, travel etc.)? No confidence in UK impartiality and preparedness.”
What they get sent back
In the majority of cases, the response was to direct peopleto this lengthy section of the Department of Foreign Affairs websitethat seeks to answer a variety of questions, with a tone of reassurance:
This page also seeks to assure Irish citizens in the UK that they do not need to apply for “settled” status in Britain after Brexit.
The response to concerned citizens is to also direct them toward signing up for the “Government Brexit update” email, which has been published at irregular intervals over the past few years to try to keep people up to speed with the latest developments.
Lastly, it suggests to people to follow the Department of Foreign Affairs and Merrion Street on Twitter.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-on-11-december-4361044-Nov2018/,"
THE HOUSE OF Commons will hold a crucial vote on 11 December to approve or reject the Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders, Prime Minister Theresa May said today.
“I am looking ahead to 11 December… when this House will be faced with the decision as to whether or not it wishes to deliver on the vote of the British people,” she told parliament.
However, the British Prime Minister faced parliamentary fury as she set off on the tricky task of convincing mutinous lawmakers to back her divorce deal with the EU.
The British leader crowned nearly two years of painful talks with Brussels that threatened to fall apart many times by sealing Brexit arrangements on Sunday with the 27 EU heads of state.
But this difficult chapter was always going to be the easy part.
May must now navigate the deal through a divided chamber in which she holds the slimmest working majority – and where lawmakers oppose it on all sides.
The beleaguered leader got a taste of just how tough her job will be as she briefed lawmakers on the outcome of her Brussels visit.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called the withdrawal deal and accompanying political declaration on future relations “an act of national self-harm”.

“For the good of the nation, the House has very little choice but to reject this deal,” he said.
Yet May might be more disconcerted by the seemingly growing and clearly more vocal chorus of resentment from her own Conservative Party.
Conservative MP Mark Francois told May her deal was “as dead as a Dodo”.
Former May loyalist Michael Fallon said the government was asking parliament to “take a huge gamble” and “surrendering our (EU) vote and our veto without any firm commitment to frictionless trade”.
More than an hour passed before the first member of her own party stood up to voice her support for the prime minister.
’Get on with it’
The current vote counts conducted by British media are not stacking up in May’s favour.

Many expect the deal to fail the first time around and for May to call a second vote on more or less the same set of arrangements before the chamber breaks for the winter holidays.
Britain would be entering unchartered waters — and quite possibly new elections – if the deal fails a second time around.
Brexit enters into force on 29 March and May’s government is also making “no-deal” preparations just in case.
May argued today that voters were simply exhausted with Brexit and just wanted their leaders to get things resolved once and for all.
“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted,” May said.
“This is that deal. A deal that delivers for the British people.”
EU foes in her Conservative Party accuse May of ceding too much to Brussels while the Labour opposition argues that it will devastate the British economy.
But both Brussels and May said the deal now on the table is final – and the best one Britain can get.
“We don’t want to give the wrong impression to people, whether they are passionate Remainers or passionate Brexiteers, that there is another agreement that can command the support of 28 member states. There isn’t,” Leo Varadkar said.
Poorer Britons?
May will now embark on an intensive nationwide campaign to promote the deal with voters across the country and lawmakers in London.
The government was to hold a special briefing on the Brexit deal for Labour MPs — an unusual but not unprecedented move.
May will also meet over 100 big business leaders to seek their support.
But Corbyn cited a fresh economic study showing the British growth slowing sharply under the plan prepared by May’s government.
The independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that trade with the EU – especially in services – was likely to be more costly after Brexit and have an adverse effect on living standards.
“GDP in the longer term will be around four per cent lower than it would have been had the UK stayed in the EU,” the report said.
It estimated that the loss equalled around €1,150 per year per person.

https://www.thejournal.ie/global-ireland-4064244-Jun2018/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS announced a series of new embassies, cultural programmes and other measures aimed at significantly increasing Ireland’s international outlook and impact over the next seven years.
The measures are outlined in the new plan – Global Ireland – Ireland’s Global Footprint to 2025 – which was launched by the government this morning.
An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was joined by Tánaiste Simon Coveney as well as a number of government ministers in announcing the plan.
Speaking at the launch today, Varadkar said that the purpose of the plan was to double Ireland’s global footprint in the coming years.
Varadkar said that there was “an urgency to this, and the reasons are self-evident”.
He said technological advancements and geopolitical shifts were driving change across the world, and trade was experiencing a moment of turbulence, while closer to home the UK was planning to leave the EU.
“The challenges we face demand comprehensive multilateral responses,” the Taoiseach said.
New missions
As part of the announcement today, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said seven new diplomatic Missions will be opening in countries across the globe.

These include three new embassies – in Kiev in Ukraine, Rabat in Morocco and Manila in the Philippines.
As well as these, Coveney announced the opening of consulates in Cardiff in Wales, Frankfurt in Germany and a Consulate General in Wales.
These follow on from the announcement of the opening of six new offices – embassies in Chile, Colombia, Jordan and New Zealand, and Consulates General in Vancouver and Mumbai last autumn.
“These increased resources abroad will help Ireland play our full role in addressing global challenges, while also meeting our moral obligations as global citizens,” said Coveney.
Overseas Aid
The government also said it was reaffirming its commitment that it would provide 0.7% of the country’s gross national income (GNI) to development assistance by 2030.
In doing this, it will publish a White Paper on International Development which will outline plans and proposals for Ireland to increase its presence and impact in countries where it is targeting its overseas development assistance.
Ireland will also launch its bid in July to join the UN Security Council for the years 2021-2022.
“If successful, this will place Ireland at the heart of UN decision-making on matters of vital importance, including international peace, security and development,” plan states.
Other measures of the plan include increasing awareness internationally of Ireland’s culture and heritage and enhancing the country’s “digital footprint”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-4-4329185-Nov2018/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has urged caution, particularly in the British media, that an imminent breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations is not necessarily to be taken for granted.
There have been widespread reports in the UK media that the British Prime Minister Theresa May is close to finally securing a Brexit withdrawal agreement and is edging closer to winning her Cabinet’s backing to resolve the sticking point around the Irish backstop issue.
Speaking this morning, Coveney said it should not be assumed that just because the UK Cabinet agrees on something, that an overall deal has been agreed with the EU.
“In terms of commentary today, particularly in the British media, I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot. Repeatedly, as people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British cabinet agree something, well then that’s it then, then everything is agreed,” he told the Ireland Canada Business Association conference in Dublin.

He said this a negotiation and there of course needs to be an agreement between those in the British government, but also with the EU and the 27 member States.
“Of course we want progress made and we want it to be made as quickly as possible because time is moving on,” he said.
The Guardianreports today that May has told her Cabinet to “stand by their diaries”, with government sources suggesting that ministers could be summoned for an emergency meeting later this week to sign off the backstop proposal before presenting it to Brussels, possibly later this month.
However, the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier said both sides are still negotiating.
“I am not, as I am speaking to you this morning, able to tell you that we are close to reaching an agreement. There is still a real point of divergence on the way of guaranteeing peace in Ireland, that there are no borders in Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the single market,” he said.
The Tánaiste urged caution stating that it is important that “people don’t get carried away on the back of rumour in the coming days”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-plan-reaction-4406671-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Dec 2018
REACTION HAS BEGUN rolling in after the Irish government last night published its preparations thus far for a no-deal Brexit.
The 131-page document lays out the plans under the headings: economic and fiscal; security; Northern Ireland and North-South relations; relations with Great Britain and sectoral analysis.
Speaking last night, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that the plan makes for a “stark” and “sobering” read, and said that this wasn’t a plan to keep things as they are, but a “damage-limiting exercise”.
Coveney last night conceded that there are no contingency plans for a border on the island of Ireland; neither are there plans to prepare fisheries for a no-deal.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that “Brexit is what threatens the possibility of a border being reintroduced on this island”.
“Brexit is not an Irish policy, it’s not our objective, so for us the onus is on the UK to address this problem and to make sure there is no reintroduction of a border,” McEntee said.
“For us, we’re not going to plan because this is not our policy.”
In relation to agriculture, a host of measures are being made for a sector that seems most susceptible to a hard or no-deal Brexit. The European Commission has suggested that there will need to be “simplified border controls” on animals and animal products travelling between the EU and the UK.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, Fianna Fáil Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers said that “there’s a lot of questions to be answered” and that her biggest concern reading the document was “around agriculture and agrifood”.
“It is by far the most affected sector and the only plan that I can see is that the aim is to diversify markets, to try move away from the UK being our biggest market, but that’s a medium to long-term goal,” Chambers said.
“In the short-term, I think that sector is extremely exposed and I’m not satisfied that there’s sufficient planning done to try to protect against that.”

Other reaction
The British Irish Chamber of Commerce (BICC) welcomed the contingency plans for Brexit, but has urged the UK to pull back from the “brink of trade chaos”.
Commenting following the release of the plans, BICC director general John McGrane said the plans show the stark reality of the disruption ahead.
“We welcome government action of course, and we will work with officials and State agencies to help deliver as many practical supports as possible for all businesses,” McGrane said.
In relation to trade, the government said that many of the same preparations needed for a “central case” scenario, or Brexit with an agreed deal, are the same for a no-deal Brexit, but those measures would have to be rolled out much faster.
“The only way to avoid widespread disruption of trade and jobs is for the UK parliament to avail of the Withdrawal Agreement that the EU has agreed with Prime Minister May to access a transition period during which a strong and comprehensive long-term trade agreement for goods and services can be negotiated for the benefit of all,” he said.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Tánaiste Simon Coveney gave some insight into the “central case scenario”.
“What we’re doing here is we are planning on the basis of what’s called a central case scenario, so in other words the most likely outcome which is that there would be a deal, there would be a transition period for about two years and at the end of that there’d be a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK that would involve some requirement for border checks,” Coveney said.
“The central case scenario means that much of this infrastructure would have to be in place by the end of 2020 because that’s when the transition period would end as part of the deal potentially unless it gets extended, which it could do,” he said.
If there’s a no-deal scenario, that trading infrastructure which is needed to protect the integrity of the EU single market, would need to be in place by the end of March of next year.
Meanwhile, Sinn Féin Brexit spokesperson David Cullinane has said the government’s Brexit contingency plans fail to protect the all-island economy and avoid a hard border.
To prepare for Brexit, the government is buying up land at Dublin Port and Rosslare Port in anticipation of additional customs checks. It’s not expected, however, that everything will be in place at the ports in time for a no-deal scenario.
Commenting of that matter, Cullinane said: “It is incredible that apart from buying a bit of land in the docklands and hiring more officers, the Irish government has devolved all responsibility for dealing with a no-deal Brexit to the EU Commission.”
He added that “with no plans in place to avoid a hard border, it is all the more likely, of course, that a hard border is what we will get”.
Speaking of the plans for Dublin Port and Rosslare Port, Coveney said: “We’re talking already about 13 inspection bays for trucks coming off ships, we’re talking about parking for 270 trucks to ensure that there’ll be a proper waiting area in the port, we’re talking about office accommodation for an additional 144 staff in the port.”
Thus far, the Irish government and the EU have staunchly denied the need for no-deal Brexit preparations, saying that it could take the focus away from trying to strike a deal.
But the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement looks unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons; if that does happen a no-deal Brexit is increasingly likely.

https://www.thejournal.ie/what-is-vassal-state-brexit-4344637-Nov2018/,"AFTER TWO YEARS of negotiations, Britan’s departure from the European Union finally progressed this week when draft withdrawal terms were agreed between both sides.
The draft agreementcovers the terms under which Britain will leave the EU next March, including arrangements about the backstop, a financial settlement for leaving the bloc, and the rights of British citizens in Europe.
However, the draft agreement has been denounced across Britain’s political spectrum since it was unveiled on Wednesday night.
Among the biggest critics of the deal have been the DUP, who have been supporting Theresa May’s government under a confidence-and-supply arrangement since last year.
Hitting out at the arrangement in the House of Commons yesterday, the party’s leader in Westminster, Nigel Dodds, accused May of facilitating the breakup of the UK.
“We stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the break-up of the UK,” he said.
It wasn’t the first time this week the phrase “vassal state” was used to describe developments in Brussels.
On Tuesday, Boris Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary after May’s Chequers plan was announced in July, said he believed a potential agreement was “vassal state stuff”.

Interestingly, the phrase was used the same day in a tweet by French president Emmanuel Macron, who said that being allied to the US did not mean “being a vassal state”.
So what does it mean?
Here’s how the phrase is defined in theOxford English Dictionary:
And here’s how it’s defined in theUS-based Merriam-Webster:
Historically, the term comes from feudal times, when a “vassal” was someone who held land if they promised allegiance to a prince or king, with obligations often including military support in exchange for certain privileges.
Usage of the term developed over time to refer to those who were subordinate to others, and it featured as such in Sonnet 58 by William Shakespeare, when the bard called himself a “vassal” to his lover.
Politically, a number of empires set up vassal states over time, which were based on tribes, kingdoms, or city-states controlling subjects without having to conquer or govern them.
The country that became a vassal state lost an independent say in its foreign policy, while also providing troops or paying tribute when the ‘senior ally’ asked them to.
In the current sense, there’s nothing to suggest that any of this will happen under the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement.
Just don’t be surprised if the term continues to pop up between now and Britain’s departure from the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-vote-4067423-Jun2018/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has won a crucial vote on its Brexit bill, which would have given parliament a veto on the final deal negotiated with Brussels.
The House of Commons has voted by 324 to 298 to overturn an amendment to the British government’s landmark EU Withdrawal Bill.
The amendment would have given parliament a veto over the final Brexit deal by removing Theresa May’s power to walk away from talks with Brussels, and send the bill back to be voted on by the House of Lords (who are unelected).
The Lords amendment would have given parliament the power to decide what happened next in the event of a ‘no-deal’, with the possibility of going back to the negotiating table or even staying in the bloc.
But in extraordinary scenes, ministers were forced to offer last-minute compromises to pro-European MPs before holding private talks in corners of the chamber as the debate raged on.
But to ensure she’d win the vote, May had to make minor concessions which could lead to Britain remaining tied to parts of the European Union after Brexit.
The government has agreed that the House of Commons will be able to direct Brexit negotiations if there’s no deal by 30 November this year. This could give MPs a veto on the final Brexit deal, or even force a second referendum.

Resignation
Earlier today, minister Phillip Lee, a close ally of Theresa May and prominent ‘Remainer’, resigned ahead of the Brexit vote.He reacted to the result of the votethis evening, saying:
Potential impact of Brexit on Ireland
The Irish government will be watching these developments closely, as it gives an indication of how Brexit will impact on businesses and workers here.
A number of reports have been commissioned to find out the potential impact Brexit would have on Ireland and how prepared businesses are.
One of those reports examined 15 sectors identified as being most exposed to the implications of Brexit such as the agrifood, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.
It found that at the time the research was being undertaken (February to August 2017), only half of the sectors were actively taking action to mitigate the potential impacts of Brexit.
Another report recommended government interventions in relation to workers’ skills, particularly those involved in goods trade across international borders.
They range from recommendations on higher-level customs clearance training to raising awareness of opportunities in logistics, supply chain and transportation careers across all sectors.

The Irish government has said nothing is confirmed yet but a government spokesperson said the situation is “fast-moving”.
With a deal finally in sight, the front pages of the UK’s newspapers are all putting their spin on the agreement.
The Daily Mail has gone with simply “Judgement Day”, but added that “Tory rebels cry betrayal and warn PM’s ‘days are numbered’”.

The Times said: “May accused of betrayal as she unveils Brexit deal.”

The Daily Express has opted for: “This Brexit deal is best for Britain.”

The Daily Telegraph’s headline reads “May faces ‘moment of truth’ on Brexit deal”.

The Guardian, meanwhile, said: “Brexit: May tells her Cabinet, this is the deal – now back me.”

The Scotsman opted for “May braced for Cabinet revolt over Brexit deal”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/saturday-night-live-theresa-may-4399308-Dec2018/,"AFTER A WEEK to forget at home and in Europe, UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been lampooned on Saturday Night Live with the US late-night show joking that she is less popular than Lord Voldemort.
Comedian Kate McKinnion took on the role of the British leader for the four-minute sketch, titled Happy Christmas Britain.
It begins with May breaking out her infamous robot dance moves alongside four police officers. She then addresses the nation before interviewing former Prime Minister David Cameron (played by Matt Damon) who “bounced and left me to clean up his mess”.
Saturday Night Live/ YouTube
“You know what’s funny?” Cameron says. “People hate me, but they really hate you. Even though I did Brexit. I mean, you’ve got to laugh.”
Perhaps revealing the limited knowledge US audiences have of British pop culture, May and Cameron are then joined by Elton John, who delivers Christmas presents that all turn out to be faeces, and Lord Voldemort.
McKinnion’s May says she and Voldemort “really get each other” but He Who Must Not Be Named is keen to distance himself from the prime minister in case it would bring him bad PR.

It’s a Wonderful Trump
The show also did a Donald Trump version of the Christmas classic It’s a Wonderful Life.
In the 1946 film George Bailey (played by James Stewart) considers suicide before an angel appears to show him how much worse off the people of his home town would be without him.
In the SNL version the angel shows Trump (played by Alec Baldwin) how the lives of everyone in his family and administration would be better if he had lost the 2016 US presidential election to Hillary Clinton.
Saturday Night Live/ YouTube
In this alternate reality the angel tells Trump that Clinton secured the White House because she did what she had to do: “visit Wisconsin once”.
That action has sent everyone’s life off in different directions and Trump and his wife Melania are now happily divorced, Mike Pence is a DJ and Kellyanne Conway “looks incredible” because she “is no longer eaten inside by lies”.
Despite seeing everyone much happier Trump fails to grasp the lesson in what the angel has shown him and he pleads for his job back.
When normality is restored he declares it “a Christmas miracle”.
The skit hasn’t gone down well with the US Commander-in-chief who tweeted yesterday that Saturday Night Live should be “tested in courts.”

BRITISH MINISTERS AGREED to make no-deal Brexit planning “an operational priority” amid continued opposition to Prime Minister Theresa May draft divorce deal, just 14 weeks before the country leaves the EU.
Following a meeting of her cabinet – the last before parliament breaks for the Christmas/New Year break – Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said around 3,500 troops would be on standby to help deal with the “any contingencies” from a no-deal outcome.
According tothe Times of London, a document that was leaked to them indicate that the government is being told to prepare in the event of a no-deal for a rise in “homelessness, poverty and suicide”.
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancocktold BBC Newsnightthat there were plans to store six weeks of stockpiled medicines for the NHS in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“I’ve become the largest buyer of fridges in the world, I didn’t expect that,” he said.

But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said ministers still hoped to secure backing for May’s agreement in a House of Commons vote delayed until next month.
He added that any responsible government would intensify preparations for the “default option” of leaving the European Union without a deal on 29 March next year.
“We agreed that preparing for no deal will be an operational priority within government,” Barclay said. “But our overall priority remains to secure a deal.”
He said departments would step up their advice to businesses on how best to prepare for the scenario, which many fear could be catastrophic for the British economy.

Divisions
May’s cabinet is divided between ministers who want the government to embrace a no-deal outcome and those who favour parliament having a final say in a series of votes on potential scenarios for Brexit.
One option is the prime minister’s own Brexit deal, but that is hanging by a thread after she was forced to pull a vote on it last week in the face of huge opposition from within her own Conservative Party.
Earlier today, Downing Street reportedly blocked opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn’s request yesterday for a non-binding no-confidence motion in May.
That had followed her telling MPs they will not get to vote on her deal this week, but instead in the week beginning 14 January.
The delay prompted accusations she was stalling to increase pressure on MPs to back the plan – and fresh calls for Labour to table a binding no-confidence vote against the whole government.
However, such a move faces likely defeat after Conservative Brexit hardliners and the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her government, both said they would back May.
‘Running down the clock’
May insisted Monday that she was continuing to seek “assurances” from the EU over elements of her plan, although EU officials said no meetings were planned.
The postponed vote has left members of her own party and Labour opposition politicians infuriated.
“The prime minister has cynically run down the clock, trying to manoeuvre parliament into a choice between two unacceptable outcomes” – her deal or no deal, Corbyn said.
May is also facing calls for a second referendum to resolve the impasse, with dozens of MPs from all sides now supporting another poll and reports that May’s officials are also considering the possibility.
But the prime minister argued that this would betray the 2016 Brexit referendum result and undermine public confidence in politics.
“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,” she told parliament yesterday.
“Another vote… would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics,” May said, adding that it would also “likely leave us no further forward”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/good-friday-agreement-2-4400368-Jan2019/,"A DERRY WOMAN who is in the middle of trying to obtain a residency card for her US husband has said that she fears Brexit will significantly delay their case.
Emma DeSouza, a 31-year-old woman from Derry, married US citizen Jake DeSouza in July 2015. In December that year, he applied to live in the UK – based on his wife’s special status under the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement.
That agreement gives citizens born in Northern Ireland with one British or Irish parent the right to identify as British or Irish citizens, or both.
The UK’s Home Office rejected Jake DeSouza’s application for an EEA residence card in Northern Ireland, for complex reasons. Although Emma DeSouza was born in Northern Ireland, and has a right under the Good Friday Agreement to identify as either Irish or British or both, the UK has her classified as being British.
In their refusal letter, the Home Office wrote: “…your spouse is entitled to renounce her status as a British citizen and rely on her Irish citizenship, but until that status is renounced she is as a matter of fact a British citizen”.
The UK government effectively argued that DeSouza is a British citizen until she revokes it in favour of her Irish citizenship. As she is classed as a British citizen, but is an Irish passport holder, the UK government had classed her as having dual-citizenship, and cannot go through the UK immigration system as an EU national. On this basis, her husband’s application for a residence card was refused.
Emma and Jake DeSouza appealed the refusal and won, but the Home Office is now appealing the case again. A hearing was scheduled for 26 November, but has been put back as the Home Office didn’t have its arguments ready, which DeSouza is concerned will affect the final decision as it will now be made after Brexit.
If British immigration laws aren’t compatible with the Good Friday Agreement, which this case suggests they aren’t, that should be changed before Brexit happens, not after, she argues.
The legal clout that the British government has put up against them suggests to the DeSouzas and their legal team that the appeals will continue right up to the European Court of Justice – but depending on the outcome of Brexit, that court might not have jurisdiction over UK immigration law anymore.

Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Emma DeSouza said that the Home Office’s appeal is based on arguing that the judge’s interpretation of the law was flawed, and the Good Friday Agreement has less authority than British immigration law.
In that judge’s ruling in 2017, he refuted this, saying:
“The constitutional changes effected by the Good Friday Agreement with its annexed British-Irish Agreement… supersede the provisions of the British Nationality Act 1981 in so far as the people of Northern Ireland are concerned.
“The UK government is arguing that the parliament is sovereign and that the Good Friday Agreement is a treaty that has no bearing on UK law,” DeSouza says.
Advertisement
She says that it doesn’t inspire much confidence in her that the UK government is promising to uphold the Good Friday Agreement after Brexit and protect citizens’ rights, while simultaneously arguing why they’re not important in her case.
Colin Harvey, a Professor of Human Rights Law in the School of Law at Queen’s University, toldTheJournal.iethat the De Souza case highlights a “failure to reflect and respect the basic principles of the Good Friday Agreement fully in domestic law, policy and practice”.
Harvey added that the UK Home Office has a muddied historical record on immigration.
“There is a real risk that the hostile environment measures will intensify, and in Northern Ireland the consequences of this will be very problematic indeed.”
Hostility towards immigration
Currently, DeSouza’s husband is living with her in Belfast; she says they’re lucky that they got to live together while their case is being appealed.
In order for Jake DeSouza to apply for residency, he and Emma had to submit their passports. Six months later after the application was refused, Emma had her passport returned, but Jake’s passport was kept by the Home Office.
“We weren’t able to leave the country, no matter who in his family was sick, he couldn’t go home. The Home Office have this unofficial policy of keeping your passport if your application is refused, and then meeting you at the airport before you leave.”
Emma De SouzaEmma De Souza
Since September, Jake has been granted temporary permission to remain in the UK until the appeal is over; he has his passport back and can travel and work for the next five years. But Emma is worried about what happens after that.
“The process is so difficult, it’s very frustrating and time consuming. Two months after we got married and our entire relationship has been about the Home Office and Brexit. I don’t know if we’ll ever know how to talk about anything else – it has eaten into our lives a lot.”
Emma runs a coffee shop in Belfast, but has decided to dedicate her spare time to campaigning to reform some of these rights that aren’t enforced. In September, she organiseda “We Are Irish Too” campaign in Septemberinvolving other families in similar situations.
The letters went to Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd.
Coveney’s office replied to say that her case and the issue of citizenship as guaranteed under the Good Friday Agreement was raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and that they would engage to make sure that the agreement is respected.
“We still haven’t received a response from the Home Secretary. There are families in Belfast waiting for our decision, so when the UK pushes the case back it gets pushed back for others, too.”

BRITISH OPPOSITION LEADER Jeremy Corbyn has denied apparently muttering “stupid woman” at Prime Minister Theresa May during a heated exchange in parliament over her delaying tactics on Brexit.
The Labour Party leader could be seen mouth two words in response to May making a joke about his failure to demand a no-confidence vote against her government after he had accused her of leading the country “into a national crisis”.
His spokesperson said that the words were not “stupid woman” but “stupid people”.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet

Conservative MPs shouted “disgraceful” when the allegations were first raised after the angry exchanges, and May herself was asked what she thought of the supposed comment.

“I think that everybody in this House, particularly in this 100th year of women getting the vote, should be encouraging women to come into this chamber and to stand in this chamber and should therefore use appropriate language in this chamber when they are referring to female members,” she said.

Several Conservative MPs said the alleged comment was a reflection of abusive language faced by many female politicians and a culture of bullying in parliament that has become a focus for concern in recent months.
One reporter played the video for percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who is deaf and can lip read:

Parliament speaker John Bercow said he did not see the incident himself but, if true, the allegation meant that Corbyn would have to apologise in front of parliament.
“It is incumbent upon all members of this House to operate in accordance with its best conversion… If a member has failed to do so that member has a duty to apologise,” he said.
Bercow, who has himself been accusing of bullying and using abusive language, said he would also look at video evidence and seek professional advice on the alleged incident.

SINN FÉIN MEP Martina Anderson has said that Brexit is the biggest thing to happen to Ireland since partition.
The Derry politician was speaking toTheJournal.iein the aftermath of the October summit, where EU leaders and the UK government parted ways without a final Brexit deal, which was the reason the summit had been pencilled in at the start of the year.
Anderson found it incredible that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May addressed the EU 27 leaders in Brussels this week and didn’t bring any new suggestions that would break the impasse.
Anderson said that she and other Irish MEPs have been explaining the importance of the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement to EU officials and European politicians so that they understand that the GFA “wasn’t just a handshake”.
“This is the biggest thing to happen to Ireland since the partition of Ireland… This is a very difficult challenge to the Good Friday Agreement, and May is the one who’s responsible as a co-guarantor to uphold it.
The Good Friday Agreement upholds cooperation and peace on the island of Ireland; it was as part of this agreement that a hard border in Ireland came down. The backstop was proposed to ensure that the essence of the GFA was maintained.
But it means the UK government is faced with a choice of either allowing Northern Ireland to remain in the EU’s Custom Union in order to avoid a hard border, or strike up a customs/trade deal with the EU that would limit their trading relations outside of Europe.
Because of this, there’s been suggestion from leading Tory party members, including Boris Johnson, that the backstop should be discarded.
Anderson says of this:
“Does she ever stop and think what do the majority of the people in the North think and feel about what I’m saying, about not needing the backstop – does she even care? Across the North we want the backstop. We’re in a difficult place, so solidarity needs to be maintained.”
Advertisement
Francisco SecoFrancisco Seco
Because of the clash over other the backstop, it’s been suggested that May shouldn’t have agreed to it in the first place in December 2017 and again in March of this year.
“She’s in the big game of politics,” Anderson says. “And she’s not in control, she’s one of the 28 member states that are negotiating a deal.”
She’s also restrained by the wishes of the DUP, who are supporting her minority government. Although they don’t want the return of a border on the island of Ireland, they are against any deal that would treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK.
One journalist quoted a source close to Arlene Foster as saying “This is a game of who blinks first, and we’ve cut our eyelids off”, hinting that they wouldn’t reverse their opinion on keeping the North in the Customs Union.
That means the British Prime Minister is going to let the tail wag the dog, Anderson says.
It would allow the members of “a party that doesn’t represent Britain to shape Brexit”, she adds, and would mean “the disaster” that follows would be “foisted upon their children and families”.
So what does Anderson think needs to happen now for us to avoid a hard border in Ireland?
“Brexit has thrown open a choice for people in the North: Do they want to stay with Britain or do they want to stay in the EU?
So is she saying that the people of the North should be asked which union they want to be a part of before Brexit talks continue?
“Facing into the possibility of a hard border, if there’s a significant change in public opinion, that would trigger a border poll, [which is the beginning of the process towards a united Ireland, as laid out in the Good Friday Agreement].”
“I was at an Irish Port the other day – 100% of the animal feed from Britain is checked, 100% of the animals are checked. Wood and produce are checked, this notion that we couldn’t have the special status that we already have is nonsense.”

A POLISH MEP has said that there’s not much concern that another member state will leave the European Union -  but added that citizens should quiz political organisations who propose leaving on what the benefits would be.
The UK is in the process of negotiating its withdrawal from the European Union – the official departure is scheduled for 29 March next year (more on that timeline here). Much debate has taken place about what was promised to voters versus what the final Brexit deal will deliver.
The vote also sparked a debate on the future of the EU, and whether the UK’s departure signals the end of the social and economic union. When MEP Danuta Hübner, who addressed the DCU Brexit Institute this week, was asked about whether other member states will leave, she toldTheJournal.ie: “We had those fears in the beginning.”
“There will be always politicians that want to do it. But Brexit is a learning process for everybody where you can see, not only how difficult it can be, but how much you can lose.
“You can of course replace things, but it will take time. By the time you build your own supply chains or your own solutions to problems it will be decades later and have a high cost attached to it.”
She says that studies by the CER and Bloomberg have shown that the UK Treasury is already losing money because of Brexit. “There will be less trade and less integration -  everything that creates jobs and growth is in the Single Market and the Customs Union.”
SIPA USA / PA ImagesSIPA USA / PA Images / PA Images
Despite this, the EU is still sensitive to any shifts in public opinion that could lead to another member state leaving.
“I don’t think the risk is on a massive scale, but we have to be vigilant. We often lose those moments where things change – like we didn’t see the moment where politicians introduced this anti-European narrative.”
European politician
Danuta Hübner’s political career has been at the heart of European politics: she’s served as a Minister for European Affairs in Poland, a Commissioner for Regional Policy within the EU, and a Co-rapporteur of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
As part of her role on the latter committee, she announced thatEnglish would not be an official language of the EUanymore, and that a number of EU member states would get additional EU representatives because of the UK’s departure (Ireland is to get two).
She’s also a member of the Brexit Steering Group, which represents EU parliamentarians’ views on Brexit; they meet once a week with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to be updated on how the talks are progressing. There are no Irish members of the group.

When asked about her thoughts on the progress made so far, Hübner says that talks have advanced significantly since Dominic Raab took over the post as the UK’s chief negotiator after David Davisresigned in Julyfollowing the Chequers plan.

She says that although a no-deal scenario is possible and must be prepared for, she doesn’t think it’s probable, and shakes her head repeatedly at the idea of it.
When asked whether the fear of the UK profiting from Brexit prompted EU negotiators to be harsh on compromising to reach a deal, Hübner says:
Irexit
Hübner becomes quite passionate at the suggestion that there could be some advantages to Ireland leaving the EU, as claimed by the Irexit Freedom Party,which was launched this weekend in Dublin.
When asked about what she thought of the party, Hübner says: “You should ask them what are the advantages to leaving. That’s very difficult to answer.”
“Even in Ireland, no one is proposing any constructive benefits.
“I think [an Irexit] is really sad and also really absurd. I don’t think they will build a majority in Ireland, but we should still ask those people [proposing it] for examples of what the benefits would be.
Opinion polls generally show that Ireland’s satisfaction with the EU is very high. Ina recent Red C poll, conducted on behalf of the European Movement group, 76% of people said that they “agreed strongly” that Ireland should remain as part of the European Union.
Migration
Hübner believes that the biggest threat to the European Union at the moment is the increase in “populist politicians using anti-European sentiment as political capital”.
“They use it to convince people that Europe should be different, that Europe should be nothing more than an economic cooperation. This is a risk for Europe, if we don’t create a counter narrative we don’t show that this is not a solution.”

One topic that has been dividing Europe for years is the issue of migration. Recently, in the German province of Chemnitz,protesters took to the streetsin anger about the scale of migration in the country; counter protests also took place welcoming migrants’ contribution to the country’s society.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel herself has come under criticism for strongly supporting an open border policy – from both within her own party and from the public.

Hübner says that countries that have one type of religion, one type of ethnicity, is a thing of the past; that the population of countries in Africa will rise sharply in the next 10 to 20 years, and because of this Europe must be prepared for increased migration to its countries.
“What are we going to do, build walls? And even then, think of a person who has travelled across seas to get to Europe – a wall isn’t going to stop them.”
She said that the best way to deal with the migration is to work together with other nations towards a solution.
That example involves countries working together for solutions to problems they have in common; but what about countries working for a solution to a problem specific to one nation – the border in Ireland post-Brexit, for example.
“We must have a backstop for Northern Ireland, we all on both sides understand the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area, and how easy it is to undermine processes which are fundamental to the future of people there.”
Both the EU and UK have pledged to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, but neither have a proposal that would avoid that and satisfy both sides.
The EU has suggested keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market; UK prime minister Theresa May has said that she couldn’t accept a border in the Irish Sea. The UK has suggested a plan dubbed ‘max fac’, which involves delaying Brexit until technology is created in order to carry out customs checks without hard infrastructure.
If there’s no agreement on a backstop for Northern Ireland, or a Plan B in the event of no other solution, there is no Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. In a no-deal scenario, a hard border would automatically go up on the island of Ireland.
“The Irish issue is everywhere… I think there is absolute unity with regards to Ireland.”

When pushed further and asked about what assurances or advice the EU could give citizens in the North, particularly communities along the border about the protections they will have from a hard Brexit or no-deal Brexit, Hübner pauses.
“Before the summer, kids from a secondary school in Northern Ireland came to visit. And those kids had a competition in school where they prepared studies on the consequences of Brexit on their life. And they were fully aware of the consequences: for their health service – the only hospital for kids is in Dublin – and other things like that. Those kids asked ‘Don’t leave us alone’.
“All the grandmothers who voted to leave and didn’t think about the consequences for their granddaughters.
“It is important,” she says.

THE LIVES OF millions of people living on the island of Ireland could be about to change dramatically.
The government of the United Kingdom and those in the European Union in charge of negotiating the terms of Brexit are still at loggerheads over Northern Ireland’s border, and whatever – if any – deal is decided could change things in both the North and the Republic.

Few, if any, believe a return to a hard border is a desirable solution. Many fear it could divide communities again, severe trade on the island, and potentially increase the need for a military presence.
We went on a road trip along the 499-km long border which is set to become the UK’s only international land border with the EU, stopping along the way to speak to people from different walks of life to see how a hard border could affect them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/celtic-interconnector-eib-4282811-Oct2018/,"THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK is to lend money to Ireland to support the Celtic Interconnector, an electricity-link between Ireland-France.
There are fears that Ireland is too reliant on the UK for its energy needs, and in light of Brexit there are doubts over the security of the gas Ireland imports from Britain.
The former Environment Minister Denis Naughten had indicated previously that other options were being examined.
EIB Vice-President Andrew McDowell said talks about the amount of money Ireland will borrow are at an “early stage”, adding that he did not have a final figure.
Vice President of the EIB, Andrew McDowell said the EU bank is showing “solidarity to Ireland” by supporting some big price-tag projects such as the Dublin and Cork port expansion as well as the Celtic Interconnector.

McDowell, who is a former advisor to Taoiseach Enda Kenny, said the EIB is backing the Celtic interconnector project to ensure there is a direct power connection between Ireland and continental Europe, which he said will help “manage and mitigate the type of risks Ireland faces into the future”.
The €1 billion underwater electricity cable linking Ireland and France is expected be finished by 2025/2026.
McDowell said investment in Ireland by the EU bank is being “stepped up” in light of the threat of Brexit.
The EIB recognises “Ireland’s unique exposure to the potential downsides of Brexit and that is why we have stepped up our activity in Ireland”.
“It is about supporting enterprise and making sure that available to enterprise is long-term financing for investment loans to create new products and new markets that will help diversify away from the UK and manage that risk.
“But on top of that we are also looking at a number of infrastructure projects and financing things like the expansion of Dublin Port, the expansion of the port in Cork to create new direct shipping lines into continental Europe,” added the EIB vice-president.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-wedded-to-the-idea-of-irish-sea-border-says-dups-foster-4330964-Nov2018/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has criticised Theresa May over a letter from the British Prime Minister suggesting the EU is pushing for a border down the Irish Sea, in the wake of Brexit.
The letter, leaked to the Times of London, suggests a Brussels plans to put a customs border in the Irish sea in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Provision for the sea border would be included in any divorce agreement, according to May’s letter to the unionist party, effectively keeping NorthernIrelandwithin the EU customs union and single market.
The Brussels plan aims to avoid a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.
In the letter, according to the Times, May said she could not accept any “circumstances or conditions” that would break up the UK into two customs territories.

The DUP’s Foster, however, has said that the letter raised “alarm bells” and that “it appears the prime minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea, withNorthern Irelandin the EU single market regulatory regime”.

The EU plan would see Northern Ireland tied to the customs union should Brexit negotiations fall through.
The “backstop” measure ensures that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border and has become one of the chief sticking points in the negotiations between the EU and the UK.
Urging caution
In the letter, May says that, although Europe is still pushing for a “backstop to the backstop”, she could not allow a divide between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland to “come into force”.
The wording of May’s letter – sent on Tuesday to Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds – has been interpreted by the DUP to mean that such a clause could be inserted into a final agreement.

The Prime Minister relies on the DUP for her House of Commons majority. In recent days, British media has reported that a final withdrawal agreement is imminent.
According to the Times, British officials have been told that a special cabinet is expected to meet next Tuesday to discuss the final shape of a divorce deal.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, however, has urged caution about an imminent breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations.
Speaking yesterday, Coveney said it should not be assumed that just because the UK Cabinet agrees on something, that an overall deal has been agreed with the EU.
“In terms of commentary today, particularly in the British media, I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-european-of-the-year-3-4064924-Jun2018/,"ENDA KENNY HAS said he is “appalled” by what is happening in politics in Britain at the moment, speaking in relation to Brexit.
The former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader received European Movement Ireland’s European of the Year Award from his successor Leo Varadkar at a ceremony at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin this afternoon.
European Movement Ireland said the award “recognises and honours individuals or organisations that have made an outstanding contribution to promoting and enhancing Ireland’s place in the EU”.
Accepting his award, Kenny touched on a range of topics in relation to Europe, focusing largely on the issues surrounding Brexit.
Kenny said that he is “appalled by what is happening in politics in Britain” currently.
“The government is driven by internal dissent, lacks credibility and clarity in the most serious issue in decades,” Kenny said.
On 15 December, EU leaders agreed to move onto phase two of Brexit talks. December’s deal promised “full alignment” with the EU single market and customs union rules that are crucial to the Good Friday Agreement.
Noting the agreement in December, Kenny said: “Six months on from the agreement being reached in December last year, very little progress has been made.
“The EU continues to negotiate from a unified position, British business is afraid to speak out because of the spectre of the Labour government.
The EU has set a ‘by October’ deadline for it to agree with the UK a final legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. That is so it can be ratified by the European Parliament, the Council and the UK.
Northern Ireland and the borderhas emergedas one of the key issues for negotiators in Brexit talks, with all sides insisting that there can be no hard border between the North and the Republic post-Brexit.
The UK has committed to providing technological solutions to the issue of the border. May committed that if the EU did not accept these solutions, a backstop plan would be put in place that would avoid this.

“The EU Council meeting in October is not a negotiating meeting. If negotiations have not been concluded before that meeting, then the EU Council will meet to discuss among themselves without Britain. This is really crucial,” Kenny said.

Last week, the UK government proposed that a “backstop” to be put in place should there be no Brexit border deal which would end in 2021.
‘We need significant progress’
Speaking before Kenny at the event, Varadkar also touched on the issues surrounding Brexit, and said that he wants to ensure that the “future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is as close and comprehensive and ambitious as possible”.
However, Varadkar noted that a Withdrawal Agreement needs to be agreed on first and Ireland needs to see “significant and substantial progress” on the backstop solution for the border if it is to agree on a final legal text.
Varadkar spoke of the impact that Kenny had during the early days of the Brexit negotiations and said that under his “strong” leadership”, the government agreed what Ireland’s priorities with regard to Brexit should be.
“With Enda firmly at the helm, we succeeded in ensuring that our unique concerns relating to Northern Ireland were listened to and understood and our concerns became European concerns and that has made all the difference for me and the Tánaiste in the year gone by,” he said.
The award
Earlier this week, a spokesperson for European Movement Ireland toldTheJournal.iethat Kenny was to receive the award “for his work in building Ireland’s relationship with European through some of the most challenging circumstances in our recent history”.
They cited his work chairing the European Council in 2013 as well as “preparing the ground for the decision to include the Irish border as a priority issue in the Brexit negotiations and establishing the All-Island Civic Dialogues on Brexit, which have proved vital in helping civil society and business prepare for Brexit”.
Since the award was established in 1988, Irish individuals with backgrounds in art, business, politics and administration have received it. Previous winners include playwright Brian Friel, businessman Michael Smurfit, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald and former Secretary General of the European Commission Catherine Day.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-online-course-4413129-Dec2018/,"A NEW ONLINE training course has been launched to get up to speed on how customs work as a no-deal Brexit threat looms.
The website www.prepareforbrexit.ie offers courses for all businesses.
The free online customs course takes 45 minutes to complete and covers both importing and exporting procedures, as well as explaining what documentation is needed.
In the event of a hard Brexit, goods moving into and out of the UK would be under customs controls and would require customs documentations. For Irish companies selling into the UK, or importing from the UK, they may for the first time be required to deal with the various systems associated with customs.

The course aims to explain in simple terms the main customs rules and includes the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit.
The Irish government has said it has stepped up it preparations for a hard Brexit, with contingency plans being published earlier this week.
More plans are due to be released in January.
Business Minister Heather Humphreys TD said “the government is focused on preparing SMEs for Brexit, building on the many measures we have already introduced, and responding to the evolving needs of business”.
“I am once again stepping up our response to Brexit with free online customs training for all businesses delivered by Enterprise Ireland. The UK is our largest trading partner with 12,000 businesses exporting to the UK and 60,000 businesses importing from the UK annually. Businesses must prepare themselves in the event of a hard Brexit as full customs procedures will come into place whereby the UK will be recognised as a ‘third country’,” she said.
Trade Minister Pat Breen TD said companies must prepare for all eventualities, adding that trade diversification is a vital strategy for any exporting firm seeking to minimise risks and to grow their business.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” in relation to Britain leaving the European Union.
Juncker told German newspaperWelt am Sonntagit is “entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems”.
“My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want…
“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and [British Prime Minister Theresa] Mrs May.
“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum,” he said.
May is hoping to get extra concessions from the EU ahead of a crucial House of Commons vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement in January.

Backstop
Earlier this month, Maypostponed a voteon the deal so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the agreement.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
Juncker’s comments come as British international trade secretary and Brexiteer Liam Foxtold the Sunday Timesthe chances of Britain leaving the EU are “50-50” if MPs reject May’s deal.
“Parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on [the referendum] result.
“Were they to do so, I think you would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and parliament. And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences,” Fox said.
Preparations are being made at British, Irish and European level for a no-deal Brexit, ahead of the official withdrawal date of 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-poll-4388094-Dec2018/,"RAISING THE ISSUE of a border poll now is “disruptive and destructive” to getting a Brexit deal ratified, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said a “crash” no-deal Brexit moves the timeline for a border poll on a united Ireland forward.
She told reporters this morning that in the case of crash-out deal, a border poll should be called.
Speaking at Leinster House today, McDonald said she wants to hear to what extent the government is making preparations for a “Constitutional transition” and a referendum on Irish unity.
“Let’s be very clear, if there is a crash, the damage arising from that will  not be fleeting, it will be long-term,” she said.
Describing yesterday in Westminster as a “shambles”, McDonald said she has told the UK Prime Minister Theresa May many times that “in the event of a crash, that certainly the issue of a referendum on unity would move, advance, very, very quickly”.
She said the UK “couldn’t expect Ireland to endure so much damage and simply be prepared to soak that up”.
Repeating her calls for a border poll during Leaders’ Questions, McDonald said uniting Ireland would remove the issue of the backstop.

Varadkar told the Dáil that if he didn’t know McDonald better, one would think her party wanted a no deal Brexit in order to “stir up” trouble in the North.
He said the government’s focus at the moment is the ratifying the deal, adding that raising the issue of a united Ireland now is “disruptive”.
McDonald said she also wants to be told about the State’s level of preparedness for such a referendum, as well as contingency plans in place.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said earlier today that he was bringing a paper to Cabinet on the preparedness for a crash Brexit.
While McDonald said she did not want such no-deal scenario to become a reality, she believed such an incident could happen by “accident”.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin also called on Varadkar to publish the Irish government’s contingency plans known as the “central case scenario plan”, however, the Taoiseach explained that there is no single overarching document.
Varadkar said recruitment of staff and infrastructure at ports and airports will be made public as will any legislation that is needed. He added that the EU Commission has been consulted in relation to the level of State aid Irish businesses might need.
Addressing the issue of the contentious backstop in the withdrawal agreement, the Taoiseach told the Dáil the backstop is “not just an Irish issue”, stating it is important to Europe too as it is necessary as an “open Irish border could otherwise cause the single European market to be contaminated”.
McDonald is due to speak with May on the telephone later this evening. She will reiterate her view that a withdrawal agreement is only possible with the minimum protections left intact, said McDonald.
If May is proposing on diluting the agreement, “then she is very, very misguided,” said McDonald.

https://www.thejournal.ie/clocks-brexit-4265274-Oct2018/,"IT’S THE GOVERNMENT’s objective to avoid there being two time zones on the island of Ireland.
Yesterday,TheJournal.iereportedthat the government planned to roll a national consultation on whether or not Ireland should scrap daylight savings time.
A steering group is to be established that will report back to Cabinet on the issue.
The European Commission has recommended the abolition of daylight savings, advising that seasonal time changes will come into force as soon as 2021.
Minister Charlie Flanagan haspreviously saidhe has “an open mind” on the proposals.
The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker proposed to end the changes in Europe next year.
The changing of the clocks for winter and summer has been a ritual in Europe since 1916, originally conceived as an energy-saving measure.
Summertime arrangements in the EU require that the clocks are changed twice per year in order to cater for the changing patterns of daylight and to take advantage of the available daylight in a given period.

Brexit
In light of the current context arising from the UK’s decision to exit the European Union, plans for any such time change trial being a joint venture with the United Kingdom is now in doubt.
A spokesperson for the government said the Commission’s timeframe for such timezone changes is “very ambitious”, adding that it is a “complex issue” particularly for Ireland in light of Brexit.
If the UK and Northern Ireland were not to avail of getting rid of daylight savings time, it would result in there being two time zones on the island.
Certainly Britain’s actions on the issue would need to be considered, said the spokesperson, adding that it is the government’s objective to avoid two time zones on the island of Ireland.
At Cabinet today during discussions on daylight savings time Minister Denis Naughten emphasised the need for research from comparable countries on how geography can affect energy savings and electricity consumption before any decision is taken on ending the biannual clock changes.
Giving an example, Ireland is at 53 degrees north. Ontario is at 51 degrees north and savings on energy there have been in the region of 1.5%. He said it is worth using research from comparable countries to ascertain how energy savings and electricity consumption will be affected.
As of the year 2017, daylight saving time is used by 77 countries and regions with a combined population in excess of 1.5 billion, making daylight savings time one of the most widespread policies in the world.
Naughten added that it is also one of the most controversial policies, with dozens of countries and regions having abandoned it in recent decades.

“This house has no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote,” Labour leader Corbyn told Parliament today before tabling his motion.
He said the move was “the only way I can think of ensuring a vote takes place this week”.
The government, however, must agree to this non-binding vote. Even if successful it wouldn’t automatically trigger May’s downfall.
House of Commons authorities have said that the government will decide whether the motion is debated and voted on, but noted that it is “parliamentary convention that any such request be granted”.
The BBC, however, has reported No 10 sources as saying “the government would not make time for the no-confidence vote.”
Ministers would not “go along with silly political games”, it has reported.

Last week, May survived a party confidence vote initiated by her own Conservative colleagues opposed to her Brexit strategy. A third of her parliamentary party voted to oust her in that vote.
Addressing the UK parliament this afternoon, May said that MPs will be able to vote on the controversial deal in the week starting 14 January.
The prime minister returned meet her EU counterparts over the last week where she told MPs she received further clarity on the proposed backstop. The backstop would come in the form of a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement, with specific rules for Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, May postponed the vote on the deal as it appeared it was to be heavily defeated.
May also warned that a second Brexit referendum would do “irreparable damage” to British politics when she addresses the House of Commons today.
“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,” she is expected to tell parliament, according to extracts from her speech released by Downing Street.
“Anther vote… would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics and to our precious United Kingdom.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/president-mitterrand-ireland-1988-4410833-Dec2018/,"IN FEBRUARY 1988, French President François Mitterrand visited Ireland and made history by becoming the first French President to address the Dáil.
In this year’s State Papers release, the details of what was served during the President’s visit on 25 February and what was discussed ahead of his arrival, has been disclosed.
Among the issues that were discussed at a 55-minute-long meeting between Mitterrand, his team, Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan Senior were Ryanair; milk quotas; tourism figures; and the UK’s role in the European Economic Community (or the precursor to the European Union).
Haughey had also urged Mitterrand to make “an early and favourable decision” in relation to Ryanair’s application to operate flights between Dublin and Paris, as part of a strategy to increase tourism figures and, in turn, boost the Irish economy.
A previous application by the airline had been rejected – the Taoiseach asked that Ryanair be granted permission to allow them to operate flights by the summer, and that Aer Lingus wouldn’t be affected by the addition.
Mitterand also spoke to Haughey about the relationship between the two countries, saying that “the French and the Irish are always together”, and referenced their shared interest in protecting small farmers and their united approach on milk quotas in the EEC.
In a remark that has aged incredibly well, he added: “The head of the British Government must note that others are united.”
In a latter part of the discussion, Haughey weighed in on his view of the UK government, saying quite pointedly:
Mitterrand also said:
This is possibly a reference to the UK’s reluctant application to join the EEC, and the fractured reaction to that application (a referendum on what the British electorate thought of joining the EEC was only held after the UK had become a member).
State PapersState Papers
Mitterrand also observed what he saw as Ireland’s more reserved approach to trade compared with Germany. Since joining the EEC, trade between Ireland and France was 25 times higher than before.

On tourism, Haughey made an interesting comment on using the French language and culture to offset the massive influence from the UK and US.
“…Ireland has the deepest interest in French culture and history. We want to improve cultural relations in every aspect. We feel overwhelmed by the UK/US cultures. The access to French language and culture, paintings, etc is most important to us to help us counter balance these influences.”
The French President said that they would do every effort to help Irish cultural institutions in France, “but we cannot go as far as speaking Irish!”
When asked by Mitterrand why the number of French tourists to Ireland was dropping, Haughey answered that air fares are too high, and that Ireland “can’t compete with the mass tourism of Spain and the sun countries”.
“But there are so many books,” was the Frenchman’s reply. “I have come here myself. I have spent many peaceful days among the reeds. There are wild geese…”
Mitterrand also spoke of the links between France and Ireland, telling Haughey: “So far as I am concerned our opportunities arise from something that go back into history.
Dining in style
Among the suggested gifts that would be given to Mitterrand during his visit were: a 14in Waterford Crystal fruit/salad bowl worth £567.29; a Waterford Crystal lamp worth £482 and measuring 18in high; and a Waterford Crystal centre bowl, 11in high and worth £360.47.
Attending a music event at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Mitterrand saw performances by De Dannan and Bernadette Greevy.
Among the food served to the French president was a three-course dinner featuring a seafood starter, a salmon steak with asparagus as the main, and macedonia fruit with raspberry sauce was the dessert.
State PapersState Papers
At a separate event, they dined on salmon, a beef filet, that season’s vegetables, a selection of Irish cheeses and strawberries.
Mitterrand’s dining habits are fairly well-known, anunusual dining affair between him and Charles Haughey featured in the 2015 TV show ‘Haughey’. In it, Mitterrand watches Haughey engage in an eating ritual of a small songbird called an ‘ortolan’.
The delicacy was a favourite of the late President, and it is said that he consumed the bird as his “last supper”whilst dying from prostate cancer in 1995.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-irish-economy-central-bank-3954237-Apr2018/,"THE CENTRAL BANK’S deputy governor has predicted that Brexit could be one of the most significant events to affect the Irish economy in a generation.
Speaking at Dublin City University’s Brexit Institute Ed Sibley highlighted the impact a hard Brexit would have on the Irish financial services system if UK firms can no longer avail of the financial services passport to offer their services into Ireland and Irish firms can no longer passport their business into the UK.
Sibley said the insurance and funds spheres in Ireland will be most drastically hit by the inability to passport between the UK and the rest of the EU due to the level of business conducted with UK.
“The full significance is almost impossible to predict at this stage, not least given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding both the short-term arrangements and the longer- term relationship between the UK and the EU,” he explained.

As Brexit negotiations play out there are risks that UK and Gibraltar-based insurers passporting into Ireland will lose their ability to continue to provide insurance cover, including collecting premiums and negotiating and settling claims on any outstanding insurance contracts.
Sibley said that Britain exiting the EU will have a significant effect on financial services regulation in Europe, both in terms of how policy is developed, but also on how the financial services sector is overseen.
Because of the importance of London as a financial hub he called on the EU not to introduce barriers to markets where key risks can be managed appropriately.
Sibley concluded his speech by providing details of a recent survey of regulated insurance companies’ preparedness for Brexit.
Nearly 200 companies responded to the survey and almost 75% of them think Brexit will have no impact on them. “Given the level of uncertainty and the range of challenges we have heard about today, this is an astounding number,” Sibley said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arron-banks-criminal-investigation-offshore-4317935-Nov2018/,"
BRITISH POLICE HAVE opened a criminal investigation into a top Brexit donor over his alleged use of offshore companies to finance the campaign to leave the European Union.
The probe came after the Electoral Commission said it had “reasonable grounds” to believe Arron Banks — an insurance company owner who was the single biggest donor behind the campaign to leave the EU — was not the true source of the loans made to the pro-Brexit camp.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said its “investigation relates to suspected electoral law offences… as well as any associated offences” by Banks and two companies he is associated with — Better for the Country (BFTC) and campaign group Leave.EU.
They will also investigate Leave.EU chief Elizabeth Bilney.
The NCA is in charge of investigating serious and organised crime.
The probe into Arron Banks comes in the wake of media revelations that he held a series of secret meetings with senior Russian embassy officials in London around the time of the 2016 vote.
Banks denied any criminal wrongdoing following the reports.
At least one of those meetings allegedly saw the embassy officials present Banks with a lucrative investment opportunity in a Russian gold company, according to media reports.
The deal never went through and Russia denies backing the pro-Brexit effort in a bid to weaken the European Union.
Banks said today that he was happy to have the opportunity to clear his name.
“I am confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues,” Banks said in a statement issued by Leave.EU.
“I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations,” he said.

Banks later sent a series of tweets that included a selfie taken in what he said was Bermuda.
“Gone fishing!” one of the tweets said.
Shell companies
The Electoral Commission said its investigation into alleged campaign violations focused on £2 million (€2.3 million) reported to have been loaned to BFTC by Banks and his insurance companies.
They also looked into a further £6 million reported to have been given to the organisation on behalf of Leave.EU by Banks alone.
The Electoral Commission said it had “reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Banks was not the true source of the £8m loans made to Better for the Country”.
It further believes that the loans involved companies incorporated in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar and the Isle of Man — a crown dependency — which is not permissible under British electoral law.
“Arron Banks, Elizabeth Bilney and others involved in Better for the Country, Leave.EU and associated companies concealed the true details of these financial transactions,” the Electoral Commission said.
The commission’s legal counsel Bob Posner said at least £2.9 million of the money funnelled into Leave.EU “was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum”.
“The financial transactions we have investigated include companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man,” Posner said.
Banks said in his statement that the Electoral Commission was acting “under intense political pressure from anti-Brexit supporters”.
He also argued that it was unfair that US billionaire George Soros was not targeted for his involvement in the campaign to stay in the European Union.
The Guardian newspaper noted that the Hungarian-American financier made his donations outside the official election period that bans foreign contributions

ALL SIDES IN the Brexit negotiations have repeatedly committed to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.
But this week will prove crucial in deciding if all sides meant it when they made that commitment: EU leaders are due to discuss the Irish border issue tomorrow and on Thursday, and after years of talks they still seem no closer to reaching a deal that will please all sides.

During our recentBrexit Road Trip, we spoke to historian Father Joe McVeigh at St Michael’s Parish Church in Enniskillen about what danger the reemergence of a hard border would pose.
“The fear is now, that if there’s a hard Brexit and a hard border, and customs and excise posts are put up again, that will provoke some reaction from a group like the IRA, and that there will be attacks on these border posts as symbols of a division in Ireland.”
“I’ve seen it happen in the past, and I fear it will happen again,” he said, adding that he is still hopeful there will be a last-minute resolution. Which is alsoTaoiseach Leo Varadkar’s prediction.

https://www.thejournal.ie/garda-commissioner-drew-harris-psni-4218008-Sep2018/,"DREW HARRIS INSISTS he has no questions to answer about his previous roles with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its predecessor the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The new Commissioner, who was officiallysworn in at a ceremony on Monday, addressed a number of issues surrounding his appointment at his first press conference this afternoon.
Some have expressed concerns that Harris’ appointment creates a conflict of interest because of an obligation to keep certain intelligence from his previous role secret.
Others have taken issue with his evidence at the Smithwick Tribunal, which found collusion between gardaí and IRA members in the killings of two RUC officers.
However, at this afternoon’s press conference, Harris firmly pledged his allegiance to his new employer and the Irish public.
“I am here to protect the people of Ireland,” he said. “I am here to lead An Garda Síochána in that mission. I’ve said that very unequivocally.
“I am here in good faith, and I am here as an individual to serve. I’m a public servant, and my public service has always been police work, and that’s what I’m here to do.”

Weighed evidence
Harris played down suggestions that his previous role with the PSNI created a conflict of interest, denying he held any evidence which could be useful to gardaí for historic investigations.
He pointed to his history working on cross-border operations in which gardaí and members of the PSNI exchanged sensitive intelligence to prevent terrorism.
“I would say that the matters that I was aware of as a member of the PSNI were always dealt with properly in terms of sharing intelligence,” he said.

Commissioner says use of sensitive information in his previous role has prevented serious terrorist attacks. He adds that there is no outstanding intelligence from his previous role that he might have to share.
However, the Commissioner also said that while he acknowledged the “hurt” caused to members of Dundalk Garda Station as a result of the Smithwick Inquiry, he accepted its findings.
“My evidence was weighed in the balance by Judge Smithwick, and I’ve no other comment to make than that,” he said.
“If individuals are hurt by that, I recognise that the vast majority of officers worked with bravery and integrity in the border area.”
Understanding
Harris added that policing the border area after Brexit would be one of the biggest challenges presented to him, particularly as criminal justice treaties would elapse when Britain leaves the EU.

However, he revealed that his immediate priorities as Commissioner would be an understanding of how resources were being used and what was required of gardaí.
He admitted that he had come into the position at a time when the policing landscape was evolving, he said resources would have to be used properly with an ethos of “openness and accountability”.
He said: “We need to have a full understanding of the demand that’s made of [us], both in reactive demand in responding, but also, our active demand in terms of operations that we would take on to counter criminal threats.”

The Commissioner rejected the findings of a cultural audit of gardaí released earlier this year, which suggested thatmorale within An Garda Síochána is at an all-time low.
He admitted that while the organisation faced “issues”, he said that areas of discontent were being addressed, adding that poor morale was not something he had experienced when he had met with individual officers.
He also expressed hope that the number of officers in the force will be maximised, particularly through the use of civilian members, during his tenure.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-to-meet-barnier-on-brexit-4241037-Sep2018/,"LAST UPDATE|18 Sep 2018
THE TÁNAISTE HAS said that the latest steps for Ireland’s contingency plans for Brexit will be rolled out this week, with a nationwide “getting Ireland Brexit ready” campaign to launch this week.
Simon Coveney and Minister of State Helen McEntee travelled to Brussels today to get an update from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on the divorce talks.
It came just days after former UK Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnsonlabeled the backstop measure, aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland as a “monstrosity that wipes out our [the UK's] sovereignty”.
Top of today’s agenda was a protocol on Northern Ireland and the Republic. Coveney said that, following his conversation with Barnier, it was clear that there will be no withdrawal agreement without the legally operable Irish backstop.
“Time is short and what we need to see now from both negotiating teams is heightened engagement in the lead-in to October’s critical EU summit,” he said.

Before departing for the meeting, Coveney discussed the situation with his Cabinet colleagues this morning as the Dáil returns from the summer recess.
Coveney said that he and Cabinet colleagues had agreed the latest steps in “Ireland’s contingency planning and implementation”, which included
In July, the government signed off on the hiring of 1,050 inspectors in customs, veterinary and food safety, as part of Brexit preparations aimed at protecting east/west trade.
The Tánaiste also confirmed that the first phase of a staffing programme had been sanctioned that will see 451 out of a total of 1,077 staff recruited to work at Irish ports and airports as a direct consequence of Brexit.
Both Coveney and McEntee travelled to Brussels after the cabinet meeting, with a private meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Barnier taking place tonight.
Today’s talks came as British Prime Minister Theresa May comes under further pressure from within her own party to scrap her Chequers plan. Speaking toRTE’s Morning Irelandpro-Brexit Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he would “prefer no deal to the Chequers plan”.

The plan agreed in July at British cabinet includes reference to the Irish backstop which would allow Northern Ireland stay in the EU if Brussels isn’t happy with Brexit arrangements.
It’s led to significant backlash for May from her own party members, including Boris Johnson who left his Foreign Secretary post in protest of Chequers.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, Bridgen said he couldn’t vote for the withdrawal agreement as proposed in Chequers and accused the EU of attempting to “annex off Northern Ireland from the UK without consulting the people”.
Separately Britain’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said he will not accept a customs border in the Irish Sea. Speaking tothe Irish Timessaid it would be sensible to start thinking about “how checks could be conducted away from the Border”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-super-canada-brexit-4258500-Sep2018/,"
BRITISH FORMER FOREIGN secretary Boris Johnson has unveiled his vision for Brexit, urging Prime Minister Theresa May to “chuck” her so-called Chequers plan for a “Super Canada” trade deal.
The ardent Brexiteer, who resigned from the government in July over the issue, described her current proposals for Britain’s future relationship with the EU as a “moral and intellectual humiliation”.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Johnson outlined a six-point alternative plan, that would scrap a backstop agreement struck with the European Union last December over the contentious Irish border.
He argued that adopting technology and making customs checks away from the frontier would prevent a return to a hard border — a sticking point in negotiations and a key factor in May’s proposal.
Johnson called for Britain and the EU to negotiate a free trade agreement — dubbed “Super Canada” — mirroring the deal the bloc signed with Ottawa in 2016.
It removed the vast majority of customs duties on exports crossing the Atlantic.
He conceded that negotiating such an agreement, which would aim for mutual recognition of standards to keep goods moving and also include services, may require extending any Brexit transition period beyond 2020.

“This is the moment to change the course of the negotiations and (to) do justice to the ambitions and potential of Brexit,” Johnson wrote in the 4,500-word article.
His intervention, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference — where he will address a fringe event on Tuesday — is set to increase pressure on embattled leader May.
She has proposed the UK follow EU rules in trade in goods after Brexit, to protect manufacturing supply lines and avoid the hard border.
The plan, forged in July at May’s country retreat Chequers, has faced strong opposition in her Conservative party and criticism in Brussels, but May has repeatedly vowed to stick with it.
Johnson reiterated the proposal was a “democratic disaster” that would “cheat the electorate” and leave Britain “half in, half out” of Europe.
Reports earlier this week suggested more than half of the cabinet now favour a Canada-style agreement, with Brexit expected to overshadow the divided party’s annual gathering starting Sunday.
Britain is set to leave the EU next March, with both sides agreeing that a provisional divorce deal, comprising assurances on the Irish border among other things, must be reached by mid-November.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has given an important speech in Belfast this morning, referencing the contentious Brexit ‘backstop’ and the Irish border issue.
In her speech, May spoke about a range of issues, including the representation of nationalists in Northern Ireland, Brexit, and the Irish border, but the most significant comments were about the ‘backstop’ agreement with the EU.
In her speech, May said that the EU’s suggestion that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with EU customs regulations in the event of no other solution to the Irish border wasn’t acceptable, and wouldn’t be accepted by a UK prime minister or the House of Commons.
She said that it would contradict the Good Friday Agreement, and that it was up to the European Union to suggest an alternative.
When pressed on what would be preferred, she said that it would be preferred if there was an actual customs agreement with the EU.
The EU and UK agreed in December to a Brexit backstop for Northern Ireland which means there would be “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland, but that they would also avoid a border along the Irish Sea.
There has been much speculation on whether the UK will backtrack on the ‘backstop’ agreement or the ‘Plan B’ arrangement for the relationship between Northern Ireland and the republic in the event of no other solution.
The UK government has asked that the whole of the UK be included in the backstop agreement – the EU said that this was unacceptable, and that the backstop was an exception to preserve the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement.
“I don’t accept that for one minute [that there is no backstop deal],”Tánaiste Simon Coveney said earlier this week. “The British government continually confirmed that they are committed to a backstop that deals with the Irish border question, and confirmed last March and in the White Paper as much.”
The UK premier is on a two-day visit to Northern Ireland during what is a crucial point in Brexit negotiations. There’s still no solution to the Irish border issue just months before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is scheduled to vote on a final deal.

During the first day of her visit to the North yesterday, May visited business owners and farmers along the border to discuss their concerns about the UK leaving the EU.
What did she say this morning?
Sky NewsSky News
Quoting Churchill at one point, May reaffirmed her commitment to Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom.
She said that as As the UK leaves the European Union, “striking trade deals across the world… that of course includes Northern Ireland”.
She said that Northern Ireland is “wholly original”, a “TV powerhouse supported by UK funds” and “2 million visitors as tourists to experience its beauty” every year.
Referencing those in favour of a united Ireland, she said that they are “absolutely committed to parity of esteem and want to work with all communities”.
She said that the fact that Drew Harris was to become the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána was an example of how much progress had been made.
Referencing the absence of a Stormont Executive for over a year and a half, she commended the North’s civil service for upholding the duties of government in absence of elected lawmakers.
But she added: “Effective and enduring devolved government is the right thing for the union”.
On the issue of a hard border, she said:
“I’ve said consistency that there can never be a hard border. During the referendum that the border must remain unchanged, you just have to speak to businesses along the border, who say it’s inconceivable. Neither would it be feasible for those in distribution chains.”
Reacting to May’s comments today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he believed it is possible for the EU’s position to evolve, as long as the “core issues are not undermined”, he added.
Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One, Coveney said the EU must ensure that Britain does not gain a competitive advantage by leaving the customs union.
He welcomed May’s call that there be no border infrastructure between Britain and the EU, stating that the EU will now engage in negotiations on the UK’s White Paper.
“I don’t think we will see the White Paper agreed in full. I think it is a basis for a detailed and real negotiations,” said Coveney.
He predicted there would be “some problems” ahead, but added that the negotiations started this week and will run into August.
Where things get difficult is discussions surrounding the backstop and how to ensure there is no infrastructure along the border, he added.
“I don’t believe we are heading for a no deal Brexit – I have never believed that,” said the minister, who was quick to point out that that does not mean that preparations for a hard Brexit are not underway.
“The White Paper is a step in the right direction,” he concluded.
Sinn Féin Leader Mary McDonald  said May visited the North “to pick a fight with Ireland and the European Union”.
“We were told that the British Minister came to Ireland to listen and to reassure. It is clear that she is not listening to community and business interests and seeks only to reassure the DUP.
“Her approach today has been provocative, to set aside her agreement with the EU from December and to walk away from a backstop,” she said.
McDonald said the UK prime minister states she wants to avoid a hard border in Ireland, however, she is pursuing a policy that will deliver a hard border.
She said there is now an onus on the Irish government to stand up in the interests of all Ireland and Europe needs to make good its commitment that Ireland comes first.
“The backstop is the contingency plan. It was agreed and should be honoured.
“What is required now is that the issues pertaining to Ireland be solved at an EU level. We need clarity and certainty for our people and the economy.
“That requires immediate talks and very clearly unless the Irish issues are resolved there can be no withdrawal agreement and no talks on future relationships.”

The DUP leader was speaking yesterday ahead of her meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May but the clip was only played this morning onBBC Radio 4 Today.
Foster has said her party will reject any Brexit deal that would effectively have Britain leave the EU customs union while Northern Ireland remains in alignment with EU trade rules.
This arrangement is what’s referred to as the ‘Brexit backstop’ and May has said that her priority is to avoid such a situation.
Speculation is growing however that London may accept some checks on goods passing between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
There have been suggestions that these checks could be carried out by UK officials away from the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland
May’s Conservatives depend on the DUP for their majority in the House of Commons, which must approve any final deal.

Asked yesterday if her party’s MPs would vote against any Brexit deal if it did not satisfy them, Foster said she was hopeful such a situation would not happen.
“We don’t want to be in that position, but we’re not calling anyone’s bluff around this,” Foster said.
Foster refused to be drawn on the issue, saying she would not comment on a deal she has not seen, but was then asked ‘how red?’ her red line was.
“The red line is blood red, it’s very red,” Foster said.
“I think we’re selling the Prime Minister short, she understands where we are in all of this and therefore I need to give her the space to share that information with me.”
After a meeting with May in Birmingham, Foster tweeted a photo the pair and said: “NO border in the Irish Sea will ever be acceptable to unionists throughout the UK… regulatory or otherwise.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-poll-3-4059433-Jun2018/,"THERE ARE ALMOST the same number of people who want a united Ireland as who want to remain as part of the United Kingdom, according to a poll of Northern Irish citizens.
An online surveyconducted by Lucid Talk for the BBCfound that 45% of people in Northern Ireland wanted to remain as part of the UK, while 42.1% said they would like to join the Republic of Ireland. 12.7% said they didn’t know.
The result represents a much closer percentage than a Queens University poll which put the percentage at 21% in favour of a united Ireland. According to the BBC, Lucid Talk’s Bill White believes the online survey method may catch more “shy” united Ireland supporters than face-to-face interviews used in the Queens University study.
Traditionally, support for remaining under British rule has been the majority viewpoint. But since the UK voted to leave the European Union, there’s been a discussion that a referendum on Irish unity could be held in Northern Ireland in order to remain as part of the EU. The North voted to remain in the EU, and there are concerns that there won’t be a solution to the Irish border issue, causing difficulties for the day-to-day lives of those in Northern Ireland.

There were a number of other interesting (though not concrete, let’s remember) findings in the poll:

When asked whether they agree that politicians in Westminster reflect their concerns, 62.4% of Northern Irish citizens said that they “strongly disagree”, with a further 18.9% saying they “tend to disagree”.
Today,an audio of British Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson was released where he said that it was “unbelievable” that the UK government was allowing the Northern Ireland issue to control the Brexit deal the UK wants.

ONCE THE UK leaves the European Union on 29 March, it’s only then that discussions can begin on what kind of trading relationship there will be post-Brexit.
There have been a few options floated around over the past few months: ‘Canada plus plus plus’, and ‘Norway plus’ being the most common of the two.
But the Norway Plus option has been referenced repeatedly since a Brexit deal was struck: why, when we’re not even at the trade part of talks yet? The short answer is: politics.
Ahead of the House of Commons vote, it looks like Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan doesn’t have the support to gain the 320 votes needed to pass.
So Tory backbencher Nick Boles has been suggesting that instead of the transition period between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 (which could be extended under the Brexit deal), that the UK should take the Norway model route.
This would mean joining the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and then the European Economic Area (EEA) – more on these later, as it’s a bit complex (you need to be either in the EU or the EFTA to be in the EEA).
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
The Norway Plus option is being considered because it’s seen as a way of sweetening the current Brexit deal, which both Remainers and Brexiteers are unhappy with.
In an unlikely Cabinet alliance, Remainer Amber Rudd and Brexiteer Michael Gove are looking at the plan, and crucially, DUP leader Arlene Foster also said her party would consider the Norway option.
But it’s been met with skepticism from most quarters, and added to that scepticism is the put down from Theresa May herself on the Norway option:
“What you see in the political declaration is what would be a deal for the United Kingdom that is not Norway, it is not Canada, it is a more ambitious free trade agreement than Canada, and it ends free movement – which Norway doesn’t do,”she told reporterson her way to the G20 summit in Argentina.
Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg also said that they would support Britain’s bid to rejoin the EFTA “if that’s what they really want”.
In February, Norway’s ambassador to Ireland Else Berit Eikeland told The Irish Times that the Norway plus deal would amount to EU membership.
Norway and the EU
In short, the Norway model means:
Energy-rich Norway opted against joining the EU in 1994, choosing instead to enter the EEA which binds Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein with the EU’s member states.
EFTA (the European Free Trade Association) is made up of those three countries, plus Switzerland. EEA membership is only available to either EU or EFTA member states. So, under a Norway-style Brexit, Britain would leave the EU, join EFTA, and only then be able to rejoin the EEA as its 31st full member.
This would mean they would get full access to the Single Market and avoid tariff barriers.
But it has no say in the rules and must adhere to the EU’s four freedoms: free movement of goods, capital, services and persons with its fellow members.

That first option is going to pose a problem for staunch Brexiteers: limiting free movement is seen as May’s number one priority in Brexit talks, and she’s used that feature of the current Brexit deal as its main selling point.
The big advantage for Britain if it became a member of the EEA would be that its financial hub in London remains undisturbed, it would be outside the Common Fisheries Policy which it has pledged to leave, and would also be outside the Common Agricultural Policy.
Although Norway is outside the Common Fisheries Policy, it has a separate symbiotic fishing agreement with the EU that allows EU trawlers to fish in Norwegian waters in order to avoid tariffs on its fish exports to the EU.
The UK government’s own impact assessment found the Norway option would be the least damaging option in terms of economic harm.
What’s the ‘plus’ part then?
The Norway deal in itself isn’t enough to solve all Brexit solutions – it’s hard to find one that would do that, to be fair.
Mainly, the Norway option doesn’t deal with the problem of the backstop and the Northern Ireland border, as Norway isn’t in the customs union. So the solution that’s being talked about is the Norway optionanda customs arrangement, hence the ‘plus’.
Thecustoms unionmeans taxes, or tariffs on trading goods is fixed if you’re an EU member. This means that goods can be transported from between EU member states without additional costs or delays.
Although the customs union and the single market are closely linked – with the former being described as “a foundation” for the latter – they are not integral to one another.
Theresa May has promised that they would leave the Customs Union in order to strike up new trade deals around the world, and instead agree to a “customs arrangement” or deal with the EU that would avoid customs checks along the Northern Ireland border.
What about the garlic?

A UK Brexit committee were told earlier this year that the number one trading problem between Norway and Sweden was garlic, as a way of illustrating how problematic and intricate trading between two jurisdictions can be.
You might have heard aboutDublin man Paul Begley, aged 46, who in March 2012 was jailed for six years over a €1.4 million scam involving the importation of garlic.
Begley avoided paying customs duty on more than 1,000 tonnes of garlic from China by having the shipment labelled as apples.
The import duties on apples are just 9%, while corresponding taxes on foreign garlic that’s imported into the EU can be as high as 232%.
Around 300,000 tonnes of garlic are produced each year in the EU, compared to roughly 23 million tonnes worldwide. Spain produces 200,000 tonnes of the EU total, followed by Italy and France; EU imports garlic mainly from China and Argentina.
The EU’s longest land border with a different jurisdiction is between Norway and Sweden and is a thousand-mile frontier.
The garlic was legitimately shipped to Norway, where there is no garlic import tax, and then smuggled into Sweden and the rest of the EU by lorry.
Kristen Hoiberget, who runs the customs operation at Svinesund,told the BBCthat the average wait time at a customs check in Norway is eight minutes: ”I don’t think there’s any border in the world that’s so smooth.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-speech-fine-gael-ard-fheis-4344645-Nov2018/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said his party can “look proudly to its record and the many steps we have taken to build a state that cares and in particular one that cares for families”.
Addressing his party members at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis this evening, Varadkar said Fine Gael is a “compassionate party” that throughout history believed that “the State has a role in offering a helping hand to those that need it”.
Unlikelast year’s speech, which made three references to housing issues, with one mention stating that the party is determined to “solving the housing crisis”, there were no mentions of it this evening.
The number of childrenliving in emergency accommodationin Ireland rose by 136 last month. Emergency accommodation figures for September show that there are now collectively 9,698 people living in homeless accommodation across Ireland.
The number of homeless children in Ireland is now 3,829.
While there has been a rise in the number of children presenting as homeless, the Department of Housing noted that the number of new families entering emergency accommodation is down from last month.
Overall in September, 88 families entered emergency accommodation in Dublin, while 45 exited. The Oireachtas Housing Committee was recently told that therecategorisationof homeless figures has “undermined confidence in the data”.
During his speech, Varadkar said each generation must answer a different question about the future of our country.
“One hundred years ago it was how to win our country its freedom and to survive as an independent state in a hostile world.
“Sixty years ago it was how to develop enterprise and industry so that we could provide opportunities for all and end the scourge of forced migration.

“Thirty years ago it was about freedom – how we could provide the liberty to individuals and families so they could decide how to live their lives,” he said, adding:
The Taoiseach stated that Fine Gael are reducing the barriers faced by many mothers working outside the home, listing off the two years of free pre-school, subsidised childcare, and longer maternity leave and paid paternity leave.
He said:
The Taoiseach admitted there are challenges, stating:
The Taoiseach also touched on the issue of Brexit, and also on who they extended invites to this evening.
Brexit
In terms of Brexit, he said it is not Ireland’s policy.
“The best case scenario for Ireland would be for the United Kingdom as a whole to remain in the European Union, in the Single Market and Customs Union. However, the British people and parliament have decided against this.
So, it has been our priority to defend our interests – to minimise the harm to Ireland and maximise the opportunities, however few.
He said the draft Withdrawal Agreement and protocol of Ireland negotiated this week protects the peace, avoids a hard border between North and South, retains the common travel area between Britain and Ireland, while also ensuring there are no tariffs or quotas between us and that customs checks are minimal.
“It translates faithfully, into a legally binding document, all that was agreed last December,” he said, adding that while it hasn’t been easy, the UK Government and the UK Prime Minister Theresa May have been “true to their word and now we commit to working closely with them to build a new and special bilateral relationship with them”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-brexit-vote-4343770-Nov2018/,"WHILE THE DRAFT Brexit deal caused what can only be described as chaos in Downing Street this week, it also caused consternation in Scotland.
As perhaps is to be expected, the SNP and its leader Nicola Sturgeon have used the deal as the basis to jumpstart moves towards another independence referendum.
The party has already committed to another vote on independence but the Brexit uncertainty of recent years has put these efforts somewhat on the backburner.
Now that the party has something concrete to point at, it has upped its criticism and is again looking to put the issue on the agenda once more.
The big talking point this time is Northern Ireland. Asthe SNP tweeted on Thursday, Scotland is not specifically mentioned in the draft agreement whereas Northern Ireland is – 100 times.
For the party of government in Scotland, that is unacceptable. Scotland voted to remain by 62% to 38%,the clearest result of any of the UK’s four countries.

The SNP is arguing for specific Scottish provisions within the draft deal, but at the very least is opposed to Northern Ireland being given a special status that it feels will hinder Scotland economically.
As Sturgeonclaimed to the BBC on Wednesday, it would put Scotland at a competitive disadvantage:
🙈 Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement will have a significant impact on jobs, investment and living standards in Scotland. Yet, the Scottish Tories don’t give a jot.pic.twitter.com/zVguSFEXFF— The SNP (@theSNP)November 15, 2018The SNP/ Twitter
🙈 Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement will have a significant impact on jobs, investment and living standards in Scotland. Yet, the Scottish Tories don’t give a jot.pic.twitter.com/zVguSFEXFF
Speaking in the Scottish parliament the following day, the Scottish First Minister sought to put the issue of a referendum back front and centre.
Sturgeon claimed that the Scottish Parliament has been “sidelined” during Brexit negotiations and that “the case for independence has grown stronger every day”.
She even went on to argue that the protection the EU has offered Ireland during Brexit negotiations should act as an example to other independent nations. Including Scotland, you could only assume.
“The European Union is a union of independent countries and look how it has stood by and stood up for Ireland over these last two years,” Sturgeon said.
“By contrast, as I said to the Prime Minister on the telephone just last night the UK government has ignored Scotland, sidelined Scotland, cast aside Scotland’s interest.”
But while Sturgeon may be seeking to use the draft Brexit deal to put independence back on the agenda, the overall Brexit issue has had the opposite effect she would want.
Related ReadsThe draft Brexit deal is 585 pages long. What's in it and what happens now?
Scotland voted by 55-45% to remain in the UK in 2014 but in the years between that referendum and the Brexit vote, support for independence began to creep up again.
In fact, three separate polls in Scotland on the week of the Brexit referendum showed a majority in favour of independence.An exit poll that daymade it 48-41% in favour of independence with 9% undecided.
But the uncertainty since Brexit has turned that completely around. Almost every single poll since has shown Scots do not favour a break from the union in the midst of Brexit uncertainty. Thelatest poll last month showeda 10 point lead for remaining part of the UK.
WikipediaWikipedia
Sturgeon’s latests efforts may therefore be mistimed, but they are likely designed to ensure that EU membership remains part of any debate on independence.
When Scotland rejected independence in 2014,one of the key issues was whether an independent Scotlandcould join the EU.
At the time it was argued by those against independence that leaving the UK would also risk leaving the EU. Sturgeon’s card is now that leaving the UK could be the only way of staying.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-guidelines-3919769-Mar2018/,"
THE EUROPEAN UNION has agreed on guidelines that will govern negotiations on future relations and trade links with Britain after Brexit, almost exactly a year before the country leaves the bloc.
The agreement was hailed as a big step forward by Britain, which only has months to seal sweeping agreements on trade, security and a host of other areas before it ceases to be an EU member.
While chairing a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that the “EU 27 has adopted guidelines for the future EU-UK relations”.
Thedocumentlays out their approach on a variety of matters, including future security, defence and foreign policy ties, as well as the outlines of a future trade deal.
Britain may negotiate trade agreements with other countries, including Ireland, after it officially leaves the bloc at midnight on 29 March 2019, but no pact can enter into force without EU permission before the end of December 2020, after a post-Brexit transition.
During that period, the country will remain part of the tariff-free single market and customs union even though it will be out of all EU decision-making bodies.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said the transition period would give people and businesses time to prepare for life outside the EU, and she welcomed the EU green-light to future trade negotiations.

“I believe there is a new dynamic now in the negotiations,” May said as she left the Brussels summit.
After kissing May’s hand in front of reporters, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the move, saying “we are taking a decisive step in this difficult and extraordinary negotiation”.
Irish issues
The guidelines warn that the road ahead, particularly on trade, will be bumpy and that Britain should not expect to enjoy the close commercial relations it does today.
“Divergence in external tariffs and internal rules as well as an absence of common institutions and a shared legal system, necessitates checks and controls to uphold the integrity of the EU single market as well as of the UK market. This, unfortunately, will have negative economic consequences, in particular in the United Kingdom,” the document said.
The major issue of the Irish border also remains unresolved. Britain and the EU both agree there must be no customs posts or other infrastructure after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
The two sides have still not agreed on how this can be done.
Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said Ireland wants to see progress on the issue by June “at the latest” if a Brexit deal is to be completed by October, as both sides want.
That would give EU parliaments time to ratify it before Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-secretary-steps-down-4116776-Jul2018/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Jul 2018
BRITAIN’S BREXIT MINISTER David Davis resigned last night in a major blow for Prime Minister Theresa May as she struggles to unite her party behind a plan to retain strong economic ties to the European Union even after leaving the bloc.
Just two days after warring factions in May’s cabinet approved the plan in a bid to unblock negotiations with Brussels, long-time eurosceptic Davis announced he was stepping down in a letter scathing of the agreement.
“The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,” he wrote to May.
Friday’s agreement, which came after marathon talks at the Prime Minister’s country retreat, would “make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real”, he added.
British media reported that junior Brexit ministers Steve Baker and Suella Braverman had also resigned.
Davis was particularly critical of the proposal for a “common rulebook” to allow free trade in goods, saying this “hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.
“I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,” he said, concluding that his post required “an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript”.
May replied in a letter saying that her Brexit plan was in line with her commitment to leave the European single market and customs union.
“I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed,” she said, asserting that it “will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom”.
“I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU,” she added.
Interview
Speaking this morning on BBC Radio’s Today show, Davis defended his resignation and said that the reason he didn’t step down on Friday after the Cabinet meeting was because it needed to be thought through “carefully” and done “properly”.
He said that as secretary he would have been “front and centre” in delivering May’s Brexit strategy, and that that wouldn’t have been plausible given the well-known reservations he had.
He said that the measures set out in May’s plan would put Britain in a weak negotiating position with the EU. The ”common rulebook” he said would make it impossible for Britain not to agree with EU rules.
If it did decide this, he said that meant that the Northern Ireland backstop could be triggered which would be a “sword of Damocles” hanging over the British government.
“It seems to me we are giving too much away too easily,” he said.

Davis said it was important for May to appoint a new Brexit Secretary who agreed with her approach, and he said that he didn’t not want her to resign as prime minister.
Irish response
In response to the resignation, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that matters affecting the British cabinet were “a matter for the prime minister”.
“We welcome that fact that the British cabinet agreed collectively on detailed proposals for the future relationship between the EU and Britain on Friday, and we look forward to seeing greater detail in the UK’s White Paper later this week,” Varadkar said.
“There’s still a lot of work to do, particularly from the British side. Time is running out.
“Brexit in name only”
Davis was appointed two years ago to head up the newly created Department for Exiting the European Union after Britain voted to leave the bloc in a referendum.
He became the public face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels, although his role had been increasingly overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took a bigger role in the negotiating strategy.
The 69-year-old had reportedly threatened to quit several times over a perceived lack of firmness in Britain’s negotiating stance but had remained strictly loyal to the prime minister in public.
May is due to address parliament soon to explain her plan for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit, amid anger from MPs in her own party who want a cleaner break and businesses who say it may still cause economic harm.
She is set to tell MPs there have been “robust views” on Brexit among cabinet members and is also expected to announce a replacement for Davis.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said Davis had “done the right thing”, adding: “The PM’s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.”
Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Brexit hardliner, told Sky News: “This is very important. It raises the most serious questions about the PM’s ideas. If the Brexit Secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposals.”
Ian Lavery, chairman of the main opposition Labour Party, said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.”
May’s plan would create a free-trade area with the EU for goods, to protect supply chains in areas such as manufacturing, while maintaining flexibility for Britain’s dominant service sector.
It is unclear whether Brussels will accept this, after repeatedly warning Britain it cannot “cherry-pick” bits of its single market.

EU TRANSPORT MINISTERS have said the European Commission’s proposal to abolish daylight savings time in 2019 was not realistic and that disagreements remained over how to implement the idea.
Ministers highlighted the challenges of implementing the suggestion, which would see an end to the annual ritual of putting clocks forward by one hour in the spring and then back an hour in the autumn.
Under the proposal still being fine tuned, it will be up to each individual member state to decide whether they follow winter time or summer time.
“If we aim to do this in 2019, as the Commission suggested, this will not be supported by the majority of member states”, Austrian Transport Minister Norbert Hofer said at the start of an informal meeting of his EU colleagues in the city of Graz yesterday.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker — whose terms will end next spring —announced the proposal in August.
The plan, seen as an attempt to demonstrate the Commission was able to react to citizens’ concerns, followed an online consultation which generated some 4.6 million responses.
But the proposal could be complicated if neighbouring countries make different choices on whether to stay on summer or winter time permanently.
“We must also be careful that we don’t end up with a patchwork of time zones” across Europe, Hofer said.
Hofer said that Austria had suggested 2021 as a start date for the change, which had met with “broad agreement”.
EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said she hoped member states could reach a common position before a formal transport ministers’ meeting scheduled for early December.
‘More debate needed’
Hofer said that although most member states were agreed on the principle of ending the practice, and that Austria would like to see it done “as soon as possible”, 2019 would be too ambitious.

“In certain areas, technical preparations will be necessary… for example the airline industry tell us they need at least 18 months to prepare,” Hofer said, later explaining that this was due to the possible impact of timezone changes on airline landing slots that had already been negotiated.
He said that computing businesses had also said they would need time to update operating systems.
While several ministers expressed enthusiasm for ending the practice, others sounded a more cautious note.
“We need a thorough public debate about this… we haven’t had that yet so we need more time to get the Danish position on this,” said Denmark’s Transport Minister Ole Birk Olesen.
“There is not much awareness about the fact that it will have costs whatever we choose,” he added.
New Brexit headache?
Hofer said that three countries had expressed skepticism on the principle of the change during the meeting: Poland, Sweden and the UK.
“The British have it easy of course, being on GMT,” Hofer noted with a smile.
Even though the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019, the UK government’s stated position to keep daylight savings time could lead to yet another Brexit headache along the Irish border.
If Ireland were to follow its EU counterparts, it would lead to a time difference being created across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic during one half of the year.
Proponents of daylight savings time say the longer evening daylight hours in the summer help save energy and bolster productivity.
However, Hofer said that energy savings had been minimal and that the twice-yearly change also has negative health impacts.

BRITISH AND IRISH ministers today played down hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations at an EU summit next week, suggesting it would take until November to clinch a divorce deal.
European Union leaders have demanded real progress by a meeting on 18 October, to allow time for any deal to be approved by the bloc’s parliaments before Britain leaves in March next year.
British Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs the October meeting “will be an important milestone, we expect that to be a moment where we will make some progress”.
But on actually getting a deal, he said: “We’ve always been clear we would aim for the October council but there would be leeway, that it might slip into November. We’re still clear on that.”
Raab declined to say when London would publish its updated plan on how to keep open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key sticking point in the talks.
In Dublin, where the government unveiled a €1.5-billion euro “rainy day fund” to cushion the country from the major economic shock of Brexit, Tánaiste and Foreign Minister Simon Coveney also looked to November.
Negotiations have “intensified significantly this week” on trying to resolve the Irish issue, he said. But, he added:”I suspect November will probably be needed as well as October to get agreement on that.”
EU leaders have held out the possibility of a special November summit to seal the overall divorce deal, but only if there is progress before then.
Northern Irish opposition
British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Europe advisor Olly Robbins is in Brussels this week as the two sides step up private negotiations in what some have called a “diplomatic tunnel” leading up to the summit.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said last week the chances of a deal were now rising but London has been trying to dampen expectations, insisting it will not pressured.

Coveney speculated that Britain would not formally publish its Irish plan, instead preferring to thrash it out with the EU behind closed doors.
The issue is particularly sensitive for May because her majority in the House of Commons depends on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
DUP leader Arlene Foster was in Brussels today for talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. She made it clear she would reject any deal that, with the goal of keeping the Irish land border open, established new checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.
“We could not support any arrangement that would give rise to customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal market,” she told reporters after the talks.
New trade deal
London believes frontier checks can be avoided through a new trade deal with Brussels, but accepts the need for a fall-back plan, or backstop, to address the issue until that deal is agreed.
It has rejected the EU proposal that Northern Ireland stay aligned to the bloc’s customs and regulatory rules, saying this would effectively carve off the province from the rest of Britain.
But it has yet to publish its own alternative, offering only a partial plan to keep the whole of Britain aligned with EU rules for a limited time. This has been rejected by both Brussels and many British eurosceptics.
May’s proposal for the future trade deal, meanwhile, has also been roundly rejected by the EU. Raab repeated May’s demand that the EU give ground, however, saying Britain had made ambitious and pragmatic proposals.
“It is quite right now to expect the EU to move in our direction and if they do match that ambition, if they do match that pragmatism, I am confident that we can still reach a deal,” he said.
On Friday, the EU ambassadors from the 27 non-British member states will meet in Luxembourg to discuss Brexit in the run-up to the summit, a diplomatic source said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/contempt-brexit-vote-4375656-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|5 Dec 2018

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is to publish the full legal advice on her Brexit deal today, after a bruising defeat in the House of Commons.
The House of Commons voted 311-293 to force the government to publish the full legal advice it received from the attorney general about the divorce deal May struck with the European Union last month.
The legal advice will be published at 11.30am today, according to RTÉ.
The government had failed to publish the advice in full despite a resolution passed by MPs last month.
MPs also voted against the government on two other motions – including one that would give MPs the power to decide what to do next if parliament votes down the Brexit deal next week. Although this isn’t legally binding, it gives an indication of May’s support.
May’s critics believe the Attorney General’s report is full of embarrassing details about Britain being forced to follow EU rules for years to come while having no say in its decisions.
Her government argues the prime minister has the right to receive legal advice in private, but after the latest parliamentary defeat promised to release the full report ahead of next Tuesday’s contentious Brexit vote.
“This house has now spoken and it’s of huge constitutional and political significance,” said opposition Labour Party member Keir Starmer.
Lawmakers also backed an amendment that will give them a bigger say in what happens if May’s deal is voted down – an outcome that looks likely.
It would let MPs draft a “Plan B” that May will face intense pressure to follow.
A defeat for the prime minister next week could trigger a no-confidence vote leading to early elections, leaving the Brexit process in utter chaos.
May faced these challenges and the ominous rumblings from disgruntled pro-Brexit members of her own party as she stepped before a packed and agitated session of parliament to kick off five days of intense debate.

“The only solution that will endure is one that addresses the concerns of those who voted ‘Leave’ while reassuring those who voted Remain,” May said.
Her message of unity was interrupted repeatedly by heckling from both pro-EU and Brexit-backing lawmakers.

Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called May’s plan “a huge and damaging failure for Britain” that came from “two years of botched negotiations”.
Brexit shambles
The pro-EU camp’s attempts to secure a second referendum on staying in the bloc meanwhile received a sudden boost from an opinion issued by a legal adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
Advocate General Campos Sanchez-Bordona said Britain had the right to halt the entire Brexit process without the agreement of other EU states.
“That possibility continues to exist until the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded,” he said.
The Scottish National Party’s pro-EU MP Alyn Smith proclaimed: “We now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles.”
But May warned that abandoning the negotiated plan “would take us back to square one”.
“We cannot afford to spend the next decade as a country going round in circles on the question of our relationship with the European Union,” she argued.
Renegotiate Brexit?
The vote next week has huge implications for the future of Britain, and that of May herself.
Labour said a defeat for the prime minister would likely trigger a confidence vote to bring down her government.
She has also been constantly challenged by hardline eurosceptics in her own party and might face an internal leadership contest as well.
Hardline Conservative Brexiteers say May’s compromise deal does not represent enough of a break with Brussels.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) also objects to special provisions for the North.
The party voted against the government Tuesday, formalising a rupture with May’s Conservatives.
Many of May’s critics want her to go back to Brussels and negotiate a better deal – a prospect that EU leaders have ruled out.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-court-ruling-brexit-reversal-4385132-Dec2018/,"THE EUROPEAN COURT of Justice has ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50, halting its withdrawal from the EU.
“The United Kingdom is free to revoke unilaterally the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU,” the court said, in response to a suit from a group of Scottish politicians.
British Prime Minister Theresa May insists she has no plans to reverse Brexit, despite parliamentary opposition to her withdrawal deal from both pro- and anti-Europe MPs.
Under Article 50 of the Lisbon EU treaty, any member state can declare its intention to quit the union, a decision which for Britain comes into effect on 29 March next year.
Britain invoked the article on 29 March 2017 – after voters backed Brexit in a national referendum the year before.
A group of Scottish legislators had asked the ECJ to rule on whether the UK could pull out of the withdrawal procedure on its own.
This morning, the ECJ ruled that “when a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, as the UK has done, that Member state is free to revoke unilaterally that notification”.
The possibility of revoking Article 50 exists as long as a withdrawal agreement concluded between the UK and the EU has not entered into force or if no such agreement has been concluded, during the two-year period.

The ECJ said it would be inconsistent with the EU Treaties’ purpose of “creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe to force the withdrawal of a Member State,” after that state has notified its intention to withdraw and following a democratic process decides to revoke its notification to withdraw.

The withdrawal agreement is expected to go before the British parliament for approval on Tuesday.
‘Dynamite’
The news was welcomed by the six Scottish politicians who took the case, MEPs Catherine Stihler, David Martin, Alyn Smith, MSPs Ross Greer and Andy Wightman, and MP Joanna Cherry.
Smith, who described the ruling as “dynamite”, said that while bringing the case was a risk, the outcome was better than the group could have hoped for.
“The timing is sublime,”he said in a statement.
“As colleagues in the House of Commons consider Mrs May’s disastrous deal we now have a roadmap out of this Brexit shambles. A bright light has switched on above an ‘exit’ sign.”
However, the British government insists it has no intention to revoke Article 50, despite the court ruling.
“We don’t want to stay in the EU,” Environment Secretary Michael Gove, an influential Brexiteer, told BBC Radio 4.
“We voted very clearly. This case is all very well but it doesn’t alter either the result of the referendum or the clear intention of the government to leave.
“It’s the intent of the government to honour that referendum mandate.”

TENS OF THOUSANDS of protesters demonstrated in London against US President Donald Trump, whose on a four-day visit to Britain.
Earlier today, Trump held a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, hoursafter the Sun published a storywhich quoted him as saying that she had “wrecked” Brexit.
Trump said that those remarks, an audio recording of which was published by the Sun, were inaccurate. He added that at a gala dinner at Blenheim Palace the night before he and May spoke for almost 90 minutes and had “probably never developed a better relationship”.

Trump also had tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, but will not attend any high-profile events in London where the big demonstrations are planned.
The Met Police releasedthis image of Trafalgar Square, indicating the scale of the protests:

“#DumpTrump”, “This is the carnival of resistance” and “My mum doesn’t like you! And she likes everyone” read some of the signs held up by protesters as they marched down Oxford Street towards Trafalgar Square.
“No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!” the protesters chanted.

Some protesters banged on pots and pans, others blew on trumpets and many held up orange “Stop Trump” balloons.
One woman wore a pink knitted ‘pussy hat’ at the start of the Women’s March, which will be followed later in the day by the main “Together Against Trump” coalition.
“Donald Trump is misogynistic, chauvinistic, homophobic, xenophobic, promotes bigotry… and has tiny little hands!” said one of the participants, 42-year-old Georgina Rose.
Grant White, 32, carried a sign depicting Trump as the Twitter bird symbol wearing a swastika around his arm.
“I am anti-Brexit, anti-Trump. There is a wave of fascism which we have to get rid of,” he said.
Stopping outside May’s residence in Downing Street, protesters whistled and shouted: “Shame on you!”

May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump since his inauguration last year and extended an invitation for him to visit that proved highly controversial.
‘A juvenile in charge of a superpower’
Around 20 drag artists joined the protest, starting out from Soho – the historic heart of Britain’s gay community – in flamboyantly colourful attire.
“I think he’s just such a poor representation of what America has to give to the world,” said Joey ‘Bourgeoisie’ Frenette, 27, who moved to Britain eight years ago from Washington DC.
Frenette said he felt compelled to protest after seeing images of caged children in the US as a result of Trump’s immigration policies.
Choreographer Joshua Hubbard was strutting his displeasure at the president in knee-high red boots, a cravat and plenty of facial make-up.
“He’s perpetuated so many stigmas,” he said as he marched.
Londoners not protesting and stopping to take in the mass of people, placards and sloganeering seemed supportive of the demonstrations.
“He brings it on himself – it’s like having a juvenile in charge of a superpower,” said construction worker Dan Kelly, 47.

Dawn, 49, came with her 11-year-old daughter Sadie.
“Trump is the man with the biggest ego in charge of the biggest power in the world. He doesn’t have a grasp of what is needed in the world,” the mother said.
Her daughter said: “He doesn’t accept people who have a different religion in his country, where there is big diversity.”
Campaigners elsewhere in London flew a ‘Baby Trump’ balloon, an act of protest approved by London mayor Sadiq Khan which has proved particularly contentious for Trump and his supporters.
“As an American, I think it’s great. It’s a peaceful way of protesting and there are a lot of people who agree with it,” said Brett Kirchner, 25, from the US state of North Carolina.
Jason Caines, 50, said of the inflatable: “It’s good. It needs to be done because he’s a bigot and a racist. He shouldn’t be president, it should have been Hillary Clinton.”
Paul Fonseca, 23, said: “I think it’s hilarious. It’s an accurate representation of his politics which are so immature. He never enters into adult discussion.”
Trump will spend the remainder of the weekend in Scotland on a private visit that will likely take in 18 holes at one of the property magnate’s golf courses, where more protests are planned.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-crisis-4117467-Jul2018/,"IT’S BEEN A turbulent 24 hours for British Prime Minister Theresa May.
First, the Brexit minister and chief negotiator with the EUstepped down. Then her foreign secretary – and chief rival for leadership of the Conservative party –resigned.
The resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson have come just days after her cabinetagreed a “collective position”on its Brexit negotiations with the EU.
What kind of deal the UK reaches with the EU has left the British government bitterly divided and, with today’s resignations, May’s plans for Brexit could now be in ruins with the potential for a challenge to her leadership now appearing likely.
Here’s how we got here:
‘Brexit means Brexit’?
Phrases like “Brexit means Brexit” and “nothing’s agreed until everything is agreed” have been worn thin by the deadline set in place for the UK to leave the EU.
That date is 29 March 2019 and an awful lot still has to be decided.  The EU and the UK are divided on a large number of issue, including customs and trade negotiations, the free movement of EU citizens and the issue of the Irish border.
Meanwhile, large divisions exist within May’s own Conservatives party and cabinet over what sort of approach the UK should take to Brexit.
Both theIrish governmentandthe EUhave been sceptical to Britain’s proposals to solve all the problems that Brexit will create so far.
The hard Brexiteers among the Tories – who count Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg among their ranks – want a complete break from the EU.
They want the UK to leave the EU’s Customs Union and Single Market, and have adopted a hardline approach to negotiations with the EU.
(All sides insist that there can be no hard border between the North and the Republic post-Brexit but no solution has been found so far to reconcile leaving the Customs Union and Single Market and avoiding a hard border. However, a time-limited backstop has been agreed that would keep thingsas they are until December 2021 at the latest in lieu of a satisfactory deal.)
On the other hand, remainers within the Conservative party have sought to give parliament the power to given the opportunity to intervene to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc.
Theresa May has attempted to navigate the tricky waters between both sides of her party, but fell decisively down on the softer side of Brexit with the“collective position” on the negotiations agreed by her Cabinet on Friday.
‘Free trade area’
After a marathon day-long meeting with her ministers on Friday, Theresa May outlined the UK’s stance to negotiations, which has been dubbed the Chequers agreement.
“Today in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,” she said in a statement.
In a video shared on the UK Prime Minister’s Twitter page, the 12 key principles the UK would approach negotiations with were outlined.
But the key principles are quite vague. They include “ending free movement”, “no more sending vasts sums of money each year to the EU”, and “a new business friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world”.
Interestingly enough in relation to the Irish border problem, the UK government is proposing a new “UK-EU free trade area with a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products”.
This would require the UK and EU to agree on what regulations it applies to goods – but the EU is unlikely to lower its standard of regulation of goods in order to create a customs arrangement with the UK post-Brexit.

It also reaffirmed its commitment to “no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.
In a letter purporting to be from May herself to Tory MPs on Friday, it instructs Cabinet members to agree with the proposal outlined, hinting that there they will be out of a job if they don’t comply.

‘Weak’
In his resignation letter, former Brexit secretary David Davis said that the Chequers agreement has the UK in “at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one”.
He made the point that Theresa May’s approach would leave the UK in a largely similar position to the way it deals with the EU now.
Davis said that the supposed control that the UK would be taking back from the EU through Brexit would be “illusory” under May’s plans.
He said the common rulebook idea “hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.
He later told BBC Radio’s Today show that “it seems to me we are giving too much away too easily”.
Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has been a vocal opponent of May’s approach from the get-go.
Johnson called the UK’s post-Brexit customs plans “crazy”in an interview in May.
“That’s not taking back control of your trade policy,” he said. “It’s not taking back control of your laws, it’s not taking back control of your borders, and it’s actually not taking back control of your money either because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels.”
It was reported yesterdaythat Johnson had described May’s Brexit proposals as “polishing a turd” in the course of the day-long meeting of ministers at the Prime Minister’s country retreat.
Johnson was fancied to compete with May to become Prime Minister after David Cameron’s resignation, but his campaign never got off the ground. Now, it’s a very different story.
What happens now?
Theresa May now has a battle on her hands.
Two senior ministers have stepped down. After disagreeing with her policies for quite some time, Boris Johnson’s resignation has now lain down the gauntlet to May.
He could be a rallying point for hardline Brexiteers opposed to the Prime Minister’s approach to Brexit.
Removing May from her job would be difficult, however. It requires 48 MPs to write to the Conservative’s backbench committee to trigger a vote of no confidence in May.
With 330 Conservative seats in parliament, it’s likely May would win such a vote. But, if she didn’t, then that would open the door for a leadership challenge from Johnson.
And, with a party bitterly divided, a general election could be on the cards in the near future with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party hopeful of exploiting the current chaos and building on the gains made in the general election last year.
With only nine months left until Britain leaves the EU, its government is precariously placed.

The “backstop” agreement between the UK and the EU is designed to avoid checks and physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
If Britain and the EU fail to agree a trade deal then Northern Ireland would remain within the EU economic market.
Speaking to Sky News, the first minister said that such a deal could put Scotland at a disadvantage.

“You end up in a position where not only is Scotland being taken out of the single market but we’ve got Northern Ireland still in the single market.”
Asked should a version of the backstop deal apply to Scotland, Sturgeon said: “That would be my position.”
The first minister said she wasn’t going to “stand in the way” of solutions to Northern Ireland’s complicated Brexit issues.
But in terms of single market investment, Sturgeon warned that “Glasgow and Belfast might find [themselves] in competition”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-brexit-eu-summit-4392448-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Dec 2018

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that she doesn’t expect an immediate breakthrough when she meets EU leaders today in an attempt to save her Brexit deal and her career.
The British leader, who survived a confidence vote staged by her own party’s MPs late last night, now needs to turn a narrow victory on home turf into an unlikely away win.
May’s 27 counterparts will join her in Brussels for a EU summit less than three weeks after a 25 November meeting at which they approved the Brexit divorce papers.
An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is also in Brussels with Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee for series of meetings with the European Council today and tomorrow.
The Taoiseach met with May briefly this morning: the two were due to meet in Dublin yesterday, but the visit was cancelled due to a sudden vote of confidence in her leadership of the Tory party.

May is also due to meet with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier before they join other leaders to try to find “reassurances” that the backstop in the Brexit deal – measures to prevent the return of a hard border with Ireland – will not last indefinitely.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels today, May admitted that she didn’t “expect and immediate breakthrough” when she met leaders today.
“My focus now is on ensuring i can get those assurances that we need to get this deal over the line because I genuinely believe that it’s in the best interests of both sides… to get the deal over the line and agree a deal,” May said.
“But I recognise the strength of concerns in the House of Commons and that’s what I’ll be putting to colleagues today.
May said that her primary focus was to “get the deal over the line”. She also confirmed that she would not be leading the Conservative Party into the next general election.
“Yes I’ve said that in my heart I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election but I think that it is right that the party feels that it would prefer to go into that election with a new leader,” she said.
No vote until 2019
A schedule for the House of Commons published today showed that the coming week has been filled by other draft legislation, meaning that the UK’s vote on whether to approve the Brexit deal won’t happen until the New Year. The parliament returns after the Christmas break on 7 January, and May has promised to hold the vote by 21 January.
The agreement on the backstop and the Brexit deal was hailed as the end to a 17-month negotiation, and leaders dared hope they had saved Britain from crashing out of the union on 29 March with no ongoing trade arrangements.
But when May brought the hard-fought compromise back to Britain she ran into renewed opposition from hardline Brexiteers on her own backbenches and balked at putting it to parliament.
EU negotiators said the leaders would listen to May and see what they can offer her in terms of a statement, but insist the 585-page withdrawal agreement itself cannot be renegotiated.
“The margin is really tight, it will be an exercise in presentation,” one senior European diplomat confided Wednesday.

They will, however, hear May out, setting aside time today during a summit they had hoped would deal with migration, budgets and eurozone reform to talk about Brexit once again.
“The discussions in Britain… do not make the situation any easier, but we should nevertheless do everything we can to avoid a hard Brexit,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.
Austria holds the rotating EU presidency and Kurz arrived in Brussels ahead of the summit to talk with host Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, about the agenda.
“It is clear that the withdrawal agreement will not be opened up and amended but there are, of course, other ways of moving towards one another that are in the interests of both sides,” Kurz said.
Backstop sell-by date?
After May made a desperate three-capital European tour on Tuesday to seek assistance from fellow leaders, Tusk had said he would love to help her, but “the question is how”.
Yesterday, Kurz suggested the secret may lie in the question of the backstop.
When asked what could be clarified, he said: “For example, the question: ‘When does the backstop end?’.”
But determined to remain loyal to continuing member Ireland, European officials insist in public and in private that the backstop must stay. “The idea of a sell-by date won’t stand,” one said.
And any modification or addendum to an agreement on plans for future UK-EU relations will not be legally binding, negotiators say.
Anything May does come away with must convince her own party, its angry Northern Irish allies and a majority of British MPs to back the deal if and when it returns to Westminster.
If the agreement is still found wanting not only would Britain and its main trading partners face economic chaos, but May could be finished off by a parliamentary vote of no confidence.
Go to see the Queen
She said yesterday she wanted to “get on with the job of delivering Brexit”, and to see “politicians on all sides coming together”.
But her hardline opponents claimed the vote against her had been higher than expected and that most back members – who do not hold jobs in May’s government – want her gone.
“She ought to go and see the Queen and resign urgently,” leading Brexit rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC.
Eurosceptics hate the divorce deal agreed last month, which they fear risks tying Britain to the bloc for years after Brexit.
Their confidence vote followed the prime minister’s decision on Monday to postpone a planned vote in the House of Commons in the face of what May feared would be a crushing defeat.
She has promised to hold that vote before 21 January – when she may yet still lose, plunging the Brexit process into a fresh crisis.

EU PRESIDENT DONALD Tusk confirmed this morning that the bloc would hold a special summit to seal the Brexit agreement with Britain on 25 November.
Tusk’s announcement will come as a boost to British Prime Minister Theresa May as she begins the daunting task of selling the deal to a fractious parliament where she faces resistance from arch Brexiteers and EU supporters alike.
Ambassadors from the 27 remaining EU states will meet by the end of the week to share their analysis of the withdrawal deal, Tusk said, adding that he hoped “there will not be too many comments”.

They will also take stock of work on the “Joint Political Declaration” about future relations between Brussels and Britain, which Tusk said should be finalised with London by Tuesday and then analysed by member states’ officials.
“Then if nothing extraordinary happens, we will hold a European Council meeting in order to finalise and formalise the Brexit agreement. It will take place on Sunday the 25th of November at 9:30 am,” Tusk told the press alongside EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier a day after the 585-page withdrawal agreement was approved by the British cabinet.
Tusk paid tribute to the work of Barnier and his team, who he said had “ensured the limitation of the damage caused by Brexit” and secured the interests of the EU.
Barnier said the deal was “fair and balanced”, though it has caused uproar among Brexit supporters in May’s government who accused her of betraying the June 2016 vote to leave the bloc.
The deal covers citizens’ rights, Britain’s financial settlement and plans for a post-Brexit transition period during which both sides hope to agree a new trade deal.

The most controversial element is a “backstop” plan to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU until a trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for border checks with Ireland.
Many Brexiteers fear this would leave Britain a “vassal state”, tied to the bloc indefinitely.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has discussed possible remedies to the ongoing impasse over the Brexit deal with Theresa May.
On Monday, the British Prime Minister postponed a crucial House of Commons vote on the draft Withdrawal Agreement so she could seek additional assurances on the backstop element of the deal.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, whichaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
May, whosurvived a confidence motionin her leadership of the Conservative Party last night, held further discussions with EU leaders at a summit in Brussels today.
After speaking to May, Varadkar said: “Some of the suggestions she made made sense, others I thought were difficult.”
Varadkar said the EU might be able to give Britain “a greater assurance” that speedy talks on a new UK-EU trade deal would mean the backstop would never need to be used.
The leaders of the EU-27 are adamant there can be no substantive changes to the legally-binding agreement on Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc but have suggested that there could be some “clarifications”.

Sources said leaders, in general, feel sympathy for May but can offer no promises. Several have publicly said negotiations on the deal, which took 18 months to hammer out, will not be reopened.
January vote
May earlier admitted an “immediate breakthrough” on the situation is unlikely. British MPs are now expected to vote on the deal next month.
May said her focus “is on ensuring that I can get those assurances that we need to get this deal over the line”.
“I don’t expect an immediate breakthrough, but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary,” she said.
May has signalled she will step down before 2022 – when the next general election is due to take place, but an election is likely to happen before then.
“In my heart, I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election,” she said yesterday.
Britain’s departure from the EU is due to take place on 29 March. Ireland is making contingency plans in the event of ano-deal Brexit, but Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said this scenario remains unlikely.

The move wasfirst reported by the The Sunand was confirmed this afternoon when UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond delivered his Budget statement.
The Sun reports that the commemorative coin will be a 50p piece and will be available when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.
Inbudget documents published today, the UK treasury confirmed plans for the coin:

Excl: Philip Hammond to unveil a special 50p Brexit coin in his Budget;https://t.co/8kbCrVyyjm
In today’s Budget, Hammond also announced the introduction of a new digital services tax aimed at tech giants from 2020.
The move comes in response to public outrage over low tax payments by tech multinationals.
“It is only right that these global giants with profitable businesses in the UK pay their fair share,” Hammond told parliament.
Hammond said the tax would be introduced from April 2020 and would apply only to profitable businesses that generate at least £500 million (€562 million) a year in global revenues.
The tax is expected to raise £400 million (€451 million) a year, he said, adding that more details would be revealed later while stressing that it would not be a tax on online sales.

Hammond added that Britain would also continue to press for “international corporate tax reform for the digital age”.
He quipped that he was “looking forward” to getting a call from former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who was named as Facebook’s new head of global affairs earlier this month.
There is political and public unease over the levels of taxes paid by tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.
Facebook earlier this month said its British tax bill tripled to £15.8 million last year compared with £5.1 million in 2016.
Facebook UK’s revenues meanwhile swelled by 50% to £1.26 billion last year compared with 2016.
There has been particular concern in Britain about online shopping giants such as Amazon undercutting traditional retailers.
Today’s tax rules were designed for when multinationals developed real assets and operations in different nations, making it relatively clear where taxes were due.
But the US tech titans exist almost exclusively in the virtual world, their services piped through apps to smartphones and tablets from designers and data servers oceans away.
The European Commission has proposed a European tax on “big tech” with substantial digital revenue in Europe, based on overall revenue in Europe and not just profits.
Ireland has been one of the biggest opponents to the tax, arguing that a growing number of countries are grumbling about hidden problems with the tax, including that it could inadvertently snag European companies.
There is also concern as to what consequences might flow from such a plan at a time against the backdrop of a potential full-blown EU-US trade war.

The announcement was made during yesterday’sBudget speech:
Opponents of Brexit were unimpressed with the gesture, and quickly filled social media with jokes, many playing on the negative impact leaving the EU could have on Britain’s economy.
Social media users have been quick to come up with their own designs for the commemorative coin. With much of the commentary directed at Chancellor Philip Hammond.

As Britain gets closer to the exit date the value of sterling has been continuing to decline, with one pound now buying €1.12 after dipping below that late last week.

EU LEADERS MET in Salzburg, Austria yesterday for an informal discussion on Brexit as we approach the final few weeks before we know whether it’s deal or no deal.
At that two-day informal summit, the UK’s ‘Chequers plan’ came under sharp criticism from a number of EU leaders, resulting in some harsh headlines for the UK Prime Minister this morning.
The Chequers plan, which is the UK government’s proposal for an orderly exit from the EU, has caused a divide in the Tory party and government – and resulted in the resignation of two senior Cabinet members.
It’s also sparked repeated criticism from Europe, which peaked yesterday when it was deemed “unworkable” just weeks out from when a final decision on Brexit must be made.
So what is Chequers, why are we talking about it now, and is it dead in the water?
What happened in Salzburg to spark this?
A number of EU leaders came out of the blocks not only to bat for Ireland, but to criticise the UK for the demands it’s made.
At a fiery press conference yesterday, European Council President Donald Tusk said that there would not be a Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop for the Irish border, reaffirming support for Ireland in wake ofreports to the contrary.
“The Irish question remains our priority too and for this we need only goodwill – which we feel, the atmosphere was better than two or three weeks ago – but the Irish question needs something more than good intentions,” Tusk said.

French President Emmanuel Macron came out with the sharpest criticism for the UK leadership: “Brexit is the choice of the British people…
“Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it’s going to bring a lot of money home, are liars.”
What is Chequers?
‘The Chequers plan’ was the Brexit ideals Theresa May’s Cabinet came up with after a day-long private meeting at the Prime Minister’s countryside residence in Chequers Court, Buckinghamshire.
Ministers were asked to hand their phones in at the beginning of the day in order to offset any possible leaks to the media during the day. After the plan was announced that night, it was reported that May sent an email around to her Cabinet colleagues, softly threatening to fire anyone who would not publicly back the Chequers plan.
A few days later, David Davis resigned asBrexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson resigned asForeign Secretary.
PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
Why are we talking about Chequers?
Tusk said that the UK’s Chequers’ plan, which prompted the resignation of David Davis as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, wasn’t acceptable as a whole, and cherry-picked elements of European Union membership.

“It must be clear that there are some issues where we are not ready to compromise, first off the four fundamental freedoms, the single market, this is why we remain sceptical of Chequers,” he said.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May, however, said that the Chequers plan was the only credible proposal that would deliver frictionless trade on the island of Ireland, and that would respect both the integrity of the United Kingdom and the Brexit vote.
May also said that a new proposition for Ireland, with more detail, would come “shortly” and that London was working towards negotiating a full exit strategy in time for the October summit.
She said that the UK understood the need to protect the integrity of the EU’s custom rules and regulations, but that she would not accept any proposal “that carves Northern Ireland away from the UK”.
So what’s in the Chequers plan?
A lot of what is in the Chequers plan is what’s been repeated before, and is an aspirational indication of what the UK wants (you can read the full plan here).
Barnier says that the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement is 80% completed, but Tánaiste Simon Coveney says that the remaining 10 to 15% relates to Irish issues – the biggest of these being the Brexit backstop and the Irish border.
An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Derrynane Beach.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
So when Tusk says that the Chequers proposal won’t work, that can directly be applied to the Chequers proposal to solve the Irish border problem.
The Chequers plan pledges toend the free movement of people, which was often debated during the EU referendum. The EU has said in response that this would mean the UK automatically leaves the Single Market and Customs Union, as it won’t separate the four freedoms upon which the EU was based (that’s free movement of people, goods, services and capital).
What does Chequers say about Ireland?
Chequers also commits, as Theresa May and her Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have, to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The second part of this is problematic in terms of agreeing a backstop or ‘Plan B’ for the Irish border.
The EU and the UK agreed to “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland in December last year and March this year, as a possible solution to the Irish border issue in absence of no other solution.
Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab.Matt DunhamMatt Dunham
The EU then proposed that Northern Ireland remain in the customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland; the UK responded by saying that it couldn’t accept a border along the Irish Sea (this isn’t just Tories saying this, but Labour party members as well).
The Chequers paper instead proposes establishinga free trade area for goods between the EU and the UK, which in theory would avoid a hard border (the trick is getting a deal that both sides would agree to).This trade deal would include an agreement onagri-food and fisheriesregulations, which would “remove the need to undertake additional regulatory checks at the border – avoiding the need for any physical infrastructure”.This would, however, mean that the UK would have to adopt the EU’s rules on all goods.
It also commits to leave the jurisdiction of theEuropean Courts of Justice, something that the EU is concerned would leave EU citizens’ rights in a grey area. This includes the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in EU member states; as well as extraditions.
The plan also pledges to leave theCommon Agricultural Policy and Common FisheriesPolicy, and to continue cooperation on security and policing measures.
Although members of may’s own Cabinet as well as EU leaders don’t think the Chequers proposals are workable, with very little time left to strike a deal, it’s the only proposal from UK negotiators that they have to work with.

Days after a crucial October summit that ended without progress on the Irish backstop, the UK prime minister is coming under pressure from her Cabinet to deliver on the Brexit promised to those who voted for it.
There’s some uncertainty over what happens next in Brexit talks: the EU says it won’t progress without a backstop, but both sides are entrenched in their views without room for compromise.
As it stands now, it looks as though we’re heading for a no-deal Brexit.
The Telegraphreports today that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab doesn’t want an extension to the Brexit transition period unless the backstop is scrapped.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had originally offered the transition extension in exchange for agreement on the Irish backstop.

As it stands now, Brexit talks are set to collapse over the lack of agreement on the Irish backstop.
At a speech at the Wolfe Tone Commemoration at Bodenstown, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said about Brexit: “The risk of a chaotic Brexit next March is still low because it would serve no one’s interests.”
Ahead of talks to extend the Confidence and Supply agreement, Martin said that his party wouldn’t collapse the government and call an election.
“Our focus is on delivering stability until the risk of a no deal Brexit or a major last-minute change is overcome.”

A TEAM OF British divers who helped save a junior football team stranded in a flooded cave in Thailand were awarded in Britain’s traditional New Year Honours alongside former supermodel Twiggy and Monty Python’s Michael Palin.
The seven underwater specialists involved in the remarkable rescue were also joined on the prestigious annual achievement list – announced yesterday – by Hollywood filmmaker Christopher Nolan, Jim Carter from Downton Abbey, best-selling author Philip Pullman and leading Brexiteer lawmaker John Redwood.
Former Irish rugby player Willie John McBride won a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to rugby, he said that he viewed the honour as “belonging to all his teammates”.

Four of the divers were given awards for exceptional bravery while the three others were made Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE).
Richard Stanton and John Volanthen – the first of the divers to reach the 12 stricken children and their coach – were awarded the George Medal, the country’s second highest civilian gallantry award.
Stanton had already been made an MBE in 2012 for his rescue services.
Fellow divers Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson receive the Queen’s Gallantry Medal, while Joshua Bratchley, Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth were decorated with MBEs.
“For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,” said Unsworth, who has also risen in fame after suing Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk for labelling him “pedo guy”.
“This was a team effort and I’m very honoured to have been recognised, particularly as you don’t engage in a major rescue expecting this outcome,” he added.
‘It makes me giggle’
Sixties it-girl Lesley Lawson, better known as Twiggy, receives a damehood for services to fashion following a decades-spanning career modelling, singing and acting.
The 69-year-old told Britain’s Press Association that the recognition was “wonderful, but it makes me giggle”.
“The hardest thing has been keeping it a secret,” she said.
Acclaimed director Nolan, an Oscar nominee this year for Dunkirk – as well as in 2011 for Inception and in 2002 for Memento – gets a CBE for services to film.

After graduating from low-budget independent movies, he has directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever made – including several Batman films – and become renowned for his technical and narrative daring.
Pullman, the creator of the hugely successfulHis Dark Materialstrilogy, receives a knighthood for services to literature.
The 72-year-old said he was “very surprised and honoured” by the acknowledgement.
“I’m most grateful of all to those who continue to read my books, and I hope they don’t have to work as hard as those who edit them,” Pullman added.
Brexiteer wins knighthood
Palin, 75, becomes the first of Monty Python’s revered comedy cast to receive a knighthood.
The veteran actor, who has reinvented himself as a travel documentary maker and writer in later life, gets a knighthood for his international contributions to travel, culture and geography.
He said news of the accolade had yet to sink in. “I don’t think it will be until I see the envelopes addressing me as Sir Michael Palin,” he added.
Meanwhile, as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in March after decades of membership, John Redwood – one of parliament’s most prominent eurosceptics – was made a knight.
Redwood was part of a group of eurosceptics who plotted to bring down the government of former Conservative prime minister John Major, who called them the “bastards”.
The veteran Conservative lawmaker – a vocal opponent of Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal, set to be voted on in mid-January – was among three MPs awarded knighthoods.
There had been speculation this year’s honours could be deployed to try to win support for May’s plan – but it appears unlikely with Redwood.
Earlier this week he published a blog outlining “eight things wrong with the withdrawal agreement”.
In sport, England football manager Gareth Southgate was awarded an OBE, while captain Harry Kane received an MBE following the team’s memorable run to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia.

UK BUSINESSES HAVE run out of time to prepare for the consequences of Britain leaving the European Union in March without an exit deal, a British government audit showed today.
The findings by the National Audit Office, the government’s spending watchdog, were published with London and Brussels at loggerheads in Brexit negotiations.
The audit found that uncertainty over the course of the negotiations has delayed preparations for a no-deal scenario for business and the government alike, and that for many, time has run out.
“Businesses do not have enough time to make the changes that will be needed if the UK leaves the EU without a ‘deal’,” the report said.
It estimated that between 145,000 and 250,000 traders will need to make customs declarations for the first time should Britain break away without coming to terms with the EU.
“Government papers from July 2018 stated that it was already too late to ensure that all traders were properly prepared for ‘no deal’,” the report wrote.
The audit also found that 11 out of 12 government projects to replace or upgrade existing border systems to prepare for more rigorous customs checks were — as of September — at risk of not being delivered on time to “acceptable quantity”.
In Ireland, the government here has taken steps to get the country Brexit ready with a series of roadshows featuring all relevant State agencies to inform businesses of what they need to know with Brexit looming.

The next roadshow is set to take place in Dublin’s convention centre tomorrow.
Potential chaos
The Financial Times reported yesterday that the British government, realising the potential chaos, was drawing up plans to charter ships to bring in food and medicine in case there was no deal.
The newspaper said a meeting of May’s cabinet yesterday was told that a heavily used trade route between the British port of Dover and the French one in Calais would quickly become blocked if no customs arrangements were made.
Britain would then ferry in “critical supplies” and possibly also car parts.
The National Audit Office said there was a “high delivery risk attached to government departments’ border programmes for ‘day one of no deal’ due to their scale, complexity and urgency.”

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that there’s still time to strike a Brexit deal and to solve the Irish backstop issue.
May and leaders from the 27 member states are meeting in Brussels today and tomorrow to discuss the progress made in Brexit talks. It had been expected that a final deal would be available by now to discuss.
“I will be talking to leaders tonight about the good progress that has been made since Salzburg, both on the Withdrawal Agreement and on our future partnership,” May told reporters this afternoon, before speaking to EU leaders.
She saidthat although both teams have been working very hard, that avoiding an Irish border and agreeing to a backstop remains an issue.
“I believe that everyone around the table wants to get a deal,” she said. “I believe a deal is achievable and now is a time to make it happen.”

After one-on-one meetings with Tusk, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, May will brief her 27 European colleagues before leaving the EU leaders to discuss Brexit over dinner without her.
Tusk has made it clear that if May and Barnier do not signal concrete progress towards a draft Brexit deal, he will not call a November summit to sign it.
Instead, the matter could either be pushed back to December or – more dramatically – the EU could use the November weekend to meet on preparations for a “no-deal” Brexit.

Varadkar and Coveney
Last night, reports emerged that Barnier was open to extending the transition period in exchange for an agreement on a backstop for Northern Ireland. The UK have been opposed to any deal that would “carve off” the North from Great Britain.
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told the BBC that Barnier is proposing an extension, but didn’t say for how long.
Another diplomat warned that the idea “was not really on the table and poses a political problem for the UK”, as Brexiteers are against any proposal that involves extending their stay within the EU.
Speaking from Brussels, Varadkar said that although he’s open to new suggestions on how to break the deadlock, he said that an extension to the transition period “couldn’t be a substitute for the backstop”.

What other leaders think
“I’m an optimistic person but not today, I have to say,” said Slovakia’s Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini.
“I think we will get information that there is still no deal and I think we should do the maximum to try to have an agreement, but we should be prepared as a no-deal result.”
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte says that he’s “cautiously optimistic” that a Brexit deal can be secured in the coming weeks.
“Basically the debate is centred on the issue of the Irish border and how to prevent a border in the Irish Sea which is something the UK desperately wants to avoid.”
At tonight’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Tánaiste Simon Coveney told party colleagues that the main core Irish issue in Brexit– a legally operable backstop agreed by the EU and UK – is still not resolved.
Coveney said the government cannot agree any withdrawal treaty that doesn’t have the backstop in it,  as agreed last December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/argentina-falklands-brexit-4368357-Nov2018/,"
ADDING TO HER EU divorce dramas, Prime Minister Theresa May is on a landmark visit to Argentina for the G20 summit where her hosts are using Brexit to advance their claim on Britain’s Falkland Islands.
May arrived late last night on the first visit by a British premier to the Argentine capital since the 1982 Falklands War between the two countries in what is being seen in Buenos Aires as a chance to improve ties.
However, the 3,400 Falkland Islanders insist their British sovereignty remains non-negotiable and say a proper thaw in their relations with Argentina remains distant.
They have reason to be worried about Brexit: if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, the Falklands’ economy – heavily reliant on tariff-free squid exports to EU member Spain – could face a hammer blow.
Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie made waves last month, saying Buenos Aires would exploit Brexit to enhance its diplomatic push for the Falklands.
Britain’s sovereignty claim to the islands, known in the Spanish-speaking world as the Malvinas, dates back to 1765 and it has held permanent administration since 1833.

Buenos Aires claims the barren, windswept islands, 400 kilometres from the Argentine coast, are occupied Argentine territory.
Argentina’s then-ruling military junta invaded on 2 April 1982 but surrendered on 14 June to a British task force after a brief but intense and bloody war.
‘More connectivity’
Faurie told AFP ahead of the summit that Buenos Aires was discussing with London the possibility of “creating more connectivity to the islands”.
“There is a lot of room still to grow in terms of confidence and trust between the two countries,” he said.
Once Britain is outside the EU in March 2019, the 27 other states will no longer be obliged to support London’s sovereignty position.
Brexit is also an opportune moment for Anglo-Argentine ties: Britain is seeking new trade partners outside the EU while Argentina needs to find ways out of an economic crisis.

“Post-Brexit, (Argentines) are imagining that if the Falkland Islands has to get its economic act in order, that may open up channels,” Richard Lapper, a South America specialist at Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs think-tank in London, told AFP.
Jimena Blanco, Americas chief and Argentina expert at risk analysts and strategic forecasters Verisk Maplecroft, said President Mauricio Macri had moved away from the Falklands “sabre-rattling” of his nationalist predecessor Cristina Kirchner.
Macri’s Falklands policy-makers “have a more moderate approach,” she told AFP.
“There is an understanding that the war, and confrontation under Kirchner, made a lot of damage that cannot be undone by one administration.
No-deal Brexit threat
As an EU member state’s overseas territory, the Falkland Islands enjoy tariff- and quota-free access to the European single market.
Some 94 percent of fisheries exports go to the EU, contributing 40 percent of the islands’ GDP and a third of government revenue.
The second-biggest sector is meat and wool exports.
It is estimated that a no-deal Brexit would shrink the Falklands government’s revenue by up to 16 percent, damaging its ability to deliver public services and invest in roads and hospitals.
Tariffs would “wipe out the EU as a market for meat exports”, while there “really isn’t an alternative market” for its squid than southern Europe, said Richard Hyslop, senior policy advisor to the Falkland Islands government.
“The fishing industry is a huge success story for the Falklands and we don’t want to see anything happen that damages that,” he told AFP.
Even so, establishing alternative trade links with Argentina seems a long way off.
Their sovereignty claim is enshrined in the constitution and Kirchner-era legislation aimed at frustrating the Falklands economy remains in place.
“Certainly I don’t think anyone’s looking at direct trade with Argentina,” said Teslyn Barkman, the Falklands lawmaker responsible for Brexit, the EU and natural resources.
“Regardless of Brexit, they would be trying to find opportunities to work this sovereignty conversation into any development,” she told AFP.","7.28am, 30 Nov 2018",

SPAIN HAS WARNED it could yet derail the Brexit deal agreed between London and Brussels if it does not guarantee Madrid’s veto over Gibraltar’s future status.
Madrid has a long-standing claim on Gibraltar, which was ceded to the British crown in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to sign a treaty with European Union leaders to leave the bloc on Sunday, if Spain does not stand in the way.
But Spain’s Foreign Minister Josep Borrell warned today after a meeting of EU ministers that the draft deal does not spell out how Gibraltar should be handled.
He said the text does not make it clear that future negotiations on ties between Brussels and post-Brexit Britain are separate from the Gibraltar issue.
“Future negotiations on Gibraltar are separate negotiations. And that is what needs to be made clear,” Borrell said.
“Until it is clear … we will not be able to give our agreement”, he warned.
According to Article 184 of the draft divorce deal, “the EU and the United Kingdom shall make every effort, in good faith and with full respect for their respective legal systems, to adopt the measures necessary to negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship”.
These agreements will be negotiated between Brexit day on 29 March and December 2020 – extendable once – and will enter into force at the end of the period.
But Spain wants to retain what it sees as its right to negotiate the future on Gibraltar with Britain on a bilateral basis, giving it an effective veto.

Although the legal service of the EU Council has tried to reassure Spain that the text does not preclude this, Madrid is seeking further clarification.
“Until we have the future declaration and we know what it says, whether we agree or not, we are not going to approve the withdrawal agreement either,” Borrell said.
In London, May’s spokesman said: “The draft withdrawal agreement agreed last week covers Gibraltar.
“The PM has been clear that we will not exclude Gibraltar, and the other overseas territories and the crown dependences from our negotiations on the future relationship. We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family.”
Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said the position adopted by Madrid “does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward”.
Over the weekend, European diplomats said they did not expect Spain’s concerns to derail the agreement.
Business support
Meanwhile, May today told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the UK’s main business lobby group, that she was “determined to deliver” her Brexit deal as she prepares for Sunday’s European Council summit to sign Britain’s divorce papers with the EU.
“We now have an intense week of negotiations ahead of us,” she told some 1,000 business leaders at the CBI annual conference in London.
“I expect us to hammer out the full and final details of the framework that will underpin our future relationship.
“I am confident that we can strike a deal at the Council that I can take back to the House of Commons.”

Varadkar said that “with growing uncertainty” about whether the UK government will pass a withdrawal agreement through Westminster, Ireland will need to “change the gear and up our preparations when it comes to Brexit”.
He was speaking after a Cabinet meeting at Derrynane in Co Kerry.
Varadkar said that this plan includes making preparations to our ports and airports, including Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Shannon, for a change to the rules of trade between Ireland and Britain in January 2021.
“That involves preparing for and hiring veterinary inspectors to carry out sanitary checks on agricultural products and plant-based products coming in from Britain and also customs inspectors,” Varadkar said.
“We estimate that the number of people we will have to hire over the course of the next year is about 1,000 people. That’s customs and veterinary inspectors to prepare our ports and airports for Brexit.”

Speaking onRTÉ’s Six One Newsthis evening, Varadkar said hiring the extra inspectors was a prudent step in order to prepare for the UK leaving the EU.
He said the government accepted Brexit was going to happen. A ‘no deal’ Brexit was an unlikely scenario, he said, adding that the government had to prepare for that possibility.
He said the preparations that were being put in place were not for the border region but were for east-west trade between the UK and Ireland.

He said he was not happy with the level of progress being made in the Brexit negotiations, but that he was happy with how the EU team was representing Ireland’s interests.
The EU was negotiating with the UK from “a position of strength”, he said – adding that Ireland’s chances of getting a good deal were boosted by the fact that all remaining EU nations were negotiating together.
Government measures
The government today signed off on a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focussed on east-west trade, moving this work from the planning to implementation stage.
Relevant government departments have been tasked to prepare detailed action plans building on their contingency planning and regular updates will now be submitted to the government.
The Cabinet has mandated the presentation to government, by September, of detailed and costed plans on the following:
The government agreed to continue contingency planning for a case of a ‘no deal’ Brexit.
The Cabinet also agreed on the need to continue to engage with the European Commission Taskforce and EU Brexit Preparedness Unit on areas where the lead policy role lies with the EU.
In a statement, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: “It is important to be clear that the decisions taken by government today do not represent the beginning of our preparations.
“A huge amount of work has been underway across government and its agencies for many months. We will also be carrying out some of our preparations on an EU-wide basis, in cooperation with our EU partners.
“The UK has chosen to walk away from the EU’s comprehensive regulatory framework but we will continue to benefit from the stability of our EU membership.”

SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said she is writing to the Taoiseach today seeking a private briefing for all party leaders on the state-of-play in the Brexit talks.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Brexit negotiations are now “in the endgame” as a deal continues slipping out of grasp despite intense talks between her government and the European Union.
May spoke to leaders of London’s City financial district with anxiety mounting over the doomsday possibility of Britain leaving the soon-to-be 27-nation bloc in March without an agreement.
The British prime minister hopes to seal divorce terms that can maintain frictionless trade — and assure there is no panic on the markets — by the end of November.
But the latest in a series of crunch meetings between top negotiators in Brussels broke up without a breakthrough in the early hours of yesterday morning.
“The negotiations for our departure are now in the endgame,” May’s office quoted her as telling a reception in the heart of London’s financial district.
“And we are working extremely hard, through the night, to make progress on the remaining issues in the withdrawal agreement, which are significant.”
Speaking to the media this morning, McDonald said she was still concerned that the Taoiseach had not clarified his intentions about a possible backstop review mechanism being acceptable.
She added that if reports are true, and the ‘end game’ in the negotiations is approaching, any sort of time limited backstop would be “wrong” and a bad idea.
When?
A UK government source has said a deal must happen by tomorrow if there is any hope of an extraordinary EU summit this month to sign the withdrawal agreement.
The crisis could otherwise drag on until a regular EU summit on 13 December.
This would dramatically curtail the time May will have to get any agreement past a rebellious British parliament before Brexit day on 29 March.
The pound dropped to $1.285 from Friday’s close of $1.297 amid fears of the saga ending in a messy divorce that fails to establish short-term trading rules between one of Europe’s biggest economies and the rest of the bloc.
Not at any cost
The talks are stuck on the question of a “backstop” arrangement to prevent the return of border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic if the sides fail to agree a free trade pact.
“Some key issues remain under discussion, in particular a solution to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,” the European Commission said yesterday.

The Financial Times briefly lifted markets by reporting yesterday that chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier told European ministers that the outlines of a deal were now “very largely defined”.
But both British and EU officials took pains to quickly play down the report.
Tániste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney saw no substantive progress after meeting Barnier.
“The two teams have really intensified their engagement,” Coveney said yesterday.
Britain’s latest concerns are focused on how it might be able to exit the “backstop” arrangement and start negotiating its own trade deals.
But signs last week that the sides were nearing a compromise looked far less promising after May came under attack from key British players for giving away too much ground.
May’s Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party — a group of 10 MPs that props up her government — and eurosceptics in her own party have accused the prime minister of negotiating away Britain’s sovereignty.
Their main fear is that Northern Ireland will be left partially under EU regulation after the rest of Britain breaks free.
May appeared to be addressing those fears by telling City officials yesterday that there “will not be an agreement at any cost”.

Mystery Cabinet meeting
May will host a weekly Cabinet meeting today that she had initially hoped would sign off on a deal struck over the weekend with the EU.
But a British source has said there is “no agreement for them to discuss” Brexit after the talks fell through. The deal is meant to finalise Britain’s exit bill of around £39 billion (€45 billion).
It must also guarantee citizens’ rights and launch a 21-month transition during which London will follow EU rules.
British and European negotiators will launch more ambitious talks during this transition period on future trading and legal relationship. But May is facing increasing pressure from all sides in her Conservative party over the mooted plan.
Eurosceptics have long warned against staying too close to the Brussels. There are also growing indications that pro-Europeans are gearing up to block the Brexit deal and seek a brand new referendum on the country’s future course.
If a deal is struck, it will have to be passed by the UK parliament. The Sinn Féin leader was again asked if there was any circumstances in which her members would take their seats at Westminster, just on this occasion, in order to vote on the Brexit deal.
When asked if Sinn Féin votes might matter, she said, “it might and it might not, all of that is speculative”.
McDonald said since Brexit happened there have been arguments made that Sinn Féin votes in Westminster could change the course of Brexit, however, she said as the votes have happened that has never been the case.
“If we were, which we are not, minded to enter Westminster just watch the law of unintended consequences. Be very sure that it would have a political affect in terms of remain Tories and so on, and I think anyone who knows the political acoustic of Westminster would tell you straight out,” she said.
McDonald said her party do represent their constituents in the North who have turned away from Westminster, and highlighted the number nationaliststhat recently wrote to the Taoiseach, which said did not happen by accident.
She said Irish interests need to be protected by the Irish government and its EU partners.
“We are an Irish republican party, and we do not contenance taking an oath to a foreign crown and sitting at Westminster at any stage, that is not on the cards.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-customs-union-deal-sunday-times-4322262-Nov2018/,"REPORTS THAT SUGGEST Britain would remain in a temporary customs union with the EU, avoiding a hard Irish border, as part of a new deal being thrashed out have been dismissed as “speculation”.
Senior sources told the Sunday Times that British Prime Minister Theresa May has secured concessions from Brussels, with the EU agreeing to write an “all-UK” customs union into the divorce deal.
This would avoid the EU’s “backstop” solution that would have treated Northern Ireland differently from the rest of Britain.
There will also be an “exit clause” from the customs union in a bid to convince Brexiteers that it is not a permanent arrangement as May looks to secure enough votes to get the deal through parliament, it added.
Downing Street refused to confirm the report, telling AFP it was “all speculation”, but that negotiations were “going well”.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s This Weekprogramme, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan also branded the report as “speculation”.
“There’s a lot of media speculation … which is no more than that, speculation,” Flanagan said.
“I’m not going to say anything that’s going to add to that speculation,” he said.
Flanagan said that Irish priorities “are very much in evidence”, and in that regard, “it’s absolutely essential now that we see the written legal text which is the backstop”.
According to RTÉ, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said the UK has given written commitments last December and March that the withdrawal agreement will give a legal guarantee of no return to a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance.

The Irish border has proved the biggest obstacle to a deal, with both sides vowing not to reinstate a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland for fear of destabilising the peace accord that ended decades of deadly sectarian violence.
Under the reported deal, the EU accepts that regulatory checks on goods can be carried out in factories and shops rather than at the border, the Sunday Times said.
That keeps open the possibility of Britain securing a future free trade agreement similar to the one signed between Canada and the EU in 2016.
The opposition UK Labour party has all but ruled out supporting any deal May reaches with Brussels, leaving the prime minister reliant on her slender parliamentary majority that comprises her own divided MPs and coalition partners the DUP of Northern Ireland.
Legal warning
According to the report, May is expected to warn her most stridently anti-EU MPs that they will be held responsible for the consequences of a no-deal Brexit if they do not vote for her deal.
However, if these Brexiteers are not convinced that the customs union is only a temporary measure they would almost certainly rebel.
Her cabinet is due to hold talks over the plan on Tuesday, with a potential EU summit pencilled in for the end of November if they agree enough progress has been made.
Parliament would then vote on the deal in December.
May’s former Brexit minister David Davis warned in the newspaper that she must be transparent about the legal foundation of her deal or suffer the same “mess” that Tony Blair did over the Iraq War.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has been contacted for comment.

THE BRITISH SANDWICH Association has warned that there could be problems getting ingredients like tomatoes and lettuce into the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Jim Winship of the group raised these concerns on the BBC Newsnight programme last night, saying the industry fears problems in getting fresh food through British ports on time.
Complicated negotiations with the EU and internal party disputes in Theresa May’s Conservative Party have raised the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.
The UK is due to depart the bloc on 29 March 2019 and a no-deal scenario has sparked fears about confusing travel and trade arrangements.
Asked about this, Winship said that the sandwich industry is concerned.
“I don’t think it means absolutely no sandwiches because our industry is very creative and clever at coming up with new recipes.”
“I think the answer from the sandwich industry is it’s going to limit the amount of choice consumers have if we suddenly crash out Brexit in the way that’s been talked about.”

Speaking on the same programme, Conservative MP Marcus Fysh dismissed the concerns as “silly”.
“I think silly season has started a bit early this year, there’s no suggestion whatsoever that  imports from the EU will be limited by our new trade agreements,” he said.
Challenged by the show’s presenter that Winship was speaking about a no-deal scenario, not new trade arrangements, Fysh said: “It’s completely, wrong. It’s a false assumption, there’s not going to be a trade blockade, by the UK, of Europe. ”
Responding to the MP, Winship said that any delay of ingredients would create a problem.
“If we suddenly have border controls being introduced that aren’t there now, that’s going to cause some massive problems with the fresh ingredients. We live in a just-in-time world. We don’t stockpile ingredients,” he said.
After appearing on the programme, Fysh suggested that Winship’s comments could be influenced by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, whose bother Patrick is CEO of major food producer and distributor Greencore.

According to a report inThe Timestoday, English football’s governing body is under pressure to strike a deal with the Premier League and the proposal will be put to the 20 clubs this week.

Premier League squads can currently contain 17 overseas players, but the changes would see that number cut to 12 — meaning half will have to be made up of “homegrown” players.
In return, the FA would reportedly agree to give a “governing body endorsement” for a work permit for every foreign players who earns a Premier League contract.
If the two bodies can’t come to an agreement, however, they could face a scenario where “all EU players would have to fulfil the same criteria that non-EU players do now in order to get a work permit”.
Manchester City, Tottenham, Watford, Brighton and Huddersfield all have 17 foreign players at present, while Chelsea (16), Liverpool (16) Fulham (16), West Ham (16), Arsenal (15), Manchester United (14), Newcastle United (14) and Leicester City (13) would also be affected if the changes were brought in.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has responded to EU leaders’ criticism of her Chequers plan, saying that ”I have treated the EU with nothing but respect – the UK expects the same”.
In a statement given inside 10 Downing Street this afternoon, May reiterated the UK’s stance on Brexit negotiations, repeating that a border on the Irish Sea would not be accepted by any UK Prime Minister.
“I will not overturn the result of the referendum, or break up my country,” she said, echoing the statement she gave yesterday where she said Chequers was the only proposal that respected the Brexit vote and the integrity of the UK.
She said that although both sides want a deal, they were currently at an “impasse” and that there were “two main issues where we remain a long way apart”: the economic relationship after Brexit, and the EU’s proposal for the Brexit backstop.
She said that the EU was proposing to remain in the economic area, which “in plain English, would mean we’d still have to abide by all the rules of the EU”.
That would mean accepting migration and being unable to strike up trade deals with other countries outside the EU.
The second option would be a free trade deal with Britain, and would mean that Northern Ireland would remain inside the Customs Union and would be “permanently separated from the UK by a border down the Irish Sea”.
“Parliament has already unanimously rejected this idea,” she said.
Accepting any deal that divides her country was out of the question, May reiterated:
She said that there could be no customs border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but commentators speculated that she left the door open to a regulatory border – if the Northern Ireland Assembly were to agree to it.

May also repeated her pledge from yesterday to put forward proposals for a solution that would avoid a hard border and would still “be in line with the commitments we made back in December”.
She then pushed the EU to come forward with a response on what the specific problems with the Chequers proposal are, and to give their alternatives. In the meantime, she said “we must continue the work ourselves for no deal”.

Addressing those in Northern Ireland, May added that in the event of a no deal, the UK will do “everything in our power” to prevent a hard border.
She also pledged that the rights of EU citizens in the UK would be protected, telling them: “We want you to stay.”
The British pound, already down against the dollar and the euro, fell sharply following May’s comments.
‘Good for all’ compromise
EU Council President Donald Tusk hit back this evening at May’s criticism of the EU’s negotiating position: “The results of our analysis have been known to the British side in every detail for many weeks.”
“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising,” he said in a statement.
Tusk added he remains “convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible” in Brexit negotiations and that he is “a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May”.
Yesterday, EU leaders such as Council President Donald Tusk, and French President Emmanuel Macron criticised the Chequers plan, which contains the UK’s proposal for an orderly exit from the European Union.
May was then forced to answer the criticism levelled at her plan by EU leaders; theFinancial Timesreports that the PM was ”blindsided” by the timing of the remarks and was ”pretty fired up”, according to one aide.
When Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was asked whether yesterday could be described as an ambush, he answered “Yes, it probably was”.
This exchange comes just a month before a vote on the final Brexit plan is expected to happen.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said that 80% of Brexit issues have been agreed; Tánaiste Simon Coveney qualified this progress by saying that a lot of the remaining issues – including the Irish border issue – relate to Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexiteers-reaction-brexit-deal-no-border-4338075-Nov2018/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May faces a backlash from leading Tory Brexiteers following a reported deal with the European Union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Reports this evening suggestedthat Britain has finally agreed a draft Brexit deal with the EU that would see a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement with specific rules for Northern Ireland.
However, negotiations have not yet concluded and May must still get the reported deal through her Cabinet, which meets tomorrow, and then the divided House of Commons.
After news of the deal emerged, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who quit the government in July over May’s strategy, said he would not support the deal.
“This is a quite incredible state of affairs,”he told reporters this evening.
“It will mean that we will have to accept rules and regulations from Brussels over which we have no say ourselves. It is utterly unacceptable to anybody who believes in democracy.”

‘Matter of concern’
Johnson also criticised the deal for the power it would give Ireland over Northern Irish affairs, saying Dublin would have more say over the Stormont executive than London for the first time since partition if it goes through.
Another leading Brexiteer in the Conservative Party, Jacob Rees-Mogg, called the deal “deeply unsatisfactory”.
“It is a failure of the government’s negotiating position and a failure to deliver on Brexit,”he told BBC, adding that he hoped that MPs will block the deal when it is put before parliament.
Former Brexit minister David Davis was also critical of the plan, calling it the “moment of truth”.
This is the moment of truth. This is the fork in the road. Do we pursue a future as an independent nation or accept EU domination, imprisonment in the customs union and 2nd class status.

Meanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the agreement must give legal effect to a ‘cast iron’ guarantee that would protect Irish interests and the Good Friday Agreement.
“While we await the publication of this document, it is a matter of concern that some are presenting the backstop agreement as temporary,” she said.
“Brexit is for the long-term and what is required is a durable, permanent and legally robust agreement that safeguards Irish interests and ensures there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to hold a special Cabinet meeting tomorrow to consider the reported draft Withdrawal Agreement.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR and UK Prime Minister Theresa May have spoken by phone as high-level Brexit negotiations become more fractious and public.
The UK’s Brexit Minister Dominic Rabb has reportedly asked May to insist that Britain has the right to pull out of the Irish backstop after just three months. A stance that could be potentially calamitous to the chances of securing a deal with the EU this week.
Responding to the reports of what Raab has demanded this morning, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said such a situation would not be a backstop at all, and doesn’t deliver on previous UK commitments.
Varadkar also said the government in Ireland ‘can’t countenance any idea’ involving a limit like this on the backstop.
“A backstop with a three month limit on it or an expiry date of that nature is not worth the paper it is written on and what the UK government signed up to is a legally operative backstop that will apply unless and until we have a new agreement to supersede it,” he told reporters in Dublin this morning.

The Irish and UK leaders spoke also by phone this morning with a statement by the Department of the Taoiseach saying the call came at the request of May.
The department said that Varadkar was not opposed to a review of the backstop but that the UK must not have the sole decision after any such review.
“Both leaders emphasised their commitment to avoiding a hard border and the need for a legally operable backstop,” the statement said.
It continued:
The Prime Minister raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop. The Taoiseach indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop. He recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply ‘unless and until’ alternative arrangements are agreed. They both expressed the hope that the negotiations could conclude in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible.
Hardline
The Daily Telegraph reported todaythat Raab had adopted the hardline stance which is at odds with the guarantees sought by the EU and Ireland that there would be no physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland once Britain leaves the EU.
His plan would grant a “review mechanism” within three or six months of the backstop coming into effect, allowing the UK the right to ditch the backstop if it so wished after this time period.
This plan is one at odds with comments made by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington during a visit to Dublin last week.
After that meeting, Coveney said: “”I think we’re very close to resolving it, I certainly hope we are.”
Lidington said: “We’re certainly, as Simon says, very close to resolving it.”
The Tánaiste said this morning, however, that proposals such as those coming from Raab would undermine any chance of a deal.
He said: “The Irish position remains consistent and [very] clear⁩ that a ‘time-limited backstop’ or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by [Ireland] or EU.”

What is the backstop?

Put simply, the backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.
The backstop would kick in at the end of the transition period – which starts on 29 March and ends on31 December 2020- if a final deal on trade and other matters is agreed.
The issue has remained one of the chief sticking points in the negotiations between the EU and UK for some time.
A backstop remains unpalatable to hardline Brexiteers and the DUP, who argue that this arrangement cuts off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
Theresa May’s government has made a commitment to ensuring no hard border in Northern Ireland but is beset on all sides by agitators in her own party and the DUP which is helping to prop up her government.
Next steps
Theresa May is set hold a Cabinet meeting tomorrow, with Raab’s proposal likely to feature prominently.
She is expected to warn her most stridently anti-EU MPs that they will be held responsible for the consequences of a no-deal Brexit if they do not vote for her deal.
However, if these Brexiteers are not convinced that the customs union is only a temporary measure they would almost certainly rebel.
Cabinet are also set to discuss a potential EU summit pencilled in for the end of November if they agree enough progress has been made.
The UK parliament would then vote on the deal in December, as other EU countries would also have to ratify the deal reached.
Separately, more than 70 business leaders penned a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a second Brexit referendum.
Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria and former Marks and Spencer chairman Alex Chesterman were among those who warned Britain was “facing either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit” which would depress investment.
“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People’s Vote,” it added.
In another letter, more than 1,000 nationalists have written to the Taoiseach urging him to defend the rights of Irish citizens north of the border, with the letter published in the Irish News today.
Signatories include Irish footballer James McClean, actors Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin and film director Jim Sheridan.

THE UK RISKS crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal deal unless substantial progress is made in talks ahead of a crucial summit next month, Leo Varadkar has warned.
Varadkar said he had yet to see a proposal from London that “remotely approaches” a solution to the border issue with Northern Ireland.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May, facing bitter splits in her government over the post-Brexit trading relationship with the bloc, held one-on-one talks with the Taoiseach and EU Council President Donald Tusk on the sidelines of a summit in Sofia.
Varadkar warned that time was running out to agree the terms of Britain’s withdrawal agreement, saying a 28-29 June summit in Brussels would be vital.
“The deadline for the withdrawal agreement is October, but if we’re not making real and substantial progress by June then we need to seriously question whether we’re going to have a withdrawal agreement at all,” Varadkar told reporters as he arrived for the summit.
His warning piles pressure on London to come up with a solution to avoid a “hard” border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

It comes after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier fired a broadside at Britain on Monday, saying there had been little movement in talks since leaders last met in March.
The EU has suggested a “backstop” proposal for the Irish border in which only Northern Ireland would stay in a customs union post-Brexit, but London says that would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Varadkar urged May to come up with concrete proposals for what do to with the border.
“But we need to see it written down in black and white, we need to know it’s workable and legally operable and we’ve yet to see anything that remotely approaches that,” Varadkar said.
The Telegraph newspaper reported earlier that a cabinet sub-committee this week agreed the UK would stay aligned to EU customs rules, possibly until two years after the transition phase ends in December 2020.
Britain is due to leave the European Union in March 2019 but continue the current trading arrangements during the transition, to give time for the two sides to agree the terms of a new partnership.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa Mayearlier today promoteda largely unknown junior health minister, eurosceptic Stephen Barclay, to be her new Brexit Secretary.
He becomes the third person to hold the job overseeing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, after his two predecessors, Dominic Raab and David Davis, both quit in protest at May’s approach.
Commenting on his appointment today, Barclay tweeted: “Delighted to accept role at DExEU. We now need to keep up the momentum to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement and outline political declaration and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK.
“Looking forward to working with a talented team of ministers and officials to do just that.”
And so, who exactly is Stephen Barclay?
A trained lawyer, Barclay has been an MP since 2010, when he was elected Conservative MP for North East Cambridgeshire.
He was previously Minister of State for the Department of Health from January to November this year. Prior to that role, Barclay acted as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from June 2017 to January 2018.
He served as a government whip from July 2016 to June 2017.
In the past, Barclay has also served on the UK Public Accounts Committee and served as an assistant government whip.

Now, let’s take a quick look back at Barclay’s life prior to his political career.
Barclay was educated at King Edward WII School in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, before reading history at Peterhouse, Cambridge.
He later went on to study law at the College of Law in Chester.
Following his studies, he worked as an insurance company lawyer for Axa Insurance and as a regulator for Britain’s Financial Services Authority.
He also worked at Barclays Bank as director of regulatory affairs and head of anti-money laundering.
Barclay is married with two children.
His appointment follows Raab’s resignation on Thursday over the Brexit deal struck with the EU.
Raab himself was only appointed in July after Davis quit, also complaining about May’s strategy.
Barclay now has the task of steering legislation implementing the Brexit through a hostile parliament.
His department also leads planning for the risk that the process collapses and Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without any deal in place.

https://www.thejournal.ie/second-referendum-brexit-irish-people-4265951-Oct2018/,"THREE QUARTERS OF Irish people want the UK to vote again on whether they should leave the European Union.
In a survey for Claire Byrne Live/Amárach Research, 75% of people answered ‘Yes’ when asked whether the UK should hold a second referendum on Brexit.
Of the remainder, 15% responded ‘No’, and 10% said they didn’t know.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that he would allow a second vote if his party backed the decision, while UK Prime Minister Theresa May criticised a prospective second vote as undemocratic during her Tory party conference speech:
“A second referendum would be a politicians’ vote. Think of what it would do to democracy… Politicians telling people they got it wrong and to vote again.”

Labour are using the promise of holding a second vote in an attempt to attract voters in any prospective election – despite Corbyn’s political past as a Eurosceptic.
In what appeared to be an acknowledgement of that threat, in her speech to Tories on Wednesday May took the opportunity to repeatedly attack Corbyn and say that the Labour party had gone into decline under his leadership.
Ireland’s second vote
In October 2009, Ireland held a second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, after the electorate voted against it by 53.4% to 46.6% in 2008.
The second time round, 67.1% of the electorate voted in favour of the Lisbon Treaty, which formed the basis for Ireland’s entry to the European Union. Although Ireland is very pro-EU according to opinion polls, the second Lisbon vote is often criticised as a lack of respect from politicians for the people’s vote.
Ireland was the only EU member state that held public referendums on the Treaty; echoing some arguments that it was irresponsible for former UK Prime Minister David Cameron to put the issue of EU membership to the electorate in the first place.
The Claire Byrne Live / Amarách Research Panel consists of over 1,000 Irish adults, all aged 18+. The poll was conducted on Monday 1 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-dialogue-3985904-Apr2018/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said Ireland is not interested in a “land grab” in Northern Ireland.
Speaking at the All Island Dialogue on Brexit this morning, he also said the United Kingdom’s approach “will have to change in some way” if the Brexit withdrawal agreement is to go ahead.
Varadkar said the Irish government pursuit for a Brexit backstop to avoid a hard border is not a bid for a land grab, stating:
“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the EU being interested in a land grab for Northern Ireland. That is not on our agenda”.
Lead EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, joined the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Simon Coveney in Dundalk Institute of Technology today – where the border issue is top of the agenda.
“Without a solution to the border issue, there will be no agreement, let there be no doubt about that,” said the Taoiseach. He added that there needs to be real and meaningful progress by June’s EU Council meeting.
While there are many, many issues at play in relation to Brexit, it is the border issue that primarily concerns Ireland, and is one of the issues that has the potential to hold up the talks.

There is still a big question mark over how the border will operate in light of Brexit.
The idea that technology solutions are the answer has been dismissed by the Taoiseach and the EU.
Earlier this month, thefront page of the Telegraphnewspaper reported on a leaked report which highlighted that the UK’s border solutions were not workable – something Coveney and Varadkar said they have highlighting for some time now.
Today, the Taoiseach sought to reassure the unionists in Northern Ireland. The Irish government has “no hidden agenda”, he said.

One of the unionists’ concerns is the border will be moved to the Irish Sea, which they argue would undermine and threaten the union with the UK.
Foster said earlier that Barnier does not understand the dispute and is “not an honest broker”. She also accused him of not understanding her party’s position.
Barnier denied this is the case, stating that he is not going to enter “polemics” with the DUP.
He added that he did not enter the negotiations in a “spirit of revenge”, stating that his “door is open”.
“I respect all opinions,” he said.

Following a meeting this morning, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney said they remain united on the position of the border with Northern Ireland, reiterating the point that there can be no hard border.
Barnier said the EU is resolutely committed to protecting and nurturing the peace process on this island.
Using the word ‘extraordinary’ to describe the negotiations on two occasions this morning, he also acknowledged “there is a risk” the Brexit talks will fail if progress is not made. However, he said he is “determined” to get a deal over the line.
He added that he would use the word determined rather than “optimistic or pessimistic” when describing his hopes for the talks.

Varadkar thanked Barnier today for showing his commitment to Ireland and understanding the importance of having an effective solution to the border problem in the withdrawal agreement.
Coveney thanked him for delivering on the promises he made when he firstvisited the Dáil last May.
He told the head of the EU task force that Barnier had become a “household name” in Ireland. The Tánaiste said Barnier is a man to be trusted, adding that after many meetings, the head of the EU task force often takes him by the elbow and states: “I am with you till the end.”

The former chancellor, who was sacked by May in 2016, also suggested that there is a strong possibility of a general election in the United Kingdom in 2019.
Speaking toBBC Radio 4′s Today programme today, Osborne – who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU – claimed that a referendum on the country’s withdrawal from the bloc should never have happened in the first place.
“I’m sceptical of referendums, he said.
“We live in a parliamentary democracy and I think it’s difficult to put simple single issues to the public and expect simple answers.
“Frankly, these are very complex issues and that’s why we have a parliament.”
Osborne, who was former prime minister David Cameron’s closest ally in government between 2010 and 2016, also hit out at demands for a no-deal Brexit as “reckless”.
And he claimed that a second Brexit referendum or a general election was likely in 2019.

“A general election is at the moment an under-reported likelihood for 2019 because in the British system the simplest way to resolve political impasses is to return to the public at a general election,” he said.
“There is a way of course for the government to avoid that and they are terrified of an election: they can themselves embrace a referendum.
“And that is clearly under discussion in Downing Street even though it’s denied.”
May has repeatedly ruled out the option, saying to do so would cause more division and may not resolve the question.
He added that if a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, he would urge the public to reverse Brexit.
“In the two years since we’ve learnt a lot more about what’s involved in leaving the European Union, we’ve learnt a great deal more about what’s on offer outside the European Union,” he said.
Earlier this month, May postponed a vote in the House of Commons on the withdrawal deal she struck with the EU in November, fearing a huge defeat as many of her own MPs oppose it.
She is seeking further clarifications from Brussels on arrangements relating to the Irish border, and has said the vote would take place the week of 14 January.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on 29 March.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jacob-rees-mogg-protest-4232550-Sep2018/,"PROTESTERS WHO SHOUTED at Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children during a demonstration have been strongly criticised by politicians in the UK.
In a three-minute videouploaded to Facebook yesterday, protesters could be seen hitting out at the pro-Brexit MP and his family outside his London home.
At one stage, a protester is captured telling the pro-Brexit MP’s children “your daddy is a horrible person” and “lots of people don’t like your daddy”.
The same protester asked Rees-Mogg how much he paid his family’s nanny, whether he gave her any time off, and whether she had developed “Stockholm Syndrome”.
“Your poor nanny who looks after you and wipes your bottom, she doesn’t get enough money every week,” he says.

“Daddy doesn’t care, because he’s too busy posing as a…toff, which he does pretty well.”
A group of police officers are stood between the protester and Rees-Mogg’s family throughout the incident.
The protest has since been criticised on both sides of Britain’s political divide.
According to BBC, a spokesman for Theresa May called the demonstration intimidating and “completely unacceptable”.
“No elected member or their family should be subjected to intimidation or abuse in that way,” the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman told the broadcaster that the behaviour of protestors was “abhorrent”.
Speaking on Politics Live, she condemned the protest “without any reservation”, and said that those involved should “never be anywhere near” children.

THE UK AND EU have spent a little over one hour discussing what the future of security between the two will be post-Brexit.
So says a new report from a UK House of Lords committee on home affairs.
The report, published today and entitled ‘Brexit: The Proposed UK-EU Security Treaty’ (it can be viewed here), stresses that ‘time is running out’ for the UK and EU to come up with a viable security treaty which would work to both sides’ benefit.
“The committee supports the government’s ambition to continue security cooperation after Brexit, but there is no evidence that sufficient progress has yet been made in the negotiations,” the report states.
Rather worryingly, it adds: “The committee believes it is unlikely that such a treaty can be agreed in the time available.”
It also suggests a scarcely-credible statistic – that the committee heard evidence during the course of its work that ‘by mid-May, the UK and EU negotiators had spent little more than an hour discussing the future internal security relationship’.
The report piles yet more pressure on the shoulders of Prime Minister Theresa May in a week in which high-profile resignations from her cabinet over how Brexit is being handled (including Brexit minister himself David Davis) have been ten-a-penny.
Despite those setbacks, however, it looks like May will still be publishing her government’s hotly-anticipated white paper on the UK’s Brexit negotiating strategy today.
Northern Ireland
Regarding a subject rather closer to Irish hearts, the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, the report states that the issues surrounding the lack of an amended security treaty ‘affect them with particular acuteness’.
Security forces in the two jurisdictions have a long-standing history of both formal and informal cooperation with regard to counterterrorism and cross-border crime (such as smuggling), it says.

The PSNI meanwhile states that the challenges of policing the border are unique due to the ‘post-conflict society’ nature of Northern Irish life, and the fact that the Northern border is the only such physical differentiation for either country.

The committee was told, by research project BrexitLawNI, that the loss of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) post-Brexit would be “one of the most serious security-related issues arising” from the exit vote, a statement endorsed by Chief Constable of the PSNI George Hamilton, who described such a scenario as “the biggest practical vulnerability” arising from Brexit.
Between 2007 and 2017 the PSNI sought 154 EAWs, leading to the extradition of 47 suspects to the North. 113 of those applications, 73%, referred to suspects believed to be located in the Republic.
The committee concluded that it was “confident” that such informal cooperation between gardaí and the PSNI would continue.
However, it stressed that formal agreements regarding access to EU security instruments are essential for the effective policing of the border, especially with regard to extradition arrangements.
“Here, perhaps more than in any other aspect of security cooperation, the negotiations should not be treated as a zero sum game, but as an opportunity to develop a partnership that will benefit both sides,” it states.
“(The lack of engagement) worsens an already precarious security and intelligence situation on the island,” security consultant Tom Clonan toldTheJournal.ie.
Theresa May, pictured yesterday at Westminster AbbeyStefan Rousseau / PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Images / PA Images
The issues surrounding border security are being handled from an Irish point of view by the Department of Justice. A request for comment had not yet been responded to at the time of publication.
Other conclusions
The report also states that, given the lack of engagement thus far, ‘pragmatic compromises’ need to be made on both sides.
It calls on both the UK and EU to change their mindsets ‘urgently’ to achieve the ‘over-riding objective of protecting the safety of citizens post-Brexit’.
Regarding the UK government’s ambitions for security cooperation, it says that there is ‘no evidence that sufficient progress has been made’, and opines that ‘it is unlikely that such a treaty can be agreed in the time available’, ie before 29 March next year, when Britain will officially leave the EU.
By turns it’s harshly critical of Britain’s performance on the security issue, remarking that if the UK wishes to maintain access to EU databases (UK police forces accessed the Schengen Information System II, a criminal-tracking database, 539 million times in 2017) and the expertise of agencies like Europol, it must ‘be willing to be flexible’.
“The EU has given little indication that it will be prepared to negotiate a bespoke treaty,” the report states. “The (British government) therefore needs to show realism about what it can achieve in the time remaining. If a comprehensive treaty cannot be agreed, a series of ad hoc security arrangements could help to ensure the level of cooperation we need.”
“It’s time for pragmatic compromises, on the UK side, and also on the EU side,” said Lord Jay of Ewelme, chairman of the committee.
“If a hard Brexit follows with a hard border, these developments amount to something of a perfect storm in defence, intelligence and policing terms,” Clonan meanwhile says of the Irish situation.

The bus was spotted driving through the city centre and stopped off at the Guinness brewery on its way up north to Belfast.
Campaigners calling for a second referendum on whether or not the UK should leave the EU are touring across the UK as well as visiting Dublin and Brussels in a bid to rally those who want to remain.
“We have been touring the UK to rally Remainers and people who are sick of Brexit to write to their MPs to demand a ‘Final Say’ and an option to ditch Brexit altogether,” said spokesperson Madeleina Kay.

The reason they came to Dublin and will be travelling to Brussels is that it is “very important to reach out to our European friends and neighbours, to show that there is a huge campaign against Brexit in the UK and that we are fighting to Remain part of the union”.

Speaking in the House of Commons, May was responding to Jim McMahon, who asked the Prime Minister to condemn the suggestion that food shortages would be used to give the UK the upper hand in Brexit negotiations.
Tory MP Priti Patel was criticised last week for suggesting that the UK government shoulduse potential food shortages in Irelandas leverage against the backstop.
Her suggestion came after a government report, leaked to theTimes of London, indicated that there could be food shortages in Ireland in a no-deal Brexit scenario, and the economic impact on Ireland would be worse than in the UK.
May said that the UK would not use that issue in the negotiating strategy and is happy “to absolutely give that insurance”.
“We want to deliver a good Brexit for the UK and a good Brexit for Ireland,” May said.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR said today that the government will need to “seriously ask” whether a withdrawal agreement is possible at all if there is no significant progress by June on the “backstop’’ in the Brexit treaty that guarantees no hard border in Ireland.
Varadkar was commenting after theDaily Telegraph reportedthat the European Union has roundly rejected proposals from the British government for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
EU sources told the Telegraph that Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans were subjected to a “systematic and forensic annihilation” at a meeting between senior figures on both sides this week.
The Telegraph’s source is quoted as saying that it was made clear that “none of the UK’s customs options will work”, as part of a “detailed and forensic rebuttal”.
Varadkar said today that the Irish government is “open to alternative proposals that may come from the United Kingdom” but that, so far, “they haven’t been forthcoming”.

Prime Minister May has been clear in her plans for the UK to leave the single market and customs union but, in December, the British government offered a guarantee that this would not mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney would not comment explicitly on the leak in today’s Telegraph, saying that the Irish government does its talking through the EU taskforce and through regular private contact with the British government.
Speaking in Cork today, he said that Ireland’s position is “rock solid and consistent” and that he is “confident” that negotiations will be able to end with no hard border while protecting Ireland’s close relationship with Britain and the island’s internal market.
What is being dubbed as the “penny dropping” moment for the UK is widely seen as the EU taskforce and the other member states standing behind Ireland and it’s position on the border.
The Irish government has repeatedly taken the stance of – if the UK wants to sever trade ties with the EU in this way – the onus is on the British to find a solution for the border.

There are three ways this could happen: either the UK actually retains membership of the single market and customs union (which May has always ruled out), some kind of technological solutions are found to address the specific problems in Ireland, or that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market while the rest of the UK leaves.
The last choice is unpalatable to many UK politicians, particularly the DUP whose support is keeping May’s Conservatives in government.
That leaves the second option which would allow the UK to set its own tariffs on trade while avoiding a hard border, and it is proposals on these solutions that are reported to have been roundly dismissed by the EU this week.
The Telegraph reported that two proposals were given. The first, dubbed a “customs partnership” would have seen the UK set its own system of tariffs on goods entering it, but also act as a collector of EU customs duties on goods that enter the UK bound for an EU country.
As this would put the onus on businesses to collect the tariffs – in lieu of a border check collecting it – the EU rejected it. It was also rejected as the EU would not allow a country outside its supervision mechanisms to level duties on goods, and implementing the scheme would be too expensive.
The other option was rejected by the EU as a “turning a blind eye” approach.
The “customs arrangement” would have seen technological and administrative measures ensuring trade with the EU remaining frictionless. In the specific case of Northern Ireland, it would have allowed traders to operate across the border without any checks.
Writing in The Irish Times today, Coveney said there are five rounds of negotiations between now and June for the British government to follow through on their political commitments given last December and March and to reach agreement with the EU taskforce.
“I was very clear in London that Ireland needed to see definitive progress by June. If not, it will be difficult for the negotiations to proceed as before,” the Tánaiste stated in the article.
May is under pressure in the House of Commons from a group of MPs seeking to keep the UK in the customs union. This would remove the possibility of a hard border in Northern Ireland, but it is opposed by hardline Conservative MPs.
This will be debated in Westminster next Thursday. While any vote is not binding, any loss for the government will heap further pressure on its current Brexit strategy.
Time is running out for a border found, with the UK due to leave the EU in less than a year, and everything needing to be agreed by roughly October of this year.

The report noted that the BeLeave was never registered with the commission as a campaigner in the EU Referendum but that: “All of BeLeave’s funding came directly from Vote Leave, or was arranged by Vote Leave.”
The Electoral Commission’s legal counsel Bob Posner added:

Specifically, the Electoral Commission looked at a payment of £675,315.18 from BeLeave and its founder Darren Grimes to Canadian data analytics firm Aggregate IQ.
The commission said this payment should have been incurred by Vote Leave, the central Brexit campaign ground ahead of the June 2016 referendum.
Vote Leave has been fined a total of £61,000 and Grimes has been fined £20,000.
In the vote, the UK voted to leave the European Union by a margin of 52%-48%.
Responding to the Electoral Commission’s conclusions, a Vote Leave spokesperson said that the report contained “a number of  false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny”.
“The Commission has failed to follow due process and, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories,” thespokesperson added.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has defended the government’s use of private investigators in its legal fight over pay claims against certain hospital consultants who are allegedly in breach of their contract.
The issue, which was reported upon by the Sunday Business Post last weekend, relates to a series of court cases involving the government and said consultants over pay claims.
The SBP reported that the government, specifically the Departments of Health, Finance, and Public Expenditure, had authorised the use of private investigators to spy on those consultants in order to verify or otherwise that they were fulfilling their contracted hours in public hospitals.
Today, at Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, leader of Fianna Fáil Micheál Martin suggested that in doing so the government had set a “sinister and dangerous precedent”, one that was “potentially an abuse of power”.
Micheál MartinOireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
He asked Varadkar whether or not the ministers of the various departments involved had been aware of the practice of commissioning private investigators.
In response, the Taoiseach said that given the nature of the ongoing court cases regarding this issue, he was “limited in what I can say”.

‘Serious issue’
He said however, that “there are some consultants who breach their contract, who worked in a private hospital when they should have been in a public one” and that the matter was a “very serious issue”.
He said that when RTÉ Prime Time conducted its own investigation into the matter using private investigators, it was recognised as having performed a “public service”.
He further added that surveillance by State bodies is not unheard of.
“You have Revenue inspectors counting the number of chip bags coming out of a chip vendor,” he said.
Responding, Martin countered that it was not acceptable for the government to say “whatever the media does we can do too”.
He said that government inspectors are “governed by a code” and that it wasn’t fair to think that “consultants are fair game”. He again demanded to know whether the various ministers knew of or had authorised the private investigations.
Varadkar said that moonlighting consultants were “damaging the interests of the patient”.
While declining to directly deal with the issue of whether or not ministers knew, he did say that “there was no ministerial involvement in execution of strategy”.

https://www.the42.ie/dallas-cowboys-brexit-week-10-nfl-preview-4329184-Nov2018/,"IN 1939, ON the eve of World War II, Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary that ‘civilisation has shrunk’.
Woolf’s words were not just those of an author worried about the prospect of a Nazi invasion, but they also captured a wider fear that had been growing for decades in the UK; the decline of the British Empire.
For some in 21st century Britain, the decline of their empire has hit them so hard, they’ve reverted to 18th and 19th century politics and opinions in a bid to keep Albion alive.
But unlike other former imperial powers such as Spain or Portugal who, on the surface at least, have the decency to be embarrassed about their colonisation of other countries, there is a view in Britain that their tiny island on the edge of the Atlantic would be a global power if it was not for the EU.
Interestingly, this view is shared by the working class and millionaires alike, despite the latter ensuring all their key assets are moved offshore before the reality of Brexit hits home.
And while this ersatz nostalgia may be a Brexiter’s wet dream, it fails to take into account that the rest of the world has simply moved on from Elizabethan armadas.
Another group of people surviving on the scraps of past glories are the Dallas Cowboys.
They came to the fore on Monday night when Titans safety Kevin Byard channeled his inner Terrell Owens and danced on the Dallas star.

Byard had just intercepted Cowboys’ quarterback Dak Prescott before continuing week nine’s series of tribute celebrations.

Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones was not happy and ran onto the field and pushed Byard and the rest of the Titans off the star.
After the game, Jones said “There’s no need for it. We’re all having fun, but I think when you go and try that, everyone knows what going on the star means. When you come into [AT&T Stadium], you don’t do that. It was about respecting the brand, respecting the star.”
If you happened to be on Twitter in the middle of the night, Dallas fans were discussing pretty much the same thing, albeit with more swearing.
But the thing Jones and the Cowboys fans missed is… what exactly is there to respect?
The Cowboys have made the playoffs just four times since 2000. They haven’t won a Super Bowl in 23 years and haven’t appeared in an NFC championship game in 20. In eight seasons under Jason Garrett their record is an uninspiring 70-57 and they have won their division just twice.
They are America’s Team in name only and, as Brexiters are about to learn, living on past glories will leave you incredibly unsatisfied.
Week 7 picks (season record 80-52-2)
Carolina Panthers @ Pittsburgh SteelersThe Panthers offence rivals that of the Chiefs and Rams as the most innovative in the NFL which means we’re finally getting to see the best of Christian McCaffrey. Despite winning four on the spin, the Steelers are flying under the radar. This should be one of the few fun Thursday night games.Pick: Steelers
Detroit Lions @ Chicago BearsThe Bears continued to take advantage of the soft part of their schedule with a facile victory over the Bills last week and they get another gimme this week against a Lions team that gave up 10 sacks last week.Pick: Bears
New Orleans Saints @ Cincinnati BengalsThe Saints took care of the last undefeated team in the NFL in week nine and are, perhaps, the most well-rounded team in the league. The Bengals struggled with the Bucs before their bye week and even home advantage might not be enough this weekend.Pick: Saints
Atlanta Falcons @ Cleveland BrownsAnother team slipping under the radar are the Atlanta Falcons. Their offence is finally clicking into gear but there are still a number of questions about their defence. Luckily for them, the Browns under Gregg Williams are not in a position to ask them.Pick: Falcons
Jacksonville Jaguars @ Indianapolis ColtsA divisional battle between two teams having different seasons than they would have imagined back in September. Both sit at 3-5 but Indy have won their past two while the Jags, who stick with Blake Bortles, are on a four game losing skid.Pick: Colts

Arizona Cardinals @ Kansas City ChiefsThe worst team in the NFC travel to take on, arguably, the best of the AFC. Bouncing Sam Bradford shows that Arizona is already thinking about next season but few rebuilding projects are as daunting as the one facing the Cardinals.Pick: Chiefs
Buffalo Bills @ New York JetsI mean, does anyone really care about this game?Pick: Jets
Washington @ Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe Bucs have decided to stay with Ryan Fitzpatrick and, as we saw in the second half against the Panthers last week, he knows how to find the end zone. If only Tampa’s coaches could make in-game adjustments as well as they do at the half.Pick: Buccaneers
New England Patriots @ Tennessee TitansFresh off Sunday night victory over the Packers, the Patriots travel to Tennessee to take on New England legend Mike Vrabel. The Titans surprised many with their win over the Cowboys on Monday but are unlikely to come away from this one with a W.Pick: Patriots
LA Chargers @ Oakland RaidersAfter years of threatening to end their Super Bowl hoodoo, the Chargers do look like legitimate contenders this year. They should make light work of an awful Raiders team this weekend.Pick: Chargers
Miami Dolphins @ Green Bay PackersIt’s becoming increasingly obvious that time is running out for Mike McCarthy in Wisconsin and you’d have to wonder how much his conservative play-calling has affected Aaron Rodgers’ Super Bowl window. However, the Dolphins are unlikely to live with them in this one.Pick: Packers
Seattle Seahawks @ LA RamsAfter impressing for a lot of the season, the Seahawks will be disappointed with last week’s loss to the Chargers, especially at home. It doesn’t get much easier this week as they face LA’s other team who will be licking their own wounds following a first defeat of the season.Pick: Rams
Dallas Cowboys @ Philadelphia EaglesThis might be the best defensive unit of Jason Garrett’s time in Dallas but his inability to get any sort of consistency out of his offence will surely cost him his job. For the Eagles, the chance to bury their divisional rivals’ season and steal a march on Washington is plenty of motivation.Pick: Eagles
New York Giants @ San Francisco 49ersTwo teams that are exactly what we thought they’d be when the season started. Why NFC East teams continue to dominate prime time football will forever remain a mystery while the division remains so mediocre.Pick: 49ers

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-embassies-4416114-Jan2019/,"OPENING TEN NEW Irish embassies in 2019, with a further three openings scheduled in 2020, is linked to Ireland’s Brexit strategy, according to Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
In announcing the government’s plans for this year, the Tánaiste also defended the costly practice of leasing, rather than buying property abroad.
By the end of 2019 Ireland will have opened the following new missions:
The government is planning a further three openings in 2020:
Coveney said “there is an element of a Brexit strategy” in opening these new embassies in terms of some sectors having an over-reliance on trade with the UK, stating that there are new markets Irish businesses can tap into.
He added that even if Brexit was not happening, Ireland would be pressing ahead with increasing its diplomatic footstep.
Describing it as “pretty dramatic in terms of the pace of expansion”, Coveney said there will be a huge return for the opening of the new embassies.
Cost of renting over buying property abroad
The Tánaiste also defended the spend on embassies abroad.
The Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee recently said it is concerned there is a move towards long-term rental, rather than the State buying properties and questioned whether renting premises for Irish embassies abroad is value for money.

Thetop five Irish embassy rental costslast year were Brussels, New York, Beijing and London.
The cost of renting the premises in Brussels last year cost €1.065 million, while Ireland’s permanent representation to the UN in New York cost €885,014. The Consulate General in New York cost €814,406 to rent.
Beijing embassy rent cost €501,825 and the London embassy and official accommodation cost €406,490.
Coveney said the State buys and leases properties abroad.
“We do both,” he said, adding that properties divisions have a job to do in order “to get the best value for money” in the right locations.
“There is no point in buying property and then finding ourselves stuck in properties that are devalued and in the wrong place in five years time,” he said, adding that the government buys where it can be assured there is value for money, and “when we can’t do that, we lease, it is case by case”.
There will be no cap on the spending for new embassies, said Coveney, who added that all costs will be transparent and every penny will be accounted for.
Among the embassies opening over the next two years, Coveney said the ‘Ireland House’ in Tokyo is one of the government’s biggest undertakings, describing it as a “huge piece of infrastructure”.
He said he was glad an embassy was opened in New Zealand, saying it should have been opened many years ago.
A site visit to Los Angeles is to take place soon, according to Coveney who said the Irish government won’t “rush into buying next door to Robbie Keane”.
He said the embassy will help promote Irish film, stating that two focuses for that embassy is on tech and also the creative industries.
“Ireland has built a reputation for itself which allows us to expand into new markets in a very exciting way. This is about capitalising on the opportunities that are emerging,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/juncker-4083625-Jun2018/,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT Jean Claude Juncker has said that Europe stands behind Ireland as Brexit negotiations reach a pivotal point.
Juncker today held a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
The meeting comes as both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Simon Coveney called for more haste in Brexit negotiations.
Coveney this morning told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that without a deal on the Irish border, the UK will struggle to leave the EU smoothly.
“Let’s be very clear, there will be no withdrawal agreement, no transition agreement and no managed Brexit if the British government do not follow through on their clear commitments in writing to Ireland and the whole EU.
“We had asked for and looked for significant progress in June. The British government have been unable to deliver on that.”
That stance was echoed by Leo Varadkar, who spoke alongside Juncker at Government Buildings today.
He said:

“There is an urgent need to intensify our efforts if we are to get there. We expect the UK to honour their commitments on the backstop in full.”
Juncker, both at the press briefing and a later address to the Dáil, reiterated Europe’s commitment to Ireland in the Brexit negotiations.
“We wanted to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone. We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and by the Commission – this will not change. I am strongly against any temptation to try to isolate Ireland and not to conclude a deal on Ireland. Ireland has to be part of the deal.”
Speaking in the Dáil, he said:
“Ireland will come first. There are those that think the other 26 countries will abandon Ireland for a deal that suits them.
“Ireland’s border is Europe’s border and it is our priority.
“Two years ago this week, the British people made a sovereign decision to leave our Union. I wish they had made a different one. But it is their decision and I respect it fully.
“However, other member states, and Ireland in particular, should not pay the price for that choice. This is why when it comes to Brexit, I have always said that it is a case of “Ireland first”.
“Ireland stands at the heart of Europe.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-papers-may-speech-4249300-Sep2018/,"THERESA MAY’S SPEECH yesterday has caused quite a stir, to say the least.
In an abruptly-called televised talk, May had another chance at responding to criticism of her Chequers plan and the general backlash to the demands the UK has been making.
Her speech in Salzburg, given immediately after European Council President Donald Tusk said that the UK proposals “will not work”, was criticised as weak. The Tory party conference is next week, putting pressure on her to deliver a strong performance.
The UK Prime Ministertook the opportunity yesterdayto say that the EU has been treated with respect, and that “the UK expects the same” in return. She said that she would not “overturn the result of the referendum, or break up my country”, suggesting that a compromise to finalise a Brexit deal wouldn’t be easy.
The speech, the latest in an escalating war-of-words, was received with caution by EU leaders, who rushed to say that a compromise was still possible.
Back in the UK, the tone was more jubilant – not least of all in the UK papers. TheDaily Expressran this opinion column on its front page.

WE’RE JUST ABOUT three months away from 29 March, which is the legal deadline by which the UK must leave the European Union.
For the past two years, the UK has been hammering out the terms and conditions for leaving the economic, customs, trade and immigration agreement they have with the 27 other member states through being part of the European Union.
Although the EU and UK negotiating teams, the 27 EU leaders, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May have agreed to support the Brexit deal, there has been a growing backlash against the deal due to concerns that the backstop could lead to the UK being permanently locked into an indefinite customs deal, or Northern Ireland being carved off from Great Britain.
Unless there’s a dramatic change (of which we haven’t been short), the UK will be out of the European Union by 30 March 2019, deal or no deal.
Both sides have agreed that a no-deal scenario is the worst outcome for everyone, but since June this year, it’s become an increasingly likely outcome. Here’s why that is, and why the deal on the table looks so unfavourable.
It’s a worst-of-both-worlds Brexit
The proposal for a deal that they’ve achieved has been described as “Frankenstein’s monster”: a creation made partly through a bizarre experiment to see how far it could go, and captivates the attention of onlookers, agape at how things unfold as time goes on.
The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, which only sets out the terms upon which the UK leaves the European Union, is seen as being too closely aligned to the EU by Brexiteers.
Nigel Farage speaks at a Leave Means Leave Save Brexit rally.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
The deal cuts off the free movement of people, which means that the UK wouldn’t be allowed access to the Single Market; disputes about EU law would go before the European Court of Justice; and the issue of fisheries, which has been called the UK’s strongest hand, is the only issue for which there has been no agreement.
Last week, Theresa May postponed the crucial House of Commons vote MPs have on her Brexit deal when it looked as though as many as 100 Tories would vote against her.
Two days later, 117 MPs voted to say they hadno confidence in her as Tory leader.
Advertisement
Then there are the MPs who oppose Brexit altogether. They are starting to think that if they reject the deal in the House of Commons vote, their chances of getting a second referendum are higher.
Since the postponed vote, the UK media have been reporting that there are secret preparations for a second referendum, despite Theresa May’s public declarations that holding a second vote would do “irreparable damage” to the integrity British politics.
EU-UK tensions have soared
A breakdown in goodwill and trust between the UK and EU has also contributed to the Brexit deal stalemate we’re in now. There’s a lack of trust from both sides, whether justified or not, as is evidenced by the row over the backstop.
But that row has been going on for some time now.
After David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary in July this year and Dominic Raab took his place, it seemed as though negotiations were put on firmer ground.
There were reports of chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier getting on better with Raab, press conferences together seemed warmer than with Davies.

But in the run up to the Salzburg summit, things took a turn. That’s something both sides do agree on.
Speaking to theTelegraph’s Brexit Podcast this month, Dominic Raab, said that he had been given political assurances that the backstop would be time limited, but that EU and UK officials began leading negotiations in the lead up to the Salzburg summit.
The summit at Salzburgwas organised to discuss the Irish backstop (which hadn’t been agreed then), but ended up with EU leaders criticising Theresa May’s Chequers plan in a move that reportedly “blindsided” the Prime Minister, and culminated in her firing back with a statement from 10 Downing Street, saying thatshe expected to be treated with respect.
“The EU have played a good game,” Raab said on the podcast. “We haven’t been tough enough or clear enough. We could have won this backstop argument, even as late as July.”
At the time of the summit, EU Council President Donald Tusk said something similar: “The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough, and in fact uncompromising.”
What’s at the heart of Brexit?
On 23 June 2016, what did the 51% of people who voted for Brexit actually vote for?
Related ReadsA Brexit timeline: How much time is actually left to strike a deal?
Was it increased sovereignty by limiting the rules and regulations of the EU, to limit immigration, or to “take back control” of its waters? Was it all three?
The most accurate answer is we’re not sure, but we can take a good guess, and that’s what MPs have been doing. The problem here arises when we hear MPs say that this Brexit deal doesn’t represent what people voted for – although that may be true, it’s not clear what the UK electorate did vote for on 23 June.
European leaders should not seek retribution on the UK over post-Brexit fishing arrangements, a group of Scottish fishermen argued last weekend.David CheskinDavid Cheskin
But let’s take the examples above as the most commonly cited reasons for Brexit.
Onsovereignty, the UK will gain more control over who enters its country, who fishes in its waters, and what laws it enforces as a result of Brexit (if Brexiteers succeed in pushing for an alternative deal).
There are losses attached to that: pulling out of the free movement of people commitment means they lose access to the lucrative Single Market, which is why so many multinationals have been looking to move their headquarters to other European capitals, including Dublin. So they get sovereignty, but at a cost.
Since the Brexit vote,immigrationfrom EU countries has fallen dramatically; but simultaneously risen from non-EU countries. If the Brexit vote is to be interpreted as a desire to limit immigration, it wasn’t clear on who it wants to refuse entry to: skilled workers from the EU; people with British heritage; people from former colonies; asylum seekers fleeing war?
Finally,fishermenhave expressed concern around where they would export their catches in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as the UK would be potentially cut off from the 27 countries it currently exports to.
The EU has said that it would only allow seafood exports from the UK to be tariff- and quota-free if there was an agreement, similar to its arrangement with Norway, that EU fishing fleets can continue to fish in British waters. Brexiteers would be against that arrangement.
Prime Minister Theresa May throws a ball for a border collie called Blitz.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Added to the internal struggles within each of those issues, is the separate issue for what Brexit means for Northern Ireland. The backstop is meant to ensure there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland because of Brexit.
But in order to do that, it means the UK has to follow EU rules very closely, or else Northern Ireland needs to follow a different set of customs rules and regulations than Great Britain.
Because of the confusion over what is at the heart of Brexit, it’s difficult for UK politicians to prioritise what they’re willing to compromise on.
And if no compromise is possible from the unhappy Brexiteer MPs, then it’s difficult to see how a Brexit deal can be agreed in the short timeframe left.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-gibraltar-brexit-deal-4350336-Nov2018/,"A TINY AREA at the southern tip of mainland Spain has caused a hiccup in the Brexit deal agreed between London and Brussels last week.
EU guidelines state that Spain must have a say on whether any post-Brexit deal applies to the British territory of Gibraltar, and the country has long laid claims to the region.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to sign a treaty with European Union leaders to leave the bloc on Sunday, if Spain does not stand in the way.
However, Spain’s Foreign Minister Josep Borrellyesterday warnedafter a meeting of EU leaders that the draft deal does not spell out how Gibraltar should be handled.
And that has led to tensions between Spain and Britain.
But before we tackle what that means, let’s take a look at the basics.
What is Gibraltar?
Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory, located near the southernmost tip of Spain.
Gibraltar is a tiny area near the southernmost tip of Spain.Google MapsGoogle Maps
It has an area of 6.7square-km. To give that a little perspective, Dundalk is four times the size of Gibraltar, and Dublin is over one hundred times bigger.
Around 30,000 people live in the densely populated area.
It has a border with Spain, running 1.2km east to west. Identity checks are required to pass the border.
Why is it a British territory?
This dates back to the beginning of the 18th century. The king of Spain, Charles II, had died childless in 1700 and left a power vacuum across a vast empire. A war between European leaders followed.
In 1704, an Anglo-Dutch fleet captured the town of Gibraltar. Spain was at war with the Austrians and wanted to ensure Britain left the war.
So, in 1713, the treaty of Utrecht was signed, ceding control of Gibraltar to Great Britain.
A general view of the Gibraltar border corssing into Spain taken from the Gibraltan sideBen BirchallBen Birchall
Modern-day Gibraltar has its own parliament. Its 1964 constitution lets residents decide which country has sovereignty over them.
On two occasions, in 1967 and 2002, residents have voted to remain under British rule.
So, what has changed since then?
Well, in short… Brexit.
Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU with 96% of voters seeking to remain.
In the wake of the referendum result last June, the Spanish government eyed an opportunity to start the debate again and called for joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.
Officially, the UK government has sought to ensure that Gibraltar remains a territory, and has said it will protect its interests.
The House of Lords published a report entitled “Brexit: Gibraltar” at the beginning of March 2017.
The report said: “We fully endorse the UK government’s commitment never to enter into sovereignty discussions against the will of the Gibraltarian people.
Advertisement
The report added that “whatever means are available” should be used to resist encroachment by Spain upon Gibraltar’s sovereignty.
When the UK triggered article 50, the issue of Gibraltar reared its head again.
At the time, former UK conservative party leader Lord Michael Howard said that Prime Minister Theresa Maywould be prepared to go to war over the Rock of Gibraltar, with the same resolve that Margaret Thatcher went to war with Argentina over the Falklands in the 1980s.
However, that issue died downed for some time … until last week.
What’s the problem now?
Well, after almost two years of negotiations, Britain’s departure from the EU finally progressed this week when draft withdrawal terms were agreed between both sides.
The draft agreementcovers the terms under which Britain will leave the EU next March, including arrangements about the backstop, a financial settlement for leaving the bloc, and the rights of British citizens in Europe.
This draft agreement has been denounced across Britain’s political spectrum since it was unveiled on Wednesday night.
However, May is due to sign a treaty with EU leaders to leave the bloc on Sunday – that is if Spain does not stand in its way.
Josep BorrellSIPA USA / PA ImagesSIPA USA / PA Images / PA Images
As noted above, Spain’s Foreign Minister Josep Borrell warned yesterday after a meeting of EU ministers that the draft deal does not spell out how Gibraltar should be handled.
Basically, he said the text does not make it clear that future negotiations on ties between Brussels and post-Brexit Britain are separate from the Gibraltar issue.
“Future negotiations on Gibraltar are separate negotiations. And that is what needs to be made clear,” Borrell said.
“Until it is clear … we will not be able to give our agreement,” he warned.
According to Article 184 of the draft divorce deal, “the EU and the United Kingdom shall make every effort, in good faith and with full respect for their respective legal systems, to adopt the measures necessary to negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship”.
These agreements will be negotiated between Brexit day on 29 March and December 2020 – extendable once – and will enter into force at the end of the period.
But Spain wants to retain what it sees as its right to negotiate the future on Gibraltar with Britain on a bilateral basis, giving it an effective veto.
So, will this issue really derail the deal?
Well, although the legal service of the EU Council has tried to reassure Spain that the text does not preclude this, Madrid is seeking further clarification.
“Until we have the future declaration and we know what it says, whether we agree or not, we are not going to approve the withdrawal agreement either,” Borrell said.
British Prime Minister Theresa MayMatt DunhamMatt Dunham
In London, May’s spokesman said: “The draft withdrawal agreement agreed last week covers Gibraltar.
“The PM has been clear that we will not exclude Gibraltar, and the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies from our negotiations on the future relationship. We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family.”
Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said the position adopted by Madrid “does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward”.
Over the weekend, European diplomats said they did not expect Spain’s concerns to derail the agreement.
So, for now, it remains unclear how Spain will act, but a Spanish veto on the Brexit deal is very possible.

BORIS JOHNSON YESTERDAY resigned as Britain’s foreign secretary, bringing the curtain down on a never-less-than-colourful two year reign as the UK’s chief diplomat.
In doing so, ostensibly because under Theresa May’s stewardship the Brexit ‘dream is dying’ (as Johnson opined in his resignation letter), he has created a EU butter mountain-sized headache for the prime minister.
However, Johnson’s unvarnished motives can only be known to himself. One thing you can be fairly certain of – we haven’t heard the last of the irrascible Oxbridge-educated Leaver-in-chief.
And Theresa May, as if she isn’t under enough pressure already, is likely to be feeling deeply uncomfortable that the unpredictable Johnson is no longer safely ensconced at the Foreign Office where she could keep a wary eye on him.
With his gaffes, sharp wit and populist rhetoric, the former London mayor was a leading campaigner to leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and a figurehead for those pressing for a clean break with the bloc.
He quit yesterday despite backing May’s plan for closer economic ties with the EU after Brexit during a cabinet meeting last Friday.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
He was subsequently reported to have described the plan as a “turd”, but anonymous aides later said he wanted to stay on in government to fight for Brexit.
Yet when Brexit secretary David Davis quit late on Sunday night, the pressure was on for Johnson to prove his credentials among the hardline Tory eurosceptics.
The distinctively-coiffed Johnson has long had leadership ambitions and many believed May gave him the plum foreign office job to keep him from building up a domestic political power base.
However, Johnson has repeatedly challenged her EU strategy, and last month was secretly recorded telling Tory activists that Donald Trump would negotiate Brexit better.
Undiplomatic
With his blond mop-top hair, bumbling manner and tendency to drift into Latin during speeches, he remains one of Britain’s most recognisable politicians and has that rare quality – natural charisma.

But many MPs and activists dislike him for his disloyalty to May, his liberal use of dubious ‘facts’ when arguing his point – including the so-called Brexit financial dividend – and, until now, his failure to follow through on his promises.
He was widely mocked last month for arranging a trip to Afghanistan to avoid having to vote for a third runway at London Heathrow Airport, which he had once said he would lie in front of bulldozers to prevent.
Critics also cite his suggestion that a British-Iranian woman held in Tehran on sedition charges may have been training journalists – something her family strongly denies, and fear has jeopardised her case.
Johnson’s appointment was a surprise given his history of mocking world leaders and other cultures in his long-running column in The Daily Telegraph.

He described White House candidate Hillary Clinton as a “sadistic nurse”, and once described Africans as “flag-waving piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”.
His resignation came in the middle of a Western Balkans summit that he was supposed to be hosting in London.

‘King of the world’
One of those rare politicians known simply by his first name, ‘Boris’ was born in New York in 1964 as Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson into a competitive, high-achieving family.
His father Stanley was a Tory member of the European Parliament; one brother, Jo, is a government minister and his sister Rachel is a journalist and writer.
All three gave their support to the Remain camp during the Brexit campaign, but Johnson himself came out strongly for Brexit, despite apparently having considered backing the other side for a time.
Rachel Johnson told her brother’s biographer that, as a child, he wanted to be “king of the world” when he grew up.

Johnson won a scholarship at the elite Eton school and studied classics at Oxford University, where he was a member of the Bullingdon Club, an all-male dining society known for rowdy behaviour.
Johnson became a journalist, working at The Times – from which he was sacked for fabricating quotes – and The Telegraph, including as Brussels correspondent.
He became MP for the then opposition Conservatives in 2001 and was later appointed as the party’s arts spokesman before being sacked over accusations of lying about an alleged extra-marital affair.
Despite London normally tending towards the Labour party, Johnson was elected mayor in 2008 and stayed until 2016, including overseeing the 2012 Olympic Games.
After May’s predecessor David Cameron quit following the EU referendum, he was ready to stand for the Tory leadership when his leading ally, Michael Gove, pulled his support to run himself – leaving both men to lose out.
One thing would seem certain – Johnson seldom does anything without having a clear idea what the payoff will be.
Theresa May well feel a lot more nervous with ‘BoJo’ outside her top circle than she did when he was a senior member of cabinet.
Speaking to reporters today, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that Johnson’s resignation letter to Theresa May “in itself” revealed the type of Brexit that he wanted “was never going to happen”.
“This is the fundamental difficulty that when you enter a free trade agreement with another country it involves the sharing of sovereignty, it involves joint approaches to establish rules regulations and standards.”

BRITAIN WILL ONLY pay its EU divorce bill if the bloc agrees the framework for a future trade deal, the new Brexit Secretary warned in an interview published today.
Dominic Raab, who replaced David Davis after he quit the role earlier this month in protest over the government’s Brexit strategy, said “some conditionality between the two” was needed.
He added that the Article 50 mechanism used to trigger Britain’s imminent exit from the European Union provided for new deal details.
“Article 50 requires, as we negotiate the withdrawal agreement, that there’s a future framework for our new relationship going forward, so the two are linked,” Raab told the Sunday Telegraph.
The British government has sent mixed signals so far on the divorce bill.

Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in December to a financial settlement totalling £35 to £39 billion ($46-51 billion, €39-44 billion) that ministers said depended on agreeing future trade ties.
But cabinet members have since cast doubt on the position.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said shortly afterwards he found it “inconceivable” Britain would not pay its bill, which he described as “not a credible scenario”.

The country is set to leave the bloc on 30 March, but the two sides want to strike a divorce agreement by late October in order to give parliament enough time to endorse a deal.
Raab met the EU’s top negotiator Michel Barnier for the first time on Friday, where he heard doubts over May’s new Brexit blueprint for the future relationship.

But Barnier noted the priority in talks should be on finalising the initial divorce deal.
A hardline stance by the British government on the financial settlement could complicate progress, with Raab insisting on the link with the bill and a future agreement.
“Certainly it needs to go into the arrangements we have at international level with our EU partners,” he told the Telegraph.
May’s plans formally unveiled in early July envisages a customs partnership for goods and a common rulebook with the EU.
It has faced severe criticism in Britain, including from within her own cabinet and Conservative Party.
Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Davis both resigned in opposition.
A new YouGov poll published by the Sunday Times showed just 12% of people backed the proposals as “good” for Britain while 43% thought they were “bad”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ida-ireland-brexit-investment-4421920-Jan2019/,"IDA IRELAND WON more than 55 Brexit-related investments last year but warns that under no scenario is Brexit a good outcome and that some companies will be impacted.
Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland, said at a press conference earlier today that “given the fact we don’t know what Brexit looks like or what a future UK/EU trade deal looks like, it’s impossible to say what would happen in the future.”
The government agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland also announced today that 2018 saw over 14,000 net jobs created with FDI employment – its highest level on record at 229,057 employed.
Despite losses of nearly 9,000 jobs last year in client employment, Shanahan said he couldn’t identify if those jobs and other FDI company losses were related to Brexit.
“Can I rule that out? No I can’t, but we will be doing everything in our power to ensure that there aren’t losses due to Brexit,” he said.
He said most companies in their portfolio are well prepared for worst-case scenarios.
Mentioning conversations he’s had with some pharmaceutical companies, he said they have made adjustments to their supply chains and logistics in order to avoid any hurdles that might arise from different Brexit outcomes.
2018 also saw the agency win new or expand previous companies presence in Ireland like the Bank of America, Barclays, Citi Group and Morgan Stanley.

Regional Areas
The job growth from FDI companies was shown to have grown outside of Ireland’s major cities, with 58% of IDA client-supported jobs now located outside Dublin.
Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said, “we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions.”
Shanahan also added that continuing to grow Dublin is a key factor in order for the rest of the country to thrive.
“A strong capital city and strong regions are required to win investment,” he said.
Over the last four years 407 investments have been won for regions, creating almost 27,000 net jobs, while employment rose in the midlands by 14% and 8% in the west.
Potential upsets
The agency said current trends in depressed investment flows may continue due to geo-political situations like trade wars.
He said the health of the US economy is also important due to the large amount of investments that come from the United States into Ireland.
Having the Irish economy maintain its competitiveness is key, and concerns have been raised around housing, investment in education, income tax levels at a high rate and skills in the labour market.
This year IDA Ireland will begin developing its new five year strategy for 2020-2024 and will see the agency looking into further opportunities in Canada, Turkey, Israel and the UAE.

VOTERS IN THE UK would vote to remain in the EU were a second Brexit vote to be held today, a new poll suggests.
TheYouGov poll, conducted on behalf of the People’s Vote campaign, a pro-Remain group, suggests that the vote for Remain would now triumph by a margin of 53% to 47% in light of the political infighting and intransigence that has been the hallmark of Britain’s dealings with the EU since the UK voted to leave the union in June 2016.
It’s one of the biggest tests of British public opinion conducted since the vote to leave 26 months ago which shocked the world.
Half of the poll’s more-than 10,000 respondents said the decision on whether or not to leave the union with no deal in place should be taken by the public in a second referendum.

Second vote
45% of those asked meanwhile said they want a say by referendum on the outcome of the UK’s negotiations with the EU, while 34% said they don’t – an increase from last December when only 33% said they were in favour of such a second vote.
With just eight months until the 29 March 2019 deadline for leaving the EU, Britain remains no closer to agreeing a negotiating stance regarding how its economic dealings with the union will work post-Brexit.
Britain’s secretary for international trade Liam Fox recently put the odds of a no-deal Brexit at 60%.
In that scenario the six-point margin of victory for Remain would stretch to double that, 56% to 44%, according to YouGov.
The poll also found that 74% of people believe the negotiations are not going well, with 68% saying they believe the UK is going to get a bad deal.

THE UK GOVERNMENT is facing a parliamentary motion of contempt over its failure to publish the full legal advice it has received on the Brexit deal.
The rarely-used procedure could ultimately lead to the suspension of a government minister and in the past has resulted in expulsion or even imprisonment.
Here are some details about the process:
What is contempt?
MPs are currently debating whether Ministers are in contempt... but what does it mean?pic.twitter.com/gEXYspWxfB— UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons)December 4, 2018UK House of Commons/ Twitter
MPs are currently debating whether Ministers are in contempt... but what does it mean?pic.twitter.com/gEXYspWxfB
Contempt of privilege is a term used to describe any act or failure to act that may hinder or block the work of parliament.
In this case, MPs have argued that not publishing the legal advice in full could hinder them in their process of deciding to vote for or against the Brexit deal on 11 December.
What is happening now?
On 13 November, a motion tabled by the main opposition Labour party passed the House of Commons demanding ministers immediately publish “any legal advice in full” on the Brexit deal struck with the EU.
The government yesterday published a legal position paper, but said it was convention for ministers not to publish the full advice because it might contain sensitive details.

Labour, backed by other opposition parties and the DUP – who, let’s not forget, are supporting the Tories in government – tabled a motion declaring the government in contempt.
Speaker John Bercow agreed “there is an arguable case that a contempt has been committed” and set aside time for a discussion starting today.
The government has tabled an amendment to the motion in an attempt to delay the process, which if passed would refer the question to the Commons’ Committee of Privileges.
What are the possible sanctions?
MPs can be suspended from the House of Commons for a variety of infractions, and this could be the fate of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox or other ministers.
The ultimate sanction is expulsion but this has not happened since 1947, in the case of Garry Allighan, MP for Gravesend in Kent, southern England.
He wrote an article alleging that MPs gave information to newspapers in return for money or favourable personal publicity, or under the influence of alcohol bought for them by journalists.
It transpired that Allighan himself was the source of reports sent to the Evening Standard newspaper.
In 2002, Labour MP Keith Vaz was suspended for a month for making an unfounded allegation to police against a woman who made a complaint about him.
Previously, the Commons could detain unruly members in a room in the clock tower containing Big Ben.
Charles Bradlaugh, MP for Northampton in central England, was the last to be held there.
He spent the night of 23 June 1880 in the room after repeatedly refusing to take the oath of allegiance required of every new member.

Writing inThe Daily Telegraph, the former Foreign Secretary said the British government is “on the verge of total surrender” to Brussels.
Johnson writes that May’s plans for a customs union backstop are “shameful” and cannot be “conceivably” supported by any of her Cabinet.
“I really can’t believe it but this Government seems to be on the verge of total surrender. With every day that passes we seem to be getting more craven.
“We have already agreed to hand over £40bn for nothing – and certainly not a trade deal – in return,” he writes.
Johnson’s brother Jo resigned as Transport Minister on Friday. He said the government’s Brexit proposal was a “failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis”.
Meanwhile, there is some disquiet in Labour about Brexit negotiations. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told Der SpiegelBrexit can’t be stopped, prompting criticism from some of his MPs.

THERESA MAY FACES a fight for her political life this week in a parliamentary vote that will decide the fate of her Brexit divorce deal.
The beleaguered leader’s splintered government appears to be facing a heavy defeat in parliament on Tuesday on the draft withdrawal agreement she signed with Brussels last month.
The text defining terms on which the island nation leaves its main trading partner after 46 years is the most important to face the House of Commons in years.
A big loss could spark immediate challenges to May from both within her Conservative Party and the opposition Labour party.
It would also leave the tortuous Brexit process in a state of flux – and raise the prospects of a no-deal scenario – less than four months before the 29 March departure date.
Media reports said May was under pressure from her cabinet to try to salvage the deal by delaying the vote and flying to Brussels to seek more concessions ahead of a planned summit with 27 fellow EU leaders on Thursday and Friday.
But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC on Sunday: “The vote is going ahead.”
Yesterday evening, May spoke on the phone with Leo Varadkar about “the current situation on Brexit, including the planned vote in Westminster on Tuesday,” a spokesperson for the Taoiseach said.
Varadkar’s support would be crucial for May if she were to negotiate further with the EU.
‘Risk of no Brexit’
May’s team insists that her vision offers the cleanest break between the UK and EU that Brexit supporters could hope for at this late stage.
A rejection by parliament “would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit,” May told the Mail on Sunday.
She also raised the spectre of an early election and a possible return to power of the opposition Labour Party for the first time since 2010.
May said the prospects of Labour leader “Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”
Newspapers have identified more than six current and former ministers in May’s cabinet who are also ready to run for her job should she falter over the coming days.
Commenting on tomorrow’s vote, Táinaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: “We are saying that the deal that is there, which is a deal between the UK and the EU, is not going to change, particularly the legal language of the Withdrawal Treaty.

“I hope people will see it for what t is, which is a fair, balanced document that deals with the complexity of a country the size and the economy the size of the UK’s leaving the Union that it had been part of for 45 years.”
EU supporters, were pinning their hopes on a European Court of Justice ruling today on whether Britain’s parliament has the right to unilaterally halt Brexit in its tracks.
One of the Union’s advocates general, a senior legal adviser, has already issued an opinion suggesting that Britain can indeed unilaterally suspend its departure.
The court has confirmed it accepts jurisdiction in the case, which is based on a request lodged by a group of anti-Brexit Scottish politicians.
May insists she has no plans to reverse Brexit, despite parliamentary opposition to her withdrawal deal from both pro- and anti-Europe MPs.
Token concessions
May would have a tough job securing better divorce terms acceptable to the Northern Irish DUP party that has propped up her government for more than a year.
EU President Donald Tusk signalled that no concessions would be made after speaking to May by phone on Sunday.

I had a phone call with PM@theresa_may. It will be an important week for the fate of#Brexit.
Yet Brussels also wants to see May succeed and avert the economic nightmare that could unfold should Britain break away without any arrangements underpinning future trade.
European officials said they might be able to find a way to offer a token concession in Brussels that May could take back to London.
But they stressed that such tinkering cannot alter the basis of the withdrawal agreement itself.
The two sides might “work on the (accompanying) protocol or clarify a point that is deemed important so that she can take it back to parliament,” an informed European source told AFP on condition on anonymity.
May would then be expected to submit the touched-up version for a second vote at an unspecified date.
Coveney has said that “the backstop was never and is not an offer from one side or the other”.
“It was a negotiated solution that both sides signed up to, the EU and UK. It is there for a good reason, it is a last resort, insurance mechanism that only kicks in if we are unable to resolve the border issues through negotiating a comprehensive future relationship, which everybody believes is possible,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-4320405-Nov2018/,"A BREXIT DEAL can be reached this month, according to Tánaiste Simon Coveney.
Speaking to reporters at Iveagh House this evening following a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference today, Coveney said significant progress has been made in recent weeks, adding that the withdrawal agreement is “nearly done”.
Coveney and Britain’s Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said they “hoped and expected” that Brexit negotiators would secure a final agreement in the coming weeks, adding that both sides are very close with getting it over the line.
The Tánaiste said a number of things are still required, stating that negotiators on both sides still have no basis as of yet to indicate political sign off if an EU summit is called.
“I don’t think we are quite there yet,” he said, stating that some movement by the British side to find a legal wording is needed.

He said it is no coincidence that he has been meeting with UK politicians in recent days such as British Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, stating they are working on the same issue as to how to assure that commitments previously made to Ireland and the EU are now followed through on by Britain.

Lidington said the talks have been “intensive” in recent weeks, adding that he wanted to leave no doubt in the minds of the Irish people that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May and her government are committed to the undertakings they have given.
He said the negotiations cannot be allowed to “drift” to the 29 March stating that both the EU and the British parliament have get any such deal passed and legislation must be drafted to give effect to any withdrawal agreement.
The MP was keen to state that the ties between Ireland and the UK will remain strong post-Brexit.
At today’s meeting, it was agreed “top level summits” alternating between Ireland and Britain each year would be held between the two government, and these would be backed-up by close bilateral work between ministers.
Lidington said such meetings would be “vital” to maintain the close links between the two countries, due to ministers and leaders not being able to meet regularly at EU summits, as is typically the case.

NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE an orderly Brexit deal will go down to the wire after Theresa May said she would return to Brussels for more talks on the eve of a planned signing summit.
After an inconclusive trip to Brussels to meet EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker, the British prime minister said she would return on Saturday to finalise preparations for a full EU meeting the next day.
It is believed that the texts of the deal will not be final before a meeting of top EU diplomats – the summit’s so-called “sherpas” – on Friday, frustrating some European leaders.
“There are some further issues that need resolution. We have given direction to our negotiators this evening. The work on those issues will now start immediately,” May said in a statement yesterday.
“I believe we have been able to give sufficient direction for them to be able to resolve those remaining issues,” she said, adding that she would meet Juncker again on Saturday.
With less than four days until Sunday’s meeting, a European Commission spokesperson said: “Very good progress was made in meeting between President Juncker and Prime Minister Theresa May.”
But she added: “Work is continuing.”
News of Saturday’s last-ditch meeting will not go down well in Berlin, where Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel had earlier urged negotiators not to reopen talks on the main withdrawal agreement.
“I hope it will be solved by Sunday,” she told German lawmakers.
Negotiators are hammering out details of a political statement on future UK-EU ties that will accompany the divorce deal, under pressure to put it together before the sherpa meeting on Friday.
After enduring another parliamentary grilling at prime minister’s questions in London, May slipped out of the Westminster bear pit and crossed the Channel to meet the head of the EU executive.
Having seen off – at least for now – a potential leadership challenge by hardline Brexiteers in her own party, she hoped to wring out of Brussels a Brexit arrangement that she can sell to her parliament.
The withdrawal treaty itself is all but final, and preparations are underway for Sunday’s summit to sign it, but there remains the matter of the parallel 20-page political declaration on future relations.
European diplomats and EU officials have been in intense talks on the declaration this week.

May must show that she has left nothing on the table if she is to convince British members of parliament to ratify the deal in the coming weeks.
May and Juncker were expected to cover fishing rights and the movement of goods after Brexit, as well as the duration of the transition period and the British territory of Gibraltar, which lies on an outcrop off Spain.
Under pressure
May faces pressure from her Northern Irish allies, who oppose a deal they say weakens British sovereignty in their province, and from Spain, which has warned it might oppose the accord over Gibraltar.
Madrid wants a veto over applying any agreement on post-transition relations to Gibraltar but May told MPs that Britain “will not exclude Gibraltar from our negotiations on the future relationship”.
There is frustration among some EU countries at Spain trying to play hardball so late in the game.
“We are following the latest developments with growing concern and incomprehension — among the EU27 our Spanish friends are all alone on this,” an EU diplomat told AFP.
Madrid reiterated its threat on Wednesday to vote against the draft deal.
Two of May’s top ministers quit last week, including her Brexit secretary, while MPs from all parties came out against the withdrawal deal – increasing the chances that Britain will crash out of the Union on March 29 without an agreement.
The withdrawal deal covers Britain’s financial settlement, expatriate citizens’ rights, contingency plans to keep open the Irish border and the terms of a post-Brexit transition.
‘Show our displeasure’
Opposition to the agreement is also building in the pro-Brexit camp. Anti-Europe Conservatives have savaged the divorce deal, which they say keeps Britain too close to the EU.
Rebels led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg failed in their attempt to force an immediate confidence vote in May’s leadership, but warned they would keep trying.
The withdrawal agreement sets out plans for a 21-month transition after Brexit, in which Britain and the EU want to turn their outline agreement on the future relationship into a full trade deal.

On Sunday, May crowned 17 months of painful talks with Brussels by sealing Brexit arrangements with the 27 other EU heads of state and government.
May must now navigate the Brexit agreement through a divided chamber in which she holds the slimmest working majority – and where lawmakers oppose it on all sides.
A vote has been set for 11 December.
In Northern Ireland today, May will meet with all five political parties in Belfast, where she will urge politicians to get behind the deal.
Throughout these discussions, she will argue that strengthening the union has been her priority from the beginning of negotiations, and make the case for her deal.
“This deal avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This has been at the forefront of my mind throughout the negotiations,” May said.
“It has been especially clear to me when I have visited communities along the border in Northern Ireland and seen first-hand how important it is that the unique circumstances local employers face are recognised in any agreement,” she said.

Prior to this meeting, May will attend a community event at Queen’s University Belfast for roundtable discussions with students, academics and community and religious leaders.
DUP warning
The visit comes after DUP leader Arlene Fosteron Sunday saidthat May will need to remove backstop provisions in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
If those references that would treat Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the UK in the absence of a closely tied customs deal and trading arrangement, then the DUP will not vote in favour of the deal in the House of Commons in the coming weeks, she said.
But she also added that the DUP could consider a Norway-style deal as a way to prevent Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK, in which the UK would join the European Economic Area and stay aligned to the single market.
Ten DUP MPs are supporting Theresa May’s government since a snap election following the EU referendum in 2016. In exchange for the DUP’s support, May promised €1.1 billion in extra funding for Northern Ireland.
But if the DUP don’t get what they want from the Brexit deal, they could collapse May’s government and trigger an election in the middle of Brexit talks.
The visit also comes less than a day after US president Donald Trump warned that the Brexit deal mayinadvertently hampertrade between London and Washington.

https://www.thejournal.ie/are-theresa-mays-days-numbered-4117301-Jul2018/,"THIS FRIDAY WILL mark the two year anniversary of Theresa May’s appointment as British Prime Minister, butthe resignation of her Brexit SecretaryDavid Davis means questions about whether she will reach a third anniversary are swirling.
While the task ahead of her at her appointment was daunting – leading the country in Brexit negotiations while uniting a party and country that had been bitterly divided on the issue – May was cast as the spiritual successor to Margaret Thatcher, her supporters t believing she was the kind of negotiator who could get all that the Leave campaign had promised Brexit would deliver.
Described as a “bloody difficult woman”by Tory grandee Ken Clarke, May promised that the next man to find out how “bloody difficult” would be EU Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
But in the two years that have followed, May’s attempts to guide the good ship Brexit have hit stormy seas again and again.
Herinitial cabinet reshufflewas called a “brutal cull” by the Daily Telegraph, despite May being a senior member of David Cameron’s previous cabinet.
In an attempt to unite the party and ward off unrest from Brexiteers May, who advocated staying in the EU, appointed several of the most vocal proponents of Brexit to senior posts, including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary.
That move did not head off the unrest though and Johnson has repeatedly undermined his boss, last month saying that if Donald Trump were in May’s position “actually you might get somewhere”. Up until last weekend’s cabinet meeting at Chequers, Davis had also been another who has publicly grumbled about issues from the speed of negotiations to the Irish border.
Now, just two days after the warring factions in May’s cabinet approved a plan in a bid to unblock negotiations with Brussels, long-time eurosceptic Davis announced he was stepping down in a letter scathing of the agreement.
“The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,” he wrote.
The impact

After last year’s attempt to consolidate her power by calling a snap election backfired spectacularly, the ability for May to suffer many more setbacks was limited.
With her ally Amber Rudd having to resign in April in the wake of the Windrush scandal, May can ill-afford another dissenting voice at the cabinet table, but will Davis’ resignation be the end of days for her?
His departure could embolden Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers — who have long considered May too prone to compromise with the EU — to challenge her leadership.
However, what May does have going for her right now is time – or the lack of it. It is now less than nine months until Britain leaves the EU on 29 March next year. With the EU continually warning Britain that time is running out to seal a divorce deal, any potential challengers may be deterred from taking on such a mammoth task.
At the very minimum, it would require a politician of bulletproof ego to believe they could deliver a meaningful Brexit in just nine months in charge.
Speaking of which…
Boris JohnsonPA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
While there are plenty of challengers in the wings, the Jacob Rees Moggs of the world, a potential compromise candidate – Michael Gove – openly supported the Chequers plan over the weekend.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said yesterday that it did not contain everything he wanted but “I’m a realist”.
“All those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC.
The wildcard in the situation is Johnson. He hasn’t publicly commented on Davis’ departure and has cancelled a number of appearances today, fuelling speculation that if someone is to challenge May, it will be him.
As for whether it will happen – or if the UK could head back to the polls this year – only time will tell.
But for May, either way, time is a commodity that she doesn’t have a lot of.

NIGEL FARAGE IS returning to frontline politics in a bid to scupper the UK government’s Brexit blueprint.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said he would be “back on the road”, taking part in a battle bus tour by the Leave Means Leave group to oppose Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan.
Farage quit the UKIP leadership following victory in the 2016 referendum on Britain’s EU membership, claiming his mission was complete.
But the MEP said today he was stepping back into the breach to oppose May’s Brexit blueprint, calling it a “cowardly sell-out”.
London and Brussels are yet to reach an agreement on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, and lawmakers are split on May’s proposals to keep Britain close to the EU on trade — parts of which have since been rejected by Brussels.

“I’ve had enough of their lies, deceit and treachery. The time has come to teach them a lesson — one that they will never forget,”Farage wrote in The Daily Telegraph.
“Theresa the Appeaser has produced a set of ideas that are nothing more than a cowardly sell-out. We need a campaign across the country that re-engages voters and restores their faith in Brexit.
The Leave Means Leave group said it would be campaigning across Britain, staging large rallies and ramping up activity on social media.
I pledge my absolute and total support to Leave Means Leave and will go back on the road to campaign.Over the last few months, scores of people have stopped me in the street to ask: “When are you coming back?”Well now you have your answer: I’m back.https://t.co/7gTH9uNVuC— Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage)August 17, 2018Nigel Farage/ Twitter

Since leaving the UKIP leadership, Farage has hosted a show on talk radio station LBC five days a week and continues to lead the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy grouping in the European Parliament.
Farage has not indicated whether he hopes to head UKIP again when the current leader Gerard Batten stands down in April.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-confidence-vote-2-4391516-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2018
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has survived a confidence motion in her leadership.
The result of the vote was as follows: 200 in favour and 117 against.
May needed to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive (half of the total number of 317 Conservative MPs).
The outcome of the vote was expected as more than 170 Tory MPs earlier today indicted they would back their leader.
The chairman of the Conservative Party’s backbench 1922 Committee Graham Brady confirmed this morning that at least 48 Tory MPs, the necessary threshold, had written to him calling for a vote on the motion.
May is expected to step down before a general election. She reportedly wants to oversee the Brexit deal being agreed before she resigns.
May has signalled she will step down before 2022 – when the next general election is due to take place, but an election is likely to happen before then.
The confidence motion comes two days after May announcedthe deferral of a House of Commons voteon the draft Withdrawal Agreement struck between Britain and the European Union.
‘A long and challenging day’
Speaking after the vote, the prime minister said today has been “a long and challenging day”. She welcomed the result but acknowledged that a significant number of her MPs voted against her, saying she has listened to their concerns.

May said she intends to deliver on Brexit and will tomorrow travel to Brussels to seek “legal and political assurances that will assuage the concerns that Members of Parliament have” in relation to the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement.
“That must start here in Westminster with politicians on all sides coming together and acting in the national interest,” she stated.
Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, a vocal critic of May, said the result of the vote means the party has “just kicked the can down the road”.

“On Monday the prime minister stood up and said she was going to lose so heavily that she wasn’t even going to present the vote,” he added.
However, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond defended May. “Now is the time to focus on the future. Her deal means we will honour the referendum,” he said.

Tonight's vote of confidence in the Prime Minister@theresa_may, is the right one. Now is the time to focus on the future. Her deal means we will honour the referendum result while safeguarding jobs and maintaining business confidence.
‘Vote makes no difference’
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the result of tonight’s vote “makes no difference to the lives of our people”.
“The prime minister has lost her majority in parliament, her government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first.
“She must now bring her dismal deal back to the House of Commons next week so parliament can take back control.”
Corbyn added that the Labour Party is “ready to govern”.
Backstop
On Monday, May postponed the Brexit vote so that she could seek additional assurances from European leaders on the Irish backstop.
May told the House of Commons the current agreement “would be rejected by a significant margin” but stated: “I’m in absolutely no doubt that this deal is the right one.”
The backstopaims to avoid a hard borderbetween the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop – including Conservative MPs and members of Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up May’s minority government.
The DUP believes the backstop threatens the United Kingdom and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
In a statement released tonight, the Irish government confirmed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, spoke by phone this evening.
“Both agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement is a balanced compromise and the best outcome available,” a spokesperson said.
A two-day European Council meeting will begin in Brussels tomorrow.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-troubles-border-northern-ireland-4262689-Oct2018/,"A RETIRED MEMBER of the Irish Defence Forces has described how the Defence Forces is as “unprepared” for Brexit as it was for manning the border when the Troubles erupted in the late 1960s.
Dan Harvey, author of the book Soldiering Against Subversion, about the Defence Forces’ role during the Troubles, toldTheJournal.iethat there are parallels between the border issues in the north and what could happen with Brexit.
“Not that [the book] was written with Brexit in mind but there is kind of a chilling parallel… it was written for the 50th anniversary of the Troubles, but Brexit, which I thought would be long since solved, is heading towards its deadline unsolved,” he said of the situation.
Beginning in 1969, the Defence Forces worked alongside the gardaí, manning border stops, dealing with incidents, and manning posts at places like Portlaoise Prison.
In his book, Harvey details how the then-Taoiseach Jack Lynch presided over an emergency meeting about the Irish Government response to rioting. Part of the response was the enlist the help of the Defence Forces. Meanwhile, British troops had been sent to Northern Ireland in huge numbers to assist the RUC and maintain British government authority.
“Well below its peacetime strength, possessing only antiquated equipment and little reliable transport ability of any note, and with no permanently occupied military posts north of a line from Galway to Gormanstown camp in County Meath, the Defence Forces were ordered northwards,” writes Harvey of the Irish response.
He wrote the book to highlight the subsequent work of the Defence Forces despite such challenges, showing how they dealt with such an intense situation.
“I was so proud of what the Defence Forces did, what they did was meaningful it had purpose and it was important, and yet it seemed to be sliding away,” he said.
Speaking toTheJournal.iethis week he said: “Again the parallels: We were underprepared in 69, we are unprepared now as well.
“And we have the lesson. It’s not that the Defence Forces hasn’t been telling people,” he said.
In his book, Harvey writes about the paramilitary attacks that took place along the border. “At the time the border was a good place to carry out your campaign because it was symbolic of division, it was symbolic of occupation,” he said. “And if you did blow up a border post you were making the point but you were also incurring costs on the British expenditure.”
He questioned what would happen if there was a hard border put in place after Brexit:

Harvey has been retired for a year, and said that he knows his colleagues in the Defence Forces are talking about the Brexit border issue themselves.
“They were responsible citizens,” he said. “Something needs to happen between this and the date [of Brexit], for it not to go in this direction [as during the Troubles]. If nothing happens then that’s the direction we’re going.”
Border warnings

Harvey’s warning came a day after former Brexit Secretary David Davistold Sky Newsthat he thinks the Irish Border is an exaggerated and oversimplified issue when it comes to Brexit negotiations.
“The people oversimplifying it are the Irish government and the commission.
“There is no acceptable sweeping political answer, what they have to do is look at the detail, the detail of tax on the border,” Davis said.
Theresa May has insisted there will be no hard border after Brexit, with her government proposing that a backstop planbe put in placeshould there be no Brexit border deal. It would last until 2021.
The UK has committed to providing technological solutions to the issue of the border. May committed that if the EU did not accept these solutions, a backstop plan would be put in place that would avoid this.
Meanwhile, earlier this year a garda representative claimed that border gardaí were “completely unprepared” for Brexit,saying thatthey have not once been briefed on the potential policing implications that a hard or soft border would cause.
The division of Cavan/Monaghan is one of the worst affected, according to Garda Representative Association (GRA) member James Morrisroe at the time.
TheJournal.ietook a Brexit road trip along the Northern Irish border, where we found that few, if any, people living there believe a return to a hard border is a desirable solution.
Many fear it could divide communities again, sever trade on the island, and potentially increase the need for a military presence:

BRITISH DESCENDENTS OF refugees who fled Nazi Germany, including many Jewish families, are racing to have their German nationality restored so they can remain EU citizens after Brexit, official data shows today.
The number of Brits applying for German passports using a special legal provision that aims to make amends for Nazi-era persecutions, known as article 116-2, has soared nearly 40-fold since Britain voted to leave the bloc in June 2016.
Germany received just 43 such passport requests in 2015, but that jumped to 684 in 2016 — nearly all of them submitted after the Brexit referendum.
Last year, the number leapt to 1,667 requests, according to figures released by the German interior ministry in response to a parliamentary question.
Under article 116-2 of the German constitution, former Germans who lost their citizenship on “political, racial or religious grounds” between the day Adolf Hitler became chancellor on January 30, 1933 and Germany’s surrender on May 8, 1945, can ask to have their citizenship reinstated.

According to the German government, the group “mainly includes German Jews” and members of critical political parties at the time.
The legal provision is also open to descendants of those who were persecuted and sought safe haven abroad.
Other EU countries have likewise seen a surge in passport applications from British people hoping to retain the same rights post-Brexit, including being able to live and work as locals in any member state.
France has seen an eight-fold increase in Britons asking for citizenship, from 386 in 2015 to 3,173 in 2017.
There was also a spike in the number of British becoming Irish citizens,figures showed in September.
“In 2014 just 51 UK citizens became naturalised Irish citizens. In 2015 this increased marginally to 54 before nearly doubling to 98 in 2016, the year of the Brexit vote,” said Senator Neale Richmond.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-brexit-amendments-4133708-Jul2018/,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that the amendments passed by the British government “have not been helpful” for Brexit negotiations with the EU.
He was responding toa number of defeatsfor British Prime Minister Theresa May in the House of Commons this week, including the rejection of a suggestion that the UK could remain in the custom union ifanother free trade dealcouldn’t be agreed.
The government is to announce its plans for a no-deal Brexit today after a special Cabinet meeting at Derrynane House in Co Kerry.
In that eventuality, it’s probable that a hard border will automatically go up on the island of Ireland in order to enforce customs and trade rules and regulations – but Varadkar has said that a hard border wouldn’t be part of their plans.
Coveney said that there were a variety of plans depending on the type of Brexit that was agreed, but that he was “confident” that it wouldn’t get to a no-deal scenario.
Speaking during two interviews onNewstalkandRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, he said that Westminster dramatics had been a distraction for everyone and that time was tight to negotiate a final deal.
Although he said that it wasn’t up to the Irish government to solve an internal disagreement, he said that the amendments voted for on Monday night would cause problems for negotiations with the EU.

“What happened on Monday night was unhelpful unpredictable in terms of how the House of Commons will vote… uncertainty is unhelpful, as we can only negotiate on what has been published and on the clear commitments made by UK Prime Minister.”
He also said that as long as Britain continues to “negotiate with itself”, the real negotiations with the EU cannot begin.
He said that last week’s White Paper which outlined Theresa May’s position was a step in the right direction, but “unfortunately people are trying to undermine that paper”.
Speaking about the fear that there would be no agreement on the ‘backstop’ – or the ‘Plan B’ arrangement for the relationship between Northern Ireland and the republic in the event of no other agreement being made – Coveney said that he was confident that commitment was water-tight.
“I don’t accept that for one minute [that there is no backstop deal],” he told Newstalk. “The British government continually confirmed that they are committed to a backstop that deals with the Irish border question, and confirmed last March and in the White Paper as much.”
He also added that the amendments which were voted in have the capacity to be changed, and shouldn’t dictate future negotiations with the EU.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told reporters today that the Irish government needs to clarify that the backstop is the contingency plan to a hard Brexit.
She said the Irish protocol – known as the backstop – was meant to be contingency plan, adding that she is concerned that Varadkar might be “stepping back” from the protocol.

When asked whether Sinn Féin, which has seven Westminster MPsbut has a policy of abstentionism, should have taken its seats to influence the vote and prevent the amendments, Coveney said Sinn Féin had explaining to do.
“It’s not for me to tell Sinn Féin what to do, but I think it’s extraordinary that a party that’s present in Northern Ireland and Ireland – and when you have an important piece of legislation and seven MPs in that parliament – to refusing to take part in debates or votes. And as a result things are being passed that might not be passed.

Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’sMarian Finucane Show, Coveney said that the British government has a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP and that he understands that.
“But we don’t have a confidence and supply agreement with any one party in Northern Ireland – we listen to all of them, including the DUP and the UUP and the Alliance, and the SDLP and Sinn Féin,” he said.
“I think the DUP would accept that Northern Ireland is different.”
Coveney said that three out of the four main issues in relation to the Brexit negotiations have been settled: those are the Brexit bill (reported to be around €35-45 billion), EU citizens rights, the transition period and the Irish border issue.
He said that the backstop “has turned into a green versus orange issue” and that unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland fear of the effect Brexit will have. He added that it was important to de-dramatise the situation and talk about the practicalities of trade and movement of goods and people.
In response to assertions that the backstop wasn’t as “bulletproof” as was first thought, Coveney said that the Irish government wouldn’t sign anything that didn’t guarantee the commitment made by the British government to Northern Ireland.

He added that Ireland doesn’t want a border along the Irish Sea either: “We have [thousands] Irish companies that trade with Britain virtually every week.”
He said that “it was probably true” the UK “didn’t give a fig” about Northern Ireland in the run up to the EU referendum that was held in June 2016, but that it matters to them now.
When asked whether they could count on the backstop as an absolute given the instability of the political situation in Britain at the moment, particularly if prominent Brexiteer and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson came to power, Coveney said:
“Forget about Boris Johnson, he’s yesterday’s person.”
Simon Coveney said that Barnier has told him that the Brexit Withdrawal deal was 87% completed, but that most of the remaining issues relate to Ireland.
He said that he still believed that it was “do-able” to make a deal on the Irish backstop.

Responding to the criticism by EU leaders of the Chequers plan in Salzburg, Austria over the past few days, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said during an interview onthe Late Late Showthat he “didn’t like what happened to Theresa May”.

THERESA MAY WILL today face knife-edge votes in parliament on her centrepiece Brexit legislation, despite her last-minute warning that defeat risked undermining her negotiations with Brussels.
After a bumpy week of Brexit spats within her administration and with the EU, May wants to fend off another setback in a long-awaited showdown with restive lawmakers.
MPs in the lower House of Commons will vote on a raft of amendments produced by the upper House of Lords, which May claims would weaken the government’s hand in exit talks with the EU.
“We must think about the message parliament will send to the European Union this week,” May told MPs in her centre-right Conservative Party last night.
Her minority Tory government relies on the support of the DUP for a slender working majority in the 650-member Commons.
“I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible,” she said.
“But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”
Flashpoints
The EU (Withdrawal) Bill, coming back down to the Commons from the unelected Lords, is the draft law that would set the legal framework for Brexit.
The government wants the Commons to reject 14 out of 15 amendments introduced by the Lords which are intended to keep Britain close to the European Union after Brexit.
However, May is worried about the prospect of a rebellion by pro-EU Conservative MPs who are determined to retain as many of the changes as possible.
Flashpoints include proposals to increase the power of parliament to decide on the final Brexit deal, and others seeking to keep Britain tightly aligned with the EU’s economy after it leaves the bloc.

Some europhile Conservatives were reported to be backing away, worried that if May was fatally damaged by defeat, it could open the way for a hardline Brexiteer to take over the party and the premiership.
Theresa MayPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
May warned her MPs: “The message we send to the country through our votes this week is important.
“We must be clear that we are united as a party in our determination to deliver on the decision made by the British people.”
Customs union concession
One amendment in danger of not being overturned is on the so-called meaningful vote, which would give parliament the power to decide what to do if it rejects the final Brexit deal.
Tomorrow, one on joining the European Economic Area – the single market – will likely fall because the main opposition Labour Party is against it.
However, the government may lose a vote on membership of the EU’s customs union, but this may not have much practical impact due to the way it is drafted.
Europhile Conservative Sarah Wollaston said she was “minded” to rebel.
“We would like to see further concessions on the amendment on the customs union because it is just a very sensible amendment that says keep it on the table, don’t completely rule it out,” she told the BBC.
After May addressed her MPs, Brexit minister Steve Baker indicated that the government would consider a new compromise amendment regarding customs relations.
“Our policy is to leave the customs union so that we can conduct our own independent trade policy but it would be appropriate that we have an arrangement in place with the European Union,” he said.
The increasingly febrile atmosphere comes as pressure builds for a deal by October ahead of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU in March next year.
There is a sense among both eurosceptics and pro-Europeans that crunch time is fast approaching.

The human milk bank in Co Fermanagh provided by the Western Health and Social Care Trust expects co-operation to continue when the UK exits the EU as the facility  “is not dependent on EU funding or legislation”.
“It, therefore, remains our expectation that access and co-operation should continue after EU Exit, in line with the Department of Health’s priorities in respect of maintaining cross-border healthcare services,” a spokesperson for the Western Trust toldTheJournal.ie.
Opened in 2000, the Western Trust milk bank issues around 1,500 litres of milk to units around Ireland each year.
Speaking earlier this year, the manager of the facility said that the breast milk bank was one of the reasons more premature babies were surviving.
In 2015 it helped approximately 856 babies including 90 sets of twins and 17 sets of triplets.
According to its website:
However, as Brexit negotiations continue, it is still uncertain what is in store for the Irish border.
If there’s a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, there’s likely to be custom checks along the border (out of the customs union), and additional tariffs (out of the single market).
This could have implications on those who rely on the service in the Republic.

‘The difference between life and death’
Concern about the future of a human milk service on the island was raised by Social Democrats’ spokeswoman on children, councillor Jennifer Whitmore, who has called for a similar facility to be set up in the Republic.
Whitmore said she believes that sick and premature babies should not have to depend on supplies from the single donor bank located in the North.
“This is a very important service, which in some instances can mean the difference between life and death.
“We can’t allow families and babies-in-need to be caught up in any potential political upheaval in the wake of Brexit,” Whitmore said.
How is milk collected?
The Milk Bank issues donors with pre-sterilised bottles, and mothers record their name and expression date on each bottle.
Milk can be frozen. Once donors have collected enough they contact the milk bank for a transport box which is then sent back to the bank, deep-frozen, using various transport routes. It is then sent on to hospitals and doctors who request it.
The Wicklow councillor has called on the Government to establish a milk bank in the Republic “so that donor milk from Irish mothers can be collected, processed and stored in this jurisdiction”.
The HSE said in response to a query from this website that it has no plans to establish and operate a human milk bank in the Republic of Ireland but is “committed to maintaining the necessary supply”.
“There is currently an arrangement in place to purchase donor human breast milk from a number of sites in the UK which meets the required need,” a HSE spokesperson said.

Online dating is awkward enough without having to go into the history of Anglo-Irish relations, and yet here we were. Then she shook her head.
“The problem with you Irish is that you think you’re special or something.” However ignorant, it should be noted that there was no malice in what she said. In fact, she seemed to really like Ireland, or the idea of it at least.
Rather, she was simply perplexed as to why Ireland would want to be separate from the United Kingdom in the first place.
English attitude towards the Irish
Winston Churchill once remarked “We have always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English”. These sentiments sum up the English attitude towards Ireland; Irish independence is viewed as a quirk of national character more so than a political reality, an eccentricity they entertain but do not fully understand.
There was a time when reflecting on British attitudes to Ireland could be dismissed as oversensitivity, but post-Brexit these attitudes are having real world consequences on everything from the visa status of Irish immigrants in the UK to the confusion currently playing out over the Irish border.
My personal experience of British ignorance towards their closest neighbours has not been limited to bad Bumble dates, I should probably point out.
Registering with my GP
My first encounter took place about two weeks after moving to London when I registered with my local GP.
“Where were you born?” the nurse asked me first, entering my details onto the system. “Dublin”. She paused. “Is that in Northern Ireland, or the South?” I tell her Dublin is in the South.
She pauses again, clearly struggling with the list of options on her computer screen. “Does that mean you’re…British?” she finally asks, half-apologetically. “No”, I answer. “I’m Irish.”

The lack of comprehension around the Irish border in the ongoing Brexit negotiations is easier to understand when viewed in this context. How could pro-Brexit politicians and their electorate not have foreseen that a hasty, improvised departure from the European Union would have serious implications for Northern Ireland and its relationship with the Republic?
The simple answer is; a majority of people voted to “take back” control of the UK’s borders without understanding where their borders actually are.
The Irish question
The impact of this cannot be underestimated. Those on the pro-Brexit side are getting increasingly frustrated with having to deal with the Irish question at all.
The former Brexit secretary David Davis infamously stated that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s “tough” stance on Brexit was influenced by Republicanism, while the Sun newspaper recently published an editorial advising Varadkar to “’shut his gob on Brexit and grow up” (the paper has previously suggested that Varadkar is being leaned on by Sinn Fein/IRA).
Brexit was supposed to be about national empowerment, and having to take Ireland seriously as an equal on the world stage was not part of the plan. Britain has dictated the terms of Ireland sovereignty since independence, but now Ireland is confidently asserting itself with the full weight of the European Union behind it, and some Tories are visibly unsettled by it.
Going away parties
Much of the confusion can probably be traced back to the Ireland Act, which the UK parliament passed in 1949 in response to the foundation of the Republic of Ireland. The act recognised that while Ireland was no longer a dominion of Britain, it would not be viewed as a foreign country under British law.
It has allowed emigrants like myself to live and work in the UK without a visa, and this status is guaranteed with or without EU membership. Friends of mine from places like France and Italy are not so lucky. Soon they will be required to apply for special ID cards if they wish to stay, and many would rather leave and feel like second class citizens.
It’s a feeling many emigrants will be familiar with; when you start attending more going away parties than welcome parties, you begin to wonder if it’s time you left too.

FORMER BREXIT SECRETARY David Davis caused something of a stir at the weekend by saying people can buy drinks with pounds in the Republic of Ireland and vice versa with euros in Northern Ireland.
Davis made the comments while discussing the future of the border between the Republic and the North. He said the difficulty in resolving what will happen to the border after Britain leaves the EU has been exaggerated.
The claim:
People can buy alcohol in Dublin with pound sterling and vice versa with euros in Belfast.
The interview:
Speaking to Sky News programmeRidge on Sunday, the Conservative MP said: “I’m reasonably familiar with the Irish border, over the course of 20 years or so.
“There is already a border there, there’s a customs border, there’s a judicial border, there’s a currency border. Those borders all operate invisibly, the only way you can tell is the stripe in the middle of the road changes colour as you go over the border.”

David Davis says he thinks the Irish border is an exaggerated and oversimplified issue when it comes to Brexit negotiations#Pledgepic.twitter.com/QOO0kskbOc
Davis said the biggest issues with regard to the border are tax and smuggling, which could both be dealt with by authorities. He then added that it doesn’t matter which currency people carry in either jurisdiction.
“The people who are over-simplifying it are the Irish government and the Commission by saying, ‘Oh, you’ve got to have a sweeping political answer.’ There is no acceptable sweeping political answer.
During the course of Brexit negotiations, several high-ranking politicians in the UK have shown a lack of knowledge or understanding of how things work in Northern Ireland and the Republic.
Davis’ comments, appearing to be made in that vein, sparked quite the reaction.

The evidence:
For the record, the official currency in the Republic of Ireland is the euro. The official currency in Northern Ireland is pound sterling (bear with us).
Some businesses that are popular with tourists do accept various currencies as payment but this is something decided by each individual company.
When asked about Davis’ comments, a spokesperson for the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland said the organisation has “no official policy” on the matter.

“From observation some businesses close to the border accept payment in both currencies but it’s a localised occurrence. It’s for individual publicans to decide whether to accept sterling,” the spokesperson said.
A spokesperson for Fáilte Ireland said the tourism body has “no role in advising tourism businesses in relation to currency exchange as this would be a commercial matter for each individual business”.
Conclusion:
As many people have pointed out, one can’t use either currency interchangeably in both jurisdictions.
Fluctuating exchange rates and the general hassle of having to exchange the money means most businesses only accept the official currency of their country.
Some establishments (generally those close to the border or popular with tourists) do accept either currency. However, this is the exception rather than the norm.
With this in mind, we rate this claimMOSTLY FALSE.

The deal would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If both sides fail to decide the next steps by 2020, a backstop will kick in securing regulatory alignment between the North and the rest of the European Union.

Esther McVey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions followed about an hour later. She said the deal put before the Cabinet “does not honour the result of the referendum”.
There have also been resignations by other MPs including junior ministers and parliamentary private secretaries (MPs who act as a minister’s contact with other MPs):

Philip Hammond and Greg Clark yesterday told business leaders that the withdrawal agreement was essential to avoiding the chaos of a no-deal Brexit, according toSky News.
Sajid Javid did not oppose the agreement in the Cabinet meeting, but reportedly offered some “constructive criticism”.

The Guardianreports that supportive voices came from the Communities Secretary, James Brokenshire, and the Education Secretary, Damian Hinds.
The Prime Minister’s comments in parliament this morning are not going down well.
She told MPs to laughter and heckling that this is not the final deal but that it will ensure Britain leave the EU in a “smooth and orderly way”.
May has been heckled all morning by MPs in the parliament as they discuss the draft agreement.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told her people around the country will be worried today at what they are seeing:
“The government should withdraw this half-baked deal that doesn’t have the support of parliament, your Cabinet and the British people.”
With the negative reaction – from her own Cabinet and the parliament – this morning, further resignations today or over the coming days would not be a surprise.

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-theresa-may-4332134-Nov2018/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said she will not support British Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to have a Northern Ireland specific backstop.
The letter from May, leaked to the Times of London, suggests Brussels plans to put a customs border in the Irish sea in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking toRTÉ news, Foster questioned the motivation for this leak and said her problem with the letter was that May had confirmed a Northern Ireland specific backstop with Chequers for the rest of the UK.
“In other words, we will have a different regulatory regime from the rest of the United Kindgom and essentially there’s going to be a border down the Irish sea and no unionist would be able to support that,” she said.

Foster said the proposal would cause a “democratic deficit” and she fears it would cause Northern Ireland to diverge away from the United Kingdom.
She claimed he Irish government does not need a backstop to prevent a hard border, rather it needs a ‘trading relationship’. Foster said the British Prime Minister now has to decide if she wants to push forward with this proposal without the support of the 10 DUP MPs.
Her comments came as Transport Minister Jo Johnson – Boris Johnson’s brother – resigned from government.
Hognson said the UK is ”barrelling towards an incoherent Brexit that is going to leave us trapped in a subordinate relationship to the EU”.
He called for the public to have another say on whether Britain should leave the union.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said that the EU’s ‘backstop’ proposals that could effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union are “not acceptable”.
The proposals were published in Februarywith the EU saying they would only be needed if no solution was found on the issue of the Irish border.
Speaking today on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, May said this would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK that this would be “not right”.
“What we’ve seen from the European Commission is an idea, one idea in particular that would effectively put a border down which would separate out Northern Ireland from Great Britain. That’s not right, that’s not acceptable, we’re one United Kingdom,” she said(after 19 mins in the above video).

May repeated that it crucial for everyone in the UK as a whole that no hard border would be implemented on the island of Ireland.
On trade, she added: “We want to make sure that we have an independent trade policy so we can negotiate trade deals around the rest of the world. There are some other aspects, we will continue to work with the European Union.”

""There will be about £600 million a week more, in cash, going into the NHS,"" says@theresa_may#marrpic.twitter.com/1WtlFnE8jE
In the interview, May also claimed that a “Brexit dividend” would help fund an additional £20 billion for Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) over the next five years.
Making the claim, May referenced the infamous Leave promise that was plastered on the side of a bus during the 2016 Brexit referendum.
“At the end of five years, 2023-24, there will be £20 billion more in real terms being spent on the NHS,” May said.
And of course that will mean we’ll have to fund that money. That will be through the Brexit dividend, the fact that we will no longer be sending vast amounts of money ever year to the EU when we leave the EU. And of course we as a country will have to pay a bit more.
May’s NHS plans are to be announced more fully on tomorrow with Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond due to set out the tax increase that Britons would have to pay to fund them.
The NHS marks its 70th anniversary this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/max-fac-costly-4031002-May2018/,"UK Prime Minister Theresa MayPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
THE HEAD OF the UK’s Revenue and Customs says that the plan to deal with Brexit advocated by hard-line Brexiteers within the government could cost Britain as much as £20 billion (€22.8 billion).
The so-called ‘Max Fac’ (which stands for maximum facilitation) plan which would see the issues surrounding border checks, such as in Northern Ireland, dealt with via technology and ‘trusted trader’ schemes, is advocated by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Jacob Rees-Mogg.
Speaking before a Treasury select committee today, permanent secretary Jon Thompson said that Max Fac would prove to be substantially more expensive than the plan endorsed by prime minister Theresa May, a customs partnership model which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU.
The £20 billion figure represents roughly twice what the UK currently contributes to the EU each year.

A spokesman for the government latertold The Guardianin the wake of Thompson’s bombshell pronouncement that “work is ongoing” on both plans and “therefore any speculation about implementation is just that”.
With May’s cabinet bitterly split over the issue, the prime minister has been forced to split her ministers into two working groups in an attempt to end the impasse.
Thompson explained that the issue with the Max Fac solution is that it would force companies to draw up British customs declarations at a cost of £32.50 each.
“So you need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between £17 billion and £20 billion,” he said.
Thompson also told Westminster’s dedicated Brexit committee today that Max Fac would not be ready before 2021 at the earliest.
Britain is due to officially exit the EU on 29 March 2019.

For all of the talk and promises that we would have real and substantial progress and that we were not going to stumble into October without any resolution of the Irish issues, that is exactly what happened, yet we move on regardless.
All other European partners have their concerns and issues, all of which I respect, but the Irish government’s position has to be to protect the interests of those who live on the island of Ireland.
At the very least the Irish government has to hold Britain to account, pressuring the European Union to hold it to account and using whatever leverage we have to make sure that will happen.
Concrete solutions
That was the Irish government’s stated intention, according to its rhetoric, but it seems that it was comfortable in allowing the phase 1 negotiations to move on without real concrete solutions.
Now it seems content to leave the June summit without concrete solutions, even though it stated all the way along that it would not allow that to happen.
Leaving aside all of the differences we can have on these issues, with the British Government and the European Union, and leaving aside all of the different scenarios with max fac, max fac plus and all of the things we are hearing that might come from the Chequers meeting and the White Paper in which Theresa May will put some options on the table, the hard reality is that the British government is still intent on taking the North out of the European Union, the customs union and the Single Market.
There may be some sort of customs partnership, but we do not know how it would work in practice.
Not included
What we do know is that services will not be included. Not every area of trade will be included. There are real question marks about whether the European Union will agree to any type of arrangement which will allow Britain to stay in the Single Market without supporting the four freedoms which include the free movement of people.
I have no difficulty with the European Union defending its position and making sure the rules of the Single Market and the customs union are protected. We are a member of the European Union and it is taken as a given that that must happen.
However, if there is divergence and the North is not aligned with the rules of the Single Market and the customs union, we will have a problem. That would be a step backwards and we did not vote for a step backwards, North or South.
Advertisement
We should not accept it under any circumstance.
A lot of work to do
The government has an awful lot of work to do between now and October to recover lost ground. Pressure needs to be exerted on the Minister of State and the government to come back with a solution that will protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, avoid any hardening of the Border and protect the rights of citizens.
It is clear that we need a Brexit summit focused solely on Irish concerns prior to the October meeting, not a conversation about Brexit over breakfast. This is something that the Taoiseach must put forcefully to our European partners.
The backstop agreed in December – signed, sealed, delivered and enforceable – is the bottom line and the very minimum needed to protect our island, jobs and economic progress.
We also need to see recognition from the Tories that the people of the North voted to remain, not to exit. Given how the negotiations have gone to this point, it is clear the British government cannot grasp the importance of these issues to Ireland. It either cannot grasp it or it does not care but, either way, the result is the same.
If the British government refuses to do the right thing by Ireland, refuses to produce credible proposals and continues along a path that will only deliver economic devastation and political upheaval on this island, then those decisions should be taken out of its hands and placed in the hands of the people of this island.
In the event of a crash
In the event of a Brexit crash, a disorderly Brexit or a hard Brexit, to which the Tories seem wedded, the British must not imagine that the Irish people will simply sigh and resign themselves to their fate.
Theresa May and her government need to understand that, in the event of a crash, a chaotic or a hard Brexit, they will have no democratic alternative other than to put the constitutional question on the issue of ending partition and Irish reunification.
A shared, agreed, new Ireland is by far a better vision for all the people of this island than the destruction the Tories seem intent on.
As somebody who is committed to Irish unity, this is not the scenario in which I would wish a debate on reunification to occur; far from it. However, if it is the case that we are left with that mess, Theresa May needs to understand that the question, democratically, will have to be put.

https://www.thejournal.ie/regina-doherty-north-south-interconnector-4271178-Oct2018/,"MINISTER FOR SOCIAL Protection Regina Doherty has said she has “absolutely no confidence” that the North-South Interconnector will be completed.
The Meath East TD said the proposed energy project faces a number of legal challenges as well as the outcome of Brexit.
Speaking to LMFM, Doherty said: “The first obstacle is local to the Republic, where the Supreme Court hearing is set for two days next week on a judicial review of the project to date.
“The second legal obstacle in the way is an appeal on behalf of the institutions of Northern Ireland to their Supreme Court with regard to the decision that was taken by a court up there to overrule the decision-making process for the granting of the overhead lines in Northern Ireland.”
Doherty added that Brexit is “probably the biggest obstacle of all, facing both north and south in the coming weeks and months”.
Overhead power lines
The government this week considered two reports into the interconnector and insisted that proposals by EirGrid to use overheadpower lines will go ahead.
One of the reports, which looked at the cost and technical feasibility of building the interconnector underground, found that using electricity pylons was the preferable option by a ratio of 3:1.
Advertisement
The plans envisage a 400kV overhead electric power-line linking an existing substation in Woodland, Co Meath, with a planned substation in Turleenan, Co Tyrone. 299 pylons are expected to be built across Cavan, Meath and Monaghan as part of the project, which An Bord Pleanála approved in 2016.
The proposals have angered locals in the three counties, who have voiced concerns about potential impacts on the environment, their health and property prices.
‘At odds with what people want’
Doherty today said an underground option would be about €450 million more expensive, but may be preferable. She said pylons are “at odds with what lots of people want”.
Speaking onMorning Irelandon RTÉ Radio 1 yesterday, Minister for Communications Denis Naughten said Brexit will not impact the project.
He also pointed to the potential offered by the overground option, stating: “The benefit of an overhead line is that you have the opportunity for investment along the route of that line.
“Particularly in Co Monaghan, where there has been pinch points in the past in relation to electricity supply, there’s an opportunity to bring new investment there as well as supply.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment toldTheJournal.iethe Department did not wish to comment on Doherty’s remarks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-costings-4144760-Jul2018/,"THE DEPARTMENT OF Foreign Affairs has been accused of wanting to delay the publication of research on the cost of a united Ireland until “after Brexit”.
Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly stated he was concerned that when a draft of the research was discussed by the members of the Good Friday Agreement Implementation Committee that a member of the committee said department officials he had spoken to said that they did not want the research released until “after Brexit”.
An IMF senior economist during German Reunification, Gunther Thumann, carried out the research, along with Daly, for the Oireachtas Committee. It shows that Northern Ireland would have a near balanced budget in a unification situation.
‘Unacceptable interference’
Speaking about calls to delay the report publication, Daly said with Brexit negotiations at a difficult point, and the stalemate in Stormont, he believes officials wanted the report pushed back.
The latest research into the costings is a follow-through on one of the commitments of last year’s report, which was adopted unanimously by the committee, added Daly.
When contacted byTheJournal.ie, there was no denial from the department, with a spokesperson stating it would not be commenting at present.
Prior to the publication of the 2017 report, Dr Kurt Hubner of the University of British Columbia, who came before the Joint Committee, constructed economic models of scenarios of Irish unification, one of which showed a benefit of €36.5 billion in the first 8 years of unification.
Sinn Féinhas also argued it would be beneficial to Irelandand has published a report to dispel what it calls the “unaffordability myth” that it might cost £24.1 billion – the figure some commentators claim is spent by Britain on the North.

Pensions and the public service
In the Thumann research, which has not been published, but has been circulated to Oireachtas members, he argues in his research that pensions would initially be the responsibility of the British Government as the pension liability was accrued while Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom.
The economist also investigated a report entitled, Northern Ireland Budgetary Issues, which was produced by the United States Congressional Research Service.
It breaks down Northern Ireland’s expenditure into identifiable expenditure, non-identifiable expenditure and accounting adjustment.
The non-identifiable expenditure of £2.9 billion cited in that report, includes Northern Ireland’s share of UK Defence Expenditure, UK Debt Interest, International service, UK contribution to the EU, British Royal family etc.
These would not be a liability of a new agreed Ireland, argues the economist.
In his research, Thumann explains that not all the accounting adjustments figure attributed by Westminster to Northern Ireland of £1.1 billion would be applicable in a reunification scenario either.
Thumann also also reports about the convergence of the public service numbers between the north and the south.
There are around 403,000 public servants in the Republic of Ireland, 8.4% of the population, while there are around 205,700 public servants in Northern Ireland, 11.4% of the population.
Combining the group of public servants would bring a saving of £1.7 billion per annum in the current budget expenditure of Northern Ireland.
While these adjustments are of a mainly statistical nature the report states it show that the £9.2 billion Northern Ireland deficit figure is not a meaningful measure of the Northern Ireland fiscal situation under unification.
While a lot of research is necessary to come up with a meaningful measure for the Northern Ireland fiscal balance under a unification scenario, the research shows the pension adjustment could reduce Northern Ireland’s fiscal balance under a reunification scenario to close to a balanced budget.
“Taking the above adjustments and savings into account the cumulative figure is £8.5 billion. With the reported deficit for Northern Ireland is at £9.2 billion therefore the current income and expenditure figure for Northern Ireland, the report concludes comes near a balanced budget in a reunification scenario. This is of course, before taking into account the likely potential for growth in Northern Ireland following unification as happened in East Germany following its reunification,” said the senator.

THERE’S A STORY about a house in Pettigo that is split down the middle by the border – one half is in Northern Ireland and the other half in the Republic.
But if you go to Pettigo, a village which is itself split by the border, you could be told it doesn’t exist – which is what happened whenTheJournal.ieasked during a road trip along the Irish border.
We dropped the idea of finding it, leaving it with the other anecdotes we heard – featuring the melted butter, day trips on bikes, and a multicoloured boat.
But as it turned out, the house did exist. Father Joe McVeigh, a historian we met with in Enniskillen, told us that therewasa house split by the border, handing us this printout from his purple folder labelled ‘Brexit’.
Gráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ieGráinne Ní Aodha / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
The text underneath the photo reads:
“The house in the picture is that of the Murray family of Gortineddan, Co Fermanagh. The door at which Mrs Murray and her daughter are standing is the Six Counties. Behind Mr Murray’s left shoulder is the door leading to the Twenty-Six Counties.”
After spending several days on the roads that weave in and out of the border between the UK and Ireland, you get to hear a fair few fables and legends about ingenious ways of smuggling goods past customs checks.

But trying to sort out which rumours are true and untrue becomes an impossible task, because so many factual, first-person accounts about the border seem so difficult to believe now, after decades of peace and an open border.
That, and the stories are so good you want them to be true.
We heard a story about a fisherman on Lough Foyle – an estuary between Donegal and Derry that both the UK and Ireland claim to own. The fisherman apparently painted either side of his boat a different colour so that he could land fish in both the Irish and UK ends of the harbour, without authorities realising that he was exceeding fishing quotas.
Another rumour concerned a woman who was smuggling food across the border. A British officer who suspected her of doing so invited her by the fire for a chat, which after a few moments, caused the butter she was concealing to melt down her leg.

We were also told about a boy on a bicycle who cycled through the border checkpoint everyday – with border officers searching him thoroughly for what he could be smuggling, and failing to find anything time and time again.
On the last few days before the border came down, the officer, exasperated, asked what he had been smuggling, to which the boy replied “bicycles”. A similar version featuring a wheelchair also exists.
We were later told that these stories weren’t actually true – many people claim to know the person or to be related to the person who smuggled the bicycles, but in fact, it’s a story that’s repeated along borders in other countries – as far away as Mexico, even.
The stories also hint at a split between communities, and a gap in the understanding between those in the North about those in the Republic, and vice versa. One of the people we spoke to remembered travelling down the M1 on a school trip to Ireland in the 1980s, and a friend remarking: “Oh, they have motorways down here!”
With these kinds of misunderstandings on the island itself, it’s not surprising that senior figures in the UK and in Europe are struggling to fully grasp how serious a threat Brexit could be for Ireland.

The likelihood of a border
When Brexit does eventually happen, the shockwaves won’t be seen through House of Commons’ speeches, at the negotiation table at Brussels, or at the plinth in Leinster House.
The seismic political change will be felt in the wallets of ordinary people, the lives of EU and UK citizens, and on the streets of Northern Ireland.
For some people in the North, Brexit is already having an effect.
“Everytime Boris Johnson opens his mouth, the people’s wages go down,” is how one Donegal resident sees it, referring to those who work in the UK but who live in the Republic.
To be clear, we still don’t know what the exact consequences of Brexit will be, because we still don’t know what the final deal will be – or if there will be one at all. But we do know that the Northern Ireland border remains the biggest block to an orderly Brexit deal.

At the moment, it looks as though the choices negotiators are faced with are: the European Union gives in to the UK on some of its demands, such as giving it access to the Single Market but allowing it to make other trade deals; or the UK gives in and allows a customs border along the Irish Sea;or,neither give inand we’re left with either a hard Brexit (which could meansomeinfrastructure along the border), or a no-deal Brexit, which would almost certainly mean checkpoint infrastructure.

A no-deal Brexit means that all EU-UK ties are cut, and a hard border would be rebuilt on the island of Ireland after decades of hard-fought-for peace.
The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is put at 50/50 by most political reporters and EU politicians – but along the border, communities are in disbelief that a border could return.
The Irish border itself
Ireland’s physical customs border first went up on April Fool’s Day in 1924, and initially, there wasn’t much concern from the Irish government and border communities.
The Irish government thought that a land border would be too complicated to enforce and that eventually the UK government would be forced to move it to the Irish Sea.
But when tensions along the border escalated – from custom checks turning into IRA targets, to armed police being sent to defend custom officers – the British government just ramped up security and the border stayed in place.
In 1970 the UK began closing “unapproved roads” or roads where the border crossed over it by putting spikes in the middle of the road, but farmers took them down and continued to use them. They tried closing the roads again in 1971 after internment was introduced – and the local communities pushed back harder.

These weren’t nationalists – they were farmers trying to access their fields, family members visiting each other, and people trying to get to their village by the quickest route possible.
“When the Troubles erupted, border areas were very quiet, there was very little IRA organisation,” border expert Paddy Mulroe toldTheJournal.iewhile we stood on the Annaghroe bridge in Co Monaghan – the last bridge to be reopened after the hard border was taken down.
“After internment in August 1971, you had a slight upsurge in violence along the border… and then there was whole scale closure of border roads, and that proved to be very counter productive by the British security forces.”
Many in local communities got involved in campaigns to reopen their border roads, which led to border road protests.
As it stands now, the border currently runs along roads, between fields and through rivers and even divides the estuaries on either side of the border – Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.
Nicky Ryan / TheJournal.ieNicky Ryan / TheJournal.ie / TheJournal.ie
There are very little signs of checkpoint infrastructure left; buildings used to police the border have either been reused or fallen into disrepair; road markings remain the same for the most part; and in places where Google Maps shows the border, you’d be staring at the road for a long time looking for any trace of a previous structure.
That seems like the obvious thing to note – the ease of access through roads and free movement of people and goods because of the open border. But when you speak to people who grew up during the Troubles, or who own a farm or business, you get closer to understanding how vital that simplicity is.
‘My gut feeling is, it might never happen’
Talking to border communities throws up thoughts and arguments about the complexities of a hard border that aren’t often discussed.
Among those problems, are a fear that the “already-isolated” Co Donegal will be “strangled” from the rest of the country, the possibility that the agriculture sector will be “wiped out” if there’s a no-deal Brexit, and the idea that the North cannot return to a border, after experiencing peace and “360-degree access” for so long.
But as much as there’s a fear of losing an all-island economy, and a connected Irish community, there is also a prevailing sentiment that whatever happens, communities in the North and Ireland will make it work.

Martin Eves, a business owner in Pettigo, described border communities as having something akin to “an islander’s mentality”; whatever hardships hit them, they will work together to weather the storm.
The downside of that, says Paddy Mulroe, is that “the border turns everyone into smuggler” – but maybe not in the assumed sense of the word.
When you ask businesses, locals and experts living along the border what they think of the threat Brexit is posing, there really isn’t one answer:
With just weeks left in this political chess game before we know whether it’s deal or no deal, Northern Ireland citizens are left without a government to represent their views, and without a certain future.
All sides are pledging to avoid a border on the island of Ireland – but with time running out and so much else at stake, will maintaining peace on the island of Ireland trump both Brexiteer’s hunt for British sovereignty, and the integrity of the European Union?

THE UK’S DECISION to leave the European Union has become a complex and unpredictable beast, which has raised many questions about the responsibilities of a political and social movement weighed against the value of an economic and trade partnership.
It has started debates about the future of the European Union, the next step for the United Kingdom, and stoked the possibility of a trade war.
It’s also put the relationship between Ireland and our closest neighbour – in business, political partnerships and family ties – in jeopardy.
Over the next few weeks, before a crucial summit in October, we’re hoping to get a final plan on what Brexit will look like. But before then, let’s have a quick catch up on how we got here, what all those terms and deals mean, and what it is to be a member of the European Union.
How did Brexit happen?
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former UK Prime Minister David Cameron point fingers at one another.Yui MokYui Mok
After winning the general election, Tory Prime Minister David Cameron announced a referendum on EU membership. Having narrowly won the Scottish independence referendum months before (which saw Cameron travelling to Scotland at the last minute in a panic in order to rally support), the vote on EU membership was seen as an easy battle to win.
As well as being part of Cameron’s manifesto, the EU referendum was also partly prompted by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, who had started to gain traction in local elections on an anti-EU, anti-immigration platform.
Boris Johnson also took a prominent part in the debate to leave the EU, which was seen as a political move to challenge Cameron as the UK and Tory leader (Johnson and Cameron went to Oxford University together, and the two have an interesting relationship – more on thatin this piece from the British Independent).
On 23 June 2016, the EU referendum was held, and even at that late stage, the expectation was that the Remain vote would win (Farage gave what was considered a concession speech late in the day).
The final resultsaw 51.9% voting to leave the European Union (that’s 17 million people), with 48.1% voting to remain. The populations of Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU, while England and Wales voted to leave.
Having been left with no other option, Cameron resigned as Prime Minister.
Why did the UK vote to leave the EU?

There was much analysis about why the UK voted to leave the European Union, but the best answer comes from looking at was being said and done directly before anddirectly after the Leave vote: that is, before the difficulties of Brexit came to light.
One of the main reasons to leave – encompassed by the Leave slogan ‘Take Back Control’ -  was to regain autonomy over UK affairs. Instead of paying into the EU which then redistributes the money in the form of grants, the UK would spend their money as they saw fit, went the argument.
This is best represented by the controversial and hotly contested “£350 million a week” which would be made in savings from leaving the EU and then given to the NHS. The day of the Brexit vote, Nigel Farage rowed back on that promise, saying it was a mistake to make such a claim. Others have also said that it isn’t possible, resulting in the big red bus, upon which the slogan appeared, to be mocked by the Remain side.

‘Take Back Our Borders’ was the slogan against immigration, which some in the UK feared in the wake of the growing migrant crisis in Europe and Germany’s pro-migration stance; and ‘Take Back Our Waters’ focused around fishing regulations and tensions around the number of EU boats that fish around the UK coast.
It’s also been said that the UK has always been a reluctant EU member state, not agreeing to join the euro being just one example. But officials in Europe also said that its politicians and representatives played a very active part in the EU, and that smaller countries could hide behind the UK when they objected strongly to certain issues.
What does it mean to be an EU member state?

The European Union started off as a coal and steel trade deal in the post-war era. Ireland and the UK joined that arrangement much later in the 1973, which was known as the European Communities by then.
In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held and now, the European Union is both an economic and a social policy agreement between European nations. The idea is that by grouping European states together under a single market, it makes Europe more attractive as a whole for workers, and for corporate investment.
Member states pay an amount into the European Union pot, which is then redistributed as the EU elected officials see fit.
Up until now, the UK was the third biggest contributor, paying around 12.5% into the total budget. In 2016, the UK paid £13.1 billion into the EU budget, with the EU giving around £4.5 billion back to the UK in grants.
The Department of Finance said in a report earlier this year that Ireland will pay €2.7 billion into the EU budget this year, but has been asked to pay more to make up the deficit caused by Brexit (more on Ireland and the EU budgethere).
Office for National StatisticsOffice for National Statistics
A large chunk of the EU budget goes towards the agriculture sector, such as CAP payments for farmers – an industry that isn’t that pronounced in the UK, but from which Ireland and Northern Ireland benefit massively.
As part of the UK’s departure from the European Union, they will have to pay “a divorce bill” of between €39 and €44 billion, a price that’s been sharply criticised by Brexiteers, and which Dominic Raab said the UK wouldrefuse to payif they don’t get a trade deal.
The bones of Brexit
So now that we’re through all that – what is Brexit, and why has something like leaving the European Union become so complex?
Part of the reason is that the UK has been a part of the EU for so long, that many of its laws are EU laws, so they will have to make new UK versions when they leave (a lot of that work has already been done).
Another reason is that being an EU member state creates close ties to other countries in the form of business links, trade deals and economic activity, particularly as the UK hasn’t been explicit about what kind of trade deal it wants instead.
The UK has indicated that it wants to remain part of the single market, but wants to limit regulation on goods and restrict immigration. But the EU has said that it won’t split the four freedoms of the EU (that’s the free movement of goods, services, people and capital) just because the UK has decided to leave the EU.

The UK’s decision to leave the single market and customs union wouldn’t be as much of a problem if it wasn’t for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland; if a hard infrastructure were to go up because of different trade rules and regulations, it could threaten the hard-fought for peace in the North, which the UK, Ireland and the EU have promised to uphold as part of the Good Friday Agreement.
There are three elements that the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier put an emphasis on from the start – that’s the EU divorce bill budget (agreed), the guarantee of EU citizens’ rights in the UK and vice versa (mostly agreed, pending the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice); and securing peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland through avoiding a hard border (which hasn’t been agreed).
Related ReadsA Brexit timeline: How much time is actually left to strike a deal?
Barnier is angling for an ambitious free trade agreement, and an Irish backstop that would effectively mean a non-political custom-checks border along the Irish Sea, which he hopes would solve that problem.
But there is a lot of daylight between the two side’s stance on this issue – and even on what a ‘Plan B’ would look like.
The backstop
This is one of the most important parts of Brexit for Ireland. The backstop is an agreement between the EU and UK that if they can’t solve the Irish border issue, but can agree on all other Brexit problems, that the backstop will come into effect.
The backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay as part of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid a hard border.
The wording of thebackstop agreementwas decided on 19 March after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing with the DUP, who are averse to the North being treated differently than Great Britain in the context of Brexit.
Although there are already differences in social policies between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, unionists fear that if the EU were to treat the North as an exception for peace-keeping reasons, that it could eventually lead to a united Ireland.
European CommissionEuropean Commission
The DUP is supporting the Tories in government, and because of this hold a great deal of sway on the backstop issue. In a speech given in Belfast, Theresa May said that she could not agree to a border along the Irish Sea, casting doubt over how watertight the backstop agreement is.
If there’s no agreement on the backstop – as in if they can’t agree on “regulatory alignment” on the island of Ireland, meaning one set of rules in Ireland – then there is no Brexit deal and the UK will go crashing out of the EU.
What happens if there is no deal?
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney speaking outside Stormont House in Belfast.PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
Good question.
No one is really sure what happens if there is no deal at the end of negotiations and the UK go crashing out of the EU. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” as Theresa May has repeatedly said, meaning that the years of preparation for Brexit could count for nothing and the UK could leave without any relationship with the EU member states, Ireland included.
In this eventuality, a border would automatically go up on the island of Ireland – the EU has already said that it’s looked at the cost of setting up and manning a border in Ireland.
Experts say that this would lead to Troubles-era violence and an end to the peaceful era the North has enjoyed under the helm of a joint DUP-Sinn Féin government (until recently).
A final plan is scheduled in for a summit in October, where European politicians are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal. But without any progress on the Irish border issue they’re behind schedule already – prompting rumours that that vote could be pushed back to December, even January.
The UK is to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 – two years to the day since Article 50 was triggered. All bets are off as to what happens between then and now.

https://www.thejournal.ie/macron-may-4162320-Aug2018/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May heads to President Emmanuel Macron’s “summer Elysee Palace” on the Mediterranean coast, seeking to soften resistance to a Brexit plan which has upended her government while failing to win over sceptical EU negotiators.
She and Macron will hold an “informal” two-hour meeting at Bregancon, a 17th-century fort long favoured by French presidents as a summer retreat.
“The plan was to go to Bregancon, which is to be a summer residence but also a place for working, and since May was finishing her vacation in Italy we proposed hosting her here,” a source said.
May is going to lay out “London’s position on the Brexit talks and its future relations with the EU,” the source said. “It will be the occasion to clarify this proposal and discuss the political context.”
There will be no press statement afterwards, because “there is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Michel Barnier,” the EU’s designated Brexit negotiator, the source added.
Barnier yesterday wrotein a number of European newspapersabout the ongoing Brexit negotiations, saying that the EU is “ready to improve the text” of the backstop plan.
The backstop, which was a bone of contention, but ultimately agreed between the EU and UK last December, provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and the North if there was a hard Brexit and is a last resort option to avoid customs checks and a border.
Barnier said the text could be changed this in the context of speaking about trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland post Brexit.
“The biggest Brexit risk is on the island of Ireland. We must ensure that Brexit does not create a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland, is maintained,” Barnier wrote.
Today, trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland is within the EU’s common framework. As we will not know yet in the autumn of 2018, when finalising the withdrawal agreement, what will be the nature of the future relationship between the EU and the UK, we must foresee in the withdrawal agreement a solution of last resort, which can be improved later. The United Kingdom shares this view.The EU proposed that Northern Ireland remain in a common regulatory area with the rest of the EU for goods and customs. We are ready to improve the text of our proposal with the United Kingdom.
In addition to Barnier hinting that elements of the backstop could be changed, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters during the week that the Irish government could be “flexible” on the backstop.
Allies
The negotiations have heaped pressure on May to win allies on the continent after her “Chequers plan” prompted two top ministers to resign in protest last month.

The prime minister has just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s divorce from the EU — set for 29 March, 2019 — must be forged in principle ahead of a European summit in mid-October.
Barnier has already shot down May’s proposed solution to keeping the border between the UK and EU member Ireland open without a “hard border”.
Under May’s proposal a dual system of taxation would be introduced which would see taxes levied by each side of the Irish border for the benefit of the other.
Flexibility?

European leaders have steadfastly voiced support for Barnier, who wrote in a piece published in French and German newspapers Thursday that Britain and the EU “are 80 percent in agreement on an exit deal.”
“But 80% is not 100%,” he warned. “Let’s be frank, the United Kingdom, having decided to leave the single market, cannot be as economically close as the rest of the EU.”
France is seen as taking a particularly hard line in the Brexit negotiations, especially on financial services, with Paris already expecting to get about 3,500 new banking jobs as leading players move operations out of London.
Companies in other sectors have also warned they might move operations out of Britain, which could prove a boon for economies on the continent.
Barnier has maintained that any Brexit accord “must conform with the economic interests of the 27 remaining EU members, and the president has always supported this as well”, the source in Macron’s office said.
But Macron also wants to avoid a “messy divorce”, which Britain’s foreign minister Jeremy Hunt has warned will happen in case of a “no-deal exit”.
“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the Commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel,” Hunt said in a British press interview before visiting Paris and Vienna this week.
The British charm offensive continued Thursday, when Brexit minister Dominic Raab said he held “constructive” talks with France’s Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau in Paris, saying they had discussed “the progress of negotiations with Michel Barnier.”

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has said she would return to Brussels this week to continue negotiations over her country’s future relationship with the EU.
After a tumultuous week in which the draft divorce deal agreed between London and the European Union was slammed in parliament, May said the proposed deal would only be signed off if the future relationship deal was satisfactory.
May said the week ahead would be “critical” in the Brexit talks.
And while hardcore Brexiteers in May’s want her replaced, she said that as things stood, they did not have the numbers to trigger a no-confidence motion.
“I will be going back to Brussels,” May told Sophie Ridge on Sky News, adding that she would meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker.
“The focus this week will be on the future relationship.”

Asked about the backstop proposals, which would keep the UK under the rules of the EU’s customs union in the event that no deal is reached during the Brexit transition period, May denied the UK would be trapped by it.
“Actually, what we’re talking about is a backstop we don’t intend to use, the EU don’t want to use it either. It’s not the only option on the table, were it to have to be used, both sides can review it, in a process in which we can prove that other arrangements in place so the backstop can be stopped, and the backstop can only ever be temporary under the legal arrangements of the European Union,” May added.

May’s position is being made more difficult by the internal pressures within her party.
She could face a no-confidence vote if at least 48 MPs submit letters saying she has lost their support. More than 20 have publically said they have done so.
Asked if the 48 figure had been reached, May said: “As far as I know, no it has not.
“We’re not going to be distracted.”
“A change of leadership at this point isn’t going to make the negotiations any easier and it’s not going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.”
She said replacing her would bring in uncertainty, and would risk delaying the talks and postponing Britain’s EU departure date, set for 29 March.
A special EU council summit is to take place next Saturday 25 November to discuss the draft deal.

Even if it is approved by EU leaders, the draft deal faces a bigger hurdle when it is put to the UK parliament.
Four ministers resigned this week saying they could not support the deal and the DUP has also said it would not support it.
Also speaking on Sky News, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also said that his party would be voting against the deal.
Asked about whether he would support another referendum on Brexit, Corbyn said that it was “an option for the future but not an option for today”.

LEO VARADKAR HAS met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of his first visit to Berlin since being elected Taoiseach.
After their meeting, the pair held a joint press conference in the German capital at which the ongoing Brexit negotiations were the primary focus.
Ahead of the meeting, the Taoiseach’s department said discussions would focus on the agenda for this week’s meeting of the European Council which includes Brexit, trade and digital taxation.

Germany is Ireland’s second largest source of inward investment, third largest source of tourists, fourth largest overall trading partner, and fifth largest food export market.
Speaking ahead of his visit, Varadkar said: “I look forward to my first visit to Berlin as Taoiseach, and to congratulating the Chancellor on her re-election. We have a lot of work to do together, both bilaterally and within our shared European Union.”
The meeting also comes a day after the EU and the UK agreed that the so-called backstop for the Irish border, agreed in December, must be made legally binding.

The backstop optionwould mean alignmentbetween the north and south for customs, VAT, energy, regulations for the protection of the environment and laws governing agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also have to adhere to EU rules on State Aid and would be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in those aforementioned areas.
The backstop agreement wasknown as ‘Option C’with regard to the Northern Irish border – one of three options laid out in the Joint Report agreed by the UK and the EU in December.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-trade-4400916-Jan2019/,"
THE UK AND EU have been in the process of negotiating the terms in which Brexit will happen on 29 March.
The proposed deal (called the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement) is due to be voted on in the House of Commons in mid-January, and doesn’t look likely to pass.
But if we do get approval on this proposed Brexit deal – and that’s a massive if – what trading agreements can the UK expect to ask for, and get?
The Norway option
Energy-rich Norway opted against EU membership in 1994 and instead chose to join the European Economic Area (EEA), enjoying all the benefits of the EU’s single market without having a say in the rules that shape it.
As a member of the EEA, which includes all EU countries as well as Iceland and Liechtenstein, Norway must allow the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons with its fellow members.
These are the EU’s four fundamental freedoms as set out in the Treaty of Rome, the cherished accomplishment of Europe’s drive towards peace and unity after World War II.
EEA members must accept EU rules in many important sectors, including competition, consumer protection and the environment, with rules updated automatically in line with EU legislation.
The big advantage for Britain in the Norway model is that its financial hub in London would remain undisturbed. By remaining in the single market, the City of London would keep its unfettered access to Europe and remain the launching point for US and Asian banks into the EU.
But Norway, with just 5.2 million people, is a far smaller player than Britain, and its model of ties with the EU is a no-go for Brexiteers.
Fuelled by anti-immigration sentiment, Britain’s vote to ditch the EU seemed to be a rejection in particular of freedom of movement, making the Norway option untenable as long as Theresa May’s conservative, pro-Brexit government remains in power.
The Single Market is based on four freedoms: the free movement of goods, services, people and capital. The EU has repeatedly said that it would not separate these four freedoms, meaning the UK would have to choose between limiting the free movement of people and protecting London’s thriving financial sector.
Staying in the single market would be challenging for a pro-EU government in Britain given the loss of sovereignty involved.
The pro-Brexit camp also rejects any involvement of the EU’s European Court of Justice, which holds the ultimate authority over the EEA.

Canada ‘plus plus plus’
Barring the close alignment of the single market, Britain is keen to strike a trade deal even more ambitious than the EU’s recent accord with Canada, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta).
That treaty is considered a blueprint for the EU’s trade deals going forward and was a model for the most recent talks with Japan.
UK Brexit negotiator David Davis has called for a “Canada plus plus plus” while Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel advocated the same, albeit with only two pluses.
Unlike classic trade deals of old, the Ceta pact touches on all aspects of the economy, including health and safety norms, and not just the usual cuts to tariffs and import quotas.
Both parties negotiate, sector by sector, an agreed level of regulatory cooperation, with London especially keen for closely aligned norms for finance, aviation and autos.
While they are ambitious for far-off Canada or Japan, an EU-UK trade deal would in fact mean a significant distancing between the UK and Europe, which are now perfectly aligned with zero tariffs.
In a Brexit twist, the trade talks would decide where to impose barriers and division – known in trade parlance as divergence – instead of the usual practice of trying to remove them – known as convergence.
These future trade barriers, which may require customs checks, pose a daunting problem with regards to EU-member Ireland, which insists on maintaining a frictionless border with the UK’s Northern Ireland – and has the backing of Brussels to defend this point.
But some have seen a back door to a possible “soft Brexit” through a provision in last week’s Brexit divorce deal which says that if London fails to come up with a better idea, there should be “alignment” between Britain and Ireland.
WTO rules
If neither of the above options prevails, Britain will inevitably revert to “third country” status in the eyes of the EU, with trade relations administered according to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
The EU’s default position at the WTO involves tariffs and increased barriers that could cripple the seamless supply chains that connect Britain and the EU.
While the EU’s average tariff rate for third countries is low – around 1.5% – they are bigger in certain strategic sectors: for cars, the rate is 10%.
Moreover, under WTO rules, also known as “hard Brexit”, it is unlikely that British products could enter the EU without further checks at the border.
The situation would grow worse as regulatory differences widened over time – a prospect Ireland would surely refuse.
Researchers at the London School of Economics predict that the “WTO rules” scenario is underestimated by hard Brexit proponents and would slash Britain’s trade with the EU by a catastrophic 40% over ten years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rosslare-port-brexit-4125799-Jul2018/,"THE GOVERNMENT IS exploring the possibilities of expanding operations at Rosslare Port to take advantage of opportunities that could be created by Brexit.
This week, Labour leader and Wexford TD Brendan Howlincalled for Rosslare Portto be upgraded to a Tier One port to prepare for new trade and transport developments.
“Rosslare Europort is particularly well-placed for development, as it is the nearest port to continental Europe and therefore strategically important,” he told the Dáil.
He said that Dublin Port was “hugely focused on shipping to Britain” and if we wanted to shift “even a fraction of this trade to continental Europe”, then we should develop the port nearest there.
He said shifting trade and transport activities to Rosslare would also benefit the environment by reducing carbon emissions.
In response to queries from Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin on the same topic, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross told the Dáil on Thursday that the status of the port and its development was reviewed recently.
He said that a consultant’s report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority “would be extremely difficult given the Port’s complex legal structure”.
“Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.”
Rosslare Europort is unusual in that it’s not a stand-alone commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts, but is instead operates as a division of Iarnród Éireann.
The harbour has four berths, and is mostly built on land reclaimed from the sea.

Rosslare is the second most strategically important seaport in the State after Dublin, and  handles more unitised freight than all other seaports in the State, excluding Dublin, put together.
Unitised freight is important because all of the high added-value exports on which Ireland’s economic recovery depends are exported as unitised freight.
An assessment of the market interest commissioned by Iarnród Éireann found that sentiment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port – but it did identify possible issues due to the “complicated” legislative basis of the port.
As a result of those concerns, Ross’ Department sought advice from the Attorney General. He also identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal which the Department is still considering.
Iarnród Éireann has also completed a commercial review of Rosslare Europort and will now prepare a business plan which will include the implications of Brexit for the port.
It’s unclear what exact trade arrangement there will be between the EU and the UK.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister Theresa May published a White Paper that outlines the UK’s proposal for its future relationship with the EU.
Among the proposals, it suggests establishing a free trade area for goods between the EU and the UK, which in theory would avoid a hard border. This would mean that the UK would have to accept all EU regulations on goods, however, as the EU’s chief negotiator has said that ”there is no justification for us to unravel what we are because the UK is leaving”.
The UK White Paper also suggested limiting free movement of people: giving preferential treatment to those who are skilled workers, or EU citizens.
RTÉ News has reported that the EU has warned its member states to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit. In this event, it would mean a hard border would automatically go up on the island of Ireland. The EU had previouslyexplored how much a border could cost, but won’t share figures on it for fear of entertaining a ‘no-deal’ scenario.
In other Brexit preparations, the Irish Maritime Development Office is also examining the volume of traffic over the UK landbridge, and the potential consequences that Brexit will have on Irish importers and exporters.

THE UK’S BREXIT negotiator David Davis has said that the Irish border problem could be solved by technology.
On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, it was put to Davis that it’s impossible to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if there isn’t an amicable deal struck between the UK and the European Union.
His reply was: ”There is a risk in trying to focus just on the downsides.
He was told that there’s no border solution in history that would work, and replied:
His comments come after aUK-EU agreement on guidelinesthat will govern negotiations on future relations and trade links with Britain after Brexit, which has been described as a “decisive step” in negotiations.
In the aftermath of that deal being struck, Davis stated that the UK government “remains steadfast” in its commitment to avoiding a hard Irish border after Brexit.

On the Andrew Marr Show, Davis said that the UK and EU have agreed “to find an Option C – that is the backstop”.
In December last year, a “regulatory alignment” deal was struck that said in the event of no deal aimed to ensure there would be no return of an Irish border on the island of Ireland.
Speaking on The Week In Politics, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that since the backstop provision, “there had been no engagement between the UK and the EU” on the agreement.
She added that the aim was to completely legally translate the document by June.
McEntee said that work was being done to look at the future relationship with the UK post-Brexit, including industries such as the environment, agriculture and fisheries.
“[We're looking at the] key issues that might arise with the UK, that work is continuing, we’re now talking about what that relationship will look like.”
Sinn Fein spokesperson for Brexit David Cullinane welcomed Davis’ remarks that a border solution will be found, but questioned the legitimacy of the Brexit deals that have been made thus far.
“By the time October comes around the Irish government will be under enormous pressure to accept whatever agreement is put on the table.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-leader-backstop-border-brexit-4422262-Jan2019/,"THE DUP DEPUTY leader Nigel Dodds has said that his party’s opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement remain just days before UK politicians are to vote on whether to keep or reject the deal.
Dodds had met with Prime Minister Theresa May for lunch at 10 Downing Street today along with DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson and MEP Diane Dodds.
After the meeting, Doddssaid:
“With this clarity emerging in London, Dublin and Brussels, there is evidently no need for the aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement which have been so vigorously opposed by a broad cross section of the House of Commons.”
Although neither the UK nor the EU want to erect a border on the island of Ireland, if there are different customs or regulatory rules between the two jurisdictions, the EU said some checks would be necessary, citing documentation for the transportation of live animals and animal produce as one example.
Despite this declaration from the EU, the Irish government has said that it has made no preparations to erect a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The House of Commons vote
The UK parliament is due to vote on the Brexit deal agreed between the EU and UK negotiating teams in the final months of last year on the week beginning on14 January.
There are a number of problems that MPs in favour of Brexit have with the deal, but most revolve around the backstop that’s been agreed.
Advertisement
The current provisions allow for a UK-wide customs arrangement, which would ensure that there would be no border (ie, customs checks) between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This would however, limit the UK’s abilities to strike up new trade deals with non-EU countries after they leave.
The other problem Brexiteers have with the backstop is that it isn’t time-limited, meaning that if the EU and UK cannot strike up a free trade deal at the end of the next phase of negotiations (assuming they get that far) then the UK will be locked into what they assumed was a temporary arrangement in the form of the Irish backstop.
Today, Dodds said of the backstop:
“Contrary to the pro-EU spin, the backstop is not the best of both worlds. It is potentially indefinite in time, would place a barrier between us and our main trading partner in Great Britain, and gives enormous leverage to the European Union in the negotiations on the future relationship with the United Kingdom.”
Dodds added that having “a new east-west barrier should be no more palatable than having any new north-south barriers”.
Today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar clarified that the UK negotiating team had pushed for the UK-wide customs arrangement, and that the EU were happy to accept a Northern Ireland-specific backstop.
Theresa May needs 320 MPs to vote for her Brexit deal at some point before the 29 January, in order that it can be subsequently ratified by the EU in time for an exit by the 29 March.
If the deal is rejected, as it is likely to be without the support of a large number of Tory MPs or the DUP, it’s unclear what will happen next. An amendment passed by ‘Remainer’ Dominic Grieve gives power back to the House of Commons in the event that the deal is rejected.
But what those options would be are limited. The UK must leave the EU by 29 March, although there technically could be an extension of the Article 50 timeline, the EU would only do this if there is a reasonable expectation that there would be a resolution. The European elections scheduled for April this year also put a time pressure on things.
Secondly, the EU and UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that there will be no renegotiations, and that the only deal is the deal that is due to go before the House of Commons in 10 days time.
Based on that, a no-deal Brexit is looking increasingly likely.

JUNIOR HEALTH MINISTER Stephen Barclay has been appointed as the new Brexit secretary, according to Downing Street.
Barclay replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned yesterday morning over British Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement for Brexit.
“The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Stephen Barclay MP to be Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union,” Downing Street tweeted.
The former insurance lawyer becomes the third person to hold the job overseeing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, after his two predecessors both resigned in protest at May’s approach to Brexit.
The announcement comes alongside the appointment of Amber Rudd as the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

Michael Gove
Earlier today, cabinet minister Michael Gove – a prominent Leave campaigner within May’s cabinet – confirmed his support for May, after it was previously speculated that he was set to resign.
Speaking to reporters outside his departmental office today, Gove was asked if he had confidence in the Prime Minister and replied: “I absolutely do.”
He added: “I am also looking forward to continuing to work with all my government colleagues and all my colleagues in Parliament in order to make sure that we get the best future for Britain.”
The British leader faces further unrest over her draft Brexit deal today following a string of resignations yesterday, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, as noted above.
The draft withdrawal agreement, which was announced on Wednesday, sets out the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU and runs to over 585 pages.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has welcomed the draft Brexit deal, which includes avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.
PM May said yesterday evening that she believed with “every fibre of my being” in the Brexit course she had set, hours after facing a hostile parliament and seeing four ministers quit her government.
Members of parliament on all sides have warned May there was no way the plan could win their approval, but she dismissed calls to quit, saying: “Am I going to see this through? Yes!”

‘No confidence’
May now faces a motion of no confidence over her proposed draft deal with the EU.
Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Brexit hardline European Research Group, submitted a letter of no-confidence in the Prime Minister yesterday saying: “It would be in the interest of the party and the country if she were to stand aside.”
At least 48 letters from Conservative MPs are required to trigger a vote of no-confidence in the party leader, but a majority of the party’s 315 lawmakers would have to vote against May in order for her to be ousted.
Meanwhile, the DUP has said that it will review its confidence and supply agreement with May’s conservative government if her plan is approved by parliament and that it will not support May’s plan.
Deputy party leader Nigel Dodds said yesterday that “the choice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom – the whole United Kingdom and the integrity of the United Kingdom – or we vote for a vassal state, with the break-up of the United Kingdom.”
May said this morning that she recognises that there are concerns over the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement within her deal. “I have some of those concerns myself,” she said.
Irish border
The Prime Minister also admitted that Northern Ireland will have “some regulations” different from the rest of the UK.
Speaking this evening, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Ireland will still seek to avoid infrastructure on the border of the island of Ireland.
He said if Ireland is forced into a situation of a no deal scenario, the government will have to look at ways in which border infrastructure can be avoided.

“It is a far more sensible approach to support what is being negotiated over the last two years as a way that we know provides the guarantees that we have looked for and insisted on, that there will be no physical border infrastructure or related checks or controls on this island,” Coveney said.
He added that he does not believe there is a better deal on offer, but that the Irish government is preparing for a no deal scenario, something he said they can’t do on their own.
“A no deal involves a lot of planning with the European Union as well because in a lot of areas it is the EU that has the competence to be able to make decisions, when it comes to trade, when it comes to aviation, when it comes to fisheries, when it comes to agriculture … all of these areas require EU collective decision making in terms of how we plan for a no deal scenario,” he said.

Meanwhile, on the DUP, May denied any “testy exchange” with the party and said that “we’re still working with the DUP.”
Earlier today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he doesn’t believe there is time for the draft withdrawal agreement to be negotiated before Brexit.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Varadkar acknowledged that May faced a challenge getting the deal through the House of Commons, but suggested that any further negotiations could lead Britain’s departure from the EU to be postponed.
“Looking at things today, it looks like it’s going to be very difficult to win the vote in the House of Commons,” Varadkar said.
“But as reality kicks in and the precipice approaches, I think you may find more and more people becoming willing to support this deal as the best possible outcome.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/soldiering-against-subversion-book-defence-forces-troubles-4262663-Oct2018/,"IN THE LATE 1960s, Irish infantry soldiers from the Defence Forces were drafted in to help with the Troubles. Along with the gardaí, they helped police the border with the republic, and took up roles in places like Portlaoise Prison.
But is the role they played recognised? No, says one former soldier, who has written a book telling the story of what the soldiers went through. Dan Harvey’s book Soldiering Against Subversion: The Irish Defence Forces and Internal Security During the Troubles, 1969 – 1998, looks at an intense time for soldiers, and comes out as the 50th anniversary of the Troubles approaches.
“I knew what it was that soldiers did during the Troubles – the serving and sacrifice they put in,” says Harvey. “They and their families: long periods away from home, poor pay and conditions, and the danger. And it had never been recognised, and the army is a conservative traditional institution, it doesn’t like to talk about itself.”
“However, I was so proud of what the Defence Forces did, what they did was meaningful, it had purpose and it was important, and yet it seemed to be sliding away.”
Harvey says there was an attitude that once “the Troubles… were over were probably best forgotten, only along with them has been what the Defence Forces did”.
He describes “a certain kind of national amnesia when you mention the Troubles”, with people forgetting about how they didn’t just affect the north. He lists off the Dublin Monaghan bombings, the Don Tidey kidnapping, or the riot called the Battle of Ballsbridge.
He wrote the book to make sure people don’t forget what happened, but he also wrote it for those like his three daughters, who are all in their twenties and who didn’t live through the Troubles. To help him, he talked to men who served during the Troubles, meaning the book contains many first-person descriptions of the work they did.
Originally from Blackrock in Cork, Harvey served in the military college, army HQ, and for the most part in the Southern Brigade, describing his roles as “many and varied and often overlapping”.
Border troubles
Harvey sees many parallels between 1969, when the first Irish infantry troops were sent to the north after major riots broke out, and the potential of a hard border after Brexit.
“We were underprepared in 69, we are unprepared now as well. Defence Force numbers are down, specialists are going, border posts are sold,” he says. “The general officer in command of second brigade here in Dublin has responsibility for Donegal. 30% of the Defence Forces are on income supplement support. We’ve had eight reorganisations in the last 23 years and the 2012 one was a disaster. So they were based if you like on money reasons and political reasons, not operational reasons. So we are unprepared.”
He also points out that the border was a target during the Troubles. “If something goes up, a camera, a customs post, is that going to be a target, is someone going to have to defend it, is someone then going to have reprisals on the people who made it a target,” he says of Brexit.
“When I think of the border, I think of the many patrols on border lanes, along the border, long days, longer nights,” he says.
But he says this huge effort was “largely unseen”.
But that was a policy. So because it was unseen it was unappreciated, but it was absolutely crucial.”

What was it like manning the border? To illustrate, Harvey pretends that I am an Irish army officer at one side of the border – the table we are sitting at – and he is my british counterpart on the other side.
“You and I cannot exchange words. Standing next to you is a guard, standing next to me is a member of the RUC. So it’s relayed that way,” he says. “We were acting in aid to the civil power, the British army were acting with the RUC. But we would not want to be seen to be talking directly with the British army – we did not want to be seen to be in cahoots with them. That was a policy, and it was a policy that was implemented.”
There was coordination, and some of what were known as “straddle operations” where the sides would cooperate militarily.
In his book, Harvey dedicates an entire chapter to the British Army’s blunders in the North.
“There were some progressive blunders in hindsight that were bound to lead to their alienation and they lost the relationship,” he says. “When they arrived in first, bands went to schools, there was football played against the locals, and little by little that was lost. They had it. Sometimes it takes years to build that trust, and that’s why it was such it had to be put into the book because you had to be able to explain to situation, the bad situation got worse.”
They were “raw brutal times”, he says. “It was very serious times and they were grim times, they were raw and brutal times. Now the role that we had was important, was purposeful and it was meaningful, so there were a lot of very good people in the Defence Forces who gave of themselves at a time when pay and conditions were very poor.”
“But they were good people, good people were attracted into it because of the times that were in it. I don’t know that the government is necessarily doing anything to attract people into the DF now. So we had people who gave a lot of themselves and they were high calibre, I was glad they were on my side.”
There is currently a major push for Defence Forces membres to have improved pay and conditions. This was also an issue during the Troubles. “The guards got overtime, prison service got overtime, cash in transit people were well paid and yet those three agencies would look to the army to support them in a crux and we were nowhere near paid as much as them, Those are just facts.”

He describes the Defence Forces as “the last stop”: “Who defends democracy because democracy won’t defend itself? So it’s the army ultimately defends democracy, it’s the army ultimately looks after the institutions of the State and the rule of law.”
He points out that 20 years ago, soldiers’ wives were protesting outside barracks, while the Gleeson committee also looked into the issues of Defence Forces pay.
“And did we ever think we’d be back in the situation 30% on income support? What is happening that this is the situation?”
It took two years to write the book, and he says he was “exhausted” after it. Now, he’s living in Paris and working on Irish people’s role in the D-Day landings.
”I am glad that it’s out there and it can be referred to and that those who lived and worked through those times, those that know say it’s an accurate reflection of their experience,” he says.
“These books – probably in 50 or 100 years’ time people will say ‘well thank God someone grabbed it while they still could’.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-ian-marshall-3983090-Apr2018/,"AN ANTI-BREXIT unionist nominated by Leo Varadkar has been elected to the Seanad with the help of Sinn Féin.
Ian Marshall won one of two vacant posts in the Seanad with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald among those to offer congratulations to the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union.
Former Fine Gael TD Anthony Lawlor was also elected to the Seanad with the Kildare politician also seemingly benefiting from the support of Sinn Féin.
Ulster farmer Marshall’s election to the Seanad follows a push from Varadkar who has stated a desire tohave candidates from Northern Irelandenter the Seanad.
Speakingto RTÉ News, Marshall said that other unionists have been supportive of his decision to enter the Seanad.
Marshall will serve in the Seanad as an Independent member but was photographed with McDonald and Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly not long after his election.

Sinn Féin Senator Rose Conway-Walsh said she welcomed her party’s decision to formally support Marshall in the Seanad by-election.
“Dealing with the potential impact of Brexit continues to be a priority for us as a party. Ian has shown that he shares our concerns and strives to work for solutions to address those concerns right across the island,” she said.
Meanwhile Anthony Lawlor, the other new member of the Seanad, said that it was an honour to join the upper house.
“I wish to thank the Fine Gael party for selecting me and for their support. I am grateful to the Seanad electorate for bestowing this honour upon me, and I would like to say thank you for the cross party support I received,” he said.
Lawlor beatFianna Fáil’s Niall Blaney to the vacant poston the Seanad’s Agricultural Panel.
Sinn Féin members were not directed to support Lawlor as they were in the case of Marshall, but the election of the Fine Gael candidate suggests they supported him over Fianna Fáil’s Donegal-based Blaney.

https://www.thejournal.ie/channel-4-televised-brexit-debate-4379985-Dec2018/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Dec 2018

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has sought to woo MPs with a promise of more power over the next stage of Brexit as she fought to save her EU withdrawal deal ahead of a crucial parliamentary vote next week.
May said lawmakers could have a greater say over an arrangement to avoid border checks with Ireland that could see Britain tied to EU rules for years after it leaves the bloc in March.
The so-called backstop is the key reason many of her own Conservative MPs and her Northern Irish allies opposed the divorce deal, putting her on course for defeat in the 11 December vote.
“People are concerned about the role of the UK in making these decisions. And the obvious, in terms of the UK, is for it to be parliament that makes these decisions,” May told BBC Radio 4.
She went on to say that parliament could decide whether to extend a transition period of apply the backstop arrangement specified in the draft deal agreed with the European Union.
Ministers admit the deal struck with Brussels last month is not perfect but say it is the only option for an orderly Brexit after four decades of membership.
Civil servants on Thursday briefed senior MPs and ministers on plans for a “no deal scenario”, which some commentators suggested would focus minds on the implications of rejecting the agreement.
But the scale of the threatened defeat has left some speculating whether May could postpone the vote.
Senior Conservative MP Graham Brady, said he would welcome deferring the vote if it meant clarifying the issue of the backstop.
Former prime minister Tony Blair told reporters at an event in parliament: “Personally I don’t see what the point is of going down with a huge defeat.”
He said May must work with MPs to establish a way forward that they can all live with, and if not, return the issue to a national vote.
Channel 4 debate
Meanwhile, ‘The Real Brexit Debate’ will take place on Sunday 9 December at 7pm on Channel 4, and will be a live, hour-long programme that will see four high-profile politicians argue about Brexit.
The guests will argue about four different issues dividing the House of Commons: the Withdrawal Agreement, a softer Brexit, a harder Brexit and whether the UK should remain in the EU.
The format of the debate will see each panellist give an overview of their position followed by the debate, and a summary from each to close.
It will be chaired by Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy before a selected audience of 100 people who hold diverse opinions on Brexit.
The announcement comes two days after the BBC cancelled another debate between Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after Labour objected to the format.
Channel 4′s director of programmes Ian Katz said that it was a “great shame” that the two leaders refused to take part in a televised debate that reflects all positions on the issue.
The House of Commons will vote on May’s withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, 11 December.

Vote on the future
In Brussels, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the deal was “the only and best agreement possible”.
“Now is the moment for everyone to take their responsibilities,” he told a committee of regional representatives.
“The British lawmakers will vote on this text and on the future relation in the next few days. It is a vote on which the future of their country depends.”
Opening the third of five days of debate on the deal, finance minister Philip Hammond also said it was “a delusion” to believe another deal could be negotiated.
But with more MPs declaring by the day they will oppose the agreement, May faces an uphill task getting it passed — and failure could also spell the end to her own premiership.
She commands only a slim majority in the House of Commons thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but the DUP is fiercely opposed to her plan.
The opposition Labour Party has said it could propose a confidence vote if May loses next week.
However, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that if that happened, he would back her.
“Having achieved our aim trying to get to a better deal, it would be illogical then to turn around the next day and say ‘let’s vote the government out’,” he told ITV.
“I think then we start on a process to try to get a better deal.”
May will return to Brussels for an EU summit next Thursday, although the bloc says it considers the divorce deal closed.
‘Just not possible’
The backstop is an arrangement intended to avoid border checks between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland by keeping both in a customs arrangement after Brexit.
It would only come into effect if London and Brussels fail to agree a new trading relationship by the end of a post-Brexit transition period, in December 2020.
But official government legal advice says the backstop could see Britain left indefinitely in the new customs arrangement, with no power to unilaterally withdraw.
Under May’s deal, if the new trade deal is not ready in June 2020, Britain will have an option to extend the transition for up to two years to avoid going into the backstop.
May has suggested parliament make that choice, but former foreign minister and leading Brexit supporter Boris Johnson rejected that idea.
“This is simply not possible,” he tweeted.
“Under her deal, the EU has the legal right to stop us extending the transition and make us enter the backstop — whatever the PM or parliament says.”
