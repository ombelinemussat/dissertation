They were misled by the Leave campaigners… primarily on the false premise of saving £350m per week that they were told would be spent on NHS improvements. It has since been shown (according to what I’ve read) that is completely wrong and the net saving would be about £128m/week.
But the UK also receives billions of EU money annually – for Nth Ireland in support of the GFA, for most of its farmers, for poorer areas like Cornwall, south Wales and most of Scotland, and for its excellent science research projects that beneficially far outweighs the meagre saving of £128m/week. They will lose all those benefits.
Significant parts of the UK – Nth Ireland, West Wales, Scotland and most notably London and the greater London area, voted to remain. In fact, such was the overwhelming Remain vote in the London area that it was even mooted that London could leave the UK and establish a Republic of London enclave within the UK that would remain part of the EU. Its population is about 9m, over twice that of the Irish Republic and the idea of a Rep of London remaining in the EU is not to be sniffed at. There are too many global businesses based in London who would leave the city to remain part of the EU that it would seriously impact the overall UK economy.
Scotland voted to Remain and it wishes to further establish its independence outside the UK and remain part of the EU. Nth Ireland voted to Remain part of the EU. If only its die-hard Unionists would cop on to the fact that there is no threat to themselves within a united Ireland under the Irish Constitution and live happily alongside us all, it would make such a big difference to the desire of the majority of Nth Ireland voters to remain in the EU. They really should not worry – after all, there are so many British citizens happily living, working and running businesses in West Cork that Corkonians jokingly refer to West Cork as the new Republic of England.
The people who carried the UK’s Leave vote were staunch hinterland Englanders who still believe in the notion of a now-defunct British Empire, not really in tune with today’s realities, and those worried by the influx of Muslims, Pakistanis, Indians, East Euorpeans, Carribean people and people of the African Continent who were part of the old British Empire who they see as eroding native British culture (a fair point… we see it here in Ireland too).
Now that the real impact and consequences of leaving the EU are becoming more apparent, of course the UK people should be given a chance to vote again.
The real truth is that ‘Engerlanders’ will become isolated from not just the European Community but more so from the global community. Stark reality, stark fact.","Jan 18th 2018, 9:07 PM"

Corbyn was the leader closest to the sentiments of the electorate – he reflected the complexities and ambiguities of a referendum called by the Conservative Party to settle a long-standing party rift. He’s going to be the next UK Prime minister, bit of diplomacy wouldn’t go a miss.
Richmond showing his distaste for democracy here – only those agreeing with his position are ‘sensible’, while anybody with a differing opinion should be made vote again as their position clearly not worthy of those ‘sensible’ types (who created the mess in the first place) like Mr Hammond.
The contempt for democracy these groups have is staggering, irrespective of where one stands on the rights and wrongs of Brexit – It was a democratic exercise and therefore to maintain any respect for the Institutions of State, the result has to be accepted. Another referendum now would only massively increase support for the far-right and would play into the hands of Mr Farage and his friends in the hard-right media.

It’s beyond ludicrous and really an absolute contortion of logic to try to turn the UK unilaterally leaving the EU into the NI border somehow being the EU’s fault.
The British and Irish states had a customs border from 1923 to 1993, when the single market was completed to a level that removed intra EU customs entirely.
It was that change that made the border finally disappear entirely and with the improved security situation in the 1990s it vanished entirely as it was irrelevant.
The CTA never covered movement of goods and services and if that’s what we’re falling back to, we will see a NI border that looks as it did before 1993, just without the active security issues.
People are misremembering (I suspect quite deliberately) how things worked between Ireland and the UK pre-EU and before the Single European Market. There was no UK-Irish customs union and you got stopped at the border with your shopping.
I suspect that the aim in the Brexit camp will be to attempt to blame the EU for Northern Ireland’s situation and divert attention from the fact that it’s being caused by UK isolationist politics.
Northern Ireland is probably the best example of how the EU allows borders not to matter and created an environment where a conflict about national identity and sovereignty could be cooled, calmed and a way of coexisting became more possible.
Brexit is just a return to old-school nationalism and with that comes borders!","Aug 31st 2017, 5:56 PM"

The island of Britain has no problem incorporating the fact that a large swathe of British people have Irish heritage and that our islands have strong links of culture, family & history good & bad. Perhaps, this is why under British law the Irish are not deemed as foreigners and even since independence have had de facto citizenship in Britain. There is a tendency amongst many Irish nationalists to constantly view our relationship with Britain through the prism of conflict. This will have to change if there is ever to be a united Ireland that can accompany unionists.

Staying is beneficial and, on the contrary, Leaving is not.
This means compensation for Ireland’s loss of trade with the UK , bolstering capital works in the South in lieu of a Hard Border and giving Irish workers better access to
EU labour markets.
The completion of the Motorways program would be a good start. Just try to drive from Killarney to Cavan Town for example. Its a long meander up the middle of the country on poor roads or travelling another 100 klms by going via the M7-M50-M3; not what you’d call a direct route with a slither of tolls to add expense to inconvenience.
A new motorway from Nenagh to Monaghan Town via Athlone , Longford & Cavan
is badly needed to open up the centre of Ireland and prevent through-traffic converging
on either Dublin or Galway Cities.
This would send a clear message to the people of Ireland that Brussels is here to help us and not to palaver & do nothing.
The big issue for the EU is to demonstrate, post Brexit, that it is better being in the EU than outside it. If Irish Economy does not outgun the British Economy post Brexit, then
there will be a strong case for us to exit too.
We have to remember that the UK Government was the first to come to our aid during
the GFC with a loan of 3 billion Stirling and all the EU could do is stitch us up with
Troika loans that robbed us of our Sovereignty, imposed property & water taxes and
impoverished Ireland’s working class for a decade.
We have to be realistic here and put the hard word on the EU:
Show us the money & stop farting around. We dont need deniable winks & nods from the
EU like what we got in 2008 when we stupidly bailed out the Banks just because we wanted to be good little EUers and avert a EZ systemic Banking collapse.

The cowardly Irish establishment and its mouthpieces has been always afraid of independence, hence the kowtowing to London, Rome and then Brussels.
Britain will have some economic changes to make but will do fine. In any event as another commentator said here, the Brexit vote wasn’t just about economics. It attracted support from all ages and cohorts, the prime concern being sovereignity and democracy.
As the EU project continues to morph into a political superstate, Brussels will seize even more control through the imminent Common Consolidated Tax Base and through taking control of further areas such as defence and common policy.
Eunionists further ignore the fact that the quantitive easing the ECB has been engaged in must stop soon and will have huge ramifications for economic growth.
Eunionists further ignore the political drift to the right in Europe which does not bode well for what workers rights remain in Europe. The EU will become a vehicle for consolidated global corporate neo liberalism as its recent attempts to force TTIP through showed.
Irish eunionists, because of a lack of maturity, only view Brexit as a prism to attack the Brits. Childish and insecure.

It’s not ‘scaremongering’ to point out issues that are actually happening now. So much of the UK’s export is tariff free because they’re in the EU, they’ll have to pay these tariffs when they leave, so many heads of industries are begging to be given exemptions from Brexit, citing tariffs, saying they’ll have to make huge layoffs.
So much support to leave but no benefits to claim. It was an emotional vote, not one made off of facts, Johnson actively lied throughout the campaign, why do leave voters still support them? They almost don’t seem to realise that they are the ones who will suffer. What about Irish agri exports too? Now that the pound is faltering, that’ll only make Irish produce more expensive.
So much regulations that they were used to will have to be re-planned over again, costing untold money. Imagine I had a whole new set of laws and regulations around finance at my work, it’d be half my experience gone, made irrelevant, you’d have to do your Bachelors and Masters again. Forget all the foreign investment that’s there in the UK BECAUSE of the EU, their contracts would be broken cos of regulation changes, meaning they’d be better off moving or not investing full stop. Who would advise to invest in a market with no stability or clear regulation? Nightmare stuff.
But hey, I must be ‘scaremongering’ to people with no credentials on economics or cross border trade.

Poorer countries like Spain and Ireland and all the rest have massively benefited from UK largesse. And like Ireland has had its fishing waters raped by the Spanish in particular plus the rest. Mass immigration from Eastern Europe has kept wages and job opportunities low for years now. Blair gave away the rebate of billions for a overhaul of the CAP. They took the money and reneged on the deal. Cameron went to Brussels asking for pretty reasonable concessions to try to stop a referendum and was sent back with zilch.

As for this ‘superstate’, this idea is entertained by europhiles like Martin Schulz, but I see this as a professional deformity – in his case due to having been head of the EU parliament. Federalism doesn’t have the necessary traction among sufficient numbers of voters in member states, quite the contrary. But not wanting federalism is not the same as wanting to leave the EU.
Taking the case of Ireland: I think more Irish people see benefits of the EU than drawbacks. What on earth would Ireland do on its own. And importantly, I think many people realize that leaving the EU in the light of Brexit would effectively turn Ireland into a vassal state of the UK. I doubt this would be a very popular idea.

When that was fixed, my rosy view was the Irish and the Northern Irish together holding the door open to the rest of the UK. They’d be staying in the customs union and the single market in all but name, thanks to this magical notion of ‘alignment’.
But now it seems as if the EU has felt compelled to satisfy the hard Brexiteers, by allowing the notion of ‘alignment’ to be effectively filled in via a free trade deal. Which means that the Good Friday Agreement becomes a bargaining chip in order for Britain to get not only access to Ireland, but by extension to the entire EU.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but if a peace deal can be allowed to collapse to a trade issue, then I’m getting the feeling that Leo and Simon have allowed themselves and the rest of us to be shafted.","Dec 16th 2017, 8:04 AM"

Unless British politicians emerge who can fight the notion of Brexit, they will become more and more comfortable in their notions that it will be a success rather than the failure which is in front of them due to poor political calculations.
The academics in the 19th century were running out of road as the clockwork solar system of Newton was so limited that genuine researchers couldn’t move on to more expansive approaches without being dragged back by theoretical diehards who did not want their convictions disturbed. The point here is that entrenched views are not found among the wider population but at the level of academics and politicians and they would rather develop contradictory positions and language than deal with the core issues.

The outcome for Britain has to be that there will be no deal, so a hard Brexit and a hard border are certainties. The Tories will have their “Take it or Leave it” parliament debate which will pass, so Britain will leave not as a friend and long time ally, but as an isolated former colonial power whose influence in the world will have shrunk dramatically. And the biggest irony is that the main reason they left was immigration, and their biggest problem with immigration is not coming from the EU but their former colonies.

For a party to claim themselves to be abstentionist means that they walk away from all forms of democracy unless it suits them, hardly a stand worth voting for in my honest opinion.

If voters haven’t actually changed their mind then the result will be unchanged.
The original referendum was run in an environment of misinformation (maybe on both sides) and appealed to emotions rather than hard practicalities.
As the actual implications of Brexit become clearer it seems perfectly fair, appropriate and democratic to ask the people if this is really what they want.","Aug 3rd 2017, 10:52 AM"

Offer them a five year transition period, during which they remain in the market and we sort out the border = business & locals happyish – Brexiters assured of a structured exit, better for everyone’s economy
If they don’t agree by the end of the year they default to Hard Brexit in 2019 and that decision is made end December 2017. We will all have time to prepare properly, Brexiters get what they want now, we can start the 8 or 9 year process required to complete the trade deal earlier.

face it, that would suit Ireland fine.
As a risk management strategy, however, in case of a hard Brexit, Ireland should be seriously diversifying trade away from UK dependance and I’m glad to see that Kerry Gold is leading the charge.
My local supermarket down here in Aus has just started to stock Kerry Gold butter and to celebrate, we’ve dug a bucket of our garden spuds , boiled some and had a bowl with butter and a sprinkle of salt in remembrance of Black ’47, 170 years ago.
Should there be a second referendum which reverses Brexit, Ireland should be supporting the limiting of EC immigrants to support the UK so that
there is not a cultural metamorphosis there in lieu of better economic prospects.
Ireland has experienced traumatic emigration again post the demise of the Celtic Tiger;
except this time it was the better educated* youth that had to go and who are being replaced by refugees and working class migrants.
* from a taxpayer’s point of view, it seems futile for the taxpayer to foot the bill for
3rd level education and then see the investment emigrate.","Nov 18th 2017, 10:31 PM"

The reduction in the US Tax rate will make very little difference to US Multinationals based here, (a) our Corporate Tax rate is still 10% lower and (b) to gain unimpeded access to EU markets they need to have a base within the EU. Now for Brexit, by the end of 2019 companies will have had over 3 years to prepare for Brexit. Any company that has not prepared itself in that time for the worst case scenario is being run by Imbeciles. Take the case of the Agri/food sector. The UK population still needs to eat after Brexit. And new trade deals take time to negotiate. So unless the UK plan on rationing they will still require all the current food they import.

Let’s say they begin importing cheap Ukranian grain. The price of UK grain is going to have to fall to match it, making already struggling arable farmers go out of business.

Might be easy for me to say but I’ve no time for identity politics. Flags in every window, murals of armed, masked men, that kind of crap I’ve no time for. Imagine living in a place so wound up in identity, sounds like a facistic nightmare where people MUST follow the line.

Ever heard of this saying, “Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst”?
How would you characterise the negotiations thus far? Going well are they? I wouldn’t share that view, and I don’t think many would. My reading of the situation, especially given the details of the proposals above, is the UK government don’t want to pay the so called “divorce” bill, and are actually very insincere in their efforts to come to a realistic compromise….either that or they are delusional, and I don’t believe that. Given that, the thing to do for the us is to prepare for the worst case scenario, which is also the most likely scenario, a return to a border. If that happens it would be devastating for the border region of the Republic certainly, if not the wider economy. In that situation we couldn’t expect to replace the loss of trade with Northern Ireland/UK immediately I think it would be prudent for the government of the Republic to stop prevaricating, sitting and hoping that things work out, and instead take action to ensure we can at least attempt to mitigate the damage by maximising whatever benefits might be available for us. It’s called logic.
Hopefully I’m wrong, and tomorrow the UK government have some spiffing idea about the border, but all signs point to the contrary, but you know I’d love to be surprised.
As for your last point, the UK government haven’t really given me the impression they want anything else other than out of the EU, so how else do they think this will play out? For that matter how else do you think it will play out? No offence but you seem to have attacked a lot of people on here today for their opinions, rightly or wrongly, but offered nothing constructive yourself if you accept as fact that the Republic is definitely not leaving the EU too, at least as far as we can foresee at this point in time.","Aug 15th 2017, 5:51 PM"

There’s a lot of arrogance on the UK side given the relative weakness of their position.
Unfortunately as the UK is one of our bigger trading partners, we will get more caught in the fallout than other EU countries. But even so, our exports to the UK are about 14 or 15% of total exports. UK’s exports to the EU are three times that.

But there’s been calls to allocate some of the seats to ‘transnational’ MEPs. Seemingly this has not been decided yet. It’d allow (e.g.) an Irish person to vote for a Swedish MEP if that person most closely reflected his or her views.
This has been proposed by federalists, but fears are that such MEPs won’t really be transnational when it matters, so that Germany and France will gain too much influence.
The proposal requires unanimity so I don’t it will make it. The Brexit vote didn’t happen for nothing, and the Polish, Hungarian, Austrian and Dutch governments seem to understand this, which is enough. But all governments should understand that a rethink and a step back are needed. ‘More Europe’ will probably backfire and it won’t be pretty.","Jan 24th 2018, 8:31 AM"

The only clear thing in the agreement (other than the arch-Brexiteers have reacted by saying that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, and that if it means something they don’t like the Tory Party will renege on it) is that the (presently non-existent) Northern Ireland Executive will have the final say over the shape of trading arrangements between the Republic and North.

In effect the EU has given Germany more real control of Europe via Finance & Economics than the Nazis ever dreamed of.
When Brexit was in the initial stages in the UK, I was as an Irish person with family in the UK happy that some people in the EU were standing up to the EU, and hoped then that in light of Brexit and other similar trends in the EU that the EU would at last take a good hard look at itself and try to address the issues that are causing anti-EU sentiment when having a chance to do so, but no instead the EU became worse and more entrenched and just helped prove some of the points of the anti-EU people, with grand statements like the EU is great and anyone anti-EU is crazy. While they dont have to agree with all the anti-EUers ideas they certainly could take a look at some of the major concerns like the faceless, un-elected bureaucrats that are telling all what to do, the drive to a Federal Europe with an European Army and tax harmonisiation and reduction of Nation State powers.

That’s why in the last northern election there was such a high turn out and also why the SDLP and UUP were wiped out as both sides take to their trenches in Sinn Fein and DUP.
Sinn Fein has only acted to demonise the goal of a united Ireland. However, you do not need to be nationalist to believe that this is for the greater good of this island. Trying to travel from Dublin to Donegal is enough evidence alone where the transport system is not fit for purpose, cause by lack of coordination between North and South. A small island on the periphery of Europe should not have two separate currencies, two separate tax systems and soon to be two separate Unions.
While some would argue about the costs of a United Ireland, this is purely a standpoint of ignorance. If this viewpoint were taken in the business world we would never see mergers or acquisitions. Like in the business world the cost would be covered by the issuing of a bond. It is important that we remember that the reason Ireland made such a successful come back was not due to the work of our politicians but due to the economic system we have in this country that gives is such a strong foothold. The system works and expansion is needed, especially as Dublin reaches full capacity. We need a United Ireland because Belfast has the infrastructure to handle the increase in business.
Despite our politicians best efforts to screw up our economy we are growing at the fastest rate in Europe in spite of then. To keep this going and to diversify to reduce over dependency on Dublin we need a united Ireland.

No matter what story is printed and a huge bandwagon of people jump on the anti government stance without understanding the details of what they are complaining about. People just want to be anti FG/FF regardless of what it is about. If we were to have a vote on EU membership there is a risk that these people would vote to leave the EU just to protest against the current incompetencies of the FG/FF government.

Let me get this straight. If there is a deal, then the DUP blocks any sort of border in the Irish Sea, while the GFA blocks a border between NI and the ROI. The result can only logically be a soft Brexit.
But if there is no deal, then the UK remains in ‘full alignment’ with the EU. The result can again only logically be a soft Brexit.
