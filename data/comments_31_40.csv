The EU has made far more concessions to the UK over brexit than anyone ever envisioned, bent over backwards in effect, with the support of the 27, but anymore concessions would give the UK a better deal than that of member states, which would logically cause others among the 27 to seek their own exit on the same terms.","Feb 3rd 2019, 5:48 PM"

Also the more the EU’s puppies like the IMF and the ECB try to fix the big financial structures by turning their debt into tax payers debt then the more the political systems will vote in extreme politicians from the far right and the far left into the EU parliament. This will just add to conflicts and more resistance to the EU and the IMF taking more control over the political controls over Eurozone countries.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-27/a-bundesbank-economist-has-a-radical-plan-to-halve-italy-s-debt
Italy’s populist government doesn’t need to ask for money from European partners to halve its debt — it could tap the large private wealth of its citizens, Bundesbank economist Karsten Wendorff suggested.
The radical proposal echoes the debate in Italian media over a potential “wealth tax.” Unlike a tax, however, it wouldn’t directly eat into the patrimony of the country’s families, according to its proponent, who heads the German central bank’s public finance department.
“Instead of a European fund that buys Italian government bonds and that is ultimately backed by European taxpayers, a national fund should be created,” Wendorff wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Saturday. “This fund would buy Italian government bonds.”
Such a fund would be financed by “national solidarity bonds” that Italian households would be obliged to purchase — for example, to the tune of 20 percent of their net wealth. At such a rate “almost half of Italian government debt could be converted into solidarity bonds.”

It’s one thing for a banana republic, such as Ireland, to force multiple referendums on its people until the government gets the result that it wants, but if one of the world’s most important democracies and geo-political powers (the U.K.) begins to do this then the principle of democracy itself becomes hollowed-out and people will lose faith in the idea of democracy. Also, in a world where there is a struggle between the ideas of democracy and that of oligarchy, the U.K. would not be able to show itself as having true faith in democracy when it matters; this would undermine the case for democracy particularly in the East.","Feb 26th 2019, 3:11 PM"

Ben Benanke himself credited the rising economy to worker insecurity, that should show the mentality of those who are advocating for the status quo, which in itself is anti capatilist.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-27/a-bundesbank-economist-has-a-radical-plan-to-halve-italy-s-debt
“Italy’s populist government doesn’t need to ask for money from European partners to halve its debt — it could tap the large private wealth of its citizens, Bundesbank economist Karsten Wendorff suggested.
The radical proposal echoes the debate in Italian media over a potential “wealth tax.” Unlike a tax, however, it wouldn’t directly eat into the patrimony of the country’s families, according to its proponent, who heads the German central bank’s public finance department.
“Instead of a European fund that buys Italian government bonds and that is ultimately backed by European taxpayers, a national fund should be created,” Wendorff wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Saturday. “This fund would buy Italian government bonds.”
Such a fund would be financed by “national solidarity bonds” that Italian households would be obliged to purchase — for example, to the tune of 20 percent of their net wealth. At such a rate “almost half of Italian government debt could be converted into solidarity bonds.”

One can argue….
The truth is no one anticipated either side leaving the EU so issues that maybe, with hindsight, should have been included, those partaining to an open border and the free movement that EU membership brings, were assumed and not included.

The significant concentration of euro processing in London probably works in Britain’s favour. ESMA did not make any contingency plans for euro processing. 75% of global euro clearing and 90% of interest rates swaps are processed in London. The ESMA stated last year that they could potentially provide temporary recognition clearing houses in London.

So despite what posters may say about her seeming confusion, may I respectfully suggest that it is the posters who are confused.
The DUP has already stymied the Stormont Government because its continuation would be awkward during the Brexit negotiations and instead concentrated on its privileged position of power in Westminster. As such Arlene & Co are calling the shots.
“13. It is understood that the North/South Ministerial Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly are mutually inter-dependent, and that one cannot successfully function without the other. (Source The Good Friday Agreement)
With no NI Ministers, there is no opportunity for the Ministers Republic to meet with their
NI counterparts twice a year as required by the Good Friday Agreement.
Furthermore , post Brexit , there will be no opportunity for disputes arising from the Good Friday Agreement to be resolved in the European Court again creating another out
for the DUP & the Orange Order and arguably rendering the Good Friday null & void.
So in summary, IMO, for the Good Friday Agreement to hold, NI has to remain in the EC

IMO, the EU has simply gone too far in regulating its member countries; so much so that national parliaments are political puppets of Brussels.
Countries should have the right to protect their borders and that includes mass immigrations.
The UK has undergone massive immigration since WW2 due to the break-up of the Empire and Ireland’s inability for provide a decent standard of living for its citizens.
In our downland in the 50s-60s, out of 43 teenagers/20 somethings, 31 emigrated and
the bulk of those went to England and that is only one townland of 11 households.
Project that to the county and then on to the country and you’ll get a idea of the mass exodus of the 50′s-60s.
Ireland’s EU obligations to take East Europeans has already put strain on our sense of identity and locals competing for low paid jobs with immigrants are also likely to rebel against the EU; similar to that of the middle England working class who tilted the Brexit scales.
There is also animosity towards the country by expats who had to emigrate due to the demise of the Celtic Tiger but are now disenfranchised while recent immigrants can vote.This certainly degrades the value of citizenship and encourages immigrants to dump their Irish citizenship altogether.
For example, I live in Ireland 4 months a year in retirement , own an Irish home and car which I’m not allowed to drive because I do not qualify for an Irish driving licence* yet a Rumanian or a Lithuanian arriving off the plane can buy a car , insure it and drive it away from the airport if he or she has the lollies. What has the country come to at all!
* All 15 Irish car insurers will not offer a car insurance quote because I do not have an Irish or EU driving licence. The Irish Driving Licence Authority has refused my application for an Irish driving licence because I don’t live here more than 6 months a year.","Jan 30th 2019, 10:13 AM"

I have been advised by the Minister for Finance that due to 2007 EU regulation covering the mobility of car insurance throughout the EU, Insurers are required to provide car insurance policies to EU citizens that are valid in all EU member country jurisdictions and this prevents them from offering car insurance to Irish Citizens who do not have an EU driving licence. The Irish Driving Licence Authority has denied me an Irish Driving Licence because I live in Ireland less than 6 months a year.
Th ludicrious thing about it is that:
-The Garda recognise my Aussie Driving Licence with an International Permit
-That rental car companies will rent me a car.
But Feckin car insurers wont even offer me a quote ! ( just for a laugh, go online and enter ‘Australian Driving Licence in the appropriate box and see what you get..eh) Its so frustrating because Ireland is legislatively hamstrung by this silly EC regulation.

If you walk in to DFS and say “I’ve been mandated by the missus to buy a sofa no matter what, she hasn’t given me a budget, and I’m not allowed to walk out of here without a sofa” then the salesperson realises this is the time to charge full price and present the sofa no-one wants to buy. No matter how much the customer comes up with ‘red lines’ like “I want a 3 seater, and it has to be under 500 quid”, if the salesperson knows the customer has to buy no matter what, he can charge whatever.
“Brexit means Brexit, and you have to deliver it” has the exact same effect. If you can’t walk away from Brexit, then you have no leverage. Moggs and co don’t get that.","Mar 12th 2019, 8:01 PM"

The UK still has it’s own view of history, it’s rights and responsibilities that are at odds with everyone else and that makes them dangerous particulary if the extremists get into power.

There might be a delay with Labour now advocating a new vote and some of Mays cabinet now threatening to resign if a no deal is the outcome.
The article makes no mention of “nothing being budgeted for” it simply says that we could face a budget deficit due to a no deal scenario.
The 2019 2023 show surpluses and these would have been calculated with the UK gone but with a deal and a new negotiated trade agreement with the EU and us by extension.
All the comments so far haven’t mentioned the economist, O’Leary said that any recession would be shallow. He maybe right maybe wrong but nobody really knows what the effects will be.
If anyone can explain or indeed show me how anyone can budget for something that nobody thought would happen or indeed know the full impact of it as it has never happened before, I’d appreciate it.
A no deal Brexit isn’t something that we need right now as we will feel the effect more than any other country, so does anybody think it prudent to forewarn the country before hand?
The last crisis caught almost everyone out by its size and its long-term effect, it caused chaos here and internationally.
Its of little comfort that we know there is a high chance of an increase in deficit and a recession but at least we know this time.

As it stands it’s highly unlikely a Border Poll in the North would result in a United Ireland. This same would follow in the event that a Border Poll was conducted as part of a negotiated solution to the backstop – which is, as you say, entirely plausible but would still mean they have to accept a Withdrawal Deal first to allow for said negotiation.
This is exactly the sort of arrangement the DUP should have been looking for because it would solidify their hold for a generation. However, if a Border Poll happens as the result of a Hard Brexit, which all data shows will likely hurt NI most of all, their chance to win is seriously in doubt as moderate voters weigh the social and economic cost of Union with Britain. Exactly the sort of thing the DUP should literally never want them to be thinking about but then I guess fundamentalists are rarely long term thinkers.","Mar 11th 2019, 9:56 PM"

The purpose of the backstop is, if they can’t actually workout the details during that next 2 year period as seems increasingly likely, then the backstop would come into effect, preventing the hard border indefinitely, until such time as a further agreement that was acceptable by all parties namely the UK and EU was adopted.","Jan 23rd 2019, 10:43 AM"

I also suggested that the Backstop have a time limit of 5/6 years, this would break the present logjam in the House Of Commons. Our Irish Gov. Ministers don’t seem to have a clue what to do. If they cant or wont do a bilateral deal with the U.K. in relation to the Border, and other issues that only effect Ireland & U.K., then they must agree to the suggestion of the Polish Foreign Minister, and agree to put a time limit on the backstop.

https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-poll-result-february-2019-4500824-Feb2019/,"The reunification of Ireland has been both a dream and seen as an attainable and positive objective by generations of Irish people since the country was divided in 1921 by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 — an Act which was not drawn up and passed by the Irish people, but by the British government and the House of Commons in London.
That Act was intended to establish separate “Home Rule” (or devolved) institutions within two new divisions of Ireland: the six north-eastern counties were to form “Northern Ireland”, while the larger part of the country was to form “Southern Ireland”. Both areas of Ireland were to continue as a part of the UK, but provision was made for their future reunification under common Home Rule institutions.
“Southern Ireland” was defined as all of Ireland except for “the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Derry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry” which were to constitute “Northern Ireland”. These six counties (out of the nine counties of Ulster), were the maximum area within which Unionists could be expected to have a safe majority. This was in spite of the fact that counties Fermanagh, Tyrone, and parts of Derry and Armagh had large Nationalist majorities, which within a few years found themselves partly isolated inside “the border”, and under Unionist control.
The 1920 Act established the post of the “Lord Lieutenant of Ireland”, who would be the British Monarch’s representative in both parts of the divided Ireland; executive authority was to be vested exclusively in the “crown”, and not answerable to either of the two proposed parliaments, north or south. The Lord Lieutenant would appoint a cabinet that did not need parliamentary support, and there was no provision for a prime minister. This system of governance was based purely on the practice of British colonial administration, and gave no voice to the people of colonised nations.
When the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, became law on 23 December 1920 it was already out of touch with realities in Ireland. The long-standing demand for home rule had been replaced among Nationalists throughout the entire country by a strong demand for complete independence, and a War of Independence was launched and waged against British rule, which reached its lowest point in late 1920 and in 1921, when 50,000 members of the British Army, supplemented by 15,000 “special forces” and “auxiliaries” failed to quell the unrest, and could not defeat the Irish Republican Army, though the latter had probably no more than 3,000 members and was becoming short of arms and ammunition.
What followed was a treaty between Britain and the newly independent “Irish Free State”; the treaty led to a civil war in the 26 counties, there were riots and civil unrest in Belfast and Derry, followed by the expulsion of many thousands of nationalists from the six north-eastern counties, further unrest in the “North” in the 1960s, a civil rights movement in the North, followed by a violent response from the Northern administration based in Stormont near Belfast, leading to the re-emergence of the Irish Republican Army in the early 1970s, and the “armed struggle” which continued until 1994.
The Unionists in the north-east also played an important role in the division of Ireland — importing arms from Germany in 1914 (as Britain was about the declare war on Germany), declaring that they would fight by whatever methods were considered necessary in order to frustrate Britain’s intention to give “home rule” to Ireland, waging what amounted to a war against nationalists in 1920 and 1921, and then establishing a system of single-party governance under which nationalists were excluded from many senior administrative posts, were deprived of voting rights, and were discriminated against when public housing was being allocated.
Some of the institutions set up under 1920 Act continued to function until they were suspended by the British parliament in 1972 (when the Northern Ireland Act 1972 re-introduced direct rule by London from 30 March 1972), while the remaining provisions of the Act still in force in the six north-eastern counties were repealed under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
It is hard to believe that some provisions of the British Government’s 1920 Act were not repealed in Ireland until the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.
This brief account is only part of the story of the tangled web of relations between Britain and Ireland; in some ways similar to the relations between Lithuania, Poland and the former Soviet Union. Both Lithuania and Ireland had their distinct struggles before gaining full independence; but while Lithuania has emerged with a national territory similar to that demarcated in 1918 and has retained her ancient and rich language, Ireland has been divided, and regaining full use of our language in daily life and in government institutions is still an ideal for many …
Some parts of the story of Ireland’s independence movement are excellently documented in the superb 3-part series “The Irish Revolution”, written and directed by Ruán Magan, with input from many distinguished historians, and from participants and eye-witnesses; and based on the book “Atlas of the Irish Revolution” by John Crowley and Donal O Drisceoil (winner of the Bord Gáis Energy Book of the Year award in 2017).

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-liveblog-vote-theresa-may-deal-4441153-Jan2019/,"If the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the British government fails to be approved by the British parliament, the real culprit will be Jeremy Corbyn.
Corbyn’s opposition is not based on principle (his positions on the EU have flip-flopped several times over his career), it is based on his sole goal of trying to precipitate a general election in the hope that he might enter number 10 Downing Street. The Conservatives, however, will not call a general election if they think it would lead to a Corbyn government (irregardless of Brexit).
It is fashionable in the media to blame very pro-Brexit Conservative backbenchers for Mrs May’s likely-looking failure to get her deal approved, but it is not really fair to blame them because they are actually acting on principle. Brexiteer backbenchers want a genuine Brexit – as per the referendum question (“Leave or Remain”) in the 2016 public vote – not a half-in-half-out fudge as per May’s Withdrawal Agreement.
The British Labour Party are supposedly in favour of the UK remaining in the customs union, and yet they won’t take the opportunity to approve the deal (endorsed by the Irish Government and the rest of the EU) which effectively ensures that Britain remains in the EU’s customs union. The reason why the Labour Party won’t play ball is because of Jeremy Corbyn’s politicking and intellectual dishonesty.
The Irish Government must be blamed for doing a terrible job in terms of lobbying the UK Labour Party to support this Withdrawal Agreement. Varadkar’s government has been utterly remiss in this regard. The Irish Government, and media, have fruitlessly concentrated their attacks on Conservative backbenchers who were always going to be unmoved by such tactics. The Irish Government, political parties and Irish media should have worked much harder in trying to convince the British Labour Party to support the Withdrawal Agreement. If tonight’s vote fails, it will be because the Labour Party didn’t support it even though the deal was endorsed by Ireland and the rest of the European Union.","Jan 15th 2019, 4:19 PM"

In the case of a Hard Brexit they are looking at an average of ~22% on all Foodstuffs imported under default WTO rules. Worse yet, if they choose to waive import tariffs they must do it on all foodstuffs which will gut their uncompetitive (globally speaking) and EU subsidised food farmers. Honestly, the loss of subsidies alone will be crippling for Veg and Meat farmers who rely on them.
They don’t get it though and they won’t believe it when they are told this is simply how it works. They are in for one helluva land if they persist in this.

Thats 24-32% over the next 3/4 years. Ordinary workers don’t have the allowances landlords have.
The figures suggest that a landlord with income of €1,500 a month, or €18,000 a year, would have claimed deductions of about €7,380 against this income, leaving taxable income of €10,620. This income is then liable to income tax, at either 20 per cent or 40 per cent, PRSI and USC. But I don’t know of any landlords with income that low, so multiply that.

So their colonies are supposed to be called British Overseas Territories. Though Tony Blare called them “colonies” about 2 days after the Act was passed:
“Gibraltar’s parliament approved an ambitious package of constitutional reform yesterday designed to give the colony almost complete self-government.” – Tony Blare, 28 February 2002.
Previously to the 26th February 2002, most British Overseas Territories Citizens (BOTCs) were not accorded nor could they automatically apply for full British citizenship (exceptions were BOTCs on Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands). After this date, all BOTCs automatically qualified for British Citizenship. Additionally, BOTCs born after the 26th February 2002 can easily apply for British citizenship which is almost always grated except in cases where the applicant fails on bad character grounds.
The act also effectively granted all BOTCs EU citizenship, which they will loose after the UK leaves the EU.
Ironically, it an be argued British Overseas Territories are now even more appropriately called colonies, as a colony is defined as “a territory under the immediate complete political control and occupied by settlers of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign.” and yes, they have British on them, whereas previously people weren’t always British citzens but e.g. Bermudan, Montserratian, Anguillian etc.
But on the other hand, they are not British settlers from Great Britain, indeed some places like Montserrat are inhabited predominately by former African Slaves and descendants of Irish indentured servants (a euphemism for slaves) who didn’t want to go there, they weren’t willing settlers.

If the EU reject the request for an extension, the only option for the UK is to cancel the whole thing and start again when they know what they want.

It’s not as though the British people would be asked to give it “another go” – seeing as the magnitude of the situation and the realistic consequences of a Brexit vote were not presented properly to the people the first time round.
Even if the people were asked a “2nd” time it wouldn’t be “undemocratic”as the political structure is different in the UK than it is here. A referendum in the UK is not legally binding in the same way as in Ireland. The output of British referenda are more like a recommendation than a decision which must be enacted – unless British parliament add strict provisions within obliging the government to align with “The will of the people”.

In Lisbon (not sure about Nice). The second vote was on an amended treaty whereby our tax sovereignty was guaranteed amongst other changes.

The Brexit vote happened when people didn’t know what they were really voting for. People now know the type of Brexit that has been agreed and should be asked if they wish to continue. This for me would be ultimate democracy!

This is an all-British project. The people pushing for a second vote are BRITISH, and they’re doing so out of real fear for the future of their country. They may get it or they may not, but why would you have a problem with British people wanting to rework British destiny in the light of new, and increasingly horrific, evidence? Seriously. This is a once-reliable, sanguine, admirable nation slowly convincing billions of people around the world that it’s lost its collective mind. Delaying a vote with 15 weeks till it crashes out. Handing 14 million quid to a ferry company with no boats. Practicing traffic jams the way sane nations practice founding day parades. $1,000,000,000,000 in liquidity fleeing the nation. 3500 troops at the ready; 1000 English and Scottish cops poised to invade Northern Ireland, with everything THAT entails. Now if I’d even suggested anything like this two years ago, or even last year, the parrots of Project Blindfold (and even intelligent people) would have scoffed, “Project Fear!!” And yet, here we are. This is real. This all happening. Now. Before Brexit even occurs.
So those of you insisting a second vote is wrong, tell me, please… In light of all this, how in the name of God it can be wrong for some British people to stand up and beg their fellow countrymen for the change, just the chance, to stop and really reconsider if this is actually the future they want for their country and its place in the world.","Jan 8th 2019, 12:36 PM"

Remember “In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time. This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the kinetic energy and potential energy of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.”

Anyway, the British commonwealth is just some pathetic attempt to make British people believe they are superior.
Most countries are third world dictatorships, their citizens just want access to England, the Royal family are unelected heads and Protestantism is its official religion.
Also, the British hunt down commonwealth immigrants and do not allow them to live there, whereas they walked into their countries.
It’s a pretend empire for slow learners with a pretend Olympic games.
We’ll be cleaning/paying up enough for Britain in a United Ireland, we don’t need to bow the knee aswell.
Could you imagine if the Germans or Russians claimed their empires were commonwealths that you joined.
Put an African as head of the British commonwealth and see if the British still want to be part of it.
Apart from celebrating the British empire, it’s a nothing organisation.

seriously – is it the Journal or Fine Gael that are pushing this or both. This is the second Journal piece on this and I dont see it being discussed elsewhere?
I agree with the idea that everything must be up for discussion in terms of showing unionists that we’ll respect their culture in the new united Ireland, and all that needs to happen as a discussion before the border poll, but the vibes im getting now, is that people here need to get used of the Commonwealth idea as its going to happen – therefore the discussion has already happened?

It is a pleasure to see a young lady identifying with the reality at hand. I grew up in a different era if not in starkly identifying reality? Many years before your time in West Cork our teachers thought us as children the only good Englishman is the one at the end of a barrel of a rifle. We would not be allowed to speak to near neighbours? This was because of their religious persuasion. This was not a failing or slight on my peers. This was the Ireland of the 1960s and 70s. My father died in July 74. I must add without castigating my forefathers that religious identity was basically thrashed into individuals of Catholic denomination at that time through schooling and media? Yes even then the media had controls. As for Archbishop McQuaid and deValera turned to Ultra- Conservative ideals and means to control the multiples. Some neighbours of different religious beliefs arrived to our door to sympathise with our plight as there was six children from the age of 17 to 3 years old age. These neighbours brought Brown bread and eggs. All neighbours played a blinder basically. The 1980s arrived and both Catholic and Protestant were into intermarriage. Ireland in Bandon was moving on it seemed? With the exception of a few die-hard on both sides. It is not all tip towing through the daisies. There’s always the few? I could be wrong and correct me if this is the case? The so-called border area the wound has not healed as yet? You are quiet correct in stating that governments have lost contact with the realities? Some that can lead to dire consequences!. Great reading and indeed identifying with your script.,"Mar 17th 2019, 4:18 PM"

The conflict is kept going by legacy issues by both sides and accusations of cultural erosion by Protestants.
It’s 47 years since Bloody Sunday, roughly the same for Kingsmill, yet these killings still dominate political discourse today.
Put it another way, Tokyo held the Olympics in 1964, 19 years after the WW2. Munich held the Olympics in 1972, 27 years after WW2 and the world cup in 1974. If the world understood that it had to move on after the millions upon million of deaths in WW2, why the hell can’t NI move on?
Those born in the Rep in the1940s, 50s, 60s or 70s knew little of the horrors of the War of Independence or Civil War because the older generation didn’t talk about it and didn’t pass on their memories of it. That was a good and crucial choice by them. Now we can look at these events as historical and without rancour.
NI can’t or won’t let go because Protestants need conflict to fuel itself as they fear assimilation and Catholics have this need to hold the British state account for state sanctioned killings.

And of course without a hard border with NI, Ireland would not be able to enforce its own customs regime (in contravention of WTO rules) or its own tax sovereignty or laws. We would be a de facto province of Westminster once again. Cunning indeed and without precedent anywhere in the world for good reason. This is simply the U.K. denying there was any need for a hard border. This is a lie plain and simple.","Mar 13th 2019, 8:54 AM"

Given our E.U. membership however and assuming we were agreeable to becoming a de facto province of Westminster by accepting these daft proposals, we would be obliged to put the border with the E.U. at our own ports.

Also, interestingly enough, the Free State and subsequently the Republic never built any permanent buildings as border posts, they were all ‘temporary’ prefabs to reflect the temporary nature of the then unrecognised border.
All that said, the future is worrying as heretofore we had an Ireland UK border and we may have an EU rest of world border in the future which is a whole different beast with different, international, responsibilities on both sides, particularly if the UK makes trade deal which are incompatible with EU trade deals.
Of course the existence of any restrictions for Irish or UK passport holders crossing the border will give rise to tensions and unwelcome intrusion into people’s daily lives with the potential to escalate. It is a pity that the basis of the Good Friday Agreement, the removal of EU borders and controls, was not written into the agreement but assumed.

Norway refused to join the EU, mainly to be able to keep their large fishing waters for themselves.
I think the discussions about border problems are fearmongering cleverly driven by EU/anti-Brexit elements. Ireland “allowed” itself to take about 4% of the EU fishing catch, while having over 25% of EU fishing waters. Something Norway avoided as that was worth over 10 billion per year already in the 1980s.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-brexit-delay-talks-4554993-Mar2019/,"A small majority of British people voted in favour of leaving (c 52% v 48%) because they were fed up with European Laws and Regulations – 1) interfering with their own preference of interpretation of their country’s laws; 2) allowing people of the other 27 EU countries to have freedom to live and work in the UK (forgetting the vice versa freedom-to-travel allowance); 3) making them pay VAT and other contributions into the EU-governing ‘Exchequer’ coffers from which many sectors of its population receive, in return, EU grants and 4) being wrongly led to believe that not being part of the EU would divert VAT etc funds back into their crumbling NHS.
The truths are out now.
Despite the UK’s Brexit Referendum statistics showing that majorities voting to Remain were, very specially in London (the most populous area of the UK), in Scotland, Nth Ireland, West Wales and that the vote to ‘Leave’ was carried by a disparate conglomerate of ‘rural’ villages, towns and smaller cities of Britain. These are locations of the veritable falsely-led believers in ‘Britannia Rules…’
(There was at least one suggestion that London City and its Greater Area should declare to be an independent state to preserve its massive ties to the EU. It is also notable that the effect of Brexit on Gibraltar, and all the UK’s other minion dominion islands around the world, have not been considered in sufficient depth or publicised enough).
Now that reality is biting hard that the VAT/NHS falsities has long been disproved, a 2nd referendum is very definitely worth a call. Let the people decide with their second, more-educated and reflective thoughts – and that the UK’s Parliament should not have a ‘final say’ over their 2nd vote.
Personally, I would not like the UK to leave the EU and would hope talk of a ‘Deal’ or ‘No Deal’ be taken off all negotiation agenda.
However, I do believe there is a way out… Forget about any ‘Deal’ or ‘No-deal’, wipe them off the table. Start with a clean slate. Future negotiations could perhaps include addressing the concerns of British people and EU laws to be changed to accommodate – not just theirs – but other populist nationalism concerns facing the EU within its own other 27 countries e.g. Italy, Austria, Greece and even Ireland.
If the EU can make laws, they can change or adapt them to make all member countries happy to live in unifying consensus.","Mar 22nd 2019, 2:43 AM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-3-4437582-Jan2019/,"The UK will leave. It is just that none of us know yet how that is going to look. I don’t think it will leave properly until for another 5-10 years. It will then form a space for itself in the wider world, but form a space it will. Too many of us in Ireland have gone again into a default position whether it’s Brit slagging or genuine concern over Ireland’s position.
Whether it is trade or general cultural links with the UK, these are enormous. The shift in how we work with the UK over that 5/10-year period will be the focus and increasingly so.
My big concern will be also during that time how the EU tax harmonisation and wider closer, we could call it federal partnership, develops. It will be a time for us to finally have a debate as to what we want as a country out of this. That discussion hasn’t even started. There seems to be an ‘official’ Ireland view, that of the two main political parties and a largely compliant media, that EU membership is the only way forward but like a lot of the smaller EU countries, what is that partnership going to be, and how close or not it should be. The UK’s decision will leave this issue as one of the defining areas to be dealt with by Ireland over the course of the next decade.
I believe more Euroscepticism will develop here. I’m just not sure yet whether this will remain a relatively small level of concern about where the EU is going, or whether the percentages of disagreement will increase, that the trend that has appeared across mainland Europe will take route here. As a nation our views on Europe have actually proved to be rather fickle. It might not take much to happen for it to sway towards higher level of concerns. This will be set against an ‘official’ Ireland/media continuously be pro EU. Will be fascinating to see how this develops and even more so, which politicians and parties will manage this process over coming years, and fully tap into public opinion.","Jan 13th 2019, 1:43 PM"

The whole purpose of the Good Friday Agreement was to morph armed conflict into
civilised political conflict and the heart of the is the Stormont Government, not the Border.
For this reason, PM May and Lord Trimble should be doing everything within their
power to get Stormont up and running again rather than spruiking principles that can be later denied. Talk is cheap and both that of Trimble and May are far from being Gospel.

France has always welcomed political and religious refugees into its metropolitan society, something admirable. Nevertheless, the French sense of nationhood has always been strong from Jeanne d’Arc onwards and even more so since the French Revolution, the Napoleonic wars, the amazing industrial revolution and the expansion of the French empire. France has been strongly European – on French terms not on Brussels terms. Geographically France and Germany are in the heart of Western Europe and economically they have the ability to drive European economic development. English society knows this and wishes to deal with continental Europe on its own terms. The EU project for a United States of Europe has been stalled by the Dutch and French referendum rejections of the proposed EU constitution. The UK withdrawal from the EU represents an English nationalist separation from the Franco-German United Europe steering engine. It is a contradiction for a French leader to criticize nationalism when his own country has exemplified the concept of a liberation nationalism that inspired slave revolts in the Caribbean, liberation movements in South America (Simon Bolivar & Bernardo O’Higgins), Irish nationalism and movements in Poland and elsewhere during the turbulent 19th century. The EU has achieved economic & infrastructural innovation among its 27 disparate members. Free trade and free movement of people is something to be grateful for. Education and cultural co-operation such as the Erasmus programme is important for international understanding. But I doubt whether a sense of EU common nationality is possible or desirable. Instead, a sense of common pan-European cultural identity may be achievable – even if Western European societies have been busy in recent decades shedding some of western civilization’s inherited traits.","Mar 5th 2019, 12:05 PM"

As the Chinese say, every crisis has a silver lining, any for Ireland it will be a golden (or silver) opportunity to abandon the vast amount of junk food that we are eating, most of which is imported from Britain.
Next time you are in a supermarket take a look at what people are buying for their families. The amount of unnecessary junk is amazing, and it’s all expensive as the consumer has to pay the transportation and advertising costs. Also, stop to examine the advertising on TV: most of it is for items you can easily live without.
It only takes a few minutes to make biscuits, and you can personalise them with nuts, dried fruit, spices, anything you have left over in the press. Bread is even easier to make. If people eliminated the crisps, biscuits, minerals, etc. not only would their health improve, their pockets would be fuller too!
For goods that we really can’t do without or produce, why is continental Europe not being explored? France and Italy have excellent agricultural products which could be imported. This could be a two-way project, as they already import a lot of our butter and meat.","Mar 11th 2019, 7:48 AM"

Parliament remainers are doing all they can to make brexit unattractive and force another referendum. Problem is, a remain vote is not certain in that case.
Ireland is being used by all sides in the UK to break brexit. It is Political nightmare, border issues can only be properly resolved after the UK leave the EU.
Varadkar, Merkel and EU need to state unequivocally the deal is closed so UK have 3 choices, no deal, the deal or remain. But all cases need to respect the GFA and UK sovereignty.
Juncker yesterday stated, even with no deal, the withdrawal agreement will form part of any trade deal later on. Problem with that is the UK probably won’t negotiate on those terms, causing border issues, whatever they may be.

I’ve never seen UK media as partisan Tory and determined to prevent a Labour Gov, as now.
Well, I think it’s no secret to anyone that Corbyn is a man of rare integrity, and someone who intends to actually prioritise the interests of the majority, labour class, citizens.

A rural public transport service is urgently needed.
For people living in rural Ireland, there is virtually no public transport, so one has to depend on taxis. It is so expensive for those on middle and low income, senior citizens and people with disabilities to get to their destination and back.
With no personal or rural public transport, life can be very difficult. Simple things like keeping a medical or hospital appointment can be virtually impossible because of taxi costs. Elderly people and those with disabilities are isolated and alone for too long.
Not everyone has a kind family member or friend to drive them to their destination.
Rural dwellers are not asking for a free transport service; they don’t mind paying for a reasonable and dependable service.
Getting out once a week can help so many people.","Feb 6th 2019, 2:09 PM"

It makes more sense to wait for another ten years and hold a referendum then, unless the no deal brexit results in reigniting the conflict in Northern Ireland, in which case all bets are off.

We have to be careful, however, in wishing for a United Ireland without rejigging
the constitution and our political institutions to accommodate Protestants in the North.
IMO we should :
-Debunk religion and the influence of the Catholic Church out of our Constitution & politics be declaring Ireland to be a secular State where the practice of religion is a private matter.
-Acquire the Catholic Church’s school & hospital properties and run education and health as secular services.
-Get rid of Co Councils and replace them with 4 strong Provincial Governments that
administer health, education & welfare. Refund fairly the VAT and earmarked health,
education & educational taxes to the Provinces. As such we would have a smaller
central Government that sets national standards but does not micro-manage; in other
words, a proper Federal/State system.
This, IMO, would allay Protestant fears that a United Ireland would mean Protestants would be subordinated by the Catholic Church’s influence on National politics.
Many militant Protestants in NI still see the Republic as a puppet Papist State and we simply have to listen to their concerns. Imagine if the position were to be the other way around and that we Catholics were invited to join a predominantly Protestant State as a minority.
We simply don’t want unity at the expense of another protracted Civil War! It’s just not worth it. Perhaps Sinn Fein is on the right track by being a secular Socialist Party.?","Jan 28th 2019, 4:38 PM"
