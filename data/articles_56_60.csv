BRITAIN’S DECISION TO vote to leave the European Union has led to much speculation about what lies ahead for the UK, Europe and Ireland.
Both before and after the referendum, politicians from various countries all seemed sure of one thing: they didn’t want a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to return.
Overall,51.9% of voters(17.4 million) in the UK wanted to leave the EU, while 48.1% (16.1 million) wanted to remain.
In Northern Ireland, 55.8% of voters (440,000) wanted to remain, while 44.2% (349,000) voted to leave.
A rather decisive 62% of people who voted in Scotland (1.6 million) wanted to remain, while 38% (just over one million) wanted to leave.
A second Scottish independence referendum is likely to be held at some point, but could be years down the line.
A border poll in the North is also not likely to take place for some time. Obviously, one of Sinn Féin’s main goals is a united Ireland and they want to see a vote sooner rather than later.
However, others who want the north and south reunified believe it’s too soon to hold a vote and doing so now would ultimately see it fail. Some people also fear a border poll would reignite sectarian tensions and could lead to violence.
Good Friday Agreement
TheGood Friday Agreement(GFA) recognises that Northern Ireland remains part of the UK due to the consent of the people living there.
However, it also provides for the people of the island of Ireland to exercise their right of self-determination by agreement between the people of North and South.
The GFA states:
If such a vote passed, the process of Irish unification would begin.
In recent weeks, we’ve asked all 158 TDs the following two questions:
1.Do you want to see a border poll in Northern Ireland during this government’s term?2.If such a vote was passed, would you support reunification if a vote was held in the Republic of Ireland?

The GFA was agreed by politicians on 10 April 1998 following intense negotiations aimed at leading to lasting peace and the decommissioning of weapons by paramilitary groups. It was overwhelmingly approved in two referendums in the North and the Republic the following May, coming into effect in 1999.
The agreement put in place a framework toestablish a number of political institutionsrepresenting the relationships that exist within and between the islands of Britain and Ireland: the Northern Ireland Assembly, the North South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.
The GFA notes that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could put legislation allowing for a united Ireland before the UK Parliament if citizens in the North voted for this in a referendum. It states:
There appears to be a greater desire for a border poll among people in the Republic, compared to people in Northern Ireland.
In July, one month after the Brexit vote, aPaddy Power/Red C Research pollfor the Sunday Times found that 65% of people in the Republic said they would vote in favour of a united Ireland.
An opinion poll carried out this week byAmárach Research for Claire Byrne Liveasked people in the Republic ‘Is it time to have a United Ireland?’ Just under half (46%) said yes, 32% said no and 22% were unsure. The highest percentage of people in favour of a united Ireland were those in the 25-34 age group, with 54% saying yes.

However, an opinion poll carried out in the North by Ipsos Mori in August and September on behalf ofBBC programme The Viewfound that just 22% of people there would support a united Ireland, with 63% wanting to remain in the UK.
More than four in 10 people with a Catholic background who were polled (43%) wanted a united Ireland, while the vast majority of people (88%) from a Protestants background would vote to stay in Britain.
More than eight in 10 respondents (83%) said the UK’s decision to leave the EU hadn’t changed the way they would vote in a border poll.
So, where do Ireland’s political parties and TDs stand on the issue?
Overall, 74 TDs (47%) sent us statements. You can read all of theindividual replies here.
Of this, 38 TDs (including 23 from Sinn Féin) want to see a border poll within the lifetime of this government, 33 do not and three are listed as ‘other’ because they did not directly answer the question.
If a border poll was passed in the North, 59 TDs who replied said they would support a similar vote here, three would not and 11 didn’t directly answer the question.
Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Enda KennySam Boal / /RollingNews.ieSam Boal / /RollingNews.ie / /RollingNews.ie
Just 13 of the 50 Fine Gael TDs answered, with six – including Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan – believing the time is not right for a border poll. However, most said they would support a similar vote in the South if such a referendum passed in the North.
Half of Fianna Fáil TDs – 22 out of 44 – replied to the survey. Of this, the majority believed holding a border poll during the lifetime of this government would be premature. However, many expressed a desire for a united Ireland at some point in the future.
All Sinn Féin TDs, so 23 overall, replied. Unsurprisingly, all are in favour of a border poll and want a united Ireland. All 158 TDs were contacted on several occasions, via phone and email.
Here’s what the main parties and/or leaders think:
Note: All responses are included in full at the request of some ministers and TDs, given the nuances of the topic being discussed.
Fine Gael
A spokesperson said: “Fine Gael supports the Government position that there is no demand for a border poll at this time, as there is no evidence to show a majority of people want to join the Republic.”
Taoiseach Enda Kenny added: ”We have made it perfectly clear that the question of a united Ireland is contained in the Good Friday Agreement, which I support fully, and of which I, as Head of Government, am a co-guarantor with the British Government.
“The Good Friday Agreement and its successor agreements contain a very clear measure to the effect that if people north and south of the Border decide by referendum that there should be a united Ireland, they should have that opportunity. We support this measure. This measure must be part of a continued guarantee of the negotiations that will take place between the European Union and on our future relationship with the United Kingdom.
Tánaiste Frances FitzgeraldEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ieEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald sent us this statement: “As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is committed fully to supporting its provisions. That Agreement addresses the question of a united Ireland. The Tánaiste fully supports the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and its successor Agreements in this regard.
“If, in the future, the people North and South decide by referendum that there should be a united Ireland then that opportunity should be available to them.
Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan and Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar also don’t think the time is right for a border poll, saying it could lead to increased division in the North.
However, Varadkar said he believes there will be a united Ireland in his lifetime.
“I know that now this is not the time for a border poll. It would be unsuccessful and divisive and could undermine relations between the two communities in the north. We need to achieve a unity of purpose first of all,” he told us.
Fianna Fáil
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál MartinLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Micheál Martin said: “Fianna Fáil is absolutely committed to the reunification of Ireland and has been since its foundation. While in Government we were central to the Good Friday Negotiations, in which we negotiated and agreed the mechanism for a border poll.
“What Fianna Fáil is doing, and what all political parties should be doing now, is to recognise the immense challenge presented by Brexit and work hard at home and abroad to help mitigate the worst impacts of this decision for Northern Ireland.
“It is through such constructive activity, rather than through unilateral demands for border polls, that we can begin to convince neighbours from the unionist community that their best interests are served in an all-Ireland context.”
Sinn Féin
Gerry Adams said: ”I firmly believe that building a united Ireland is in the interests of every Irish citizen, North and South, and offers the most sensible, prudent path to ensuring long-term prosperity, progress and equality for everyone on the island.
“We need to be planning for the future, not sustaining the mistakes of the past and partition, which has held back the economic and social potential of the country since the island was artificially divided.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry AdamsSam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“At present there are two states on this island, North and South, and three governments in Dublin, Belfast and London trying to run them. None of them can adequately prioritise the interests of all our citizens. For that, we need one integrated vision for the island.
“Recent research (Hubner and Van Nieuwkoop, 2015*) shows that Irish unity would result in significant long-term improvements in Ireland’s economy – concluding that Irish unity would result in a €35.6 billion boost during the first eight years of unification.
“Any neutral observer would easily come to the conclusion that there are no advantages for a small island nation, with 6.4 million inhabitants, on the edge of Europe having separate tax regimes and legal systems, competing economic development programmes, and back-to-back health and education systems.”
*The research, carried out by a consulting firm in Vancouver, British Columbia, is based on the models of unification seen in Germany in the late 20th century and post-partition Korea. Three unification scenarios were presented, with the most aggressive estimating a €35.6 billion boost in an all-island GDP in the first eight years of unification.
Labour
Labour leader Brendan HowlinEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ieEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Brendan Howlin told us: ”It is the view of the Labour Party that reunification of the island of Ireland must be our ambition, but we recognise the principle of consent that underpins the ongoing peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland.
“We support the reunification of the island of Ireland. In the unlikely event that a referendum is held in Northern Ireland, and that the people of the North vote for reunification, the Labour Party would campaign in support of this proposal in the Republic.”
Anti-Austerity Alliance
The AAA sent us this statement: “The Anti-Austerity Alliance TDs – Ruth Coppinger, Paul Murphy and Mick Barry – are opposed to the calls for a border poll. A border poll would be nothing more than a sectarian headcount and would resolve nothing.
AAA TD Ruth CoppingerLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
“A binary referendum is not a basis to reconcile the two communities, with their opposing national identities and aspirations. It would serve only to heighten tensions and pit Catholic and Protestant workers and young people against each other. The ‘losing side’ would not stoically accept its fate. Such a poll would only deepen divisions and stoke the flames of sectarian conflict.
“These fears and aspirations are continually preyed upon and manipulated by the sectarian parties and paramilitaries in both communities to suit their own narrow interests.
“Neither community has the right to coerce the other into a state they do not want to be part of on the basis of a simple majority vote. The current situation is not a solution but a border poll will not provide a solution either. No solution can be found while forces with a vested interest in maintaining sectarian division – whether the Green and Orange parties or British capitalism – continue to dominate.
“Only by building a new movement which unites Protestant and Catholic workers and youth around their common interests and in opposition to the political establishment can we begin to break down the sectarian barriers between our communities. On this basis, The AAA TDs favour a socialist solution to the national problem on this island where the rights of both Catholics and Protestants are guaranteed.”
The above quotes are based on statements from party leaders and/or when a party or alliance sent a joint statement on behalf of all members.
Who said what
Below is a selection of other people’s views from different parties and none.
Several Fianna Fáil TDs are not in favour of a border poll during the lifetime of this government, but most who replied would back reunification if the North did eventually vote to join the Republic.
Fianna Fáil's Timmy DooleyLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Most of the Fianna Fáil TDs who replied sent us the same statement, namely:
Some of the party’s members elaborated on their views, with Timmy Dooley telling us: “I’d love to get to the point where there is a border poll and there’s a chance of it succeeding. At the moment it would be a distraction. A lot of issues need to be addressed because of the Brexit vote. There is no chance of it passing, it would be a sideshow.
“I absolutely want to see a united Ireland, but a border poll in lifetime of this government will not be successful. We should be encouraging people to work together to deal with the fallout of Brexit. When people in the North see the long-term implications of Brexit, there is a much better chance of the majority deciding to move towards a Dublin government.
Sectarian issues
His colleague Jim O’Callaghan had this to say: “Even though I believe partition was a sectarian solution to a political problem, I believe a border poll during this government’s term would be inadvisable. Irish unity will only be achieved when we can bring together the different traditions on this island.
“A border poll in the next year or so will be extremely divisive. It will simply harden opinions and force people into sectarian groupings. It will probably result in sectarian violence. Northern Ireland was established as a sectarian state, with widespread discrimination against Catholics. That has now ended – not because of the IRA’s campaign of violence – but because of the civil rights campaign and the unacceptability of discrimination.
“In a less sectarian climate a border poll can occur but politicians have a responsibility to ensure that the current peace is not threatened. A border poll in the next few years would, in my opinion, destabilise the current peace in the North. The recent vote on Brexit in Northern Ireland shows that unionists are prepared to see the benefits of remaining part of a union with the south, rather than a small union with an inward looking and self-interested England. Calls by Sinn Féin for an immediate border poll undermine the significance of this change in unionism. Such tactless calls are counter-productive to securing Irish unity.”
‘Good economically and politically’
Unsurprisingly, all Sinn Féin TDs are in favour of a border poll, something the party has repeatedly called for.
Brian Stanley said: “Due to Brexit if the North is dragged out of the EU by England, then there will be two currencies and two political systems on the island and one part of Ireland in the EU and the other out of it.
His colleague Carol Nolan stated: “Partition has impacted and stunted development on this island and has been an obstacle in terms of developing agriculture and tourism. It doesn’t make sense to have two legal systems and two currencies on such a small island.”
Sinn Féin's Carol NolanLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Peadar Tóibín said he wants the people of the North to be given ”a democratic chance … to indicate their choice”.
He said a united Ireland would “reduce duplication and therefore the cost of key public service delivery” and “reduce the barriers to enterprise on the island”. He added that the border is a “competitive advantage for criminals” and getting rid of it would help prevent smuggling.
John Halligan and Finian McGrath of the Independent Alliance said they would support a border poll during the lifetime of the government, with Halligan stressing the idea needs to be backed by people in the north.
‘A significant risk to the peace process’
The majority of Fine Gael TDs did not reply to the question, but most of those who did don’t think the time is right for a border poll.
Josepha Madigan told us: “There is no evidence that a border poll in Northern Poll would result in a change to the status quo. In fact, the evidence points to the current arrangement, of devolved government based in Stormont, as being the preferred option for most people in Northern Ireland. The peace process, which is hugely important for people living both north and south of the border, is underpinned by the constitutional arrangement established by the Good Friday Agreement.
Fine Gael's Josepha MadiganSam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Peter Burke said: “It is too soon and would be extremely politically divisive. At present, there is no evidence of a majority wanting to join the Republic. People have a right to their opinion but discussions of border poll in the short-term future are premature.
“If a poll was to be held, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland must judge it likely that a majority of the electorate would opt for a united Ireland. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that such an outcome would occur. If those resident in the both the North and the South wanted reunification then I would support it.”
‘Psychological borders caused by deep hurt, pain, suffering and loss’
Gino Kenny from People Before Profit (PBP) said: ”I’d like to see a united Ireland. In order for that to happen there has to be a consensus in the six counties.
“A border poll has been mooted many times over the last 20/30 years, a focus is on it against after the Brexit vote. I’m not against it, it depends on how it’s done. It’s about timing, I’m not sure it would pass, probably not based on polls.”
PBP TD Gino KennyMark Stedman / RollingNews.ieMark Stedman / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
His PBP colleagues also questioned whether or not such a poll would pass. Richard Boyd Barrett said: “We would support a border poll, another question is whether or not it would pass.”
Bríd Smith added:
Eamon Ryan said the Green Party “would only like to see a border poll in Northern Ireland when the time is right which is not the case as it currently stands”.
Green Party Deputy Leader Catherine MartinLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
His colleague Catherine Martin added: “One of the outcomes of the Brexit referendum was the immediate call by some for a border poll. Firstly, I should state that I would love to see a united Ireland by peaceful means. I was born and reared in a border town – I know first-hand how destructive and divisive borders can be – we do not want to see the return of physical borders.
“But much more work is needed to remove in many respects an even more important debilitating border, namely the psychological borders caused by deep hurt, pain, suffering and loss which is still extremely palatable and present for many in both communities. So much more work, often low-profile work, must first be done to build up trust and mutual respect.
“It is my opinion that a border poll should not be rushed as that would alienate and would prove divisive running the risk of turning the poll into a sectarian headcount and going on then to proceeding to lose the vote, as inevitably would happen, would be a serious setback for the goal of achieving a united Ireland for a generation.
“Yes, I would like to see a border poll take place some day, but only if it had a realistic chance of being successful and that is not the case at present as the unionist community is to say at the very least certainly not enthused by it – to have a poll knowing in all likelihood that it is going to fail is a retrograde step.”
Independent TD Mattie McGrathLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Four independent TDs replied, with all in favour of a border poll. Mattie McGrath said: “As a political proposition there would appear to be little to fear in subjecting the issue to a democratic vote.
“Consensus is a key principle of the post-Good Friday politics. If the proposition was put in line with the provisions of that agreement then it might provide a measure of clarity that would be helpful in an environment that is increasingly uncertain post-Brexit.”
The Social Democrat and Workers and Unemployed Action Group TDs did not reply to the survey.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-christmas-3159115-Dec2016/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has used her first Christmas message as PM to urge the UK to seize the “historic opportunity” afforded by the Brexit referendum to “forge a bold new role” in the world.
In a tumultuous year at home and abroad, May says that the “United Kingdom has had much to celebrate” in 2016.
In the brief message, the Prime Minister singled out the armed forces, olympians and the Queen for praise, and referenced her own upbringing in a vicarage while wishing “joy and peace” to all.
In terms of Britain “coming together”, she said:

“And, with our international partners, we must work together to promote trade, increase prosperity and face the challenges to peace and security around the world.”
Speaking on what united the UK this year, she said: “Her Majesty the Queen celebrated her 90th birthday, surrounded by the Royal Family and well-wishers from across our four nations, the Commonwealth and the world.
“Four years after the success of London 2012, our Olympic and Paralympic athletes continued to work and train – and they were rewarded by coming second in the medal table.
May added that Britain re-affirmed its commitment to stand up for people of all religions to practise their religion freely in peace and safety at a time of year when “we also think of Christians in other parts of the world who face persecution this Christmas”.
She closed by mentioning her upbringing in a vicarage, and that she understood how demanding it can be for those who have to work over the Christmas period. May thanked the armed forces, security agencies and emergency services who work all year round to serve the public.
Enda Kenny recently told reporters that he expected a visit from Prime Minister Mayto Dublin next month, to discuss the upcoming Article 50 negotiations and other matters.

ONE OF IRELAND’S largest mushroom producers has snapped up a major competitor – a move that it puts down to the Brexit referendum.
Wexford-based Walsh Mushrooms Group, which accounts for 15% of the total UK mushroom market, bought Tipperary’s Golden Mushrooms for an undisclosed sum.
The Irish mushroom industry exports over 80% of its products to the UK each year. This reliance on Ireland’s neighbour has seen the sector hit hard by the devaluation of the British pound after the Brexit referendum.
Speaking toFora, Walsh Mushrooms managing director Padraic O’Leary said the company’s purchase of Golden Mushrooms is “a reaction to difficulties in industry” and will help it prepare for whenever the currency rebounds.
However he added that the acquisition will not counteract the effect the weakened pound is having on the Irish industry and his firm, which has seen its UK sales deliver significantly less revenue to the parent company over the past six months.
“The mushroom industry started to hurt immediately after the Brexit referendum and the founders of Golden Mushrooms wanted to sell, so we decided to make the purchase to strengthen our group.
“I think the acquisition shows that we are confident in the industry and that it will bounce back – we believe there is a future there.
Padraic O'Leary (left)Finbarr O'RourkeFinbarr O'Rourke
Since June, five Irish mushroom growers have gone out of business as a direct result of Brexit.
O’Leary said his company has lost about 20% from both its top and bottom lines, adding that it was already a tight-margin industry. The firm has dropped the price of compost it supplies to farmers to help producers, he added.

Over the past six months, Walsh Mushrooms has also been able to renegotiate its deals with UK suppliers to ensure the company remains sustainable. This has seen the price of mushrooms exported from Ireland rise in the UK.
Consolidation
Golden Mushrooms was founded in 1998 by Michael and Marian Bergin and has grown to become a significant producer in the Irish market, employing 90 people.
The company will now trade as Walsh Mushrooms Golden and act as another wing of the Walsh group, which also has a compost manufacturing plant in Wexford and mushroom production and packing facilities in the UK.
O’Leary said that after the acquisition, which has brought the total staff at the group to 380, he doesn’t plan to make any more significant purchases.
Finbarr O'RourkeFinbarr O'Rourke
He said this is an important stage for the company to “consolidate what it has got” and be ready to take advantage when the market rebounds.
“We don’t have a target revenue for this year, our target is to deal with all the volatility, which can be difficult to predict since no one knows how this could pan out.
“What we do know is that mushrooms are the second largest-selling vegetable in the UK, but the market over there is not self-sufficient, so it needs our imports.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-phil-hogan-theresa-may-3176932-Jan2017/,"FORMER ENVIRONMENT MINISTER Phil Hogan says Ireland needs to cut its ties with Britain in the wake of Brexit.
Writing in the Irish Times today, the EU Agriculture Commissioner says that the UK’s vote to leave the union represents a chance for Ireland to forge relationships with the remaining states.
Hogan says that while the UK has always been a “sympathetic ally” at EU level, it is time for Ireland to stand alone and make its own relationships.
“Brexit will happen and we now need to take a very strategic and far-sighted review of our relationships with both the UK and the rest of our European partners. There will be a new dynamic in European affairs, and Ireland needs to be absolutely prepared to influence, shape and lead that dynamic and change.
“If we don’t step up to the plate in managing this fundamental shift in our relationship with our European neighbours, then others will shape the environment for us.”

He goes on to say that Brexit will “force us to forge relations and shape our destiny within the EU without the presence of our nearest and strongest ally since 1973″.
The editorial comes at a time when British Prime Minister Theresa May vows that the UK can’t “keep bits” of EU membership.
“”The referendum vote was a vote for us to… bring control into our immigration system. I’m clear that is part of what we need to deliver,” she told Sky News in an interview.
“We will be able to have control over our borders, of our laws.”
German leader Angela Merkel has warned Britain will not be able to remain in the EU’s single market while “cherry picking” the terms — including over the free movement of labour — and May on Sunday appeared to suggest she would be willing to quit the trade zone.
“Often people talk in terms of, somehow we’re leaving the EU but we still want to keep bits of membership of the EU,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-negotiations-team-eu-3143128-Dec2016/,"THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Minister Charlie Flanagan has said that Ireland is firmly on ‘Team EU’.
Speaking to the European Movement Ireland (EMI) tonight, Flanagan said that Ireland and “team EU” will be ready for Brexit negotiations.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May today denied reports that a post-Brexit trade deal could take a decade.
May was tonight frozen out of a dinner where the other 27 EU leaders will discuss the process for Britain’s departure.
They have rejected all negotiations until Britain officially triggers the two-year divorce process, expected in March, but May dismissed any suggestion that it amounted to a snub.

“It is right that the other leaders prepare for those negotiations as we have been preparing,” she said.
Flanagan tonight said that Ireland will be ready for the negotiations, saying that other countries understand that Ireland has a larger stake in Brexit.
“But I am confident that we in Ireland and in “Team EU” will be ready for the negotiations.”
In his speech, Flanagan also took aim at the rise of populism across Europe.
“The reality is that governments are generally faced with difficult choices – there are no easy solutions to the complex problems we all face domestically or internationally.
“I believe it will become clear to electorates that populism is an empty formula.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-bertie-observer-good-friday-3235718-Feb2017/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S PEACE process is being put at risk by Theresa May’s hardline Brexit policy, according to former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern.
In an interview with the Observer in the UK today, Ahern said May’s flip-flopping over whether the border between the North and the Republic would be manned sends the wrong message to the entire island of Ireland.
Ahern said he believes that there must be consistency to the Prime Minister’s words on Brexit.
Hetold the Observer: “May seems to be switching her language. She’s saying not that there’ll be no border, but that the border won’t be as difficult as to create problems. I worry far more about what’s going to happen with that.”
Ahern added that any attempt to create a physical border would be “very hard to maintain and would create a lot of bad feeling”.
Not only would the reinstatement of a physical border have negative consequences economically, it would stoke anger within the North’s nationalist community, who saw the Good Friday Agreement as a way of “integrating the island”, Ahern added.

He said that if you take that away, it will have a “destabilising effect” on an area which is already in flux.
Dublin visit
Theresa May, speaking in Dublin last month, said both she and Kenny were “personally committed to strengthening the relationship” between Ireland and the UK.
“I know for the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the ability to move freely across the border is an essential part of daily life, which is why the Taoiseach and I have both been clear that there will be no return to the borders of the past,” said the UK Prime Minister.
Both leaders said any manifestation of a hard border in the North would have “very negative consequences”.
May and Kenny reiterated each other’s points about the border issue, stating they wanted it to be as “seamless”, “friction free” and as “trouble-free” as possible.
Describing their earlier private discussion as “frank” and “constructive”, Kenny said both countries were in agreement that the trading ties between the two countries should be “recognised and facilitated” as negotiations go forward.
He said this was an “absolute priority” for the Irish government.

THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, in a symbolic motion, voted overwhelmingly today to reject Britain’s march towards the EU exit, with the semi-autonomous government warning Scotland would not be “humiliated”.
The Scottish government said the vote – backed by nearly three quarters of Scottish lawmakers from across the political spectrum – is one of the most important in the parliament’s 18-year history.
Minister for Brexit Negotiations Mike Russell said his government will “never allow Scotland to be humiliated, and its democratic choice rejected. We will never, ever, turn our back on Europe and the world.”
He said there was still time for London to avert another independence bid by Scotland if it accepted a “compromise” – a differentiated solution that would keep Scotland in the European single market even as the rest of Britain leaves.

British lawmakers are debating a bill that would empower Prime Minister Theresa May to begin the country’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU).
The Scottish Parliament voted by 90 votes to 34 that the draft legislation should not proceed as Edinburgh has received no commitment that it will be effectively consulted on the exit terms.
The vote has no legal force, however.
The only dissenters were the Scottish Conservatives, who are aligned with May’s Conservative government in London.

“This is the Scottish Parliament. The people that voted for us are Scottish voters, they expect us to stand up for Scotland,” Russell said.
Scotland was told it would be an “equal partner” in the British union if it rejected independence, which it did by 55% in a 2014 referendum.
Twenty months later Scotland voted to remain in the EU by 62%, but it was outvoted by England which has a vastly larger population.

Brexit succeeded overall with 52% of the vote.
British judges ruled in January that a convention designed to deter London from imposing laws on Scotland carried no legal weight, clearing the way for the UK government to trigger Brexit without consulting Edinburgh.
A majority of MPs yesterday rejected amendments to the Brexit bill which called for greater involvement of the devolved administrations.
Lawmakers voted against guaranteeing they be consulted before Prime Minister Theresa May signs any agreements with Brussels, or delaying starting exit proceedings until at least one month after the devolved administrations have agreed to a UK strategy.
The Scottish parliament vote sends a clear signal to London that the Brexit process is proceeding without their support, but the UK government has no compulsion to listen.
“We’re going to keep talking and make sure that we go on talking so the Article 50 letter can still be influenced by the reasonable demands of Scotland,” Russell said.
A British government spokesman said: “The UK government will continue our engagement with the Scottish government and with people and groups across Scotland as we prepare to leave the EU to secure the best deal for Scotland and the UK.”

In a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Government Buildings this afternoon, the Taoiseach said he intended to accept Trump’s invitation to the White House in March for various reasons.
Pressure has been mounting on the Taoiseach over the weekend to snub the invitation, with over 30,000 people signing an online petition calling on him not to visit.
But at today’s press conference, he reiterated that he would not be cancelling the visit.
“First of all, I think it is really important that I get to say face-to-face to the president the issues that are important to us,” said Kenny, adding that he disagreed with Trump’s latest immigration policy which has caused confusion and protests around the globe.
“I don’t agree with it – I will obviously say that to the president and vice president when I meet with them.”
Kenny explained that it has been tradition for the Taoiseach to travel to the White House for St Patrick’s Day. He said that it offers opportunities to speak to senators, congress people and mayors about issues that matter to the Irish.

During the press conference, Kenny also announced that the US pre-clearance policy at Dublin and Shannon airports will be reviewed. This afternoon itemerged that one person was turned away atDublin Airport since Trump’s immigration ban.
“I have asked for a complete review of pre-clearance facilities here in Ireland,” said Kenny.
The Taoiseach pointed out that pre-clearance at Irish airports has been an enormous convenience in terms of efficiency and economics over the years.

On her first visit to Dublin as UK prime minister, May was also asked about Donald Trump.

In relation to Brexit and Northern Ireland, May said they were both she and Kenny were “personally committed to strengthening the relationship” between Ireland and the UK.
“I know for the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the ability to move freely across the border is an essential part of daily life, which is why the Taoiseach and I have both been clear that there will be no return to the borders of the past,” said the UK Prime Minister.

Both leaders said any manifestation of a hard border in the North would have “very negative consequences”.
May and Kenny reiterated each other’s points about the border issue, stating they wanted it to be as “seamless”, “friction free” and as “trouble-free” as possible.
Describing their earlier private discussion as “frank” and “constructive”, Kenny said both countries were in agreement that the trading ties between the two countries should be “recognised and facilitated” as negotiations go forward.
He said this was an “absolute priority” for the Irish government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-customs-sinn-fein-brexit-3242469-Feb2017/,"SINN FÉIN PRESIDENT Gerry Adams has said he is worried of the catastrophic effect a hard border would have on the island and said he was concerned at claims the government is preparing for a return to the days of border controls.
Reports in yesterday’s Irish Examiner claimed that revenue officials had been meeting to determine all “legal and practical implications of a range of scenarios”.
Adams said: “This allegedly includes the examination and identification of locations for full border checkpoints with ‘red and green channel’ facilities in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, and Donegal. It is also claimed that the M1 motorway between Dublin and Belfast is to be a particular focus for customs officials.”

Adams had used his Dáíl speaking time to ask the Taoiseach about the reports. Kenny responded by saying  he had seen reports drafted by customs officials but “I have an agreement with the British government that there will be no return to the border of the past and that means customs posts along the border”.
Kenny added that he and his party do not want to see a return to the old days and that “nobody north or south wants to a return to that”.
But Sinn Féín said it was not happy with that response and said it wanted clarity on what is to happen.
Adams, who is a TD for Louth, added: “The government urgently needs to clarify these contradictory positions. The people of Louth and the border community do not want a return of customs posts and checkpoints. Such a development would have serious economic consequences for jobs, the farming community, the fishing industry and local enterprises. Brexit is already hurting local businesses and this would make that situation worse.”

THE PASSPORT OFFICE is recruiting extra staff to cope with a surge in demand in response to last year’s Brexit vote in the UK.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said that while it did not compile reasons why people applied for passports, it was reasonable to assume that the vote to leave the European Union was a factor in the increase in demand from Britain and Northern Ireland.
Applications from the North were up by 77% in January, compared to the same month last year. Demand from Britain was up by over 70% on the January 2015 figure.

It comes amid continuing political turmoil in London over planned Brexit negotiations. There are concerns that UK passport holders will lose benefits like freedom to work anywhere in the union, in the wake of the country’s exit.

Brexit minister David Davis said this week he expects the government to meets its end-of-March deadline to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, kicking off the formal exit negotiation process.
Other factors
Back here, other factors leading to an increase in passport demand over the last year include a large number of Irish citizens travelling for last summers Euros, and a spike in applications in 2006 feeding through in renewals ten years later.
“Early indicators in 2017 are showing that increased demand for passports is likely to be sustained, certainly in the immediate future,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said.
“We are in the course of delivering a major Passport Reform Programme which will ensure significant customer service improvements to benefit citizens in the near future.
“This includes the introduction of online adult renewals which will mean a more efficient service for applicants.  I expect to start rolling out this programme before the end of March this year.”
To respond to the increase in demand the Passport Service is recruiting over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers, over half of which are already in place, Flanagan said.

THE UK’S PRIME Minister yesterday laid out a plan for a hard Brexit, one that would see the UK leave the EU and negotiate its own trade deal with the remaining 27 members.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
But what would that deal contain? Is it feasible? What happens now?
May has long held an ambition to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March, formally beginning the process of taking the UK out of the EU.
From then, her government has 24 months to negotiate its own versions of agreements with countries which have deals with the EU, if it wishes to continue trading as usual.
That means sitting down with all nations from Albania to Turkey which have existing agreements – as well as Canada, much of Southern Africa and the Caribbean, all of whom currently have provisional agreements in place with the EU.
There is also the issue of a shelved TTIP (the EU trade agreement with the US). Incoming President Donald Trump said at the weekend that he wants to negotiate a deal with the UK as soon as possible, but even that might not be quick enough.
Sources familiar with the negotiation of such deals say that while two years may seem like a long period, in reality it is not even close to enough time.
“The UK says it needs 50 new trade agreements straight away, but you can’t do that,” says one source, who points to CETA, the EU deal with Canada. It was agreed in October, seven years after negotiations began in 2009.
Taxing issues
So what is a trade agreement, anyway?
According to the World Trade Organisation, there are 625 trade agreements between the world’s 195 sovereign states.
Advertisement
The basic aim of agreements is to remove trade tariffs and taxes on goods entering markets.
So in the case of CETA, Irish farmers were unhappy that a large quantity of Canadian beef would be allowed enter the EU market without tariffs.
While economists generally praise the deals for opening up trade flows, some politicians are wary of them.
“It’s been shown over consistent studies that single-market membership increases trade flows,” says Dermot O’Leary, an economist with Goodbody. “That’s not argued with.”
But Luke Ming Flanagan does argue with the purpose of CETA. While many businesses see trade agreements as market opportunities for their products, Flanagan says some see other opportunities.
“Despite the tag, CETA is not about trade, it’s about big business and standards – labour standards, environmental standards, food quality standards, healthcare standards – and it’s about big business and access to and potential private ownership of what are normally seen as public utilities – water, power, transport, communication.”
May-be she will
So with May under pressure to rewrite the UK’s trading policy of the last 44 years in just 24 months, the question is: Is it doable?
“Theresa May is trying to avoid a cliff edge. The cliff edge would be that period outside the EU,” says O’Leary.
“That two-year transition period would be one where nothing would change. That’s important for the UK, but it’s also important for the EU. In the event of no negotiations, there would be a crash-landing Brexit.
“(Yesterday’s) speech is very much a starting position.”
Sources familiar with EU trade agreements say that any deal between the UK and EU will take “some time” to negotiate. With the UK a major trading partner of Ireland’s, that could be a problem for many export-based companies, says O’Leary.
“For May, it’s a decent starting position to begin her negotiations. It’s just not realistic to expect some of the things she has set out.
“It’s only when the conversations start will we get into the meat of what she wants.”

This is contrary to the provisions of Article 50 – which when triggered, leaves the country two years to negotiate their departure from the European Union (EU).
Speaking toSky News, Enda Kenny said:
“I think it will be impossible to do the negotiations within the contemplated two-year period.
Enda Kenny made the comments at the British Irish Council (BIC) in Wales. The Council was set up in 1988 to discuss matters in relation to Ireland, the United Kingdom, and its surrounding islands.
This year, the forum’s interests are focused on Brexit and its implications for the economy, trade, and sectoral areas such as agriculture, agri-food and fisheries; the common travel area and relations with the EU.
He added that Europe had “not yet” seen a coherent Brexit plan as there had been “different statements made by different people”.

Also at the meeting was First Minsiter of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon is due to travel to Ireland next week to “strengthen relations” between the two Celtic nations, and address Seanad Éireann – making her the first serving foreign leader to do so.
Enda Kenny met with the Scottish First Minister at the summit, where they discussed “mutual Irish-Scottish interests, both cultural and economic”.
“The British Irish Council was an important opportunity to call on the UK Government to work harder to protect our interests in Europe in the face of an impending Brexit.
“In the post-Referendum landscape, it has become even more important that Scotland and Ireland work together to further strengthen our shared economic, cultural and social ties.”
British Prime Minister Theresa May did not attend the forum, which was criticised by both Northern Ireland Deputy Minister Martin McGuinness who called it a “missed opportunity”, and the first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, who called it “unfortunate”.
Jones added: “We do need to see the prime minister here in future so she can answer directly some of the points that are made.”

In the final quarter of last year, there was an 11% increase in the number of jobs advertised online compared to the same period in 2015.
The figures, published today by IrishJobs.ie, show that all counties experienced an improvement in the number of jobs available, particularly Carlow, Dublin and Limerick.
Here’s how much the number of jobs advertised increased in certain sectors:

The Jobseeker Sentiment Survey, in which the website asked the views of 1,223 people, found that 67% of Irish employees felt very confident about the Irish jobs market.
Trump and Brexit
In terms of international affairs affecting jobs here, 49% of Irish employees said they don’t know what their employer’s Brexit plans are (17% are aware), while 66% of jobseekers said they’re not worried about Donald Trump’s election as US President impacting their current job situation.
Orla Moran, General Manager of IrishJobs.ie, said, despite the challenges of 2016, the figures “show a strong increase in jobs advertised online throughout the year, which has been matched by positive sentiment from jobseekers and optimism for the year ahead”.
“In our survey Irish workers tell us they are unsure whether their employers have begun Brexit planning. Given that Ireland trades over 40% of its exports with the UK, it’s important Irish companies start to think about the potential implications of Brexit and plan accordingly,” Moran said.

Ahern said the impact of the UK leaving the EU will be “enormous” on Ireland, saying the food sector will be particularly badly hit as about 45% of perishable items in the industry are exported to the UK.
In terms of the border between the Republic of Ireland and the North, Ahern said: “The whole border issue is a nightmare for us.
“I had hoped that the UK would not pull out of the customs union because that was never really mentioned last summer … People were talking about the single market, they were talking about the European Union … and then on 17 January the prime minister said, ‘Yeah, we’re leaving the customs union.’

“That draws a big difficulty for us for the very simple reason that the border between North and South, between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, becomes the natural border between the European Union and the United Kingdom,” Ahern said.
St Patrick’s week
Speaking to reporters at an EU summit in Brussels earlier, Enda Kenny called for clarity on the type of relationship Britain wants with the EU post-Brexit and what this could mean for Ireland.
In his weekly message, the Taoiseach said he will use his St Patrick’s week trip to the US to reaffirm Ireland’s commitment to the EU.
“Accordingly, the message I will take with me to the United States across the next seven days will be one of reassurance in terms of Ireland’s commitment to maintaining our current position as the gateway to Europe for US investors…
“Ireland’s absolute commitment to remain at the heart of Europe in spite of Brexit is set to be a theme of each and every ministerial visit abroad this St Patrick’s Day and I have asked each minister to report back to Cabinet on their return in this regard,” Kenny said.

Once the paragraph of legislation is enacted, it officially begins the process that will allow the UK to leave the European Union.
When it’s triggered, it marks two years of negotiations between the UK and the EU (some say that technically those talks have already begun, and it will in reality take years to complete Brexit talks).
“It’s been nine months now since that joyous morning on June 24th when we realised that Brexit had won the referendum,” ‘Brexiteer’ Nigel Farage said during aSky Newsinterview this morning.
It’s expected that Queen Elizabeth will give her Royal Assent for Article 50 today, which will mean Prime Minister Theresa May will be free to begin Brexit officially.
But May’s spokesperson yesterday played down speculation that she would send her notification letter to the European Council today.
“We have been clear that the prime minister will trigger Article 50 by the end of March,” her spokesperson said ahead of the vote, heavily emphasising the word “end”.
The latest reports suggest that the government is now looking to trigger Article 50 after a summit in Rome on 25 March to mark the EU’s 60th birthday.
PA ImagesPA Images
Yesterday, the parliament passed the Brexit bill (or the EU Withdrawal Bill), rejecting amendments that would have given a more certain status to EU immigrants, and would have allowed the parliament to veto Brexit.

Surprisingly shocked
“Of course I’m disappointed,” Nigel Farage said today about the delay of triggering Article 50.
Yesterday, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced yesterday that she would be asking Westminster to approve a second Scottish independence referendum so that the people of Scotland would have the option of choosing to remain in the UK outside the EU, or becoming an independent country as part of the EU.
Ben Stansall / PA ImagesBen Stansall / PA Images / PA Images
Many analysts said that May’s statement suggested she wasn’t expecting the announcement, as it mirrored a similar announcement from months ago released upon the issuing a Scottish poll showing a rise in favour of independence.
“We don’t believe that there should be a second referendum,” a spokesperson for Theresa May said in February.
“There has been a referendum, it was clear, decisive, it was legal, and both sides agreed to abide by the results of that referendum.”
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
The British government has the power to block Sturgeon’s request, but this would likely only energise the Scottish nationalists’ cause.
What a delay means
Although there were no official plans for the piece of legislation to be triggered, it had been expected that it would happen today.
Now reports suggest that those negotiations will be pushed back until the end of the month, prolonging the uncertainty in an already very confusing process.
This morning, Nigel Farage said the delay would mean that they wouldn’t be able to discuss Brexit at the Summit of European Leaders on the 6 April. According to Farage, those discussions now won’t happen until May.

Updated at 5pm
BRITAIN HAS SAID it will begin leaving the European Union on Wednesday next week, setting an historic and uncharted course to become the first country to withdraw from the bloc by March 2019.
Nine months after the stunning referendum vote for Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May’s government will finally trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty next week, starting a two-year exit process.
“We are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation,” said Brexit minister David Davis.
The European Commission said immediately that it was ready to begin negotiations, although a source in Brussels said it would take “four to six weeks” to arrange a summit to agree a common EU position.
Britain has said it wants to agree its divorce and a new relationship with Europe within the two years.
The deal would have to be agreed by all the EU’s national and some regional parliaments.
May’s Downing Street office repeated today that a deal is possible, although lawmakers have warned her government to prepare for failure – and for Britain to crash out of the EU with no agreement in place.
Special EU summit
The prime minister has long said she would start the Article 50 process by the end of this month.
Britain’s ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, this morning informed the office of EU President Donald Tusk that it would do so on March 29, her spokesman told reporters.
“We wish the talks to begin promptly, but we fully respect that the 27 (other EU nations) will want to agree their position in advance,” the spokesman said.

The notification of Article 50 will take the form of a letter to Tusk, followed by a statement by May to MPs in the House of Commons.
Tusk has said he would issue draft guidelines for the negotiations within 48 hours, although these will need to be approved by EU leaders.
A special summit had been pencilled in for April 6 but Britain’s timetable means this has now been pushed back to late April or early May, a European source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“We expect to need approximately four to six weeks to prepare and consult with the EU 27 member states,” the source said.

Britain’s path will be set just days after the EU celebrates the 60th anniversary of its founding Treaty of Rome with a special summit on March 25, which May will not be attending.
European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier will spearhead the talks with London.
“We are ready to begin negotiations,” Margaritis Schinas, the spokesman for European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, told a briefing.
The British government says the Brexit process is irreversible once Article 50 is triggered, although experts have said there is no legal ban on member states changing their minds before they have actually left the EU.
‘New positive partnership’
May’s preparations for Brexit were wrong-footed last week when Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to hold a new independence referendum in order to keep EU ties.
The prime minister is expected to visit Scotland before triggering Article 50, as part of a tour of Britain that began today in Wales and will also take in Northern Ireland.
“The government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union,” Davis said.
Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU in the June 23 referendum, while England and Wales voted to leave, resulting in a UK-wide vote of 52 percent for Brexit, and 48 percent against.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-theresa-may-speech-3189295-Jan2017/,"‘BREXIT MEANS BREXIT’, but what does that mean?
Despite British Prime Minister Theresa May keeping her cards close to her chest, her hand has been forced into revealing at least part of what her government’s Brexit plans are.
In order to keep to the planned timeline, May wasforced to concede a commitment to Labourthat she will give more details about what they are seeking from the EU in negotiations.
In a much-anticipated speech today, this will be laid out at the glitzy Lancaster House, a central London mansion usually used by the Foreign Office.
So what are we likely to hear? According to the weekend papers, May is expecting to announce a full withdrawal from some of the major institutions of the EU.
Namely: the EU’s single market, the European customs union and the European Court of Justice.
The Sun’s front page described this as ‘May’s triple Brexit blast’ and such a clean break from the EU would certainly constitute a so-called ‘hard Brexit’.

While the UK may have wanted to maintain some connection to the bloc, the EU has made it clear that free movement of citizens is a prerequisite to doing so. That’s something that Brexit hardliners couldn’t countenance.

With governments across the EU sure to be listening closely to what May has to say, Irish officials will be keen to see if the British PM makes any reference to bilateral relations and the future status of the Irish border.
This broad brushstroke speech may avoid going into such specifics, but May’s imminent visit to Ireland may mean it gets some mention.
In anticipation of May’s speech today sterling plunged to $1.1986 yesterday,  a 31-year low and its lowest level since October’s “flash crash”.
The pound has fallen sharply since Britain’s vote last June to exit the EU, pushing up share prices of multinationals and also having someunexpected consequences for consumers.
Yesterday, May won endorsement from Donald Trump over her Brexit course, with the US President-elect saying that Britain leaving the EUwould “end up as a great thing”.
Trump added in an interview with The Times newspaper that he would work for a trade deal with post-Brexit Britain “quickly and done properly”.

Updated 13.06pm
NICOLA STURGEON HAS told the Seanad that Ireland and Scotland can send a “powerful signal” around the world on the basis of their shared values.
Scotland’s First Minister is on a two-day visit to Dublin, and today became the first head of a foreign government to address the Seanad.
In his opening address, cathaoirleach Denis O’Donovan noted the historic links between the two countries, citing Robert the Bruce, St Colum Cille and the gaelic kingdom of Dál Riada – which included parts of Ireland and Scotland.
He also paid tribute to Sturgeon for “embodying the modern Scotland”.
In her speech, Sturgeon said: “It is a great honour to be invited to address all of you today… it is truly a historic day for all of us. It is wonderful to join you in these absolutely beautiful surroundings.”
She said she had the privilege of seeing the Book of Kells in Trinity College Dublin last night, underlining the deeply linked historic connections between Ireland and Scotland. She also noted the countries’ shared history of emigration.
Scotland is home to a third of the Syrian refugees welcomed to the UK, and Sturgeon also noted Ireland’s efforts to welcome refugees. Sturgeon said she has been hugely touched by the warm welcome extended to her by President Michael D. Higgins.
“Throughout the last four decades, an important context for our co-operation has been our shared place in the European Union,” she added, noting former president Mary Robinson’s comments on how the EU has heightened Ireland’s national self-confidence.
She said it was clear from her discussions with Irish ministers that Brexit is Ireland’s largest foreign policy issue since its entry to the EEC in 1973.

Sturgeon added that by working together, “our small nations” can deliver a big and powerful signal around the world on the basis of the countries’ shared values.
In welcoming the Scottish First Leader, Fine Gael deputy leader Dr James Reilly attempted to share his time with Enda Kenny’s constituency colleague Michelle Mulherin, but was informed that would not be possible by the chair.
Reilly noted that there were “many Celtic fans who follow the soccer” in Scotland in a very serious way.
Kenny meeting
Sturgeon’s visit to Dublin does not include a meeting with Enda Kenny. The Scottish leader said that their diaries meant that they met at the British-Irish Council last Friday instead.
While the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union earlier this year, a majority in Scotland voted to stay, after a passionate campaign led by Sturgeon’s Scottish National Party. Brexit thus provides much of the backdrop to the visit.
This morning Sturgeon praised the Taoiseach’s support for the Scottish government’s unique position, as it advocates for a ‘soft Brexit’ that will retain access to the EU single market for British – and Scottish – businesses.
Yet the issue is complicated by the opaque negotiating strategy taken by the Conservative government in London, and Kenny’s twin priorities of preserving good relations with the EU – and with British prime minister Theresa May in order to prevent a hard border.

Supportive
Sturgeon acknowledged the balancing act Kenny must strike in his bid to preserve a soft border between the Republic and the North.
“Enda Kenny has been extremely supportive of Scotland’s position, but he’s is the leader of an EU member state,” Sturgeon told RTÉ’sMorning Ireland.
“So when negotiations begin with the UK, he’s clearly going to be on the EU side of that negotiation.
“I think absolutely, in terms of Scotland, we have a friend and an ally in Ireland and in the Irish government.

Vatican
“I met Enda on Friday at the British-Irish Council, and I know he was in the Vatican yesterday. I would think I have a got a good relationship with Enda, he’s always very supportive of the Scottish position,” Sturgeon added.
“I had the great pleasure and privilege of meeting the president [Michael D Higgins] and Charlie Flanagan the foreign minister yesterday.”
The Scottish leader said the visit is about more than just Brexit, however. Scottish exports to Ireland are worth €1.32 billion, and Irish investment into Scotland currently supports more than 6,000 jobs.
“I don’t think anyone could look at the visit, and the good interactions between the Scottish and Irish governments and take conclusions from that whatsoever, other than the fact our diaries meant that we met on Friday rather than today.”

Divisions
Sturgeon believes the rest of the UK is now beholden to the internal politics of the London government – and the Conservative Party.
“I don’t think yet it has a clear idea of what it wants to achieve,” she added.
“There was no planning done for the Brexit vote,” she said, adding that not much seems to have been done in the five months since the Brexit referendum.
“So whichever direction the prime minister [Theresa May] chooses to take, she is at risk of upsetting one wing of her party.
“And immediately she backtracks on that, or appears to backtrack on that. So I think it crystallizes the position she is in. The party is divided.

Single market
While a narrow majority in England and Wales voted in favour of leaving the EU, those campaigning for Brexit insisted that businesses across the UK – including Scotland and Northern Ireland – would still gain access to the single market.
Yet the consensus across the European Union is that the UK cannot pick and choose to which of the EU’s four freedoms – goods, services, capital, and people – it adheres. And the leading Brexiteers in the Conservative Party are keen to reduce immigration.
Yet Scotland still harbours faint hopes that a compromise can be engineered.
“I want the UK to stay in the single market, I strongly agree that’s the least worst option in the wake of the Brexit result,” Sturgeon said.
“So I would hope that we can persuade the UK government to stay in the single market. I readily accept, the signals are not promising,” she added.
“I want to explore options for Scotland to do that… none of them are straightforward.

Independence
Sturgeon also left the door open to another independence referendum, if the UK goes for a hard Brexit without access to the European single market.
""If we get to a situation where Scotland is being taken off a hard Brexit cliff-edge, with seriously damaging implications for our economy, jobs, investment and living standards, then I think in those circumstances, Scotland will have the right to decide that that's the direction it wanted to take...
""That's very much on the table.""

https://www.thejournal.ie/russian-hackers-brexit-vote-3138361-Dec2016/,"A LABOUR MP has said Russian hackers “probably” influenced the Brexit referendum in the UK, where Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Speaking during a debate on Syria in the House of Commons today, Ben Bradshaw, a Remain campaigner, said: “I don’t think we have even begun to wake up to what Russia is doing when it comes to cyber warfare.
“Not only their interference, now proven, in the American presidential campaign, probably in our own referendum last year.
“We don’t have the evidence for that yet, but I think it’s highly probable.”

The former culture secretary added that Russian hackers will likely be involved in the upcoming French and German elections.
However, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said there is no evidence of hackers influencing the outcome of the Brexit vote.
He toldSky News: “I have not come across any evidence that Russian cyber warfare was used to influence the referendum.
Last week, US President Barack Obama ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review of election season cyberattacks.
US intelligence officials have accused Russia of hacking into Democratic officials’ email accounts in an attempt to interfere with the presidential campaign.

Earlier today, the British secretary for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire called an snap election for the 2 March – putting an official end to the powersharing government between Sinn Féin and the DUP.
Tonight, May and Kenny discussed the current situation in Northern Ireland, and their hopes for an election campaign would be respectful, and that they would return to a partnership under the Good Friday Agreement as soon as possible.
If the to-be elected officials of the Stormont Assembly can’t form a government – Sinn Féin have promised they won’t return to the ‘status quo’ – it’s been suggested that direct rule between London and Dublin might be put in place.

“No one should underestimate the challenge faced to the political institutions here in Northern Ireland and what is at stake,” Brokenshire said today in Belfast.
“I would strongly encourage the political parties to conduct this election with a view to the future of Northern Ireland and re-establishing a partnership government at the earliest opportunity.”

Kenny repeated the concerns Ireland have if a ‘hard’ Brexit were to come about, covering the economic and trading relationship, the common travel area, and the Northern Ireland Peace Process including border issues.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/opinion-if-we-chose-to-stick-with-the-uk-we-will-probably-go-backwards-3249166-Feb2017/,"WITH BREXIT IMMINENT, there are three choices facing Ireland. Firstly, we can continue to do what we are doing at present which is to be in the EU but try to continue having as many links to the UK as possible.
Secondly, Ireland could follow the UK and leave the EU. Or thirdly, Ireland could move closer to the rest of the EU.
We can’t have it both ways
The first option leaves Ireland in a position of weakness as it means that we want to have it both ways. Ireland is strongly dependent on business with the UK and therefore hopes for the least amount of change to that situation. This is neither wise nor realistic. It is not in the interest of the UK to offer Ireland many favours nor is it wise for Ireland to be seen by the rest of the EU wishing for an exemption to the future EU relationship with the UK.
The second option of Ireland also leaving the EU would be utterly ruinous for Ireland on so many levels. If the UK is going to be negatively affected by leaving the EU, Ireland would suffer multiple times more by also leaving the EU. We would end up back where we were in the 1930s – completely economically dependent on Britain. Foreign companies wanting to be based in the EU would quit Ireland and leave many people unemployed.
The last option is for Ireland to realign itself and move politically, economically and culturally closer to the EU.
EU statistics
The EU with 500 million people has the third largest population in the world after China and India. Even though the EU accounts for just 6.9% of the world’s population, the EU’s trade with the rest of the world accounts for around 20% of global exports and imports.
The EU’s economy of $16 trillion is larger than the USA’s economy. The EU is represented as a unified entity in the WTO. The euro is the second largest reserve currency and the second most traded currency in the world after the US dollar.
Ireland is part of the EU, it is part of the single market and it uses the euro as its currency. It would be economic suicide to leave the world’s biggest economy.
6 point plan for Ireland after Brexit
1.    Leave the Common Travel Area (CTA) and join the Schengen area.
No matter what the Government says, there will be a hard border in Ireland. This is an opportunity for Ireland to join the Schengen agreement as Iceland did.
Advertisement
2.    Switch to driving on the right side of the road.
75 % of countries in the world drive on the right side of the road. Ireland is in the minority. We should make the switch to the right side to become part of the European mainstream.
3.    Change plugs
Ireland should change its electrical plugs to the two-pin plug found across much of Europe. It will be better for consumers, tourists and businesses. Irish importers would be able to import electronic devices from the EU rather than from the UK.
4.    Intensive language learning
Ireland needs to regear its education policy so that everyone in Ireland can speak four languages fluently. Luxembourg is a small country that has a clear education policy – everyone learns four languages. Ireland can do the same. In fact, it must to be able to do that to have better relations with other EU states.
5.    More staff in Irish embassies in Europe
More officials should be sent to work in Irish embassies across the EU to promote Ireland for business and other exchanges. The embassies should assist Irish businesses to travel across the EU to find new customers.
6.    A reward in return for the English language
The English language in the EU is going to be downgraded. The EU will probably ask Ireland to designate English as another official language. The Irish Government should not roll over and do this unless it gets a major deal in return such as reform of the Common Fisheries Policy so that it is fairer to Irish fishermen.
With these six points, Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the EU will change and be better. It would be folly to try to act as if nothing has changed and that Ireland can still have such a tight economic dependency on the UK. If we stick to that approach, Ireland will suffer and not reap the rewards from being part of the largest economy of the world.
No matter what, changes have to happen. It is up to the Irish people and Government to be bold and not feel restricted or bound by the past. If we do, Ireland will move forward. If we choose to stick with the UK, we will probably go backwards.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/we-need-to-talk-about-brexit-and-cause-of-political-extremes-3196402-Jan2017/,"WHILE THERE HAS been widespread concern about the consequences of the UK’s Brexit decision and its implications for Ireland, there has been far less discussion of the causes of that Brexit vote.
Yet it is crucial that its causes be addressed or we are likely to see those causes strike again. The causes of Brexit are like those that led to the election of President Trump and to the growing support for political extremes across the EU.
The issues we must address
Growing inequality, failure to engage people in shaping the decisions that impact on them and a growing perception that the EU is really run by an elite in the interests of an elite, are among the main causes that must be addressed. Economic recovery has yet to be experienced by large numbers of people in Europe.
Many remain excluded as they continue to lose out in employment, education, healthcare, poverty and related services. This is undermining the confidence many people had in the European project because they see the EU constantly giving priority to economic issues ahead of social challenges.
New study
The situation in all 28 EU countries is analysed in a newstudyfrom Social Justice Ireland entitled: “Europe: The Excluded Suffer while Europe Stagnates” published today.
This study shows that long-term unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing the EU. Almost 11 million people in the EU are long-term unemployed and 6.6 million have been unemployed for more than two years. This is a very worrying trend.
The youngest and oldest workers in the EU have been hardest hit by long-term unemployment. Young workers were most affected by long-term unemployment before and during the recession. While older workers are less likely to become unemployed than younger workers, once they become long-term unemployed they face greater difficulties in finding a new job.
This creates the potential for long-term marginalisation of these groups.

Efficient social policies make a difference
The best performing Member States in the EU in economic terms have ambitious and efficient social policies as a central part of their growth model. These countries have a total tax-take well above the EU average and provide more opportunities for every individual to participate broadly in things like education, health services and the labour market.
They are also some of the most competitive countries in the world, and include Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
Inequality divides societies
Inequalities in Europe’s social situation bring risks of a breakdown in social cohesion both within and between countries. Great disparities in wealth and power divide society into rich and poor, powerful and powerless, and this weakens the bonds between people and divides society between the lucky and the left out.
Societies are now faced with profound questions for public policy based on emerging technologies, the changing nature of work, and the differential impact on various demographic groups.
Europe must be not only concerned with the goal of budgetary consolidation and the resolution of the debt crisis, but also with promoting justice, equality and social inclusion.
Economic priorities still dominate social priorities
The report concludes that unfortunately, in Europe, economic priorities still dominate social priorities. There is a perception the European technocrats are insulated from the experience of the poorer people of Europe, something that is corrosive of trust in the whole European project.
Leadership at EU level in relation to vulnerable groups will prove critical not just to the future economic and social outlook but also to the democratic future of Europe.
Report’s Recommendations
The report recommends that to address important challenges including long-term unemployment the EU should:

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/theresa-mays-brexit-plan-3191098-Jan2017/,"THERESA MAY’S SPEECH was some piece of work. She seems to think the EU and the UK are negotiating on an equal basis. It’s a dangerous game of chicken. It’s like a hostage taker. She’s saying: “Give me the deal I want or the 64 million Brits get it”.
And, the more clarity that Theresa May tries to bring to the Brexit process, the more questions there are. There was hope that the New Year would bring some clarity on what we can expect from Brexit, or at least from the negotiations.
Staking out the UK’s negotiating position
Today’s landmark speech was intended to stake out the UK’s negotiating position. What we saw instead was long on soundbites and platitudes, and short on detail. It seems Prime Minister May’s objective is to have all of the benefits from EU membership without the EU membership.
There has been a hardening of positions by EU and UK leaders as we near Prime Minister May’s self-imposed deadline for triggering Article 50. While this may not be surprising as each enters unprecedented and unpredictable negotiations, it is not good news for the Irish economy.
Ireland have most to lose from Brexit
History and geography has tied the Irish and UK economy together through trade, and while the share of trade between the countries has reduced since both joined the European Union, they share approximately €1 billion in trade every week. The impact of, at best, currency fluctuations and, at worst, the imposition of tariffs will be substantial and damaging.
Brexit will be painful for the Irish economy, and the harder the Brexit the more pain we can expect. In the last week or so, EU leaders, from Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, which holds the EU Presidency for the first half of 2017, to Chancellor Angela Merkel have insisted that the UK cannot pick and choose the elements of the EU it wishes to retain, gaining access to the single market without free movement of labour.
UK is overplaying its hand
At the same time Prime Minister Theresa May seems to believe that the UK can retain access to the single market, because it will be in the interests of both parties, even if the UK does not accept free movement. There is a sense that the UK is overplaying its hand. Even as Article 50 is triggered and negotiations begin, it is unlikely that 2017 will bring about much more clarity on the likely outcome of Brexit.
The softer options are better for the UK, and for Ireland, though they may involve UK contributions to the EU to access the single market and/ or free movement of people between the UK and the EU. Both of these would not be politically palatable in the UK.
British government clearly doesn’t have a plan for Brexit and is scrambling to find one

This explains the sometimes contradictory messages coming from the British government, meaningless statements such as the “red, white, and blue Brexit”, and suggesting the UK can have it all.
The Conservative government has committed to providing a strategy for Brexit to parliament in advance of invoking Article 50. It is unlikely that strategy will be comprehensive or enlightening, and the government will claim that a more detailed plan would hamper their negotiations.
In the meantime, EU leaders sit and wait for the British to get their act together. There is little incentive for Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, and other leaders of larger EU members to adopt anything other than their best poker faces. The Brexit process is unprecedented and triggering Article 50 will set in train a series of negotiations whose outcome is unpredictable.
European leaders won’t prioritise Brexit
In this context it makes sense to be non-committal and let the British come with their opening offer. Even after a formal application to leave is submitted, the European leaders are unlikely to prioritise Brexit negotiations. They have their own domestic concerns with elections scheduled in France, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2017.
Two critical factors that will need to be clarified early in the negotiations process are whether an Article 50 application to leave can be withdrawn and whether there can be a “transition period” beyond the two years allowed for in Article 50.
The first matter may become an issue before the Irish courts shortly. Even without these legal complications, it is difficult to overstate how substantial the Brexit process will be. For example, the UK has not negotiated a trade deal on its own in over 40 years.
It is unlikely that any civil servants have experience of doing so. EU laws, rules, and regulations are embedded in British laws over the last 40 years and it will be arduous to unpick all of them.
There is a risk that 2017 could also see a UK election
It could be prompted by Prime Minister May seeking to strengthen her hand going into negotiations and trying to take advantage of ongoing Labour party troubles. On the other hand, perceived failures in negotiations might embolden Brexiteers to seek to replace her as Conservative leader.
Signs that EU leaders are being tough on single market access and the movement of people could feed perceptions among hardliners that the unwelcome soft Brexit has to be opposed from the top of the government. Ireland has more at stake than any other EU member from Brexit. However, our worries are not likely to be eased much in 2017 as British and EU leaders begin negotiations.
The ultimate shape of Brexit will only emerge in 2018 and beyond, and in the meantime we can expect more uncertainty and posturing from British and EU leaders. The Irish need to persist in making our case, but it may be some time before the decision-makers turn their heads to listen.

https://www.thejournal.ie/esri-economic-growth-3119751-Dec2016/,"A NEW REPORT from the ESRI on the medium-term outlook for the Irish economy says that while the outlook for the economy is generally good, threats to foreign direct investment, post-Brexit, and the problems with the supply of housing could pose big risks.
According to the think-tank, the Irish economy can sustainably grow by 3% each year until 2025.
The report warns, however, that Britain leaving the EU is likely to have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy.
Additionally, a gap between the amount of deposits in banks and the expected level of credit required for housing could give rise to “concerns about the emergence of another credit fuelled bubble”.
Growth
The ESRI said that the “sustainable long-term real growth rate” of the Irish economy was around 3%, despite recent warnings from watchdog body the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that growth projections forwere “far from assured”.
This predicted growth will be underpinned by the continued increase in the number of people working, which is expected to rise by 2% each year.
The demand for workers will also reduce the unemployment rate to just over 6% in the medium term, according to the ESRI.
Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to remain “relatively low” at 2% per year.

Warnings
The latest ESRI report looked at the opportunities and threats that Brexit could throw up for Ireland, especially in terms of foreign direct investment.
It said that while there was potential for Ireland to benefit from foreign direct investment relocation from the UK after Brexit, this was entirely dependent on global demand.
If the world economy continued to perform well and firms relocated their operations and investment from the UK to Ireland post-Brexit, then GDP could increase by 3%.
However, if Brexit was to be accompanied by a downturn in the global economy, these positive effects would be negligible.
Similarly, proposed changes to corporate tax rules across Europe could damage Ireland’s competitiveness.
Housing
The ESRI estimates that, by 2024, housing demand could reach up to 30,000 units per annum. Currently, the demand for housing is around 23,000 per year.
As part of Minister Simon Coveney’s Rebuilding Ireland Plan, the the Build More Homes initiative has ambitious targets todouble the annual level of houses being built to 25,000 homes.
However, this increase is likely to place a significant strain on the banking sector, as ESRI analysis suggests that the “traditional deposit base” in Irish banks will be “unable to fund the level of credit required to meet the housing demands of the economy”.
The report said:
The ESRI added that prudent measures can be adopted to “reflect the changing circumstances in the market” to prevent such a bubble occurring again.

TODAY AT AROUND 12.30pm, British Prime Minister Theresa May will trigger Article 50.
That will formally begin the two-year negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, where regulations around trade, fishing boundaries, visas and endless other regulations will be renegotiated.
In the lead up and aftermath of the triggering of Article 50, the world will be watching. An indication of how the crucial Brexit negotiations will go will be measured in how Europe’s leaders react (with congratulations, or cynicism?) and how the markets behave.
US President Donald Trump’s commentary will also be influential, as always.
Article 50 is a part of the Lisbon Treaty, or the European Union agreement, that allows a country to leave the EU.
It was added after Greenland had to get the approval of all other EU member states before they left in 1985.
Article 50 is as follows:
The UK is bound by their constitution to carry out the results of referenda (Ireland is not similarly bound by their constitution).

According to theGuardian, the UK’s representative in Brussels Tim Barlow is to personally hand over a letter from the British government to the European Council president, Donald Tusk.
This is significant – although there is much reportage about the two-year period assigned to renegotiate a new relationship between the UK and the EU, in reality the time can be extended.

But the longer negotiations take, the worse off both sides will be, as it creates uncertainty for businesses looking to invest or open operations in the EU or the UK.

Once it’s activated, there’s no turning back, say UK and European lawyers, which is why activating Article 50 is considered to be so significant.
If Britain decide they want to rejoin the EUaftertriggering Article 50, it means they will have to reapply like any other country, as stated below:
(Article 49 says: “Any European State which respects the values referred to in Article 2 and is committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the Union.” )

So triggering Article 50 is quite a straightforward process, considering it hasn’t been done before.
What’s less clear is how negotiations will go, and what the reaction will be to the official beginning of Brexit.
After Article 50 is triggered this afternoon, the reaction of EU leaders to the action will be a good indicator of how negotiations will progress.

Donald Trump’s comments will also be significant (he’ll probably congratulate Theresa May and make a jab at the EU).
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s reaction will also be significant – its parliament last night voted to make a formal request to the British government to hold a new referendum on independence.
Here at home, Taoiseach Enda Kenny and relevant ministers are expected to issue their responses this afternoon.
The markets are also expected to react: billions were wiped off the British stock exchange in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, followed by a dramatic surge two days later.
“First the panic effect, then the rebound. That’s a well-known mechanism on financial markets,” said Christopher Dembik, an economist at Saxo Banque in Paris saidat the time.

https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-brexit-minister-3307451-Mar2017/,"THE VAST MAJORITY of Irish people think Enda Kenny should step aside as Brexit Minister when he leaves office, according to a recent poll.
The Red C/ Sunday Business Post poll shows that 60% of those polled think that Kenny should relinquish his title as Brexit Minister once he resigns as Taoiseach.
Although Kenny hasn’t officially announced when he will leave, he’s expected to give a timeline for his departure soon – sometime after 29 April is one reported deadline.

That’s the date set for the European Council – a summit that will set the negotiating criteria for talks between the EU and UK.
Kenny has signaled that he wishes to stay on to ensure Brexit negotiations and talks in Northern Ireland progress smoothly – a move Simon Coveney, who’s a leading candidate for the Fine Gael leadership described as ‘unsurprising’.
The same poll also showed that People were split on whether there should be a general election when Enda Kenny steps down and there’s another Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach.
The poll also showed that the vast majority of people didn’t think the government had a clear plan to deal with Brexit (68%) and that 58% of people thought that a united Ireland was the best way to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-article-50-3201973-Jan2017/,"THIS MORNING, THE Supreme Court in the UK ruled triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treatymust be put before Parliament before Brexit can happen.
Supreme Court president, Lord David Neuberger, said that leaving the EU would fundamentally change the UK’s constitution.
He said that it is something which “renders it impermissible for the government to withdraw from the EU Treaties without prior Parliamentary authority”.
What does this mean?
As with passing a bill here in Ireland, it often takes weeks, or months, for a bill to be go from initial debate stage to becoming approved and enshrined in law.
Now that Theresa May’s government will have to go to House of Commons to approve Brexit, she will need the support of all of her Conservative majority to ensure that it goes through the house as quickly as possible.
While a large number of Conservative MPs advocated to leave the EU, it is likely that members from all parties who advocated to remain – including pro-remain Conservatives, Labour, and the Scottish National Party – will table amendments to the motions and bills to delay its passage through Parliament.
Stefan Rosseau PA Wire / PA ImagesStefan Rosseau PA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
It will give MPs from across the house a chance to debate the issues before the UK begins its negotiations with the EU on leaving.
It is expected that the government will be forced to divulge more details on how it will conduct these negotiations through a parliamentary debate, and that will then be the subject of fierce debate.
After it clears the House of Commons, it will have to go through the House of Lords where the government has no clear majority.
While it will have to go before Parliament in Westminster, the Conservative government will not have to consult with devolved assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before it acts to leave the EU.

This is despite the fact that both the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.
This is likely to be a relief to the government, as gaining approval from these assemblies – particularly the current dissolved Northern assembly – would be particularly tricky.
Time is short to meet May’s target of triggering Article 50 by the end of March, but Downing Street has already indicated that date is still the target.

Downing Street says Prime Minister still intends to hit Article 50 by end of March, despite Supreme Court ruling.
A statement from the Prime Minister said: “The government will deliver on their verdict – triggering Article 50, as planned, by the end of March. Today’s ruling does not change that”.
Any debate, then, will need to happen soon.
Any chance Brexit might not happen?
Almost certainly not.
The British people did vote to leave the EU and, despite many of their views and convictions on the matter, an MP voting to block Brexit in a parliamentary vote would be unprecedented.
The Conservative government has filled its senior positions with MPs who campaigned to leave the EU, such as Boris Johnson.
The leader of the opposition, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, has said he will order all Labour MPs to vote in favour of triggering article 50.
He has said he will use the parliamentary debate to prevent the Conservatives ruling the EU negotiations.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-turkey-3210700-Jan2017/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has urged Turkey to maintain the rule of law and observe its human rights obligations in the wake of a failed coup on 15 July last.
Speaking after talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, May said she was “proud” Britain had stood with Turkey’s democratically-elected government when the coup struck.
“Now it is important that Turkey sustains that democracy by maintaining the rule of law and upholding its international human rights obligations, as the government has undertaken to do,” she said.
May stressed that Turkey was one of Britain’s “oldest friends” with relations going back over 400 years, referring to the establishment of relations between the Ottoman Empire and England under Elizabeth I.
The premier is seeking a delicate balance in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, expressing keen interest in expanding trade with Turkey but also echoing European alarm over the magnitude of the crackdown since the failed coup.
Fighter jet
Meanwhile, Britain’s BAE Systems signed a deal with Turkey’s national aerospace firm to develop a new generation of Turkish fighter jets, the British government said in a statement.
Under the deal signed in Ankara during May’s visit, BAE Systems and state-owned Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) will establish a partnership for the development of the TF-X fighter jet.
Commenting on the agreement, May said it indicated Britain is “a great, global, trading nation and that we are open for business”, after the Brexit vote saw the country seeking new partners for trade.
“It marks the start of a new and deeper trading relationship with Turkey and will potentially secure British and Turkish jobs and prosperity for decades to come,” May added.
The deal is a so-called Heads of Agreement which is non-binding and will only be obligatory once formal contracts are signed.

The initial phase is worth over £100 million (about €117 million), Downing Street said.
Trade
May also said Britain and Turkey had agreed to set up a working group to boost bilateral trade.
“We have agreed that we will have a joint working group to prepare the ground for our post-Brexit trading relationship,” May said.
Erdogan said the two sides were targeting increasing annual trade from over $15 billion to $20 billion.
May said that they had discussed the prospects for enhancing trade in the talks.
“We both want to build on our existing links and I believe that doing so will be to the benefit of both of our countries and for the prosperity of both our nations,” she said.
Erdogan added: “We discussed what kind of joint steps we could take in the defence industry.”
Syria
The pair also discussed the battle against jihadists in Syria and efforts to reunify Cyprus, where both Ankara and London are guarantor powers.
The British premier said security on air transport was also a key issue.
“We also agreed to step up our work together on aviation security with a programme of shared training and information exchange,” May said.

We are well-informed as to the problems; now is the time to focus on solutions.
The Government has identified the impact on the economy, Northern Ireland and preserving the common travel area as its priorities in the negotiations.
The Seanad Special Select Committee
The Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is a newly established Seanad committee, tasked with finding possible solutions to the challenges Brexit poses, in order to produce a report that will better inform negotiations.
In terms of membership, the Committee represents a wide spectrum of senators, all with differing opinions and experiences, but we are wholly united in our goal of contributing to trying to make Brexit as positive as possible for Ireland.
The varied areas of expertise from which our members are drawn will facilitate a more considered debate of the possible solutions to the uncertainty and challenges Brexit brings.
Constructive, positive input from the Seanad can and will now play an important role in laying the groundwork for a solutions-based approach to the negotiations.
Focusing on solutions not problems
As Chairman of the Seanad Special Select Committee, I will ensure that we will not spend our months analysing the problems Brexit poses.
Valuable work has already been done by numerous Joint Oireachtas Committees, who continue to produce reports on the potential impact that Brexit could have on jobs, trade, exports, investment, travel and the movement of people.
My Committee will now set about building on that work by holding a series of hearings that will specifically focus on the solutions to the many problems identified. To do this, we will invite experts and leading Brexit campaigners to come before the Committee.
The chairs of those Oireachtas Committees that have produced sectoral reports on Brexit will be invited to address the Seanad in plenary session, in order to facilitate substantial engagement on the recommendations contained within those reports.
Advertisement
The Seanad Special Select Committee will use the reports’ recommendations as the starting point for our work, taking an all-encompassing view of the sectoral issues. Our task is not to analyse once again the challenges posed by Brexit; the writing is on the wall and the UK will soon exit the EU. Our job is to find constructive potential solutions to the problems and work to safeguard Ireland’s strategic interests.
Timeframe
Our Committee will produce a report by the end of June 2017, which will form part of the overall negotiation strategy.
This report will be sent to all government departments, all member state governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.
In February of this year, I was part of a cross-party delegation that travelled to Brussels for talks with EU Chief Negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier.
The report published by the Committee in June will be in response to a direct request for solutions from Mr Barnier and it is the Committee’s hope that the report will further inform negotiations.
Mitigating risks while looking for positives
As the UK withdraws from the EU, economic opportunities will arise and Ireland must aggressively pursue those opportunities, so while we remain mindful of the risks Brexit poses and will continue to work to mitigate those risks, we also have to look for positives.
In particular, we now need to look further East, beyond our traditional Anglo-Saxon markets, and assess the possibilities for Irish exports in the Asian markets and indeed, in other member states.
Ireland’s future is tied to Europe, but our relationship with the UK will always be vital. Ireland has an economic, historical, political, social and cultural relationship with the UK unlike any other member state of the EU; a relationship which literally spans centuries.
The Irish and UK economies are highly inter-dependent, notwithstanding our common access to the wider European single market. The peace process will undoubtedly be impacted by the UK departure; and the sizeable Irish community in the UK also have concerns about their status once the UK leaves the Union.
For these reasons and others, it is vital that we now stop analysing the many challenges Brexit brings and focus instead on what our future relationship with the European Union is going to look like, as well as how we can mitigate the negative effects of the UK departure on the peoples of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Neale Richmond is a Fine Gael Senator and Chairman of the Seanad Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The Committee will hold its first meeting today at 11am in the Seanad chamber.

Speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kenny wasasked by CNBC International’s Steve Sedgwickwhether Ireland’s government was stable.
“It is, and it means that you think differently,” Kenny said.
“It means that you reach out to other parties, that you hear other voices, that you work on a programme which is published, which is transparent and accountable and you sign deals with other parties on certain issues to keep government working in the interest of the people.”

The Taoiseach was asked twice whether he felt there should be an Irish election this year, with Sedgwick putting it to him that the Irish election showed the country’s electorate is angry along with other populations in Europe.

He reiterated that both he and British Prime Minister Theresa May have agreed that they do not want to see a return to a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Kenny acknowledged there is not solution on this yet but said he was confident one would be found.
“In terms of the border, there will only be the one land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland when Britain is removed, removes itself from the European Union,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-lawyer-brexit-case-irish-court-3131605-Dec2016/,"A BRITISH LAWYER has launched a crowdfunding campaign to challenge Article 50 – the process of the UK leaving the European Union – in the Irish High Court.
Jolyon Maugham QC, who is based in London, had campaigned against Brexit.
He launched theonline campaigntonight and is hoping to raise £70,000 (about €83,000) to cover the costs of an action in the High Court here. It will aim to establish whether an Article 50 notification sent by the UK would be revocable at a future date.
The defendants would be the Irish State, the European Council and the European Commission and the plaintiffs would be UK MEPs.
On Wednesday, MPs backed a vote to trigger Article 50 by next March.

A statement released by Maughan tonight said: “The claim alleges that Article 50 may, in fact, already have been triggered. If it has been triggered then the Commission is in breach of its Treaty duties through wrongly refusing to commence negotiations with the UK. But if it has not, the Council and Irish State are in breach of their Treaty duties in wrongly excluding the United Kingdom from Council meetings.
“The plaintiffs will say that they suffer a prospective deprivation of their rights associated with these breaches. And that to resolve these disputes it will be necessary to refer certain questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union.”
‘People deserve answers’
Speaking about his decision to launch the campaign, Maugham said:
“Put aside the legal niceties, what no one can dispute is that there are incredibly important questions to answer.
“Everyone – those who voted leave and remain; the people and government of Ireland – deserves to know the answer to these questions. People must plan their lives. Businesses need certainty to invest.
“The people of Ireland are entitled to a government that can work for the best possible future for Ireland. It’s right that we all have the maximum certainty that the law can give. And referring these questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union is the only way to deliver that certainty.”

Updated 20.00
FRANCOIS FILLON HAS taken a strong lead in the run-off of France’s right-wing presidential primary early results show.
Fillon, a conservative former prime minister, had 68.7% of the vote to 31.3% for his centrist rival Alain Juppe, results from 3,565 out of 10,229 polling stations suggest.
Right-wing voters flocked to the polls for a second week running to pick the candidate expected to face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election next May.
Between 4.2 and 4.6 million people cast ballots in today’s run-off, according to an Elabe estimate for BFM television.
Some 4.3 million took part in the first round on 20 September which Fillon won by 44.1% to Juppe’s 28.5%.
The US-style primary contest, the first for the party, is a battle between socially conservative and economic “radical” Fillon and the more moderate Juppe, also a former prime minister who is nine years older at 71.
The French presidential vote is seen as a key test for mainstream political parties after the success of Donald Trump in the United States and the Brexit campaign in Britain, both of which harnessed anti-elite, anti-establishment anger.
Polls opened at 7am Irish time, with all French voters who pay €2 and state they share the values of the centre-right allowed to cast a ballot.
Whoever wins will face fierce competition from far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who is waiting in the wings ready to attack the victor as a symbol of France’s ruling class.
Fillon, a career politician and prime minister from 2007 until 2012, has warned that France is “on the verge of revolt” and believes his plan to slash 500,000 public sector jobs and business regulations is the tonic the demoralised country needs.
Alain JuppeBob EdmeBob Edme
“I’ll do everything for entrepreneurs!” he declared at his final rally on Friday night in Paris, promising to help businesses create the jobs needed to lower France’s stubbornly high unemployment rate of around 10%.
The devout Catholic and motor racing fan has also won support with his hard line on Muslim immigrants, as well as an emphasis on protecting France’s identity, language and family values.
He has demanded that “the Islamic religion accept what all the others have accepted in the past… that radicalism and provocation have no place here”.

Happy France?
Juppe, meanwhile, has made a pitch for the centre-ground, accusing his opponent of wanting to reform France with “brutality” with an unrealistic programme that has drawn support from the far-right.
As well as promising to shrink the French state, Juppe’s signature announcement was a promise to seek a “happy identity” for multicultural France despite worries about the threat of immigration and Islamic extremism.
“I am best placed with my programme to beat Marine Le Pen,” Juppe said on the last day of campaigning on Friday.

He has also sought to highlight Fillon’s conservative views on abortion and gay marriage, as well as his closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin who praised Fillon last week as a “very principled person”.
But it is Fillon who has all the momentum heading into today’s vote.
He won the first round of the primary last Sunday with 44% and has since picked up endorsements from party heavyweights including former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was knocked out on the same weekend in perhaps a final blow to his political career.
Several surveys last week forecast Fillon to emerge as winner today with around 60%, but after a topsy-turvy year that has made fools of analysts and pollsters, no one should take his victory for granted.
Unpredictable election
As well as Le Pen, today’s winner will face competition in next year’s vote from a Socialist party candidate, probably President Francois Hollande who appears intent on trying to defy his historically-low approval ratings.
After a troubled five years in power, a survey on Friday showed current Prime Minister Manuel Valls would be a far more popular candidate than Hollande.
Valls did not exclude making a run at the candidacy in the socialist primary, saying “I will make my decision with a clear conscience”, in an interview published by the weekly Journal du Dimanche.
Hollande’s former protégé and economy minister, 38-year-old Emmanuel Macron, is also set to stand for the presidency as a centrist independent, injecting some youth and another element of uncertainty into the race.
Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melanchon is also likely to draw votes away from mainstream parties in a trend seen in elections across Europe following years of austerity and anger over globalisation and job losses.
Current polls forecast that Le Pen and the Republicans’ candidate will make it through to the final run-off round of the election in May, with the latter set to win by drawing moderate voters from the right and left to block the far-right.

On 23 June British citizens voted to leave the European Union – and will become the first country to do so. This sparked a lot of questions over the future of the EU, the future of the United Kingdom, and the future of democracy itself – as there was some speculation that people had been ‘sold a lie’ and didn’t fully understand what they were voting for.

French authorities cleared the camp of the thousands of migrants that had settled there in the hope of travelling to Britain. The camp was demolished in the space of a week because structures were deemed unsafe; meanwhile residents were directed to different ‘reception’ areas around France – but it’s not certain if all have arrived.

Merkel will have her own challenges ahead too. Germany have an election in the new year, and with stiff opposition from within her own party over her ‘open borders’ policy towards migrants, it’s going to be a tough year for Europe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-brexit-2-3143311-Dec2016/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS ruled out a bilateral agreement with Britain ahead of Brexit talks between the UK and the EU.
Enda Kenny says Ireland will stand with the other 26 countries within the union.
He added that we wouldn’t be allowed to try and sign a private deal with Britain, despite calls from politicians there.
It comes after The UK’s House of Lords suggested a bilateral deal with Ireland would be the best way to guarantee the future of Northern Ireland and the border.
Butspeaking to reporters as he was leaving a summit of EU leadersin Brussels last night, Enda Kenny said it wasn’t discussed at the summit and isn’t possible.
EU leaders wound up an all-day summit last night where UK Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed the UK would formally withdraw from the EU in March.

She added that she would prioritise the status of British citizens working in the EU as well as EU citizens in the UK.
Two-year divorce process
Near the end of the summit, Theresa May left while the other 27 EU leaders briefly discussed the process for Britain’s departure.
The leaders said in a statement they had agreed to allow European Parliament representatives into preparatory talks for Brexit, after the assembly’s leader Martin Schulz warned that they could block an eventual deal if MEPs were frozen out.
The EU has rejected all negotiations until Britain officially triggers the two-year divorce process, expected in March but May said she did not feel she had been snubbed. She said:
The British government separately rejected a report yesterday that its ambassador to the EU had warned that it could take up to 10 years to agree a new trade deal after Brexit.
“This is the ambassador reflecting the views of others which have been put to him,” May’s spokesman said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-high-court-case-3184347-Jan2017/,"A BRITISH LAWYER is bringing a case before the Irish High Court to ask whether the United Kingdom can go back on its decision to leave the European Union.
The argument revolves around whether British politicians can decide to remain in the EU if the deal they’re offered as part of the Brexit negotiations isn’t good enough.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March, in which 2-year negotiations begin to determine Britain’s new relationship with European Union member states.
Britain has voiced its desire to remain part of the EU free trade agreement, but want limits on the free movement of people, while EU leaders say that those two policies cannot be separated from one another.
The crowdfunded court case will ask the Irish High Court to refer this detail of law to the European Court of Justice to clarify what can be done in the event of a bad deal.
‘Slicing the apple’
Queen’s Counsel Jolyon Maugham toldRTÉ Newsthat he aims to bring the case before the Irish High Court on the 27 January and won’t reveal the political backers to the motion until then.

“It’s a short point of law, but this is really important stuff,” he toldRTÉ’s Morning Ireland.”Not just for the United Kingdom, but for the whole European Union, and in particular, for Ireland.”
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Maugham says they plan to argue their case based on the argument that there’s already been a breaches in the way Brexit has been handled.
“If Article 50 has been triggered, then you ought to have begun negotiations with us. If it hasn’t been triggered, then you oughtn’t be excluding us from council meetings.”
This is based on reports that Theresa May has been excluded from some meetings on the future of the EU in the aftermath of the UK’s June referendum on membership.
He says that there were numerous reasons for choosing to take the case to an Irish court, but in reality it could have been taken to any court – except a British one.
“It’s very difficult given the rather angry press that we have over here for judges to contemplate referring the question of EU law to the proper arbiter.
“Whether the question is asked by a UK court or a Dublin court makes no difference. The same court gets to answer it and that’s the Court of Justice.”
Although the result of the Brexit referendum was 52% in favour of leaving the European Union, the British government is under no legislative obligation to act on the results.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-ind-ref-3196065-Jan2017/,"
THE COUNTDOWN TO a second Scottish independence referendum appears to have begun after Prime Minister Theresa May laid out the course towards a “hard” Brexit – but Scots are as divided as ever.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said another vote was “more likely” than ever after May outlined her plan to pull the country out of the EU’s single market despite Scotland’s objections this week.
“Time is fast running out for the UK government to convince us that they care one jot about Scotland’s interests,” Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament on Thursday.
“If they don’t, Scotland does face a choice: do we go down the damaging path set out by Theresa May… or do we want to take control over the future of our country?”
Following a meeting with Brexit minister David Davis on Thursday, Sturgeon’s representative Mike Russell said: “The clock is ticking”.
Scotland voted in 2014 by a margin of 55 to 45 percent to stay in the United Kingdom.
But Sturgeon argues that last year’s vote for Brexit has left Scotland in “uncharted waters” since a majority of Scots instead opted to stay in the EU.
She has put forward proposals for Scotland to be allowed to remain in the single market even as the rest of Britain leaves and has drafted an independence referendum bill just in case.
Her independence ally Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens whose votes she needs to get a second referendum through parliament, has predicted it will be held some time in 2018.
‘Tension in the family’
The dilemma for Sturgeon is that many Scots say the EU referendum has not changed their minds on independence.
The latest poll of 1,002 respondents carried out by BMG Research for the Herald newspaper last month found 55 percent against and 45 percent in favour — the same split as in the 2014 vote.

Mother and daughter Irene and Cara Henney, from Paisley on the edge of Glasgow, are typical of the generational divide seen in both the independence and EU referendums.
Irene, 55, who works in sales, said no to independence but yes to Brexit.
“Sturgeon has lost sight of what matters to the Scottish people, like health and education… By calling for a second referendum she’s probably alienating a lot of people,” she said.

Cara, 18, a student, voted yes to independence in her first ever national vote after the Scottish government lowered the voting age to 16.
Cara missed the EU referendum, which was reserved for over-18s, but said she would have voted to stay.
“While I don’t agree with some of Sturgeon’s priorities, now that Scotland is being taken out of the EU against its will she is giving us an opportunity to fight back,” she said.
Asked about the differences with her mother, she said: “It does cause some tension in the family”.
Stuart Salter, 34, a town planner from Edinburgh, voted No to independence and wants to remain in the EU.
He said: “The Brexit vote hasn’t changed my mind about independence.
“Driving Scotland towards another independence referendum will only add to the present uncertainty”.
Campbell Fraser, 50, a drama workshop director from Clarkston, south of Glasgow, said he wanted Scotland to be an independent EU member state.
“We have to make sure we win because I don’t think we’ll get another chance in my lifetime,” he said.
Forced independence bid?
Political experts believe Sturgeon may be left with little choice but to call a referendum.
But Michael Keating, director of the Economic and Social Research Council’s Centre on Constitutional Change, told AFP: “There is no sign whatsoever that the UK government is going to take (Sturgeon’s) proposals seriously.
“They have to say they are, because if they reject it out of hand, they will be playing right into the Scottish government’s hands,” he said.
Nicola McEwen, professor of Territorial Politics at Edinburgh University, said Sturgeon had left no “compromise position” for Scotland.
“The worry for the Scottish government is if you hold a second referendum and lose it, you lose the leverage for Scotland within the United Kingdom.
“But if the situation is such that there doesn’t appear to be much leverage now anyway, the Scottish government may decide it has nothing to lose.”

BRITAIN’S AMBASSADOR TO the European Union criticised London’s serious lack of negotiating experience ahead of Brexit talks, hours after announcing his resignation yesterday.
Ivan Rogers stepped down from his role less than three months before Britain is due to begin talks to leave the bloc, cutting short his term which was due to end in October.
A highly-regarded diplomat, Rogers was criticised last month for saying it would take 10 years for Britain to conclude a trade deal with the EU.
In a lengthy resignation email to staff at UKRep, the office which represents Britain in negotiations in the EU, he urged colleagues to speak up even when their views were not welcome.
“I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power.

“I hope that you will support each other in those difficult moments where you have to deliver messages that are disagreeable to those who need to hear them,” Rogers said in the note, published by The Times newspaper.
Rogers, who has held the post since November 2013 and previously served as prime minister David Cameron’s Europe adviser, also criticised the British government’s lack of preparation for the divorce proceedings.
“Serious multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in Whitehall, and that is not the case in the Commission or in the Council,” said Rogers, pinpointing a gap in preparedness for Brexit talks between the British government and EU institutions.
Britain voted 52% in favour of leaving the bloc in the country’s 23 June referendum and anti-EU campaigners have since claimed Rogers has a pessimistic view of Brexit.
But supporters of the outgoing EU envoy have meanwhile praised him for being a realist, with credibility gained from his lengthy experience.

Glenn Caton, who is in charge of Cadbury in the UK,told the Guardianthat the company would have to adapt to the terms of Brexit – but committed to future manufacturing there.
The company may eventually have to pass on the higher cost of doing business to customers by selling smaller products for the same price.
He said there were three priorities for the company as Brexit approached – a strong economy; no introduction of new, complex regulation; and security for staff from the 50-odd different nationalities who work at its Bournville plant.
If the Brexit deal doesn’t deliver, the company will have to adapt, he said,telling the paper:

Founded 1824 in Birmingham, Cadbury was taken over by Mondelez International, a US company, in 2010.
Cadbury Ireland employs staff at its Coolock plant in north Dublin and at its chocolate crumb factory in Rathmore, Kerry. Mondelez cut 200 jobs in Ireland in 2015.
Cadbury supports additional jobs in Ireland,according to the company website, through the purchase of local milk, sugar beet, packaging and a range of other materials.
More than €250 million worth of Cadbury chocolate produced in Ireland is exported every year.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, Mondelez said:
“Product evolution is not unique to chocolate, our business nor our brands. It is a decades-long, industry wide trend that happens for many reasons. Recently, it has been well reported that food manufacturers have been experiencing higher input costs for some time, making food more expensive and we are no exception to this.

Mitchell O’Connor toldBrendan O’Connor on RTÉ Radio 1: “I’d be lying to you if I said it doesn’t [hurt], it does, it’s hurtful.
“It comes with the job, ministers get criticism all the time, I can take that. Who it really hurts are my parents. I could get a phone call at six o’clock in the morning from my mother who didn’t sleep all night [because of it].”
In October, the Irish Times published an article which quoted a number of anonymous sources discussing their concerns about the Fine Gael TD’s aptitude for the jobs portfolio.
Meanwhile, two of Mitchell O’Connor’s advisers quit in November and January.

The minister said her mother is in hospital and her sister sent her a photo of her reading a newspaper last week, to which she said ‘Will you grab that paper off her before she gets to the middle pages’ because she knew she was “splashed all over it”.
She denied she was only chosen for the jobs ministry because she has been loyal to Taoiseach Enda Kenny, saying: “People talk, there’s chatter all the time.”
Teacher
Mitchell O’Connor said her experience as a teacher helps her in her current role.
Mitchell O’Connor said she’s particularly focused on creating jobs in rural areas and, being from Co Galway, is aware of how needed more jobs are in regional areas.
The minister added that she is “ambitious” and has her “head down”.
“I’m not out schmoozing. I’m in my office making sure that we’re ready for Brexit, for the challenges that are coming down the track.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/esri-2017-3139907-Dec2016/,"THE ESRI IS predicting a strong performance by the Irish economy next year despite Brexit likely hitting exports.
The Economic and Social Research Institute is predicting GDP growth of 3.5% for 2017 following 4.2% this year.
A continued decline in the rate of unemployment is also expected with a forecast of 6.8% by the end of next year. Currently the rate sits at 7.3%.
The ESRI says that growth could potentially have been higher were it not for the Brexit vote and other “trade-related uncertainty”.

Despite this, domestic sources of demand are being described as “robust”, leading to the ESRI’s overall positive quarterly assessment.
“The building and construction components of investment have picked up in recent quarters and should continue to grow into the New Year, resulting in approximately 17,500 housing completions in 2017,” reads a summary of the report.
The ESRI also says that consumer sentiment has remained steady in recent months and is above the long-term average. It is predicting strong consumption growth of 3.5% in 2017.
The report’s author Kieran McQuinn warns, however, that there is significant uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
“It is increasingly apparent at this stage that it may take some time before the necessary trade arrangements are concluded,” he says.

https://www.the42.ie/antrim-hurling-brexit-3286266-Mar2017/,"ANTRIM HURLER NEIL McManus has serious concerns about the impact Brexit will have on the GAA in the six counties.
An All-Ireland club finalist with Cushendall in 2016, McManus believes GAA will suffer if a ‘hard border’ returns.
“For the GAA in Ulster if it came to a situation where there was a hard border which looks likely at the minute, because there’s been no alternative set out, then it would cause serious problems for a county like Antrim.
“I would say 90% of the games we play are against opposition in the 26 counties. A hard border would just be terrible because it would put people off crossing it.
“Ireland is a small place and to draw a line across the country is madness in the first place and to have physical check-points then would be hugely negative.

“On the whole, Brexit was so negative. There’s no argument that can give you anything other than a fiscal indication of negativity coming out of Brexit.
“We don’t know what sort of impact it will have and, at best, we’ll be able to stay where we were with no hope of progression because we’re cutting down the places where we’re able to do business.
“We’re cutting down the places that we can go to, we’re removing the ability to move freely, we’re removing the ability of people to travel which is crazy, the Irish love to travel.”
Geographical isolation has been put forward as an obstacle to Antrim’s hurling progress but McManus is reluctant to pinpoint that as the sole reason.
“I don’t like to use excuses for Antrim hurling’s current position. So I don’t think we can use that geographical issue as the reason why Antrim are where they are.
“I think we have to look a wee bit closer to home on that front and go back to the building blocks that Antrim hurling was traditionally known for – hard work and honesty.”
McManus is currently out of action with a broken jaw but is looking forward to rejoining an Antrim squad that top the table in Division 2A of the Allianz Hurling League.

“We have the players who are capable of playing in Division One. But I’m sure that Westmeath, Carlow, Kildare, and the other teams pushing for promotion out of 2A feel the same.
“But I genuinely believe in our squad. We have the ability, anyone outside of Antrim could tell you about all the good players we have, but it’s the way we’re behaving, the way that we’re working, that’s the most encouraging part.”

BRITAIN’S BREXIT MINISTER responsible for managing its departure from the European Union denied reports his government was planning to pay eastern EU states to support it during negotiations with Brussels.
David Davis described as “implausible” recent British media reports that money would be diverted from development projects in Africa and Asia to the Baltic states and other eastern EU countries.
“I didn’t recognise the story I saw in the papers the other day. It seemed to me to be wholly implausible. We have not started the negotiation yet but that is not the way I think it’s going to go,” Davis told reporters after talks with Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics in Riga.
“It’s not a divorce, it’s a new relationship… it’s very modern in that respect,” Davis added.
Davis also assured Rinkevics that Britain wanted to preserve equal rights for EU citizens living there following Brexit.
“We want to see Latvian citizens in the UK have all the rights they have now continuing into the future.

“That’s not just resident rights, that’s public services, healthcare, all the normal right we would give our own citizens,” Davis said.
Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens living and working in Britain, a majority from eastern EU states like Poland, are demanding that their rights be protected despite Brexit.
It is estimated that at least 1.2 million British citizens currently live and work in the 27 other EU member states. They, too, are lobbying to preserve their rights post-Brexit.
Rinkevics made light of the idea Britain would bribe its way to a favourable outcome in departure talks, saying: “Today you will probably ask how much money Mr. Davis has brought in bribes –- I have to say right away we have never had these discussions and no money has been brought to us.”
He also insisted the EU member states would not be divided when it comes to Brexit talks between Brussels and London.
“We will negotiate according to the solidarity of the 27 EU member states which means there will be a common position,” Rinkevics said.
Currently on a tour of the Baltic states, Davis meets with Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis later.

The British foreign secretary then wished the presenter a good morning and walked off camera. Murnaghan managed to shout the correct answer – Park Geun-hye – at Johnson before he disappeared entirely.
“And bye-bye there to the foreign secretary.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-sea-fisheries-amendment-3309930-Mar2017/,"THE GOVERNMENT’S AMENDMENT to the Sea Fisheries Bill could be unnecessary as Britain could leave the fishing arrangement the government are trying to comply with.
According to a report inThe Telegraph, British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to announce within weeks that the UK will be pulling out of the 1964 London Convention, of which Ireland is also a member.
The agreement allows European fishing vessels to access waters six to twelve nautical miles from British shores, and includes the voisinage arrangement, which allows countries to fish between 0-6 nautical miles on their neighbours’ shores.
But there is no provision in Irish law for voisinage, as a recentcourt rulingshowed. So the Irish government has been progressing an amendment through the Seanad to comply with those arrangements – over 50 years after they were first agreed.
But if Britain leaves the London Convention (which is considered outdated anyway), and since fishing boundaries and quotas will be renegotiated as part of Brexit talks, there seems little point in rushing the bill through (it got this far without being voted on).
Sea Fisheries Protection AuthoritySea Fisheries Protection Authority
There’s been much controversy around the bill – with Senators Grace O’Sullivan, David Norris and Kevin Humphreys allvoicing their concernsabout the arrangement, which could see boats registering in Northern Ireland in order to fish in Irish shores.
Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed indicated that the reason for the government progressing the bill this far was to keep on Britain’s good side during Brexit negotiations:
Europe
Meanwhile, EU fishing fleets are increasingly anxious about their future access to teeming British waters as Britain prepares to trigger the two-year countdown to its exit from the bloc.

Fleets from nine EU countries including France, Germany and Spain have banded together in a newly-createdEuropean Fisheries Alliance, formerly launched at the European Parliament last week, warning of steep losses if divorce proceedings turn bitter.

European fleets obtain one-third of their catch in the exclusive economic zone around the British Isles, and loss of access to those waters could cut their profits in half in the short term, the fishing alliance says.
In the long term, EU fleets could lose a combined 500 to 600 vessels if they were excluded from British waters, representing 15% of the total, and up to 3,000 fleet jobs.
From 2011 to 2015, European fleets caught 700,000 tonnes of fish and seafood in British waters, valued at about €612 million, the NAFC said in a report published in January.
British vessels, by contrast, caught just 92,000 tonnes, valued at 110 million pounds, in other EU waters.
Loads to go around
And the European Fisheries Alliance notes that Britain cannot eat all the salmon, lobster, scallops and other fish and seafood its boats produce: about 70% of production, worth a billion euros a year, is exported to its European partners.
Despite this, a UK parliament White Paper published in December found that the majority of fish consumed in Britain are imported.
“Continued access to free, or preferential, trade in fish and seafood will therefore be crucial for the seafood industry and UK consumers” after Brexit, the paper said.
And depending on whether Britain negotiates a “hard” or “soft” exit, the viability of dozens of fishing centres, from Concarneau in France and Rostock in Germany or Gdansk in Poland, could be at stake.
But others say that leaving the EU would give Britain a chance to revive homegrown fleets.
“Brexit is an opportunity for the UK to revitalise its fishing industry, stabilise threatened ecosystems and create thousands of new jobs,” said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director in Europe for Oceana, an environmental advocacy group.
“But this will only happen if overfishing is stopped.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/daily-mail-sexist-3310317-Mar2017/,"THE UK EDITION of the Daily Mail has come in for sharp criticism over its front page headline today, covering yesterday’s meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
The future of the union was a topic for debate yesterday ahead of May triggering Article 50 to get the Brexit ball rolling, and the Mail ran with the headline: “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!” alongside a picture of the pair sitting while facing the cameras.
Inside, a column from Sarah Vine dissects the issue of the pair’s legs in great detail, claiming that Sturgeon positioned her legs in a “more flirty, tantalisingly crossed” way, in a “direct attempt at seduction” towards the Scottish electorate.
Labour MPs led the criticism against the Daily Mail, calling it sexist, moronic and offensive.
MP Yvette Cooper said that these women would help to determine in the union continues to exist, and ironically said that the headline would “obviously” be about their legs in 2017, while MP Harriet Harman echoed this sentiment.

The Scottish edition of the Mail led with the same picture but an altogether different headline: “Oh so frosty! Secrets of Nicola and PM’s talk-in”. The Irish edition focused on May’s decision not to visit Northern Ireland before Wednesday.
There was further condemnation across social media for the headline from members of the public.
Theresa May is expected to trigger Article 50 tomorrow, which will begin Brexit negotiations with the EU.
Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, has asked colleagues to support a vote to hold another referendum on Scottish independence, after a majority in the country voted to remain in the EU.
Last week, the Irish and UK editions of the Daily Mailran very different storieson the death of Martin McGuinness.

Speaking ahead of the meeting the Taoiseach said, “I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister May to Dublin.
In a statement the Taoiseach’s department added that, “Discussions will cover the current situation in Northern Ireland, the UK/Ireland Joint Work Programme and key bilateral issues that the UK and Ireland are committed to working closely on as the UK prepares to leave the EU.”

Entry to the US is being denied to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
May came under fire over the weekend for not condemning what has become dubbed as Trump’s Muslim ban. However, she released a statement late on Saturday night saying she “did not agree” with the policy.
Kenny is also under pressure over calls from numerous politicians for the Taoiseach tocancel his upcoming visit to the White Houseto mark St Patrick’s Day.
No talk
Arequest was made earlier this month for May to address the Dáilduring her visit to Dublin.
However speaking last week, Kenny indicated that the request was turned down, saying, “My understanding is that the Prime Minister’s schedule will not allow that to happen and I am not in control of that schedule.”
The last UK Prime Minister to address the Houses of the Oireachtas was Tony Blair in November 1998.
Kenny travelled to London last July to speak with May about how Brexit would unfold.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May will target a clean divorce from the EU when she sets out her Brexit plans in a major speech this week according to reports.
In Tuesday’s address, she will call for Britain to unite and get behind Brexit, pleading for an end to the “insults” and rancour between Leavers and Remainers, her Downing Street office said.
But newspapers said she would be laying out the path towards a “hard Brexit” – a strategy likely to infuriate embittered Remain voters even more.
May will spark two years of Brexit negotiations when she triggers the Article 50 departure process by the end of March.
She has been under pressure to reveal her strategy for the talks that will set out the future relationship between Britain and the European Union.
Downing Street would not be drawn on matching reports in several newspapers this morning that May was targeting a hard Brexit – pulling out of the single market, the European customs union and the European Court of Justice, in order to regain control of EU immigration.
‘Triple Brexit blast’
The Sunday Times this morning reports that May will announce that Britain is seeking a “clean and hard Brexit”, citing the above points.
“May’s triple Brexit blast” is how The Sun puts it, saying May will “show she means business by announcing a triple whammy departure from the EU”.
The Sunday Telegraph quoted a government source as saying: “She’s gone for the full works. People will know when she said ‘Brexit means Brexit’, she really meant it”.
Downing Street would only say the speech would call on Britain to “set aside old divisions, and unite to make a success of Brexit”.

While the June referendum on Britain’s EU membership split the country – the Leave campaign won with a 52% majority – most Britons share a vision of a future Britain that is “secure, prosperous, outward-looking and tolerant”, said Downing Street.
“Setting out the government’s plan for the Brexit negotiations, the PM will highlight the importance of building on common goals – such as protecting and enhancing workers’ rights – and focusing on a positive vision of Britain outside the EU.
May has revealed little so far on her negotiating position, but has been clear she wants control over immigration from EU countries – a major issue in the referendum.
Stop the ‘insults’ plea
May – who gave lukewarm backing to the Remain campaign – was to call on all sides to respect the referendum outcome.
However people voted, the public and parliament want the government to “get on with it”, while business was planning to make the best of Brexit, she was to say, according to Downing Street.
“Now we need to put an end to the division and the language associated with it – Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults – and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain,” May was to say.
The speech will take place at Lancaster House, a central London mansion used by the Foreign Office for glitzy diplomatic occasions.
The audience will be comprised of foreign ambassadors, Britain’s Brexit negotiating team and other senior officials involved in the EU departure process.
Meanwhile Brexit Secretary David Davis indicated that Britain would consider a transitional arrangement in the divorce talks.
“If it proves necessary, we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements,” he wrote in The Sunday Times.
“We don’t want the EU to fail, we want it to prosper politically and economically, and we need to persuade our allies that a strong new partnership with the UK will help the EU to do that,” he added.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned yesterday the bloc must be aware of the risk to financial stability during what are expected to be very tough talks with Britain.

RYANAIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE Michael O’Leary has brushed off criticism of his airline’s social media policy in the wakeof mocking tweets being posted yesterday relating to employees of rival Aer Lingusbeing arrested in connection to a people smuggling scam at Dublin Airport.
Speaking at the launch of Ryanair’s winter schedule for 2017 this morning in Dublin, O’Leary said that it was clearly a sign that the low-fares carrier’s social media strategy was working, and dismissed the media’s coverage of it as “scurrilous” and “utter, complete rubbish”.
“When I saw the tweets last night I didn’t find them particularly funny,” he said.
He added that he would be instructing his social media team to “have a look at” doing similar campaigns in future, “given it is obviously so effective”.
Ryanair sent two tweets yesterday evening in the wake of the arrest of three people at the airport in connection with a people-smuggling ring (which involved the use of Aer Lingus branded catering trucks) which is alleged to have brought 600 illegal immigrants to these shores in the last six years.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
O’Leary today dismissed the whole story as an example of “a slow news day” and “a storm in a teacup”.
He described the immigration facilities at the airport as “second to none” and said that he could apportion no blame to Aer Lingus regarding the situation.
He further asserted that he is “absolutely certain” that a similar scam could not be perpetrated via Ryanair planes.
“We have hardly any catering for starters,” was his tongue-in-cheek take on that inquiry.
Regarding his own airline’s fortunes, he held back his most scornful statements for the DAA (previously Dublin Airport Authority), comparing it to “North Korea in that they think they can charge whatever they want”.
Costs at the airport are clearly a bugbear of the CEO given, as the company said in its release, that other EU airports are cutting costs.

A spokesperson for the DAA refuted O’Leary’s claims, saying:
In recent years, Ryanair has availed of Dublin Airport’s Growth Incentive Scheme, which offers airlines a rebate on fees in return for delivering increased passenger numbers. The scheme continues to operate at the airport.
O’Leary said his airline had delivered “70% of Dublin’s growth over the last two or three years”, but because the incentives lasted only 12 months its fees were now set to rise.
Ryanair’s new business would go to other European airports that had committed to cutting airport charges, rather than Dublin, he said.

The building of a new runway at the airport was similarly dismissed.
“This new runway will be half a kilometre longer than it should be. It should cost €200 million and it’s being budgeted at €350 million,” O’Leary said.
(The DAA has saidpreviously the correctestimated cost is actually €320 million, and not €350 million as claimed by O’Leary).
Aside from the social media storm and the trouble with DAA, O’Leary held court on the two main issues of the day – namely Brexit and Donald Trump.
“Brexit will be the single biggest challenge we face, given it should lead to a drop in Sterling, and consequently a drop in visitor numbers from the UK. There is no upside to it. The UK Government clearly doesn’t have a bull’s notion what it’s doing,” he said.
Of the inauguration of Donald Trump, O’Leary said he admired the US President’s ability to “offend the middle class, liberal media”.
“They should be offended on a daily basis,” he said.
Of Trump’s ‘America First’ policy, he said: “It doesn’t work, it’s pure populism.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/pat-casey-stephen-donnelly-3220408-Feb2017/,"FIANNA FÁIL TD Pat Casey has said it “wasn’t easy” for him to take the news Stephen Donnelly was joining the party.
Both men are based in the Wicklow constituency, which Donnelly topped in last year’s general election – when he ran as a Social Democrat, before leaving the party last September to become an independent TD once more.
Speaking onMorning Ireland, Casey said: “While it came as an initial shock to me, I wasn’t surprised. I suppose this was mooted five months ago.
“On a personal level I have to take it on board. I equally have to agree with Micheál Martin on his vision for moving the party forward.
“We can all be cynical … It wasn’t easy for me to take this news yesterday.
“We now have two sitting Fianna Fáil TDs in Wicklow. This time last year we had no TD.”

Donnelly has been sharply critical of Fianna Fáil in the past. He is now on the party’s front bench as Brexit spokesperson. Casey is the party’s junior spokesperson on urban renewal and housing.
When asked about Donnelly immediately getting a front bench position, Casey said: “Stephen, I suppose, has done five years at national level ahead of me. Equally, I would have a lot more local government knowledge than Stephen would have so … swings and roundabouts. We do the best we can with what we have.”
Not all members are happy
Jennifer Cuffe, a councillor on Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, was Casey’s running mate in last year’s general election. Casey said not everyone is happy with her being sidelined in favour of Donnelly.
“Jennifer is a councillor in Dún Laoghaire … She came down to fill a void in Co Wicklow where we couldn’t find someone to run with me in the last election. Jennifer is back in Dún Laoghaire, where she is working hard.”
Casey added that other voters are happy with the news and likely to vote for Donnelly next time around.
“I think he clearly indicated yesterday that he believed in a lot of the policies we have … Stephen has made this decision. We as a party have taken him into the party because we believe that he can bring added value to the party,” he said.

Fine Gael senator and spokesperson on EU Affairs Neale Richmond welcomed the news, saying: “Post-Brexit, Ireland but particularly Dublin, can position itself as an alternative base for financial institutions seeking to passport into the European Union.
“Ireland is an attractive place for banks and financial services companies to do business and it is vital that we attract this business to offset the obvious negative economic that Brexit will bring to the wider Irish economy.
Richmond added that, in terms of investment, Ireland is “a bit below the EU average when it comes to doing business with the Chinese market”, but the Bank of China move “will go a long way towards boosting this”.

Next week she said she would seek the approval of the Scottish Parliament to open discussions with the UK government on the details of a Section 30 order – which will enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate for an independence referendum.
“I will stand up for Scotland’s interests during Brexit negotiations,” she said during amedia briefingtoday from her Bute House residence in Edinburgh.
“Scotland will have a choice to follow [the rest of Britain out of Europe] or to become an independent country.
“By taking these steps, I am ensuring that Scotland’s future will be decided [not just by the Scottish government] but by the people of Scotland. It will be Scotland’s choice.”
She maintained that the Scottish Nationalists’ manifesto says that a “significant or material change of public opinion or a change in circumstance” would provide a mandate for a second vote.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet

‘Brexit could puncture the Scottish boat’
Earlier, Sturgeon said the UK government had not “moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise and agreement” since the Brexit vote, which saw Scotland vote by 62% to 38% to remain in the EU, while the UK as a whole voted by a margin of 52:48% in favour of leaving.
Back inFebruaryof this year, a spokesperson for Theresa May said she “does not believe there should be a second referendum”.
The comment was sparked by a poll published that same day that revealed rising support for independence ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union.
“We don’t believe that there should be a second referendum. There has been a referendum, it was clear, decisive, it was legal, and both sides agreed to abide by the results of that referendum,” the British government’s spokesperson said.
Questions, questions…
When asked if there was anything the British government could say, Sturgeon answered that would mean they’d have to say ‘something’.
“I don’t know if there’s any prospect of them saying something, because why haven’t they said anything to date. But I am open to discussions. The conduct of the government thus far… has forced me to make this announcement the day before Article 50 is triggered.”
When asked if there was a contradiction in asking for independence from the UK to remain in another union, the EU, Sturgeon said that Scotland doesn’t want to turn their backs on the rest of the UK.
“I’m arguing that we should continue to trade within the single market and within the UK. Scotland becoming independent does not mean turning our backs on the [UK]. I think it would create a genuine partnership of equals.”
She maintained that it was for the Scottish people to make the final decision: to follow the rest of the United Kingdom out of the EU and into whatever deal they make, or to become an independent country and to make their own deal with the UK and the EU.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has said any Brexit deal needs to include a provision to allow Northern Ireland to rejoin the EU should reunification with the Republic ever happen.
Kenny’s comments represent a re-stating of policies he’s discussed before. He was answering questions after a meeting in Brussels with European Commission President Jean Claude Junker and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Speaking last month he said that while a united Ireland wasn’t something he was interested in pursuing as part of the talks, language relating to the possibility should be retained as part of the UK’s exit deal.

“The Good Friday Agreement has been referred to by [Junker],” the Taoiseach said today.
The Taoiseach has been talking about reunification and the Good Friday Agreement in relation to Brexit since last summer.
“The discussions and negotiations that will take place over the next period should take into account the possibility, however far out that it might be, that the clause in the Good Friday Agreement might be triggered,” he said,after commenting on the issue at the MacGill summer school in Donegal’s Glenties in the weeks after the Brexit vote.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Theresa May has signed the historic letter which will launch Brexit when it is delivered to Brussels tomorrow, a photo released by her office showed.
Sitting in front of a lone Union Jack national flag and a portrait of Britain’s first prime minister, Robert Walpole, May signed the letter to begin the country’s departure from the European Union.
The letter will be taken from 10 Downing Street to Brussels, where it will be delivered by Tim Barrow, Britain’s EU ambassador, to EU President Donald Tusk around 11.30am.
Formally notifying Tusk of Britain’s intention to leave the bloc, by triggering Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, sets the clock ticking on a two-year negotiating period to end the UK’s 44 years of membership.
On the eve of launching Brexit, May this evening made separate phone calls to Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“They agreed that a strong EU was in everyone’s interests and that the UK would remain a close and committed ally,” Downing Street said.
Break from the bloc
“They also agreed on the importance of entering into negotiations in a constructive and positive spirit, and of ensuring a smooth and orderly exit process.”
As Britain begins its break with the bloc on Wednesday, May will address parliament and promise to represent everyone in the UK — including EU citizens — in the negotiations with Brussels.
She will express hope “that we are no longer defined by the vote we cast, but by our determination to make a success of the result”.
“We are one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future. And, now that the decision has been made to leave the EU, it is time to come together,” the prime minister will say, according to her speech published in advance by Downing Street.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-supreme-court-theresa-may-3201747-Jan2017/,"The UK Supreme Court giving its judgement this morningYoutubeYoutube
Updated 09.38
THE UK SUPREME Court has ruled that Britain must put the triggering of Article 50 before Parliament before Brexit can happen.
The court ruled by a majority of eight votes to three in favour of upholding the same decision previously decided by the High Court.
However, the Government will not have to consult with the devolved assemblies in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland before acting.
Outlining the reasoning behind the judgement, president of the Supreme Court Lord David Neuberger said that as things stand the European Communities Act (ECA) ruled that EU law takes precedence over Britain’s domestic laws.
As such, a withdrawal from the EU would fundamentally affect the UK’s constitution, something which “renders it impermissible for the Government to withdraw from the EU Treaties without prior Parliamentary authority”.
“The 2016 referendum is of great political significance. However, its legal significance is determined by what Parliament included in the statute authorising it, and that statute simply provided for the referendum to be held without specifying the consequences,” Neuberger said.
Within the three dissenting judgements, the point was made that European law could only be supreme in the UK on condition of Britain actually wishing to be a member of the EU.
The full judgement can be readhere.
Voting as expected
The 11 Supreme Court judges were expected to rule against the government in a move which could delay Prime Minister Theresa May triggering Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, which would formally begin exit negotiations.
Today’s decision follows a High Court ruling against the government last November, in a case which attracted protests and abuse against the lead claimant.
Businesswoman Gina Miller said she has suffered death threats and racist taunts since bringing the case.
“Things that were considered unacceptable are now acceptable,” she told AFP ahead of the Supreme Court decision.
Anger was also directed at the High Court judges following their decision, being branded “Enemies of the People” by one newspaper.

The legal challenge has tapped into divisions within British society after the June referendum which saw 52% vote to leave the EU.
Brexiteers have claimed the case is an attempt to block Britain’s departure from the European Union, but MPs are not expected to vote against triggering Article 50.
If they lose the case ministers are preparing to rush emergency legislation through the Houses of Commons and Lords – and the opposition Labour party has promised not to block it.
Theresa MayPA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
“Even if the Supreme Court rules that May cannot bypass parliament in Westminster, parliamentarians will be unlikely to go against the vote of the British people and block Brexit,” said Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.
Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has however said he will take the chance to table amendments to the bill, including maintaining access to Europe’s single market.
Such a move would go against the premier’s plan for a “hard Brexit” announced last week, through which May said Britain will leave the single market in order to control EU immigration.
Scotland to have a say?
Opposition amendments could delay May’s timetable to trigger Brexit talks by the end of March, but the Supreme Court could further scupper her plans.
Judges are also set to rule on whether the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland must have a say on the prime minister’s plan.
Gostynska-Jakubowska said May could find it difficult to trigger Article 50 by her March deadline if the judges demand greater involvement from the devolved nations, while deeming such an outcome unlikely.
While Wales voted for Brexit, a majority in Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU.
Northern Ireland is facing its own political turmoil with snap elections on March 2 after the power-sharing executive in Belfast collapsed earlier this month.
The pro-EU Scottish National Party, meanwhile, has 54 MPs in the 650-seat House of Commons and also controls the government in Edinburgh.
Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at City Index Direct, said giving greater power to the devolved governments would be the “worst outcome” for May at the Supreme Court.
“This outcome would likely delay the UK’s Brexit plans, and, trigger the break-up of the UK, especially if it leads to another independence referendum in Scotland,” she said.

THE UK PARLIAMENT has given Prime Minister Theresa May approval to start Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The House of Lords rejected a last-ditch attempt to amend a bill empowering May to begin Brexit, paving the way for it to become law as early as Tuesday.
The prime minister could then trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty at any time, starting two years of talks that will end with Britain becoming the first country to leave the bloc.
May’s spokesperson sought to play down speculation she would send her notification letter to the European Council on Tuesday, when the bill is expected to receive royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II.
“We have been clear that the prime minister will trigger Article 50 by the end of March,” her spokesperson said ahead of the vote, heavily emphasising the word “end”.
But the prospect of an imminent start to Brexit was enough to push the nationalist devolved government in Scotland into calling for a new independence referendum.
May has said Britain will leave Europe’s single market in order to cut immigration, a move that the Scottish National Party (SNP), which is in power in Edinburgh, has warned would be highly damaging to jobs and growth.
SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said since the June referendum vote for Brexit that Scotland, where a majority wanted to stay in the EU, sought a different future.
Today she made good on her warning, promising to give Scotland “a choice at the end of this process” by early 2019 — before Britain leaves the EU.
The European Commission, however, quickly responded, saying that Scotland would have to reapply to join the EU rather than inheriting Britain’s membership.
Countdown to Brexit
May has the power to block the vote and said that another referendum, after Scots voted by 55% to reject independence in 2014, would only cause “uncertainty and division”.
But Sturgeon’s call pushes to centre stage one of the prime minister’s biggest concerns about Brexit — that it could lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom — as she prepares to fire the starting gun.

The other 27 European leaders are prepared for Britain to trigger Article 50, which begins a two-year countdown to Brexit, this week.
However, speculation is growing that it may now be delayed until after a summit in Rome on 25 March to mark the EU’s 60th birthday — timing that would likely be welcomed in Brussels.
Once May has notified the EU of her decision by letter, the bloc will take just 48 hours to issue its first draft proposal for the negotiations, with a follow-up meeting planned on 6 April.
The actual talks are not expected to begin for months.
The bill empowering May to begin Brexit was forced on the government by a Supreme Court ruling and was held up when the House of Lords voted for amendments demanding guarantees for EU nationals’ rights and a parliamentary vote on the final withdrawal deal.
Brexit minister David Davis successfully urged MPs to overturn the changes earlier today, saying: “We will not enter the negotiations with our hands tied.”
The House of Lords then conceded, passing the bill unamended late on Monday.
‘Shame on you’
The Lords amendment demanding protections for more than three million Europeans living in Britain was defeated by 335 votes to 287 by MPs — prompting shouts of “shame on you” from protesters outside.
Around 150 people had gathered to urge MPs to back the change, including Karin Templin, a 39-year-old architect who was born in the US but is now British.
“I’m appalled at the UK government, at this stupid ridiculous game that means they won’t guarantee the rights of everybody who wants to stay in their home and in their jobs. I’m disgusted,” she said.
May’s government says it wants to guarantee Europeans’ rights to stay in Britain, but cannot until EU leaders offer similar rights to British expatriates.
The other amendment that was overturned would have given parliament the right to decide whether to accept the final Brexit deal.
May has promised lawmakers a vote on the deal but only if she accepts it — insisting her ability to walk away will strengthen her hand in negotiations.

ENDA KENNY HAS said he doesn’t have to “answer to” Nigel Farage.
The Taoiseach was responding to the MEP and former Ukip leader saying he should apologise to Donald Trump for previously saying remarks by the then US presidential candidate were “racist and dangerous”.
Kenny made the comments in May, in the midst of a very divisive election campaign in the US.
Speaking to reporters in Washington DC today, Kenny told reporters he didn’t call Trump a racist.

“I did not refer to the person, the now president, as being racist. My comment was in respect of his language…
“Language and words can be used by people in many regards. My comments was when he was running as a candidate in respect of the election to be held.
“I’m not into English classes. The language that was used on that occasion was in my view not that language that I would use but it was not related to his personality.”
In terms of Farage, he said:
“I’m responding to an invitation sent by the president of the United States and I’m happy to go to the White House to continue the traditional connection between Ireland and the United States, symbolising the contribution Irish people have made over many centuries and the fact that we want to continue with that.
“I’ve nothing further to say in respect of comments made by Mr Farage.”
‘Vile things’
Earlier, Farage told RTÉ’sToday with Sean O’Rourkehe hopes the first thing the Taoiseach does during his meeting with the US President is “to apologise to Donald Trump for saying vile things about him consistently during the campaign”.

Farage said that might be a good start because “Trump won’t have forgotten that”.

He said “how much more insulting can you be than to call someone racist” adding, “I think he needs to apologise.”
In May of last year, Kenny was asked about some of the then-presidential candidate Trump’s comments. Speaking in the Dáil, Kenny described his rhetoric as both “racist and dangerous”:
Kenny wasthen askedif he regretted making such comments about the man who will soon become the next president of America.
He said maybe Trump will “let bygones be bygones” but he believes Enda Kenny is “wasting his time” trying to sell President Trump “the idea of independent sovereign states like Ireland giving away their ability to make their own laws to Juncker”.
Farage went on to say that Ireland, Germany, France and all other EU member states aren’t sovereign nations because their laws and regulations are overruled by those of the EU.

Farage reiterated comments he made yesterday, saying he’s “frustrated” at the pace of triggering Article 50 to begin Britain’s exit from the EU.
He said he doesn’t think the British Government realises the strength of its position and isn’t being “bold enough”.
He said the UK is now “the biggest export market in the world for the Eurozone” and he said the EU “needs free market access to us even more than we need it the other way around”.
On Nicola Sturgeon’s call for a Scottish independence referendum, he said if he was Prime Minister Theresa May he would say, ‘”Yeah go on, have that referendum, call her bluff, get her to lose heavily and that would be the end of Scottish nationalism for many decades to come.”
Farage is a friend of Trump, and was one of the first people to meet him after the election, flying to the US and taking the famous photo in the gold elevator with the 45th President of the United States.

DOUGLAS FLINT, THE chairman of HSBC, says it is highly likely the bank will move in the region of 1,000 jobs to a base on continental Europe if Brexit negotiations fail to secure continuing passporting rights for the British financial sector.
Speaking at a hearing of the House of Commons’ Treasury Select Committee today, Flint told chairman Andre Tyrie that HSBC will shift jobs to one its pre-existing bases on the content before Article 50 negotiations are finished to mitigate any disruption to its business.
“We would take pre-emptive action in order to ensure that we have the capacity in place in order to be able to continue to deliver what we deliver today from a different set of arrangements,” Flint said.
Flint pointed out that HSBC already has a fully integrated banking operation in France, meaning that any business that moves from London to the continent post-Brexit will most likely shift to Paris.
“We are in perhaps a better position than many, having a full service bank already in France, and therefore we have an operation within the European Union that we can service EU business from that is currently done in London.
“Much of it would go to Paris because that’s where we’ve got the largest banking operation.”

This is not the first time HSBC has looked to move jobs out of London, and last year the bank warned that it may move its headquarters from the city, with Canada, New York, and Hong Kong all mooted as potential new homes.
Fears about the City losing its passporting rights are probably the biggest concern British banks have when it comes to Brexit.
Banks currently have the right to “passport” their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate.Roughly13,500 companies use financialpassportingin some formin relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports.

Numerous banks have already indicated that they will move some of their London-based business to the continent once Brexit is completed — or even during negotiations — andParis and Frankfurt are currently battling it out to attract any operations that move out of the capital.
New figures released yesterday underline both the central importance of the City to the British economy and the importance of trade with the EU. Britain’s financial sector has the biggest trade surplus with the EU, selling £19.1 billion more to Europe than it buys from the continent.
There are fears that this vital trading relationship could be jeopardised by Britain’s looming exit from the EU. There are multiple potential pitfalls: a lack of clarity on a post-Brexit deal could drive finance firms to relocate elsewhere in Europe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-referendum-7-3311681-Mar2017/,"Updated: 9.10pm
SCOTLAND’S PARLIAMENT HAS voted to allow First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to make a formal request to the British government to hold a new referendum on independence, on the eve of the formal launch of Brexit.
The Edinburgh parliament voted by 69 votes in favour and 59 against in a rebuff to British Prime Minister Theresa May, who had argued that a 2014 referendum against independence had already settled the question.
Sturgeon will now make a formal request for a referendum but she needs approval from the British government and parliament in London to do so and May has already said that “now is not the time”.
May will begin the process of ending Britain’s 44-year membership of the European Union by invoking Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, opening two years of negotiations.
Last year’s Brexit vote has spurred the independence campaign of Sturgeon, head of the ruling Scottish National Party (SNP), who argues that Scotland is being forced out of the European bloc against its will.
Both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, but they were outnumbered by voters in England and Wales who backed Brexit.
Most recent polls show support for independence is high but still short of a majority.
A survey by ScotCen published earlier this month showed support at 46%,  its highest level since the yearly study began in 1999.

UK an ‘unstoppable force’
Sturgeon and May met in Scotland on Monday, with the prime minister reiterating that the time was not ripe for a referendum and describing the four nations of the United Kingdom as an “unstoppable force”.
The SNP leader has suggested an independence vote should be held by spring 2019 at the latest, before Britain leaves the EU.
independence supporters celebrate outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh today.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Neither leader has expressed a willingness to compromise and the rift is unlikely to end before Article 50 is triggered.
Rejecting Sturgeon’s request would be politically risky for May, whose government is also trying to prevent the collapse of the power-sharing arrangement which governs Northern Ireland.
The Northern Ireland executive collapsed in January following a dispute between the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist Party and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein, which failed to reach a new power-sharing deal by a Monday deadline.
The British government has extended the talks and, if a resolution is not reached, fresh elections could be called or London could resume direct rule over Northern Ireland.
“In the absence of devolved government, it is ultimately for the United Kingdom government to provide for political stability and good governance,” Northern Ireland Minister James Brokenshire told parliament on Tuesday.
The fate of the province is one of the priorities set by the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. “We will not stand for anything that weakens dialogue and peace in Northern Ireland,” Michel Barnier wrote in the Financial Times on Monday.

UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May secured a symbolic victory on Brexit today after MPs agreed not to delay her plans to begin exit talks by the end of March.
May did, however, have to promise to give them more details of her negotiating strategy.
Labour’s original motion demanded the government publish its “plan” before triggering EU Article 50, which begins the two-year exit process.
This motion had been expected to draw support from dozens of May’s Conservative MPs but the premier fended off a rebellion with a last-minute amendment.
The amendment accepted the Labour motion on condition that MPs support her timetable for triggering the Brexit talks.
Following the results, Labour MP Hilary Benn said he hoped the vote would prompt the government to give more information on its plans for negotiating Britain’s future outside the European Union.
“When they have said they are going to publish a plan, I expect to see some detail,” he told BBC News.
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the vote was “a very historic moment” which enabled the government to act on Brexit.
“The government now has a blank cheque, and I think that’s a good thing,” he told Sky News.

Despite the March timeline, May has refused to give a “running commentary” on her strategy, insisting that revealing her hand prematurely would undermine the negotiations.

Today’s vote is non-binding with the government still fighting a Supreme Court case that they hope will allow May trigger Article 50 without a parliament vote.
Ministers made it clear that today’s vote intended to flush out those MPs who may seek to delay Brexit if it comes to a commons vote.
“It’s always been our intention to lay out the strategy in more detail when possible and provided it does not undermine the UK’s negotiating position,” Brexit minister David Davis told MPs.
‘A trap’
Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer welcomed the amendment, saying the government had “caved in” and “must now prepare its plan and publish it”.
He called for an outline plan by January, warning that his party would not accept a “late, vague plan” that allowed no time for parliamentary debate.
May has previously said she wants the “best possible deal” for trade with the EU, to create new deals outside the bloc and to control immigration.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lawyers-ireland-brexit-3121193-Dec2016/,"IRELAND HAS GOTTEN a record number of new solicitors in 2016 as UK-based legal eagles look to Ireland after the Brexit vote.
New stats from the Law Society show that 1,347 new solicitors will be added to the Roll of Solicitors by the time the year is out.
This number beats the previous record number from 2008 by over 500 and is a 275% increase compared to last year.
Qualified solicitors from England and Wales have been allowed register in Ireland since 1991, and vice versa, after qualifications from both jurisdictions were recognised by the other.
Advertisement
In the latest edition of the industry magazine,the Law Society Gazette saysthat Irish solicitors have been the main beneficiary of this agreement in the 25 years since but that Brexit has “changed the direction of transfers across the Irish Sea”.
A breakdown of the figures shows that, of the 1,347 new solicitors registered here this year, 810 came from England.
Law Society director general Ken Murphy has described the massive increase of solicitors as “a tsunami” but cautioned that it’s unclear at this point exactly how many UK legal firms will open offices here.
“The single word that dominates all assessments of the potential impact of Brexit is ‘uncertainty’. So far, the Law Society of Ireland has no knowledge that any of the England-based firms intend to open an office in this jurisdiction,” Murphy said, adding the €300 per solicitor charge pays for administration costs but doesn’t swell the Law Society’s coffers.
The firm from England and Wales that has transferred the most solicitors to Ireland is Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. The firm, which is one of the so-called ‘Magic Circle’ of London-based firms and one of the one of the top 10 largest in the world, added 117 UK solicitors to the Irish roll this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irexit-brexit-daniel-mulhall-telegraph-3248750-Feb2017/,"IRELAND’S AMBASSADOR TO Britain has hit out media reports in the UK which suggested that Ireland would be keen to follow Brexit and leave the EU.
An opinion piece written by columnist Simon Heffer in this weekend’s Daily Telegraph suggested that Ireland’s low corporation tax was the only reason multinationals were attracted to set up shop here.
He wrote: “I expect it won’t be too long before Ireland wants to leave the EU as well, not simply because of the importance of its trade with the UK, but because the EU is determined to forbid it to operate the 12.5% corporation tax rate that is just about the only thing keeping it economically viable.”
Hefner also claimed that a return of a hard border between the Republic and the North would not stoke tensions.
He wrote on Saturday that this rhetoric was mere “scaremongering”  and that “terrorism in Ireland has never died, and there is no link between it and new Border controls”.
Tweeting his response to the claims, Ambassador Daniel Mulhall wrote that he was ” not impressed at snide comments of Simon Heffer @Telegraph. I can assure him there is precious little support in Ireland for an EU exit.”

He added that there’s lots going for Irish economy other than 12.5% tax, citing our “highly-educated, hard-working population and location within EU.”

BRITISH BUSINESSES ARE struggling to fill in vacancies because of a drop in the supply of European Union nationals following the Brexit vote, a new report revealed on Monday.
The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) highlighted that the growth of EU nationals in employment halved to just 30,000 in the final quarter of 2016.
According to the latest data, there are currently about 2.26 million EU nationals working in Britain.
“The survey data… suggest that a fall in the supply of EU nationals may heighten recruitment difficulties in the year ahead,” the CIPD wrote in its Labour Market outlook report.
Job vacancies in the UK economy remain well above historical average levels and the report emphasises that a fall in the supply of EU nationals would hit some specific industries hard.
Advertisement
These include low-skilled sectors such as wholesale, retail, accommodation and food services as well as human health and social work, which employ large number of EU workers.
More than 1,000 employers were polled for the survey.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is expected to start the divorce proceeding with the EU before the end of March, has said she wants to guarantee the rights of EU citizens who are already living in Britain.
But uncertainty over what that would entail and whether visa restrictions would be enforced is also prompting some EU nationals in the UK to consider relocating.
Almost one in three British employers surveyed by the CIPD say they have evidence that the EU nationals they employ have looked to leave their organisation and/or Britain in 2017.
The issue of immigration was at the heart of the EU referendum campaign last year in which 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union.

THE UK AND the European Union must “work hard” to avoid a failure in Brexit negotiations, Prime Minister Theresa May said in the letter formally launching the process, calling it a “momentous” challenge.
May also called for talks on Britain’s exit and on future trade ties to be worked out “alongside” each other, although the EU has said the new trading relationship should only be discussed after Brexit is agreed.
In her letter, which was hand-delivered to EU president Donald Tusk in Brussels by Britain’s EU ambassador Tim Barrow, May struck a conciliatory tone and called for a new “bold and ambitious” free trade deal with the bloc.
She said she wanted a “deep and special partnership” that would take in both security and economic cooperation.
“Europe’s security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War,” she said.

Ireland
The letter made specific reference to relations with Ireland and the peace process, arguing that Brexit must not “harm the Republic of Ireland”.
The section in the letter about Ireland read:
The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.
Failure
In the letter, May also said that both Britain and the EU “would of course cope” if the negotiations fall through and the two sides are forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs to trade with each other.
But she added: “It is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.”
British business leaders have warned about the prospect of a “no deal” scenario and May had said in a speech in January that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/political-proposals-campaigns-2016-3162385-Dec2016/,"IMAGINE A PERSON planning and preparing their proposal to their partner of five years, thinking of how they’ll do it, figuring out what they’re going to say – and they come up with “marry me to keep things tipping along?”
Not the most romantic, enthusiastic or special way of asking someone for a life commitment. But that proposal is essentially what we were offered by government strategists in this year’s General Election.
The Remain campaign in Britain and Hillary Clinton propositioned their voters with the equivalent of “marry me, so we don’t break up”, and “marry me, because the other guy is a complete headcase”.
2016 saw three major political campaigns – our own General Election, the United Kingdom’s referendum on membership of the European Union, and the US Presidential election.
Across all three there are things that a would-be political strategist, candidate or campaigner would do well to learn.
Like any good proposal, a political campaign must give voters a sense of hope that things in the future will be wonderful. When asking people to go out to vote, it can’t be for the status quo. It has to be to fix a problem, or build a future.
The defining word of the Referendum on Europe was Remain. Sit in your nappy.
Niall CarsonNiall Carson
The Remain side should have given a vision of Britain leading in Europe again. Drawing on the memory of the country that saved a continent twice, rather than an impotent campaign focussed on staying in a body that most of their politicians had criticised for 30 plus years.
Fine Gael’s ‘Let’s Keep the Recovery Going’: ditto. Dull, and speaking to a converted audience who were feeling the recovery. It was the status quo. Don’t you dare mess this thing up.
Donald Trump’s proposition was visionary to many – he was going to fix things, it was active, focussed on the outcome to “Make America Great Again”. He had the ability to make a cohort of resentful and angry people feel hopeful and proud. Hillary Clinton’s slogans of “Stronger Together” and particularly “I’m with Her” spoke to an already-converted group.
As much as Democrats will hate it, Trump followed what their two most loved Presidents did. He gave a vision. For example, Obama’s “Yes We Can” filled his voters with the hope that they could fix the mess that George W Bush had created.
Or JFK with his speech at Rice University to persuade the American people to support his space strategy, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”. Future tense. Inspiring.
These “proposals” were more like, “We’re going have a wonderful life together, and I’m going to make you very happy.”
The vanquished also failed to speak to the Floating Voter about things they cared about and in terms they understood. This is the most obvious thing in the world. Don’t preach to the converted because they’re already with you. Clinton even said that half of Trump voters were “deplorables”. Dismissing them when she should have been trying to wrap her arms around them.
It would seem the strategists behind 2016’s losing campaigns didn’t listen or appreciate what the Floating Voters cared about. Whereas Trump did. For example, illegal immigration and unemployment are big issues for many Americans. Trump spoke to that.
In Flint Michigan he did it perfectly, telling the crowds:
And he was going to fix that.

This is because there is a cohort of people who feel things are pretty rubbish for them, and who didn’t hear from the losing campaigns how things were going to improve for them.
Obama gets praised for his oratory but his policies were about supporting the middle class and improving their lives through health insurance and fair taxation.
Ken Bone (the man wearing a red sweater who asked a question during one of the debates) said that he had to weigh up his dislike for Trump versus the impact on his family and pocket. 45% of college-educated white women voted for Trump.
He may be an ass but they felt he was giving them more things than Hillary was. He was going to bring jobs back, deal with illegal immigration and address fundamentalist Islamic terrorism.
In an argument of logic versus emotion, emotion often wins. The Greeks called it Pathos. They appeal to people’s emotions. Trump did that. The Leave campaign did that.
Campaigns need to equip the man or woman to win an argument in the bar. And be able to do it in five sentences. The Remain side gave no simple clarity. Their campaign forgot the Monty Python sketch of “What did the Romans ever do for us?”.
What did the EU ever do for the UK?
For years politicians in Britain had reaped benefit by slamming Europe for anything bad that happened and taking credit for the good stuff. The Remain side failed to differentiate to voters what value membership of the European Union gave versus the cost accrued.
And Cameron, in particular, should have spent a year or two ahead of the referendum doing that, explaining to people what Europe contributed to the UK.
In Ireland we were given terms like “fiscal space” rather than a vision of a country where nobody would be left behind. Hillary’s thesis seemed to be that she deserved it because her experience made her one of the most qualified candidates ever.
Part of what’s to blame might be focus groups.
Political strategists love them because they give them a chance to test their ideas on a selection of the public to find out if they’re any good. And to give them the cover of “it tested well with the focus group”.
But focus groups are flawed for so many reasons. Issues discussed tend to be national – but all politics is local. The topics may not be personal to the attendees, so why would they care?
People behave differently when they know they’re being watched. The facilitator may influence them. Individuals who turn up to focus groups are a particular type of person.
The stuff you say publicly in a room full of strangers is different to what you would say privately to your nearest and dearest.
The result of focus groups for campaigns tends to be dull, boring and safe “messages”. I would be amazed if anything Donald Trump said was focus-grouped. But you can be sure the others were.
So for any campaign in 2017, parties and candidates would do well to remember the importance of a vision – fix something or build a future; to talk to floating voters about the things that they care about and in a way they can understand, remember and retell; and not to be ironed flat by the pseudo-science of focus groups.
The French Presidential election is the one to watch.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-donald-trump-3209899-Jan2017/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has played down speculation that he is about to lift sanctions on Russia, as British Prime Minister Theresa May said they should continue.
When asked by reporters whether he was planning to release Russia from sanctions imposed over its intervention in Ukraine, Trump said: “It’s very early to be talking about that.”
May, at a joint White House news conference, said Britain believes sanctions should continue until Russia upholds its end of the international Minsk Agreement drawn up to end the conflict.

Trump reiterated his support for Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, declaring: “A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world.”
Both leaders said they would work to strengthen US and British commercial ties, with May hoping that a swift trade deal with Washington will mitigate the effects of Brexit.
May added that Trump had accepted an invitation to make a state visit to Britain later this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-thoroughbred-industry-bloodstock-brexit-2-3173012-Jan2017/,"
DESPITE A RECORD-BREAKING 2016 on UK tracks for Irish-trained horses, Ireland’s racehorse industry is looking at the year to come with trepidation.
The Irish and British racehorse industries are governed by separate bodies, but the two have effectively operated as one entity for centuries.
However, the spectre of Brexit has gripped the sector, with currency volatility and the possibility of trade borders between Ireland and the UK threatening an industry that has operated with little change for a century.
At the auction houses, where Irish breeders sell their stock to international buyers looking for the next Cheltenham or Aintree champion, there are few champagne corks being popped despite a bumper year.
Trading at Goffs’ November sale of Irish foals and breeding stock passed the €40 million mark – only the second time the Kildare auction house saw transactions top the milestone.
Meanwhile, rival auctioneers Tattersalls, based in Meath, marked their 250th birthday year with a record annual turnover of nearly €280 million.
Goffs Group chief executive Henry Beeby says uncertainty about 2017 is playing on everyone’s mind as the new year beckons.
“I hear the British government saying one thing is going to happen in its autumn statement and then people who are meant to know what they’re talking about say the opposite.
“Ongoing uncertainty is not good for any market. That would be my overriding feeling and particularly a market that is dealing in a speculative and luxurious item such as a racehorse. I hope they get certainty as quick as possible, whether it is the positive or negative, we’ll deal with that.”
Henry BeebyGoffsGoffs
Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) chief executive Charles O’Neill, who promotes the Irish racehorse industry worldwide, says demand from the UK for Irish thoroughbreds is not going to disappear overnight, but Brexit is still on people’s minds.
“Everywhere you travel, Brexit comes up in meeting. People want to know what it’s going to mean and what the biggest issues are. Uncertainty is the biggest killer in all of this. It’s the not knowing,” he says.
“If we got the rules we could work to those and know what to do. But all the speculating is no good for the Irish thoroughbred industry.”
Barriers
One of the major ramifications from Britain leaving the EU is the possibility of a ‘hard’ border being introduced between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
“I think what would be very detrimental not just to Ireland, but to Britain as well, would be any kind of barriers of movement of horses, people or trade between the two countries,” says Beeby.
“When it comes to bloodstock, Britain and Ireland are really one industry – we work from one stud book. If you take Tattersalls clients in Newmarket and Goffs clients in Kildare, they are nearly one in the same.”
The hard border would also create problems for the racing industry itself, according to O’Neill.
“The last thing we need is borders up across the North. Horse racing isn’t divided in Ireland, it’s all 32 counties, so you have to make sure we have free trade for racing up in Down Royal and Downpatrick – they are as much a part of racing in Ireland.”
Charles O'NeillCaroline NorrisCaroline Norris
O’Neill added that a hard border between Ireland and the UK isn’t the only issue on the mind of racehorse breeders and trainers.

“It’s not all down to free movement … with the volatility in the currency now, people are looking a lot more at where they are spending money.
“There is volatility and that brings more uncertainty. So you have to get around that and make sure Ireland is always the go-to place to buy horses, even in times of uncertainty.”
Attracting international buyers
While the thoroughbred industry will be joining the lobbying efforts around Brexit, the reality is its voice will barely be heard in the din of concerns from business and interest groups.
For now, those within the industry are focusing their attention on the matters more closely within their control, such as attracting more buyers from outside the British Isles.
Beeby says Goffs has concentrated its efforts in getting US buyers to sales after the upheaval of the UK vote to leave the EU.
“It reaped dividends because we had more American buyers than we have had for many a year, or possibly ever, at the yearling sale in September,” he said.
“We still focus heavily on our local markets, but we have spread our wings and appointed a couple of very good new agents in the US and Australasia recently to bring new people back to buy Irish horses.”
Niall CarsonNiall Carson
Overproduction
Aside from dealing with the fallout of the Brexit referendum, the industry is also contending with a problem more of its own creation – the overproduction of foals.
Beeby says the number of foals produced in Ireland peaked around 2007 before crashing alongside the economy during the recession. However it is now rising at a faster rate than anywhere else in Europe.
“We’ve got to be careful that we don’t flood a market that doesn’t need that many horses. We’ve seen the clearance rate at some of the sales dropping over the last 12 months, which means supply may be starting to edge towards outstripping demand again.
“There needs to be a focus on a relative quality – and I use the term ‘relative quality’ advisedly. We’re not talking about being elitist, but from our point of view, we will focus on a relative quality in every category.”
However, O’Neill doesn’t believe lower auction clearance rates is a necessary symptom of higher production.
“We just need to keep raising the standard and the quality of the breed, that’s where the problem is. We don’t have enough good mares producing the good horses. If they are good foals of the right quality, they will sell.”
GoffsGoffs
Convincing Ireland’s breeders to sell their best stock through the Kildare-based auction house and not rivals in England will be another major challenge for Goffs this year.
Beeby says it’s an ongoing battle to change breeders’ perceptions that they needed to head across the Irish Sea to get the best prices.
In 2013, Goffs fetched the highest ever price for an Irish racehorse when it sold ‘Chicquita’ for €6 million.
“It is no disrespect to UK auctioneers, but breeders don’t need to go there,” says Beeby. “Goffs can look people in the eye and say when we have the best horses, we get the best prices. We have the buyers here.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/shopping-luxury-london-brexit-3110737-Dec2016/,"
WHILE THE PROSPECT of Brexit is weighing on much of the British economy, tourism and luxury goods businesses are cashing in on bargain-hungry visitors lured by the slide in the pound.
London’s tourism agency says sales of goods eligible for sales-tax exemption have gone up by a third since the Brexit vote in June, which sent the pound sterling plunging against the euro and dollar.
“We calculated that over the last four months it’s been about 12% cheaper for Europeans to come and shop here,” said Chris Gottlieb, head of leisure marketing at the agency London & Partners.
The pound is now at €1.17 compared with €1.03 before the shock vote to leave the European Union, while it has also fallen to $1.25 from $1.49.
The result is that London has become the cheapest city for luxury goods shopping in the world in dollar terms, according to a study by Deloitte.
‘Going to spend much more’
In tourist areas, the effects are evident.
“We’re going to spend much more money than we planned to,” said Radostina Nonova, a Bulgarian tourist, laughing as she lugged her bags on Carnaby Street – in the heart of London’s shopping district.
“So we shop and we can afford to eat and drink outside. That was not possible years ago,” she said.
French tourist Christophe Disic said he did not come just because the pound was low but “when we changed our money we realised we had a few more pounds for fewer euros”.
When speaking to US tourists, shopkeepers are quick to take out their calculators.

Denis Sagajevs works in Shinola, a shop selling watches and leather accessories. He said:
“It’s affected by the fact that they can claim VAT on their way back. We pretty much on a day to day basis explain that to customers from the States. It happens to be quite a strong sales driver.”
50% increase in shoppers
Some shops are adapting their advertising and sales tactics to the new consumer behaviour.
“Before the vote, European tourists were couples who came to be together and maybe bought a couple of things,” said James, the manager of a luxury men’s clothes shop on Carnaby Street.
“Now, there are groups of friends who rush in. They grab everything they can carry.”
James estimated that European and US shoppers coming to his store have increased by around 50%.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Instead of spending on costly advertising in British newspapers as it did before, his firm is changing tactic to appeal more to overseas visitors.
They have put up signs outside underground train stations near the shop.
But there are doubts about how long the boom can last.
While the good health of the British economy was confirmed by solid growth of 0.5% in the third quarter, the official forecasts for 2017 have been lowered to 1.4% from 2.2%.
“Our British customer sales are not as strong as before the vote and we don’t even know if this tourism boom is going to last,” James said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/charlie-flanagan-irexit-fanciful-thinking-farage-3170536-Jan2017/,"NIGEL FARAGE’S BELIEF that Ireland could follow the UK and leave the EU has been described by Foreign Affairs minister Charlie Flanagan as “fanciful thinking”.
Speaking on RTÉ radio this morning, Farage said that an Irexit should “not be discounted” following the UK’s decision to leave the EU this summer.
But hitting back, Flanagan questioned how much Farage knew about the Irish people and our relationship with the EU.
Speaking onRTÉ Drivetime, Flanagan said: “I think that’s somewhat fanciful thinking. I’m not sure how familiar he is with Ireland or Irish people. I don’t subscribe to his view. Irish people have embraced the European project.”

Flanagan said that the British government needs to clarify its plans for Brexit “at the earliest possible opportunity” six months after they voted to leave.
Not clear
He said: ”I think it’s important that the British government develop something of a plan. I believe it’s important now, over six months since the referendum, we know what type of relationship that they wish to have with the European Union. It’s not clear, to date, what that plan might be.”
Recognising Brexit as the biggest “economic challenge of our time”, Flanagan said he is looking forward to Theresa May’s visit to Dublin this month.
He cited the border and relations between the the UK and Ireland as consequences of Brexit which will need particular attention.
Flanagan added: “Ireland is firmly on Team EU in the context of these negotiations. Ireland would obviously wish, post Brexit, that the relationship between the UK and the EU would be close. Our preference obviously is what has been described as a ‘soft Brexit’.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-damage-brexit-negotiations-3199662-Jan2017/,"FORMER GREEK MINISTER for Finance Yanis Varoufakis has said that fears that Ireland may end up as “collateral damage” in negotiations between London and Brussels are “well-founded”.
Speaking toRTÉ’s This Week, the economist said if Britain chooses to leave the capital union, Ireland would not be negotiating with London over the status of the border: ”there will be negotiations between London and Brussels on this”.
This comes asGerry Adamssaid that Brexit could destroy the Good Friday Agreement, and that Brexit was a ”hostile act against this island”, because it could mean taking the North out of the European Union.
Other concerns
The main challenges that Brexit poses for Ireland include higher taxes on imported and exported products, and the future for the border between the Republic of Ireland and the North.
When Britain leave the European Union, higher taxes on goods exported from Ireland are likely; but how much higher they are will signify just how tough Brexit will be for small Irish businesses here.
Because the UK voted to leave the EU on a mandate of limiting the free movement of people, the worry is that a physical border of some sorts will return, seriously impacting relations in the North – especially at a time of political uncertainty.
“I think that it’s imperative for the Irish government to ensure that it’s not sidelined,” Varoufakis said today.

Varoufakis was made Greek Finance minister after his far-left party Syriza rose to power in the 2014 general elections.
He and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras promised to get a better – or less austere – deal from the European Union, but failed in negotiations to achieve that.

Varoufakis then resigned, he says because Tsipras was told he would get a better deal for the Greek people if Varoufakis stepped aside. Since his resignation in 2015, Varoufakis has been a vocal critic of the EU – often expressing his disillusionment with the way the European Union functions.
“My great fear having experienced negotiations [like these] is that negotiations are not rational – indeed they are often fake negotiations. Often there is a power-play that leaves behind the common interest for both sides,” he said today.
The PM’s Speech
Earlier this week Theresa May outlined her ‘wish-list’ for Brexit negotiations. Included on that list was her desire to acknowledge the unique relationship they have in the North.
She also said that if they didn’t get a good deal, that they would get competitive on trade by lowering corporate tax rates.
Various opposition politicians, including Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, expressed concern about Theresa May’s speech, saying that it doesn’t include much detail about how negotiations will proceed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-gerry-adams-2-3282803-Mar2017/,"GERRY ADAMS HAS called on Enda Kenny to get tough with the UK and to clarify what consequences Brexit will have on the North.
Speaking at Sinn Féin’s Ard Comhairle in Dublin today, Adams said the British are continuing with their plan to impose Brexit, regardless of the views of people of Ireland north and south.
Adams welcomed the fact that Enda Kenny expressed his impatience over the lack of clarity from Britain.
“I welcome his remarks, but, as usual, the Taoiseach is too slow and too mesmerised about what the British government is doing.
“The Taoiseach needs to stop waiting for the British government. I know he is engaging with EU partners, but he must act in our national interest, at European level, to secure special designated status for the north within the EU. That is the consensus of the majority of parties north and south.”

Responding to questions on the threat by James Brokenshire to call another election, Gerry Adams said that it is a sign that Westminster is threatening republicans with an election.
He added: “Back in the day, the threat was martial law, internment, censorship, and lead and plastic bullets. So, Mr Brokenshire’s threat is progress.”
Earlier this month, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) just about scraped into first place in the Assembly elections. It marked a first in Northern Irish politics – for the first time ever, unionist parties do not command a majority leadership in Stormont.
Sinn Féin had its best results ever in the election with 27 of the 90 seats.
The vote was called to resolve a political stalemate between historical rivals DUP and Sinn Fein, but they will have to try to work together again to form a new power-sharing government.
The election could potentially bring Northern Ireland back under direct rule unless the DUP and Sinn Féin can break the deadlock.
There was a 64.8% turnout – the highest since the first vote after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. There was a 55% turnout in the 2016 election.

https://www.thejournal.ie/juncker-brexit-chat-3304854-Mar2017/,"EU COMMISSION PRESIDENT Jean-Claude Juncker has said that there is no desire to “punish” Britain during the upcoming Brexit negotiations, calling the country’s decision to leave the EU “a failure and a tragedy”.
In an interview with the BBC broadcast today, Juncker indicated that Britain’s bill of what it needs to pay when it leaves the EU would be around €58 billion.
The interview itself got off to an inauspicious start, when reporter Katya Adler asked Juncker if he thought that Theresa May’s absence at an upcoming meeting of EU leaders would be the “elephant in the room”.
Juncker answered: “She is not an elephant”.
While the EU would be going into the negotiations with its eyes open, it would look to treat Britain fairly, according to Juncker.

When asked how he would feel when Article 50 is triggered on Wednesday, Juncker said: “I will be sad, as I was sad when the referendum took place.
On how much Britain would have to pay when it leaves the EU, Juncker said it would not exceed sums already agreed upon with the UK:
He added that an aim of the EU was to ensure that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, and British citizens living in the EU, were protected.
Theresa May is due to trigger Article 50, signalling the start of the Brexit negotiations, on Wednesday 29 March.
It will begin a long, complicated process for the UK to cut its ties as a member of the European Union.
“We are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation,” said Brexit minister David Davis earlier this week.

IT’S A DAY that has been coming for months.
This morning, UK Prime Minister Theresa May finally outlined just exactly how she plans to extract the UK from the EU following last year’s Brexit referendum. Sort of. Kinda.
That May was seeking a so-called ‘hard’ Brexit – ie one which would see Britain exit the single market amongst other things – was no secret. But just how hard a hard Brexit are we talking? And when will it happen?
Here’s how it all went down.
17 Jan 201711:46AMTheresa May has been effectively avoiding questions as to just what kind of Brexit her government favours.A strong train of thought is that the main reason for this is that the UK government has been floundering with indecision in the face of an economic catastrophe they never believed could actually happen.But, as Theresa is so fond of telling us, will Brexit really mean Brexit?17 Jan 201711:49AMSky News is reporting that May is set to outline a truly clean breakvia a 12-point plan for Brexit.17 Jan 201711:50AMHere we go17 Jan 201711:51AM“The people voted for a new path. It is up to this government to deliver it,” says May.17 Jan 201711:52AMNo specifics as yet. May wants Britain to be a “truly global country” and to be “a friend to all countries”.17 Jan 201711:55AM“The British people voted for change,” she says. “We are a European country, but we are also a country that has always looked beyond our borders towards the wider world.”23 June was not the moment that Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to become a truly global Britain.17 Jan 201711:55AM“It remains overwhelmingly in Britain’s interests for the EU to succeed,” says May.17 Jan 201711:57AMNow the Prime Minister is setting out Britain’s reasons for leaving the EU.“Unlike other EU nations we have no written constitution,” she says.She admits that it’s true Britain has “often looked like an awkward member state” of the EU.17 Jan 201711:59AM“I believe there is a lesson from Brexit, not just for us but for Europe also.”There are different ways of dealing with different interests.Our vote to leave the EU was no rejection of the values that we share or do harm to the EU itself.We do not want to turn back the clock to times when Europe was less peaceful.“We will continue to be friends and partners. You will still be welcome in this country,” May adds.17 Jan 201712:00PM“We are leaving the European Union. We are not leaving Europe.”17 Jan 201712:01PM“We do not seek to be an associated member of the European Union. Not a member of bits of the European Union. We are leaving the EU.”17 Jan 201712:01PMNow we’re getting down to the nuts and bolts. May is about to outline her 12-point plan for Brexit.17 Jan 201712:02PMObjective One – “We will provide certainty wherever we can.

Theresa May has been effectively avoiding questions as to just what kind of Brexit her government favours.
A strong train of thought is that the main reason for this is that the UK government has been floundering with indecision in the face of an economic catastrophe they never believed could actually happen.
But, as Theresa is so fond of telling us, will Brexit really mean Brexit?
Sky News is reporting that May is set to outline a truly clean breakvia a 12-point plan for Brexit.
Here we go
“The people voted for a new path. It is up to this government to deliver it,” says May.
No specifics as yet. May wants Britain to be a “truly global country” and to be “a friend to all countries”.
“The British people voted for change,” she says. “We are a European country, but we are also a country that has always looked beyond our borders towards the wider world.”
23 June was not the moment that Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to become a truly global Britain.
“It remains overwhelmingly in Britain’s interests for the EU to succeed,” says May.
Now the Prime Minister is setting out Britain’s reasons for leaving the EU.
“Unlike other EU nations we have no written constitution,” she says.
She admits that it’s true Britain has “often looked like an awkward member state” of the EU.
“I believe there is a lesson from Brexit, not just for us but for Europe also.”
There are different ways of dealing with different interests.
Our vote to leave the EU was no rejection of the values that we share or do harm to the EU itself.
We do not want to turn back the clock to times when Europe was less peaceful.
“We will continue to be friends and partners. You will still be welcome in this country,” May adds.
“We are leaving the European Union. We are not leaving Europe.”
“We do not seek to be an associated member of the European Union. Not a member of bits of the European Union. We are leaving the EU.”
Now we’re getting down to the nuts and bolts. May is about to outline her 12-point plan for Brexit.
Objective One – “We will provide certainty wherever we can. This will compromises on both sides, and not everyone will know everything at all times,” says May.
“I can confirm that the government will put the final deal to a vote before both houses of Parliament.”
Objective Two – Britain will be taking charge of its own laws.
A mention for Northern Ireland’s currently fraught political situation:
“I hope the spirit of unity will apply in Northern Ireland and the main parties there will form a government as soon as possible,” says Theresa May.
“Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past,” the prime minister says of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Objective Three – A fairer Britain. This means immigration.
“We will continue to attract the brightest and the best to work and study in Britain,” says May.
But that must be done properly so our immigration controls serve the national interest.
Now, what does that mean?
“In the last decade we’ve seen record levels of net immigration. This has put a downward pressure on working class people,” says May.
You cannot control immigration from Europe while a member of the EU.
Now we’re talking Free Trade.
“We will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union,” says May.
But I want to be clear. That does not mean membership of the free market.
So, ‘hard’ Brexit it is.
Leaving the single market will mean no longer having to make “vast contributions” to the EU’s budget says Theresa May.

“President-Elect Trump says Britain is not at the back of the queue when it comes to trade, rather it is at the front of the line,” she says.
That may be the first mention of the soon-to-be inaugurated US president.

Interesting.
“We will welcome agreement to continue to collaborate with our European partners on major science and technology initiatives.”
Now we’re onto defence.
“With threats to common security becoming more serious, we need to work together more, not less,” says May.
I am proud of the role Britain has played in promoting Europe’s security.

So, the 12 points of Brexit, in case you missed them:
Theresa May does not want a “punitive Brexit deal” for Britain.
That would not be the act of a friend. Britain could not and would not accept such a deal.
So, the speech has ended, we have our 12 points for Brexit, pretty much no details of how they’ll be achieved, and now it’s time for a Q&A.
Will EU nationals be treated the exact same way as non-EU nationals post-Brexit asks a London Times journalist?
“We do recognise the importance of immigration, we recognise the contribution of those who have come here and who are still her, but our immigration policy will follow the plan which I have set out,” is the reply.
So, maybe, is the answer.
If Parliament rejects the deal, will Britain still be in the EU?
“Today is about coming together and analysing the opportunities available to us across the world, and then bringing them home,” is May’s answer.
The British Parliament has made it very clear it wants us to get on with it, and that is what we are doing.
Kirsty WigglesworthKirsty Wigglesworth
A Spanish journalist, from El Pais, asks if migration is completely off the table.
“This is not about a confrontation,” is May’s reply. “This is about what is right for the EU, I mean the UK.”
That’s quite the Freudian slip, Theresa.
I want to work out what is to our mutual benefit. Thank you.
And with that, like Keyser Soze, Theresa May is gone.
So, what have we learned? Well:
The Irish Government has issued a statement in the wake of May’s speech:
“The Government has noted the contents of Prime Minister May’s speech today and welcomes the fact that it provides greater clarity on the proposed approach of the British Government to the Brexit negotiation process,” it reads.
For Ireland, the priorities for the negotiation process that lies ahead are unchanged:  our economic and trading arrangements, the Northern Ireland Peace Process including border issues, the common travel area, and the future of the European Union.
In her speech, Prime Minister May highlighted the specific and historic relationship between Britain and Ireland.   In this context, she made clear that her priorities include maintaining the common travel area and avoiding a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland, both of which are welcome.
That statement continues:
The Government notes that the British approach is now firmly that of a country which will have left the EU but which seeks to negotiate a new, close relationship with it.   While this will inevitably be seen by many as a “hard exit”, the analysis across Government has covered all possible models for the future UK relationship with the EU.
So… is it a hard exit or isn’t it? Does anyone know?
The Government’s preparation (for Brexit) is extensive.  Important organisational changes have been implemented in Government Departments and Agencies, with additional resources provided in key areas.  Preparation to date includes the contingency work done before the UK referendum, intensified analysis and scenario planning carried out across all key sectors since, and extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement including through the all-island Civic Dialogue process.
So, we have it all in hand. Nothing to worry about.

For now, we have Theresa’s 12 points of Brexit to pick over.

EU REGULATIONS COULD put Irish tourism businesses at a disadvantage compared to their UK-based rivals after Brexit, a new report has warned.
A document published today by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) said that “withdrawal from EU inspired regulations and compliance issues” could make the cost of doing business in the UK comparatively cheaper than Ireland.
ITIC – which counts Aer Lingus, the Guinness Storehouse and Tourism Ireland among its member organisations – called for “the harmonisation of regulatory standards across the island of Ireland”.
It warned that a different set of business codes and practices between Northern Ireland and the Republic could lead to “significant cost variances”, which would skew customers’ perception of value-for-money between the two parts of the island.
EU-imposed health and safety rules, environmental regulations and consumer protection codes are the “most likely aspects” that could handicap Ireland’s transport and hospitality sectors after Brexit.
The report said coach operators in particular could be disadvantaged against firms based in Britain and Northern Ireland because of the need to comply with “EU directives governing drivers’ hours and associated costs”.

‘Left behind’
The ITIC report was critical of the government’s response to Brexit so far.
It noted that unlike state agencies in the agri-food and manufacturing sectors, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have not been given extra funding to recruit additional staff.

“It is evident that the impacts on tourism are not being treated with the same degree of urgency and importance as other export sectors of the economy, ” ITIC said.
ITIC said the government should provide an extra €12 million to tourism budgets.
The organisation also called for the retention of the ‘Common Travel Area’ and liberal aviation access between the UK and the EU. It has previously called for theestablishment of a ‘Brexit taskforce’.
ITICITIC

ITIC said the UK’s decision to leave the EU will be “the greatest challenge to face Irish tourism since the global economic recession of 2008″.
The British market is Ireland’s largest overseas tourism market, and brought in €1.3 billion last year. Two out of every five visitors that came to the island in 2016 hailed from Britain.
ITIC chief Eoghan O’Mara Walsh said “the tourism euro is as valuable as the euro earned by any other export sector”.
“The government must be proactive and help the sector consolidate its market share in Britain but crucially diversify into other markets,” he said.

IN THE WAKE of the Brexit referendum earthquake, few people felt the aftershocks as keenly as the shopkeepers of Dundalk.
Following the plunge in the value of the pound, residents of this town of 37,000 people have been heading across to the border do their shopping and the movement has only intensified in the run-up to Christmas.
But while the politicians are still trying to figure out what Brexit will look like, retailers in Dundalk are fighting back with gift vouchers – a form of alternative currency aimed at boosting local shopping.
Dundalk Chamber of Commerce chairman Michael Gaynor told AFP:
Sterling is about 10% lower against the euro compared to before the 23 June referendum.
TheDundalk vouchersare available online or from the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce’s office and can be obtained either by individuals as regular gift vouchers for Christmas presents or by employers for bonuses.
The colourful ‘shop local’ vouchers are printed in denominations of €5, €10, €20 and €50, and are accepted in more than 200 Dundalk stores, from jewellers to electrical outlets to cafes.
So far this year vouchers to the value of more than €300,000 have been purchased, and the chamber of commerce expects this to top out at over €500,000 by the end of the festive period in early January — a welcome boost to a local economy under severe pressure.

Hard border
The border promises to be a central part of Brexit negotiations, with many on both sides fearing a return of customs and police checks – the “hard” border present during decades of conflict on the island.
The border is currently open and checks would be “hugely problematic”, including for many people from Northern Ireland who work in Dundalk, Gaynor said.

In recent months, shoppers from the Irish Republic have been crossing the border in waves to take advantage of the favourable exchange rate, particularly on alcohol, toys and groceries.
A recent Red C poll indicated that as many as 56% of shoppers in border counties intended to travel to Northern Ireland for Christmas shopping.
A report by Goodbody Stockbrokers showed traffic flows from south to north on Saturday mornings had surged 29% in the wake of the referendum.
Although there are strong appeals to support the local economy, even people walking the streets of Dundalk are voting with their pockets.
“Everything up north for toys is a lot cheaper and there is more variety — it’s definitely worth taking the trip up to get something a little different and save a few euros,” said Chris Cumiskey, a housewife who said she can save around 25% on food shopping in the nearby Northern Ireland town of Newry.
Eugene Kelly, an unemployed man, said:

Local
Lorraine Prenty, a human resources executive, said she chose to shop local but noted the increase in cars heading across the border in recent months.
“Around Dundalk there just isn’t the same volume of traffic or the number of people this year,” she said.
Gaynor tried to strike an upbeat tone, saying that a modest recovery in the value of the pound since the referendum meltdown had managed to avert disaster.
“We have managed to weather the storm, for now at least,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-whitepaper-3219372-Feb2017/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has published its long-awaited “White Paper” on Brexit, with its relationship with Ireland forming a key part of the document.
Maintaining the common travel area between Northern Ireland and the Republic gets its own section in the paper, with the UK government saying that “maintaining our strong and historic ties with Ireland will be an important priority for the UK”.
They call the economies of the UK and Ireland “deeply integrated” and say that the relationship between the two countries has “never been better”.
On the issue of a hard border between North and South, they make this statement:
It is also signalled that it will retain the dual nationality rulings under the Good Friday agreement, whereby a resident of Northern Ireland can acquire a British or Irish passport.
They say that they will work to devise a solution that will retain the current border status while “protecting the integrity of the UK’s immigration system”.
The issue of its relations with Ireland forms just one of 12 sections to the Brexit whitepaper.

The list of twelve priorities for the British government in the Brexit White Papergov.ukgov.uk
In terms of Northern Ireland, the UK government wants to maintain the integrity of the union as it currently exists, and indicated it would support continued devolution of powers under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
They will discuss with each devolved administration – in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland –  how best to reinstate powers that will be returning to them from the EU.
Other aspects of the White Paper call for the control of immigration, taking back their own laws and securing trade agreements with other countries.
London is aiming for a “new, positive and constructive partnership between Britain and the European Union that works in our mutual interest”, Brexit minister David Davis said as he launched the 77-page document in parliament.
The “White Paper”, which came a day after the government comfortably won a first vote on triggering the start of divorce negotiations, also said Britain will pull out of the single market in order to control immigration from the EU, which ran at 284,000 in the year to June 2016.
Britain will look to strike a new customs agreement with Brussels, enabling it to forge its own trade deals with the rest of the world, it said.
Davis said Britain wanted to build a strong, alternative partnership with Brussels.
“This government will make no attempt to remain in the EU by the backdoor, nor will we hold a second referendum on membership,” the document says.
“Instead, the strategic partnership which we seek will underpin free trade between the UK and EU… as well as the closest possible cooperation on key issues like security, foreign policy and science and technology.”

https://www.the42.ie/10-team-league-of-ireland-opinion-3268608-Mar2017/,"IT’S BEEN QUITE the year for people casting votes.
Donald Trump is US president thanks to the quirk of US politics that is the Electoral College system. It allowed Trump to win the US Presidential Election despite his receiving approximately three million votes less than Hilary Clinton. Trump won 46% of the popular vote to Clinton’s 48%.
The Brexit vote across the UK last year was similarly contentious. Even though Northern Ireland and Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union, the future of both states has been defined by others, elsewhere, during an ‘all or nothing’ vote.
There is no electoral college system in Irish football. Nevertheless, we’ve somehow arrived at a situation where 30% of the popular vote was sufficient to change to the structure of our league.
At least everyone in the Brexit referendum was given the opportunity to vote and express their opinion. In our league, 40% of the clubs weren’t afforded that same opportunity and now find their futures affected by 30% elsewhere who thought change was needed.
Ultimately, neither Trump nor Brexit helps to explain how we’ve ended up with a decision to have two 10-team divisions from next season, or why the decision ended up being announced after teams had already committed to a new budget. Unfortunately, we might as well ask Trump for clarity on the league’s structural change as the response from clubs and the FAI on the process has offered little.
Advertisement
What we do know is that FAI Director of Competitions Fran Gavin has praised the clubs for their ‘brave decision’ duringan interview with extratime.ie last week, though there’s no clarity or evidence whatsoever that the clubs had any part in the decision.
Gavin stated: “They formed their own association, the Premier Club Alliance, and they were looking for a change of structure. Amongst themselves, they came up with the decisions to go to 10 teams.
“I suppose it is a brave and courageous decision as it meant that three of them were going to go down in order to get a 10-team Premier and 10-team First Division.
While there are clubs that have consistently sought a 10-team Premier Division, there’s no evidence clubs as a whole were looking to bring about the structural change proposed in the Conroy Report from 2015.
There are doubts that a majority of Premier Division clubs voted for the move — there’s even doubt that the clubs were aware it was a vote at all. The only thing that is crystal clear is that the decision was made without the agreement of a majority of clubs, in fact, the input of the eight First Division clubs was not considered by anyone.
This was not a decision reached through a popular vote. From speaking to a number of officials across a number of clubs, it’s likely that only five or six Premier Division clubs expressed a preference for the change, not even a majority of the sides in the top flight.
Even then, one of those clubs, Bray Wanderers, publicly withdrew their support for the change when they realised that a conversation at PCA level was being presented by the FAI as the justification for the change, while with the ‘decision,’ a wedge was being driven between Premier and First Division clubs. Sligo Rovers were also suggested to be wavering on their initial vote.
It quickly became clear during my conversations that some clubs didn’t consider the meeting where the structural change was discussed as a formal vote, feeling it was more ‘conversational’ based on an FAI request for feedback. There seems to have been no sense in the room at the time of the vote that its outcome would be used to define the structure of the league within a matter of months. It’s also very clear that even those clubs who preferred the 10-team option were not aware that the change would be brought about so quickly, requiring one quarter of the league to be relegated in a single season and the removal of the opportunity for second and third-placed teams in the First Division to be promoted.

It’s my understanding that the PCA informed the FAI that the clubs couldn’t come to an agreement and requested a meeting of all 20 clubs to discuss potential changes. Of course, this only goes to show the lack of a unifying vision from the clubs.
Ultimately, the impact to clubs as a result of this ‘decision’ by a minority has very real consequences for a number of sides who had already set out their budgets and plans for 2017. It begs the recurring question since the FAI and league merger: do the clubs have any real input into the running of the league?
Unfortunately, it would appear not.

https://www.thejournal.ie/italy-referendum-3109260-Dec2016/,"AFTER VOTERS IN the UK and the US firmly rebuked the political classes with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, Italians could be next to deliver a bloody nose to the political establishment.
The EU’s fifth largest economy goes to the polls in a referendum tomorrow that will decide on some major changes to their political system.
In short, Italians are being asked whether to greatly reduce the power of their upper house, the Senate.
In Italy, the Senate’s power is greater than in similar parliamentary democracies with two houses, like Ireland, and critics of the Senate have argued that it adds to the notorious political instability in the country.
It’s proposed that members of the Senate will be drastically cut from 315 to 100 and that all members will be appointed rather than elected.
The proposals for the Senate from Prime Minister Matteo Renzi go hand-in-hand with a new electoral reform law designed to ensure elections produce winners with clear majorities.
Arguing for a referendum Yes votein the Financial Times, Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said that:
“The value of the proposed amendments is so obvious that regular attempts have been made to introduce them since the 1980s.”
Demonstrations have shown the depth of feeling in Italy ahead of tomorrow's vote.Andrew Medichini / APAndrew Medichini / AP / AP
As ever though with referendums, campaigns are rarely fought on the issue at hand alone and Prime Minister Renzi has perhaps unwisely made this explicitly the case.
The centre-left leader has suggested he will step down if voters reject the referendum, giving fuel to opponents who seek to make the vote about his premiership.
They argue that constitutional fine-tuning is far from being an obvious priority in a country with high unemployment and declining real incomes.
Former comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo is among those opposed to the referendum with his Five Star Movement arguing it would give greater power to politicians.

The populist party was founded just seven years ago but has established itself as the biggest rival to Renzi’s  Democratic Party. Its representative Virginia Raggi is currently the mayor of Rome and the party is targeting a place in government.
Grillo came to political prominence in 2007 when her organised Vaffanculo Day, or ‘Fuck Off Day’, across Italy in opposition to other political reforms.
The fear from Renzi and others who are campaigning for the referendum is that Italians will send a similar message tomorrow.
The Five Star Movement are far from being alone in opposition to the referendum though. The separatist Northern League are campaigning for a No vote as is four-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
The fear from Brussels ahead of tomorrow’s referendum is that a defeat would mean a collapse of the government and potential political chaos in Italy.

If voters reject proposals, Renzi has said:
“We will do everything that has to be done to ensure Italy is ready to face its challenges,” he added.
Renzi was speaking as he presented his 2017 budget plans to the media after winning backing for them last week from the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget includes plans to loosen the fiscal strings to finance tax cuts, increased health and education spending and measures to help smaller companies and the country’s earthquake-hit areas.
The freeing up of spending plans has already put Renzi on a collision course with the European Commission, so further disagreements aren’t what Brussels wants.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-protest-border-3247042-Feb2017/,"AN ANTI-BREXIT protest on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland today saw traffic grind to a halt this morning as a number of vans, trucks and tractors formed a “go-slow” convoy on the M1 motorway.
A fake customs post was erected to express fears about a return to a hard border after the UK leaves the EU.
To emphasise their point, the protest simulated how a hard border would affect a farmer bringing a trailer-load of sheep to market, and a requirement to show your passport as you pass through.

The protest was organised by Border Communities Against Brexit, who say that a return to a customs border would be a “huge step backwards” for their communities.
They fear that Brexit would affect ordinary communities in the North badly, saying that farm incomes will be hit and jobs will be lost.
It is believed at least 100 people took part in the protest, which saw traffic backed up near Ravensdale, Co Louth between the border of north and south.

Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy expressed his support for today’s protest. He said:

Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly insisted that she did not want to return to “the borders of the past” when Britain leaves the EU.
In therecently published white paper on Brexitfrom the British government, it said that it wanted to have “as seamless and frictionless a border” as possible between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny has also insisted onseveral occasionsthat he would fight against a hard border returning to this island.
In recent days, the second All-Ireland Forum on Brexit heard Kenny reiterate, again, that “we must not return to a hard border”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/rust-belt-brexit-3127832-Dec2016/,"
AS A DRIVING force behind Brexit, the rust belt of northern England helped trigger an anti-establishment earthquake whose aftershocks travelled across the Atlantic, and its people are in no mood to back down.
The town of Rotherham voted 68% in favour of Brexit, and six months on its residents believe they, and other areas hit by industrial decline, are now at the epicentre of a generational shift in politics.
“It’s all a protest vote, you can see that in America with Trump getting in,” said Derik Cardow, a 72-year-old Brexit voter out shopping in a covered market in the centre of the Yorkshire town.
Cardow, who recently switched his support from centre-left Labour to the anti-EU, anti-mass-immigration UK Independence Party, said he would have “definitely” voted for Trump.
From his fruit-and-vegetable stall in the market, Luke Ellis, a 26-year-old who also voted to leave the European Union in the June referendum, said:
Rotherham boomed during the Industrial Revolution, producing high-grade steel, but has suffered decades of economic decline with almost every steel mill and all the local coal mines closing.
The town has traditionally voted for Labour, but found common cause with Conservatives during the Brexit campaign over issues such as globalisation, immigration and free trade.
“It’s time we got back to looking after our own,” said Ellis, who blamed the import of cheap coal for the decline of the local economy, and of the US Rust Belt that voted overwhelmingly for Trump.
‘On our knees’
Jonathan Lang from Shiloh, a Christian charity that helps adults affected by homelessness and substance abuse, said an economic and moral chasm had opened between the cosmopolitan political class and the “proud, hard-working, hard-drinking” areas left behind by globalisation.
“The reason they are not listening is because they don’t see it. This is why you had Brexit,” he told AFP, as volunteers served up lunch in the canteen next door.
The operations manager said there were an “awful lot of people who’ve not been able to adapt” to social changes beyond their control.
At the market, Ellis said:
“We’ve been on our knees.

Immigration was Brexit’s hot-button subject, with the Leave campaign accused of fanning the flames of xenophobia.
That played a part in Rotherham’s vote but was not the main factor, said Joanne Griffiths (45) a rare Remain voter in the town.
“I don’t think it’s the fact that there are a lot of racists – there are racists everywhere – they just felt particularly put on,” she said.
The town of 250,000 has recently welcomed many Roma families from eastern Europe, with one estate a few miles from the centre of Rotherham housing 6,000 such migrants, according to a government report.
Hi-tech hopes
The referendum also revealed a sharp divide in support for the EU between younger and older voters in Rotherham and in many parts of Britain.
“The older generation were absolutely elated when they came in on that Friday morning (after the referendum),” recalled Ellis.
The problem has been deepened by the “brain drain” of younger, well-educated locals to more affluent areas.
The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, built on a former coking plant partly thanks to funding from Brussels, is bucking the trend.
The research park is a collaboration between aerospace giants such as Rolls-Royce, the government, engineers and scientists, and is set to double its 600 workforce over the next five years.
“The AMRC really is establishing this part of Rotherham, and Sheffield, as the node of an advanced manufacturing district,” said chief executive Colin Sirett, a former Airbus head of research.
The park offers apprenticeship opportunities for teenagers and is indirectly creating jobs to cater for the growing workforce, but can do little to solve the immediate crisis in blue-collar employment.
Ellis explained that long-standing malaise had left the town unconcerned by predictions of rising prices and a Brexit economic slowdown and as determined as ever to leave the EU, reasoning:
Cardow said his main concern was the time the government is taking in leaving the EU.

UKIP HAS ASKED the Welsh government to seek EU funding from the Irish government to help upgrade a motorway between London and south Wales.
The M4 motorway is the main artery between the main cities of Wales and the rest of the UK – but it also carries a large amount of Irish goods exported and sold there.
Ukip assembly member David Rowlands made the appealto the Welsh National Assembly this afternoon. He says that Irish exporters also rely on the M4 to transport goods to other EU countries on the continent – and toldTheJournal.iethat it is “quite a reasonable idea to explore”.
I kid you not. UKIP AM has just asked if Welsh Govt would ask Ireland to pay for a new M4, because Ireland could access EU funds. Oh yes.— Rhun ap Iorwerth (@RhunapIorwerth)November 29, 2016Rhun ap Iorwerth/ Twitter
I kid you not. UKIP AM has just asked if Welsh Govt would ask Ireland to pay for a new M4, because Ireland could access EU funds. Oh yes.
Rowlands – one of seven Ukip representatives in the Welsh National Assembly – asked Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones today to seek Ireland’s help in rebuilding the motorway, using EU transport funds.
“First Minister, given that a large proportion of all Irish exports, both to the UK and the EU, pass along the M4 motorway,” Rowlands began – before halting to read the question posed on the order of business.
Recommencing, he said:
The First Minister replied:
To jeers, Rowlands said:
“Very ironic, I think,” he added. He proceeded to quote from the EU’sfund allocation principles, which, according to Rowlands, read:
“I trust that they know what they’re saying, and that we can now get funds from the EU. Post-Brexit, of course.”

Irony
Speaking this afternoon toTheJournal.ie, Rowlands said:
“Of course I’m glad they all realise the irony in what I was saying to the assembly, and they were all intelligent enough to pick it up.
“But this is quite a reasonable idea to explore, if you think about it. That bottleneck in Newport is as damaging to the Irish economy as it is to the Welsh or English economy, really.
“In a way, if you think about, Ireland – southern Ireland – is still part of the European Union, and it still desires access to the EU and to the British, the UK markets,” he added.

“And if the European Parliament is committed, as they say they are, to having a pan-European highway and networks, they can’t say to Ireland ‘you’re out on a limb now’.
“It’s the same with anything with regard to Brexit, I realise the irony.”

Careful
In his reply to Rowlands, First Minister Jones referred to Ukip’s role in Brexit.
“The member seems to be urging on me that I should urge the Irish government to apply for European funding for Welsh roads,” he said.
“There’s a second point here as well,” Jones added.
“We must be very careful, because England could turn around and say ‘the M4 goes across the Severn Bridge, a lot of traffic Welsh traffic, so therefore we could ask for a Welsh contribution for traffic east of the Severn Bridge’.
“Where is that argument then?”
The UK is Ireland’s largest European export market by volume and value – although the value of Irish exports to Belgiumrecently overtookthose to Britain alone.
Wales recently voted in favour of Brexit, and Ukip won 13% of the recent assembly elections held earlier this year, partly down to their opposition to the EU.
Belfast Agreement
Steffan Lewis of Plaid Cymru said to the Assembly today that there does exist scope for a formal bilateral agreement between Wales and Ireland through the Belfast Agreement.
“This is a surreal question, even by the standards of this year,” he said.
Yet Lewis indicated that there is support for asking for Irish help for Welsh infrastructure.
Steffan Lewis of Plaid Cymru.Welsh AssemblyWelsh Assembly
He said such an arrangement could be formalised “into a Celtic Sea alliance so we can give some hope to our western regions, and the eastern regions of the Irish state”.
Jones replied: “The Celtic Sea alliance is based, I think, on co-operation between Norway and Sweden, as to how that would work.
“It is likely that we will lose indirect funding [after Brexit], as far as Wales is concerned, which will have an effect, particularly on our ferry ports.
“Of course, the British-Irish Council is a useful body in terms of exploring those issues with countries that border the Irish Sea.”

Updated 12.50pm
FORMER BRITISH PRIME Minister Tony Blair has urged Britons who support the European Union to “rise up” and persuade Brexit voters to change their mind about leaving the bloc in a high-profile speech.
“This is not the time for retreat, indifference or despair but the time to rise up in defence of what we believe,” he said at an event organised by Open Britain, a campaign group lobbying for Britain to retain close ties with the EU.
“I don’t know if we can succeed. But I do know we will suffer a rancorous verdict from future generations if we do not try,” he said.
“We have to build a movement that will stretch across party lines,” he said, announcing that he was creating an institute that would also develop arguments against Brexit and keep ties with the EU.
Britain voted to leave the European Union last year and Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty by the end of March, starting a two-year exit process.
Change of mind
Experts are divided on whether the government could change its mind about leaving the EU at some point in the future, even after invoking Article 50.
Blair came to power in 1997 at the head of the moderate leftist “New Labour” movement and won three general elections but his role in leading Britain into the Iraq War has badly damaged his legacy.

Brexit supporters quickly criticised Blair’s comments.

“The EU referendum was democratic, fair and free and the British people voted for Brexit,” said Richard Tice, co-chair of the Leave Means Leave group.
“Tony Blair is now trying to do everything he can to halt Brexit,” he said.
Former Conservative minister Iain Duncan Smith said the speech was “arrogant” and “undemocratic”.
‘Yesterday’s man’
Nigel Farage, former head of the UK Independence Party, tweeted: “Tony Blair is yesterday’s man”.
In the speech, which was shown live in full on BBC and Sky News, Blair launched a stinging attack on government policy saying the EU departure process was being led by proponents of hard Brexit.
“Our challenge is to expose relentlessly the actual cost, to show how this decision was based on imperfect knowledge,” he said, adding: “How hideously, in this debate, is the mantle of patriotism abused”.
Blair also warned that Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, now had a “much more credible” case for independence.
He said Brexit could have a “destabilising impact” on Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay.
Blair made the speech at the offices of Bloomberg news agency, the same place where former prime minister David Cameron announced in January 2013 that Britain would hold an EU membership referendum.
The British government is still waiting for the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, to pass the bill giving Prime Minister Theresa May the authority to trigger the exit from EU.
The lower house of parliament did that on 9 February.

https://www.thejournal.ie/shetland-islands-3243324-Feb2017/,"
OF ALL THE ramifications of the Brexit vote, the fate of the Shetland Islands in the North Atlantic and their oil fields and fisheries may not top the list for negotiators in London and Brussels.
But the prospect of a new bid for Scottish independence as Britain leaves the EU is making some residents of these rugged islands think again about whether they would be better off alone.
“It would be wonderful,” Andrea Manson, a Shetland councillor and a key figure in the Wir Shetland movement for greater autonomy, told AFP at the guesthouse she runs, the Mid Brae Inn.
The movement’s name means “Our Shetland” in the local Scots dialect, a derivation of Middle English which has replaced the islands’ original Germanic language, Norn.
The remote archipelago, already fiercely independent in spirit, is geographically and culturally closer to Scandinavia than to Edinburgh, and politically more aligned with London and Brussels.
In the past 1,300 years, Shetland has been overrun by Scandinavian vikings, pawned to Scotland as a wedding dowry by Denmark, subsumed into the United Kingdom in 1707, and dragged into the European Economic Community against its will in 1973.
The Shetlands were the only part of Britain, along with the Western Isles of Scotland, that voted against EEC membership in a 1975 referendum.
The Shetland Islands are located in the North Sea and are closer to Norway than Edinburgh.Shetland.orgShetland.org
- ‘Control of the seabed’ -Many Shetlanders are sceptical of Scottish separatism.
In the final tense days of the 2014 independence referendum, the local MP Alistair Carmichael, who was minister for Scotland at the time, said the islands could try to remain part of Britain if the rest of Scotland left.
In the end, 55 percent of Scots voted to stay in Britain. The unionist vote in the Shetlands was 63.7 percent — one of the highest levels in Scotland.
Now Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that a second independence referendum is “highly likely” following the Brexit vote — and Shetland is once again considering its position.
“We would like control of the seabed around us, the fishing ground around us, and the freedom to get rid of some of the bureaucracy that comes down from the EU, Westminster and the Scottish parliament,” Manson said.

“Our seas are being plundered by foreign boats. We also contribute an enormous amount of money to the national economy through taxes, through the oil revenues, and yet we don’t get back our fair share.”

Scotland has around 60% of the EU’s oil reserves and the second-largest volume of proven natural gas reserves, most of it located around Shetland.
The islands also land more fish than ports in England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.
“I don’t suppose we would ever be allowed full independence,” Manson said, adding:
The Faroe Islands lie about 320 km northwest of Shetland and have autonomous status within the Kingdom of Denmark.
They have an almost identical landmass to Shetland but twice the population, and many Shetlanders envy the archipelago’s independent parliament and vast sovereign waters.
The Faroe Island will hold a referendum in April 2018 on a new constitution that would give the territory the right to self-determination.
Power to the people

Tavish Scott of Scotland’s Liberal Democrat party, who represents Shetland in the Scottish Parliament, said he understood the desire for autonomy.
“Shetland certainly explored — and I think again will explore — what kind of constitutional future it wants,” he said.
But Scotland’s nationalist government is keen to retain Shetland as a jewel in the economic crown of an independent Scotland.

Maree Todd, a Scottish National Party lawmaker, told AFP that the party could discuss Shetland’s sovereignty, but that she believed it would be better off as part of an independent Scotland.
“Of course I think it is worth discussing,” she said, adding that islanders are not “entirely sceptical” about the prospect of Scottish independence.
“We want power to come back to Scotland, not just to Edinburgh but to the people of Scotland,” she said.

THE UK’S TOP diplomat to the European Union, Sir Ivan Rogers, has resigned.
BBC News reportsthat the EU ambassador, who had been expected to play a key role in the upcoming Brexit negotiations is leaving his post 11 months earlier than was expected.
Rogers was appointed to the role in November 2013 by David Cameron, having previously served as the former Prime Minister’s Europe advisor.
No reason for Rogers departure has been given by the Foreign Office, as of yet, according to the BBC.
Last month, he reportedly told British ministers that other EU countries believed it could take up to 10 years to negotiate a new trade arrangements with the departing UK.
But Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman insisted a deal could be done within two years that would allow Britain to trade with and operate within the single European market.
Rogers headed the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the European Union (UKRep), which represents Britain in negotiations that take place in the EU.
“His resignation is not a surprise for those who work with him,” a European diplomat told AFP.
The Labour MP who chairs the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn, has urged the Conservative government to “get its skates” on with finding a replacement at this “crucial time”.

Aled Williams, the former spokesman for Britain’s EU embassy, said Rogers’ departure was a “big loss” to the Brexit negotiations.
“Not many Brits know the ins and outs of Brussels better than Sir Ivan,” he said.
“Sir Ivan never sugar-coated his advice: had the credibility to tell his political bosses how he saw it in Brussels.”
Arron Banks, who chaired the Leave.EU campaign group in the referendum, welcomed the resignation.
“This is a man who claimed it could take up to 10 years to agree a Brexit deal,” he said.
“He is far too much of a pessimist and yet another of the establishment’s pro-EU old guard. He has at least done the honourable thing in resigning.
“It’s time now for someone who is optimistic about the future that lies ahead for Brexit Britain. Enough talk, we need to get on with getting out.”
Theresa May has previously indicated that the negotiations between the UK and the Eu regarding the former’s withdrawal would beginby the end of March.
She has said she wants the “best possible deal” for trade with the EU, to create new deals outside the bloc and to control immigration.
A new cabinet post, called Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, was created in the wake of the Brexit vote and is occupied by Conservative veteran MP David Davis.

THERESA MAY HAS spoken.
During the British Prime Minister’s much anticipated speech at lunchtime today, she acknowledged that the United Kingdom cannot remain in the single market (but wants access to it); does not want a deal already offered to other countries (but wants the best deal possible); and wants the EU and its members to prosper.
In her plan for negotiating deals once the UK leaves the EU, she laid out her 12-point plan about what she hoped to achieve during negotiations – some of which posed more questions than it answered.
So here’s a list of the most important things we learned from her speech this afternoon, and what it means for Ireland.
Steve ParsonsSteve Parsons
One of the strongest statements May made today – and not just from an Irish point of view – was when she outlined the importance of maintaining the Common Travel Area between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
It was fourth on her 12-point to do list – right after British law and maintaining relations with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales – and it made the cut as she closed her speech too:
Maintaining a ‘soft’ border should not be too difficult to negotiate for, as both Switzerland and Norway enjoy a ‘soft’ border with its EU neighbours.
However, what is more problematic is that May only pledged to find a solution that “protected the integrity of the United Kingdom’s immigration system”. So there may not be a lot of room for manoeuvre there.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Of all the issues surrounding a Brexit, trade tariffs is the one that could hurt the British government the most. It would mean that goods, services and capital will be taxed at a higher rate than when they were within the EU (presumably).
The PM wants a TTIP-type trade agreement to allow for the “maximum freedom to trade with European markets and let European markets do the same here”.
Although her entire speech was reasonable and conciliatory, May gently warned the EU that if it didn’t cut them a good deal on trade, it would affect businesses, economies and jobs in the remaining 27 countries, and that they’d get aggressive in competing for trade.
Since David Cameron’s resignation, there has been much speculation about May’s personal stance on Brexit. Although she officially stood behind her boss in the referendum campaign, it’s thought that she agrees that there should be more limitations on immigration.
In the speech today, May gave a bit more insight into how she feels about the issue, saying, “While controlled immigration can bring great benefits – filling skills shortages, delivering public services, making British businesses the world-beaters they often are – when the numbers get too high, public support for the system falters.”
May also pledged to guarantee the rights of British citizens already in EU countries and EU citizens already in Britain as a kind of halfway meeting ahead of negotiations with the EU.

In the wake of Brexit, people found it difficult to justify the reasons for a United Kingdom (remember that mantra, ‘Let’s take back control’).

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon promised that there would be a second Scottish independence referendum – based on their vote to remain in the EU.
With recent elections called in Northern Ireland, May presented a united front today when she said that the UK’s devolved administrations can submit their requests for the Brexit negotiations.
“We have already received a paper from the Scottish government, and look forward to receiving a paper from the Welsh government shortly. Both papers will be considered as part of this important process.
“We won’t agree on everything, but I look forward to working with the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole of the United Kingdom.”
Another great pillar of the Brexit vote was the people’s wish for sovereignty over their own laws. May has assuaged concerns that there would be a repeal of certain EU laws by clarifying that the same laws would be passed over into British law.
“And it is why, as we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert theacquis– the body of existing EU law – into British law.
“And it will be for the British Parliament to decide on any changes to that law after full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate.”
AP / Press Association ImagesAP / Press Association Images / Press Association Images
In an effort to show the reward for keeping Britain onside, May cited British secret service MI6, Britain’s nuclear powers, and anti-terrorism efforts.
Her offer of cross-border crime protection was particularly significant, as this is an issue that Britain has historically held back on.
“After Brexit, Britain wants to be a good friend and neighbour in every way, and that includes defending the safety and security of all of our citizens.”

May’s speech was more aspirational than concrete – setting the tone for negotiations rather than illuminating how they will go about it.
She did say, however, that there was to be no ‘transitional status’ while negotiations are underway which would lead the UK to be “stuck forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory”.
She also added that ”it is not my job to fill column inches with daily updates”, suggesting that even if she did have a plan on this, she won’t be sharing it with the public or media.
“This is a fair and comprehensive plan.
In the Dáil earlier today, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin made his concerns over the lack of detail and the lack of provisions for the Irish people known.
Enda Kenny tried to assure Martin, telling him that this was only the start of the process, and that “we now have further clarification” of what kind of deal Britain wants from the EU.
Independent Galway TD Michael Fitzmaurice said that the onus was now Europe to ensure that Ireland is protected from a ‘hard’ Brexit.
Fianna Fáil TD Dara O’Brien was a bit more dismissive of the speech, saying that although the tone was soft, the message was tough. He told Drivetime this evening that “it’s effectively a total divorce, asking for a border of sorts to come into play in the north”.
He called once more for a Brexit minister here and asked the government to “start being selfish about Ireland”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/metro-north-2-3215500-Jan2017/,"THE METRO RAIL link from Dublin Airport to the city centre has been on the long finger for years – but it could be here sooner than expected.
Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe today announced the government is to review its capital spending programme – stating that it has €2.6 billion to play (€2.2 billion is being spent on Minister Simon Coveney’s housing action plan).
One of the projects tipped to be top of the list is the Metro North – one of the most well-known projects from the Celtic Tiger era.
It is envisaged the Metro line would carry 30 million passengers a year.
Construction was due to start in 2021 and be finished by 2026, but this could now be brought forward.
Gravidade Consulting Engineers/ YouTube
Speaking at a press conference today, Donohoe said ministers and their departments will be making submissions to him about what projects they want to see progressed.
While he said there is a lot of speculation about what projects might get the green light, the Metro project is a “leading example” of what the money could be spent on.

The minister said one of the underlying themes of the capital spend programme to be considered is how Ireland will prepare for Brexit, while another is the needs of a growing population.
He said a high-speed link to the city centre and the airport fits into that theme and would “deepen access” to Dublin Airport.

Metro North aims to carry passengers from Dublin’s O’Connell Street to the airport in 19 minutes.
He pointed out that Dublin Airport is sixth busiest airport in Europe, but it is also one of the few large airports in Europe that does not have a direct rail link to the city.
“[Metro] is definitely the kind of project Minister [Shane] Ross will be making to me,” said Donohoe.
The minister said the second parallel runway at the airport, which is currently going through the planning process, will be an “unbelievable” opportunity to this airport.
But it’s not just the Metro and the airport that will benefit from the funds.
Finance Minister Michael Noonan said capacity expansion of Ireland’s ports is needed. Donohoe said access to Dublin Port needs to be improved so as to ensure a “competitive advantage” in the light of Brexit.
“Access is going to be crucial,” he said.
Noonan agreed that Dublin Port needs to be expanded, stating that some of the “largest vessels in the world” must be able to dock there.
Speaking about trade implications of Brexit, Noonan said he did not foresee ships being used more for trade purposes.
He said trucks bringing goods from Europe to Ireland will still travel through the UK. The minister outlined that when trucks arrive at Dover or Calais ports they will simply have to use the special channel for Irish trucks.
He said this issue does not appear to be an issue in the negotiations.
“They’ll start in the EU and end in the EU,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/retailers-poor-christmas-3224716-Feb2017/,"IRISH RETAILERS TOOK a hit in the second half of 2016, culminating in a challenging Christmas period, according to a new report from Retail Ireland titled “Storm clouds gathering”.
The group, which represents retailers in Ireland, said sales in department stores, computer and electronic retailers and book shops fell significantly during the Christmas period, when compared to Christmas 2015, while the value of all retail sales in Ireland over Christmas was 0.1% lower than the previous year.
More customers shopping online with UK retailers were said to have played a role in the results, and Retail Ireland also highlights the number of shoppers going north of the border to take advantage of the weaker sterling as contributing to this poor performance.
Retail Ireland director Thomas Burke said: “There were disappointing results across the board over the Christmas trading period, with some retail categories coming under particular pressure.”

Looking at department stores, it was the weak sterling and poor performance of Irish online retailers that prompted Irish stores to offer a range of discounts which led to a further squeeze on their margins, they said.
With Christmas day falling on a Sunday, supermarkets got an extra boost as shoppers had two extra days to stock up.
Sales at supermarkets rose in December, when compared with the same period last year, while sales also rose at clothing retailers and at furniture and homeware stores.
Major shopping days such as Cyber Monday and Black Friday have gathered momentum in recent years, and Burke said the data suggests a “structural shift in pre-Christmas consumer shopping patterns” with more people than ever buying early.
Brexit is also a big worry for retailers, with Burke saying that, as a sector, “retail is one of the most exposed to Brexit pressures” and their data shows that “this impact is already telling in our sector”.
He added: “Government must aid [retailers] by taking urgent and decisive steps to address the high cost of doing business, particularly labour taxes, insurance and rates.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has published a draft law that would authorise Prime Minister Theresa May to begin the procedure for leaving the European Union in an important milestone towards Brexit.
“The British people have made the decision to leave the EU… so today we have introduced a bill in parliament which will allow us to formally trigger Article 50 by the end of March,” said Brexit minister David Davis.
The two clause “European Union Notification of Withdrawal Bill” asks parliament to give May authority to “notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU.”
The government said MPs would get their first chance to debate it on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.
The government is being forced to go to parliament following alandmark Supreme Court ruling this weekthat rejected its argument that executive powers allowed it to proceed without prior approval.

Conservative Prime Minister May has a small majority in the House of Commons and is expected to get the go-ahead from MPs, although opposition parties have said they plan put forward amendments which could slow it down.

House of Commons leader David Lidington told parliament that the bill’s third and final reading in the House of Commons would be on February 8.
The bill’s progress in the House of Lords, the upper chamber, is less certain as the government has no majority there and no control over the timing.
If approved by the House of Lords, the bill would then have to be signed off by Queen Elizabeth II before May can trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty — the formal process for leaving the bloc.
Theresa May had been invited to address the Dáil, with Brexit high on the planned agenda, but refused the offer.
The move was strongly criticised by former deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-tourism-record-3208612-Jan2017/,"FIGURES RELEASED TODAY by the Central Statistics Office have shown that more tourists visited Ireland in 2016 than ever before.
A total of 9,584,400 people visited our shores last year, representing a 10.9% increase on 2015.
A spokesperson for Tourism Ireland toldTheJournal.iethat a myriad of factors, which include stronger global economy, air access to Ireland and star attractions such as the filming locations of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, helped Irish tourism pull in the visitors last year.
Tourism authorities here are planning to build on these figures in 2017 by promoting regions such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland’s Ancient East, as well as capitalising on our connections to Star Wars and Game of Thrones.
Tourism Ireland added that the risks to tourism of Brexit can be mitigated through aggressive marketing and proactive policy interventions.
In terms of breakdown, visits from different regions of the world rose across the board last year.
North American visitors increased by 19.4% to just under 2 million. Visitors from mainland Europe grew 8.5% to 3.3 million people.
UK visitors totalled 3.9 million, representing a rise of 10.6%, while visitors to Ireland from the rest of the world rose 2.2% to over half a million people.

Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross welcomed the figures and praised the hard work of tourism agencies.
He added that he is “confident of another good year for tourism in 2017″.
Warning notes were sounded, however, by Fáilte Ireland on the challenges that lie ahead for Irish tourism.
Its director of business development, Paul Keeley, said: “While 2016 delivered an impressive performance, we need to remember that, as a small open tourism economy, we are at the mercy of external events.
According to 2016 figures, British visitors represented well over a third of all overseas visitors to Ireland.
Keeley added that Ireland should now “address the factors within our control” to help mitigate the effects of Brexit.
Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons, echoed these warnings and said that they would highlight iconic experiences across Ireland and that the group aims to grow overseas tourism revenue by 4.5% to €5.7 billion this year.
He said: “Tourism Ireland believes that the adverse impact of Brexit can be mitigated through a combination of aggressive overseas marketing and the continuation of existing successful wider policy initiatives.”
He added that the depreciation of the pound against the euro means that value for money in coming to Ireland must be emphasised to British tourists, in particular.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gerry-adams-owen-paterson-tube-3312562-Mar2017/,"GERRY ADAMS GAVE a slightly unexpected response this morning when asked about a suggestion by a former Northern Ireland Secretary that Stormont politicians should have their wages stopped as the post-election talks impasse continues.
Withholding pay from MLAs might help ”crystallise minds” and prevent lengthy negotiations, Conservative Owen Paterson, who served in the role under David Cameron, said earlier this week.
Asked about the proposal on RTÉ’s Todayprogramme this morning, the Sinn Féin leader responded by calling Paterson a “tube”.
“First let me say that Owen Paterson is a complete tube,” Adams said – using a term generally taken to mean fool or idiot.
He insisted that Paterson had done nothing to address demands from Catholic communities for inquests into historical events when he was Northern Secretary between 2010 and 2012. Adams said the Conservative government was withholding money set aside for such inquests.

The Irish News conducted an online poll yesterday– with the majority of respondents backing Paterson’s suggestion.
Paterson commented on Twitter that the non-scientific survey showed: “Strong support for stopping NI MLAs salaries & expenses payments if they fail to deliver popular demand for a new Executive.”
While perhaps not widely used throughout Ireland, the term “tube” is more common in the North.
It was prominently used in the 2004 Belfast-set canine caper comedyMan About Dog for instance.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-ireland-uk-3134091-Dec2016/,"ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT of Brexit on the UK economy will be “replicated, or even magnified, for the Irish economy”, according to a report by the UK’s House of Lords.
Areport by the Lords European Union Committeepublished today looked specifically at UK-Irish relations in the context of Brexit.
It argued that the “unique nature” of the relationship between the UK and Ireland posed a danger that Ireland both north and south would suffer “collateral damage” from the Brexit vote.
The 78-page report argued for the continuation of the open land border between the UK and Ireland as well as the continued free of movement for citizens as part of the Common Travel Area.
It also wants people in Northern Ireland to retain the right to hold Irish citizenship and therefore be EU citizens.

As part of its recommendations, the Lords Committee wants the Irish and British governments to draft a bilateral agreement outlining their shared interests in Brexit negotiations.
It wants the EU to consent to a bilateral trade agreement between Ireland and the UK.
“The Committee concluded that any negative impact of Brexit on the UK economy is likely to be replicated, or even magnified, for the Irish economy,” the report states.

Speaking today onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, chair of the Lords Committee Tim Boswell said that “there’s a lot to talk about”
“If we don’t get on with it in good time, it may well not be sufficient attention in the final negotiations,” he said.
“What we’ve said very clearly in our report is that we don’t Ireland north or south to suffer collateral damage as a result of Britain’s decision in its referendum to leave the EU.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-union-ireland-3135923-Dec2016/,"WHAT IS GOING to happen next in Europe is anyone’s guess.
The intense negotiations between Greece and the heads of EU financial institutions last year was the first major signal of the European Union’s weakness.
What followed was Greece’s left wing Syriza party reneging on its promise to end austerity and continuing to implement financial policies which Prime Minister Alexis Tsiparas argued strongly against before his election.
With Brexit to reckon with in the New Year, we’re forced to stare in the face of the flaws that go with the EU, which was created out of hope for a peaceful Europe bound together by free trade, unlimited movement of citizens, and a unified approach on issues such as climate change and upholding human rights.
Other EU developments that hint at fractures within the organisation include the Belgian region of Wallonia grinding an EU trade deal with Canada to a halt, and the differing opinions on how to meet the demands created by the migrant crisis.
And that’s not to mention the rise of far-right parties across Europe, threatening to bring the continent back to it’s World War past rather than a prosperous future.
So where is it headed?
With upcoming elections in both France and Germany, you’d wonder whether the EU’s political representatives are feeling a little on edge about the future of the project.
So we asked a few Irish Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including the Vice-President of the European Parliament.
Mairead McGuinness MEP and Vice-President of the European Parliament, says:
“In 2017, the European Union is facing a number of challenges – individually they are not existential challenges, but cumulatively they could cause problems:
“But it is too early to sound the death knell for the European Union. One of the benefits of Brexit is that it has prompted debate, in the European Parliament and elsewhere, on how the European Union needs to continue to evolve to deal with these challenges.”
Brexit
And what a debate it has sparked.

The referendum on the 23 June fractured the symbiotic and peaceful foundations of Europe in the hope that individual countries will come out better off because of it.
Whether Britain does thrive outside of the EU depends on the deal they cut with other member states, but McGuinness says that the negotiations will be important for the other 27 member states too.
“Brexit could kill or cure Europe. It is our choice and determination which will determine the outcome and as I see it, the EU-27 are strong in their resolve to remain united and forward looking. Brexit has to be dealt with but it cannot consume the EU when there are other things to do.
Surprisingly, other MEPs don’t seem too concerned by Brexit as it’s not mentioned much (either that or they’re sick of talking about it).
Things that concern them far more is the perception that the European Union is for ‘elites’ and where far-right politics might take Europe.
Elites

Matt Carthy who represents Sinn Féin and the Midlands North West, is slightly more concerned about Europe compared to his Fine Gael counterparts.
“The European Union now faces a very real existential crisis. More and more citizens across all European states have become disconnected with the whole direction of the EU project.

He disagrees with the idea of breaking up the European Union, and says instead there needs to be reform to salvage the traits worth saving.
“There are areas in which there is clearly a role for a European Union such as tackling climate change, delivering financial and corporate transparency and addressing the migration crisis.
“But the EU is failing on all these fronts because its leaders are concentrating instead on absorbing powers which should rightly be the business of national parliaments.”
McGuinness agrees that this is an issue, saying “In 2017, the EU needs to be strong and resolute – and it needs to work for citizens. Citizens need a sense of ownership of the EU: that it is there for them, not just for so-called elites, and that they are part of the project.”
Far-right

The biggest concern for Europe seems to be the rise of far-right politics as a solution for economic difficulty and a protest against multiculturalism.
Deirdre Clune says that MEPs will be “closely watching” the results of elections in France, Netherlands and Germany, as some candidates promise to take their countries out of the EU if elected.
Brian Hayes agrees with his Fine Gael colleague, and goes a step further, to say that “Europe’s biggest threat right now is the rise of nationalist politics”.
“We know to our cost from European history, the totally destructive forces that nationalism can unleash. The EU has over the past 50 years provided a bridgehead away from war and nationalism and towards cooperation and peace.
“It’s not perfect by a long shot and certainly needs reforming, but without the EU smaller counties, like Ireland, would face a very uncertain future dominated by larger counties in their region.
A European country

All MEPs say that the dismantling of the European Union would be disastrous for Ireland, with Brian Hayes suggesting that “Ireland would be the biggest loser from a breakup of the EU”.
“We depend on trade more than most because we are small and need to export. The break up of the EU means no single market for our goods and services and would represent the biggest challenge to our economy since independence.
Clune says that more needs to be done to communicate with citizens about what happens in the European Union.
“For instance, what does completing the Single Digital market mean? To me it means that a business in a remote spot in West Cork with access to high speed broadband can operate in any state across Europe without a single barrier.
“It means that a consumer in West Kerry can purchase services or products from any point in Europe free from geo-blocking, taxes or tariffs. All the elements involved in delivering these scenarios are part of ongoing work in Brussels.”
Between 1972 and 2014, Ireland received €72.5 billion from the EU, while it contributed approximately €30 billion to invest in infrastructure, education, research and other services.
‘Fight back’
Meanwhile, Hayes agrees that the EU is worth keeping, but that it does need to change: “Without necessary reforms, such as complete banking union and economic convergence, the Euro will not deliver its potential and the Europe will continue to be the sick man of the world”.
Even Carthy, who would come from a party of Eurosceptics, agrees that the bond between the 27 remaining EU countries should be saved:
“We need a new Europe based on social solidarity and co-operation among states, not the current drive towards a neo-liberal superstate. Above all, the EU must insert democratic values into the centre of all its decision-making.”
McGuinness says that the European Union has qualities that are worth fighting for, and that “it’s time to fight back and talk about what Europe means, the good it has done and what remains to be done”.
“We are not good at saying what Europe does well. It’s sometimes forgotten that EU membership is voluntary and involves member states sharing responsibilities in some policy areas.
“There are lots of problems facing us, but our job as politicians is to find solutions and not to just wring our hands in despair.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-scotland-3175823-Jan2017/,"SCOTLAND’S FIRST MINISTER Nicola Sturgeon says she’s not “bluffing” around the prospect of second Scottish independence referendum.
Sturgeon said a second referendum could be on the cards if Scotland is ”driven off a hard Brexit cliff”.
Speaking to BBC’s the Andrew Marr Show, Sturgeon took aim at UK Prime Theresa May, saying she had “no plan” around leaving the EU.
A hard Brexit would likely involve the UK leaving the European single market, isolating it in terms of trade. However, this approach would give the UK more control of its borders.

The BBC reportsthat Sturgeon has previously said a soft Brexit would see the prospect of Scottish independence “put aside” in the short-term.
In 2014, Scottish voters backed staying in the UK in a closely fought referendum by 55% to 44%.
Scottish voters also voted for the UK to remain in the EU by 62% to 38%.
Sturgeon said in her interview to be broadcast this morning that the UK Government and Theresa May would “be making a big mistake if they think I am in any way bluffing” with regards to holding another Scottish independence referendum.

https://www.thejournal.ie/may-eu-movement-3260969-Feb2017/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Theresa May is said to be poised to announce the end of free movement for new EU migrants when Article 50 triggers the Brexit negotiations next month.
She is expected to announce that EU citizens will no longer have the right to stay in the UK permanently at the same time that negotiations begin for Britain to leave the European Union.
The Telegraph reportsthat a cut-off date will be announced, where anyone from the EU who came to live and work in Britain before that date will have their rights protected as long as UK citizens living in Europe are granted the same assurances.
With no countries singled out, it is believed that this measure would apply to Ireland alongside all other EU member states, although this will be subject to negotiation during the Brexit talks.
Leading Eurosceptic MP Iain Duncan Smith said the expected announcement shows that Britain is taking back its borders, while giving clarity to the 3.6 million EU citizens already living in the country.
He said: “Theresa understands that if you want to take control you have to command the high ground. She will be giving clarity by setting a clear deadline while the European Union looks increasingly muddled and mean-spirited.”
Debate
Today, the Parliament’s House of Lords is set to scrutinise the bill allowing Britain to leave the EU, which made itthrough the House of Commonsearlier this month.
Peers are set to discuss proposals including measures to guarantee the rights of EU nationals in Britain, and defining the parameters of a parliamentary  vote on the final Brexit deal.
The so-called “committee stage” is the first opportunity for peers to make amendments, which would then get debated and voted on before being passed back to the House of Commons for approval.
If the Lords approves the bill without amendments it will be sent,  after its final reading on 7 March, directly to Queen Elizabeth II to sign into law.
However, if there are amendments, the bill could bounce between the two houses as they try to agree on its final wording, potentially derailing May’s timetable.
Dick Newby, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the upper house, said there was strong support among peers for protecting the rights of EU citizens.

There is “an overwhelming desire to do the right thing and ensure that all EU nationals have the right to remain,” he was quoted as saying by the Guardian on Sunday.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Conservative peer Michael Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister, vowed to support opposition moves to secure a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal within the bill.
May has urged the Lords to neither amend the bill nor delay it.
“There will be debate and scrutiny in the House of Lords, but I don’t want to see anybody holding up what the British people want… which is for us to deliver Brexit, to leave the European Union,” she said.
Irish reaction
Speaking onRTÉ’s The News at One, Minister for State for European Affairs Dara Murphy said that one of the key issues to be addressed over the next few months will be the rights of British citizens in Europe, and vice versa.
He said that it was important that the tone for discussions between the EU and the UK remain “moderate” and that the fears of people affected by the end of free movement are addressed.
“The free movement of people around Europe has been an excellent contributory factor to economies and in enriching societies,” he said.
Minister Murphy said that it would be impossible to immediately suspend free movement as soon as Article 50 is triggered, despite what has been suggested by May’s administration.
“The legal position is very clear,” he said, adding that the rights of EU citizens are guaranteed until after the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations.
He later said that when free movement does end between the UK and the EU is “subject to the negotiations” around Brexit.
The Fine Gael TD for Cork North Central said that maintaining the common travel area was a key priority, and that the government here was focusing on ensuring this remained in place.
“There is a strong understanding [in the EU] that we have unique circumstances,” he added.

BREXIT CAMPAIGNER AND former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has taken aim at Sinn Féin, in particular Gerry Adams, over the party’s approach to the referendum.
“I remember the Nice Treaty, which Ireland rejected and I remember the Lisbon Treaty which Ireland rejected just over ten years ago,” Faragetold TV3′s Agenda today.
“And I remember Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin saying in both of those referendums – we didn’t fight the British for 500 years to have Ireland governed by the EU.
“And I thought, I’m not a Gerry Adams supporter, but actually what he’s saying is completely and utterly logical. Irish nationalism actually made some sense.

“They wanted Ireland to be an independent self-governing democratic nation.
Sinn Féin campaigned to remain in the European Union, and the party called for a border poll back in June after results showed a majority in Northern Ireland had in fact voted to remain in the EU.
Eamonn FarrellEamonn Farrell
Last month, Adams told the annual Friends of Sinn Féin dinner in New York that the Brexit process posed a danger to the peace process and to constitutional arrangements fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement – one of the landmark deals of the process.
“The choice is simple,” he said. “Acquiesce to the demands of London and allow the North to be dragged out of the EU, at the whim of an English government, or pursue the credible path to argue at European level and with the British government for the North to be designated a special status within the EU.”
Adams said an ongoing process could end partition on the island of Ireland.
“Just as there are massive challenges, there is also the opportunity to plot a new course forward; a course that will end the partition of our island.
“The British government is now obliged to legislate for Irish unity if a majority wants that. The duty of the Irish government should be to achieve this. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

Brexit plan? To 'have cake and eat it', according to glimpse of hand-written memohttps://t.co/kjLkdclwPwpic.twitter.com/NRJr4Jp69k— HuffPost UK (@HuffPostUK)November 28, 2016Huffington Post UK/ Twitter
Brexit plan? To 'have cake and eat it', according to glimpse of hand-written memohttps://t.co/kjLkdclwPwpic.twitter.com/NRJr4Jp69k
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has distanced itself from a memo outlining plans for Brexit spotted as a lawmaker left Downing Street, which included the aim to “have cake and eat it”.
“What’s the model? Have cake and eat it,” read the hand-written paper held by an aide accompanying Mark Field, a London MP for the ruling Conservative Party.
The notes were caught by a photographer as Field left the Department for Exiting the European Union – an office set up in the wake of Britain’s shock 23 June vote to leave the bloc.
The Brexit department would not detail the purpose of Field’s visit to Downing Street or who he had been meeting.
“These individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special adviser. They do not reflect the government’s position in relation to Brexit negotiations,” a government spokesperson told AFP.
The memo suggests Britain will fail to keep access to the European single market and will seek to keep the negotiations to two years, rejecting the idea of a lengthier transitional deal aimed at lessening the sudden impact of leaving the EU.
“Keep the two years. Won’t provide more detail. We think it’s unlikely we’ll be offered single market,” the notes read.
“Transitional – loathe to do it. Whitehall will hold onto it,” they say, referring to the view that pro-EU lawmakers in Britain would seek to make a transitional deal permanent.

More than five months after the referendum, Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to outline the government’s Brexit strategy.
The government’s promise to keep its playing cards close to its chest ahead of starting formal divorce proceedings with Brussels – which May has promised to do before the end of March – has also fuelled interest in any snippets of information out of Downing Street.
‘Very French negotiating team’
The notes photographed yesterday and published in British media go into brief detail on negotiating by sector, suggesting a deal on manufacturing will be “relatively straightforward”.
“Services harder – because French hoping for business,” is also written, while “French likely to be most difficult” appears further down the page.
Paris is just one of many European cities hoping to attract business away from the City of London financial hub, by promising access to the EU single market and free movement of workers.
The memo also mentions a “very French negotiating team”, in an apparent nod to the European Commission’s top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, a former French minister.
“Canada Plus” is scrawled on the notepad, likely referring to the recent trade deal struck between Ottawa and Brussels, while the comment “no Norway” suggests London should not seek membership of the the tariff-free European Economic Area as part of its EU exit.
The notes will prove embarrassing for Downing Street, following a memo leaked earlier this month which claimed the government had no overarching plan for Brexit.
Civil servants are struggling to cope with more than 500 Brexit-related projects and an extra 30,000 extra staff may be needed to handle the workload, according to the memo, reportedly prepared for the government by a consultant.
May’s team denied the claims and said it did not commission the report.

Questions also hang over the visit due to the Taoiseach stating that he will decide if he will extend an invitation to Trump to visit Ireland when he meets the President.
Varadkar has said he “wouldn’t be keen”on inviting Donald Trump to visit Ireland.
‘Unique opportunity’
The annual trade and publicity missions have come in for criticism in recent years, in wake of the downturn, and successive ministers have been keen to talk up the real-world benefits.
“St Patrick’s Day provides Ireland with both an international platform to deliver our strategic messages as well as access to key political and business contacts in leading markets around the world,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said tonight.
“This year St Patrick’s Day falls in a month of critical importance, with the expected triggering of Article 50 by the UK and the beginning of its formal negotiations to leave the EU.
“It is essential that Irish Ministers continue to highlight Ireland’s priorities to Member State governments throughout Europe, building on the important work that has already taken place.
The Taoiseach is due to meet businesses, political leaders and community groups in New York and Washington. Other locations may be added to Kenny’s itinerary at a later date.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-may-ireland-2-3154122-Dec2016/,"ENDA KENNY TOLD reporters today he will be holding a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Ireland next month.
The meeting is expected to take place in Dublin.
Earlier this week, May said the status of Irish people in the UK might change after Britain leaves the EU.
When asked about May’s comments, the Taoiseach said: “Theresa May has declined to rule out a change in the status of Irish nationals living in Britain, suggesting the issue is part of a broader negotiation about the rights of EU citizens after Brexit.
“After Britain leaves the EU, it will be free to choose what rights to offer Irish citizens in the UK, including a continuation of the current arrangement under which they have most of the same rights as British citizens.”
Government sources today said that May’s remarks may have conflated two different questions: the status of other EU citizens in Britain and the status of Irish citizens living in Britain.

It is understood the British government has no intention of making the status of Irish citizens living in the UK conditional on the outcome of talks in relation to citizens from other EU countries.
Article 50
Kenny continued: “When Article 50 is triggered, we will then know what kind of future relationship the UK wants with Europe, because that is what this is all about.
“And in those discussions, what I intend to see happen is very clear. The Good Friday Agreement contains the future option and potential for a united Ireland.
“That can only be triggered if there are sufficient support for a referendum North and South. It is the peoples North and South who will decide to join Ireland, in a new Republic. So it is very important that that understanding of that principle is enshrined it the language of negotiations to be concluded.”
Kenny said that in previous discussions with May they “agreed a few things”.
“She did ask that when the negotiations would start that a question of European Union people, living in Britain, and British people living in Europe, would be dealt with at an early part of those discussions. And that is separate from the rights and relationship that Ireland has with the UK.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/queen-brexit-ready-3291460-Mar2017/,"
QUEEN ELIZABETH II gave royal assent today to a bill empowering British Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty and begin the process of leaving the European Union.
May has said she will send a letter to the European Council informing them of Britain’s decision to leave the bloc by the end of March, following a majority vote for Brexit in last year’s referendum.
The House of Commons speaker John Bercow announced the final go-ahead in the parliamentary chamber, prompting cheers from ruling Conservative Party MPs.
“Her Majesty has signified her royal assent,” he said.
May’s spokesman told a daily briefing: “The legislation now has royal assent.
“We look forward to beginning negotiations when we trigger Article 50 by the end of March,” he said.
The queen’s signature on the bill allows May to invoke Article 50 at any time, starting a process that will take a maximum of two years unless Britain and its EU partners agree to extend the deadline.

May has said she will address the British parliament to inform lawmakers that she has triggered Article 50, and an initial response is expected from the European Commission within 48 hours.
Full negotiations, however, are not expected to start for several weeks or months as both sides prepare.
“This will be a defining moment for our whole country as we begin to forge a new relationship with Europe and a new role for ourselves in the world,” May told MPs on Tuesday.
She had been widely expected to trigger Article 50 this week but the plan appears to have been derailed by a surprise announcement by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Monday that she would seek a new independence referendum.
During the EU referendum campaign, Buckingham Palace denied a report in The Sun tabloid that the queen was a supporter of Brexit.
The newspaper cited an anonymous “senior source” who said the monarch had “let rip” at pro-EU politician Nick Clegg during a lunch in 2011 when he was deputy prime minister.
“People who heard their conversation were left in no doubt at all about the queen’s views on European integration,” the source was quoted as saying.
“The EU is clearly something her majesty feels passionately about,” the source said.

WHEN YOU’RE THE leader of a country you’re bound to get lots of post – both letters and emails.
Enda Kenny is no exception, with correspondence being sent to the Taoiseach from Ireland and abroad on a daily basis.
We were granted access to letters and emails sent to Kenny from 12-14 October, the days following the Budget announcement this year, under the Freedom of Information Act.
The topics that featured most frequently were the Eighth Amendment and the ongoing war in Syria. The Budget also came up, as did Brexit. He also got some autograph requests.
Pro-life
Over the course of the three days, the Taoiseach received a number of emails about the possibility of the Eighth Amendment (the section of the Constitution that gives equal status to the right of the unborn to that of a woman) being repealed, something currently being examined by the Citizens’ Assembly. They were all pro-life.
One of the emails described terminations as “inhumane” and claimed to be speaking on behalf of “the most vulnerable in our society – the infant in the womb”.

Another person who emailed the Taoiseach accused him of bowing to a “roaring mob” over abortion, noting: “You really have let yourself and your country down.”
A different email included a link to a petition the writer wanted Kenny to sign. It called for the Citizens’ Assembly to be opposed as it “conspires to kill the unborn”.
Budget
Some first-time buyers, and Fine Gael voters, wrote a letter expressing their thoughts on the tax rebate scheme for new homeowners, something they missed out on it by just a few weeks.
They wrote: “During your election campaign in February you promised, in the Fine Gael Manifesto, to support home ownership. This is one of the reasons we both voted for candidates of Fine Gael in the general election and wanted your party to remain in power.
“Please backdate the rebate to your date of re-election to government. If there is anything you could do to help us avail of this scheme and ease our financial burden-we would be extremely grateful.”

Another member of the public was unhappy at what they saw as stay-at-home parents “being treated differently to dual-income families” in terms of childcare provisions in the Budget.

One person sent an email to Kenny and other Oireachtas members describing the Budget as “an insult to every taxpayer in the country”.
They singled out the fiver increase in the old-age pension as particularly unfair, and said it was “time for a re-think on how the country is going to be governed for the remainder of this term … some of you will not be re-elected and you will only have yourselves to blame”.
Syria
The war in Syria, which has been ongoing since 2011 and claimed over 300,000 lives, came up a number of times over the three-day period being looked at.
The general consensus was anti-Assad regime and anti-Russia.



Brexit
In terms of Brexit, Chartered Accountants Ireland sent the Taoiseach their “recommended priorities for policy makers working on agreements for the future movement of goods and people”.
Separately, a person sent an email to Kenny, but addressed to Finance Minister Michael Noonan which accused Ireland of “standing idly by” and being “asleep at the wheel” while other countries fought for business following the UK’s decision to leave the EU.

‘Well done’
Although mostly negative in tone, not all public correspondence sent to Kenny over the course of the three days was negative.
A couple of people wanted his autograph or a signed photograph.


Another person sent him an email with the subject line ‘Well done’, which praised the Taoiseach for managing to “pull all tribes together”.

EU REGULATIONS COULD put Irish tourism businesses at a disadvantage compared to their UK-based rivals after Brexit, a new report has warned.
A document published today by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) said that “withdrawal from EU inspired regulations and compliance issues” could make the cost of doing business in the UK comparatively cheaper than Ireland.
ITIC – which counts Aer Lingus, the Guinness Storehouse and Tourism Ireland among its member organisations – called for “the harmonisation of regulatory standards across the island of Ireland”.
It warned that a different set of business codes and practices between Northern Ireland and the Republic could lead to “significant cost variances”, which would skew customers’ perception of value-for-money between the two parts of the island.
EU-imposed health and safety rules, environmental regulations and consumer protection codes are the “most likely aspects” that could handicap Ireland’s transport and hospitality sectors after Brexit.
The report said coach operators in particular could be disadvantaged against firms based in Britain and Northern Ireland because of the need to comply with “EU directives governing drivers’ hours and associated costs”.

‘Left behind’
The ITIC report was critical of the government’s response to Brexit so far.
It noted that unlike state agencies in the agri-food and manufacturing sectors, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have not been given extra funding to recruit additional staff.

“It is evident that the impacts on tourism are not being treated with the same degree of urgency and importance as other export sectors of the economy, ” ITIC said.
ITIC said the government should provide an extra €12 million to tourism budgets.
The organisation also called for the retention of the ‘Common Travel Area’ and liberal aviation access between the UK and the EU. It has previously called for theestablishment of a ‘Brexit taskforce’.

ITIC said the UK’s decision to leave the EU will be “the greatest challenge to face Irish tourism since the global economic recession of 2008″.
The British market is Ireland’s largest overseas tourism market, and brought in €1.3 billion last year. Two out of every five visitors that came to the island in 2016 hailed from Britain.
ITIC chief Eoghan O’Mara Walsh said “the tourism euro is as valuable as the euro earned by any other export sector”.
“The government must be proactive and help the sector consolidate its market share in Britain but crucially diversify into other markets,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scottish-independence-brexit-3229968-Feb2017/,"
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT “does not believe there should be a second referendum” on Scottish independence, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokeswoman said today, following reports that she is making contingency plans for another vote.
Speculation is mounting that Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will declare her intention to hold a rerun of the September 2014 vote, as a poll published today revealed rising support for independence ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union.
“We don’t believe that there should be a second referendum. There has been a referendum, it was clear, decisive, it was legal, and both sides agreed to abide by the results of that referendum,” May’s spokesman told journalists today.
Downing Street was responding to a report that it had told Scottish newspaper The Courier it was holding “contingency” talks to deal with a referendum announcement.
Scotland rejected independence by 55% in 2014, but 20 months later it voted to remain in the European Union by 62%, sparking calls for a fresh vote.
The battle over Scotland’s constitutional future is now almost an even split, according to a new poll released Wednesday.
Support has risen to 49%, excluding undecided voters, with 51% in favour of staying in the British union, a BMG poll for the Herald newspaper said.
The poll was conducted after May confirmed her intention to take Britain out of the European single market.
‘Game on’
Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has said a second independence referendum is now “highly likely”, and allies have suggested it could be as early as 2018.

Former SNP leader Alex Salmond tweeted a picture of the Herald’s front page story on the poll, saying: “Game on…”
Game on...https://t.co/17sJ2yyKHs— Alex Salmond (@AlexSalmond)February 7, 2017Alex Salmond/ Twitter
Game on...https://t.co/17sJ2yyKHs
The SNP said the latest poll showed the independence debate is now “a virtual dead heat”.
“If the Tories continue with their blind pursuit of a hard Brexit, ignoring the clear view of an overwhelming majority of people in Scotland, then more and more people will see independence as the option delivering certainty and stability,” said SNP chair Derek Mackay.
Conducted among 1,067 voters aged over 16, the poll asked: “Should Scotland be an independent country?” with 43% saying “Yes” and 45% saying “No”. The remainder were undecided or would not say.
It represents a three-point swing towards independence from a similar BMG/Herald poll conducted in December.
However, the survey also found 56% of Scots do not want another independence referendum before the conclusion of Brexit negotiations, expected in 2019.
The Scottish parliament, in a symbolic motion, voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to reject Britain’s march towards the EU exit, with the semi-autonomous government warning Scotland would not be “humiliated”.
The Scottish government said the vote – backed by nearly three quarters of Scottish lawmakers from across the political spectrum – is one of the most important in the parliament’s 18-year history.
May warned today that an independent Scotland “would not be in the European Union.”

UK MPS HAVE approved the first stage of a bill empowering Prime Minister Theresa May to start pulling Britain out of the European Union.
MPs approved the bill, which would allow the government to trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty and formally begin two years of exit negotiations, by a margin of 498 to 114.
It was the first Brexit-related vote in the House of Commons, with a second and final vote in the lower house set for next week.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his party MPs not block the bill, but dozens rebelled.
May is under intense pressure to push the bill through quickly, having promised EU leaders she would trigger Article 50 by the end of March.
She told MPs she would publish a long-awaited Brexit strategy paper tomorrow, opening it to parliamentary scrutiny while the Article 50 legislation makes its way through parliament.
“It will reflect the government’s plan for Brexit,” May’s spokeswoman told reporters.
The government had sought to exclude parliament, insisting it had the power to trigger Article 50 on its own, but the Supreme Court last week ruled it must consult lawmakers.
Most MPs campaigned to stay in the EU ahead of last June’s referendum, but as debate on the bill began yesterday, many said they would accept the result, however reluctantly.
The bill could be delayed in the upper House of Lords, where May’s Conservative Party does not have a majority – and where the unelected peers have no fear of a public backlash.

‘Remainers’ divided
A new survey revealed that MPs who campaigned to leave the EU are relatively united in what they want – whereas those who were on the other side have more diverse views.
Some 72% of Leavers favour controlling immigration or not paying into the EU budget over retaining access to Europe’s single market.
This reflects May’s own position.
She has said she wants to end the free movement into Britain of people from the EU, a demand she acknowledges is incompatible with maintaining membership of the single market.
“Remainers are much more divided over what to prioritise – which may well make them less able to shape the debate,” said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe research programme.
The vast majority of Leavers (86%) also believe Britain will be able to make up for any loss in trade with the EU through other deals, whereas 71% of Remainers believe it cannot.
But Britain’s former ambassador to the EU has warned that the bloc would likely take a “hard line”, demanding an exit bill of €40-60 billion as part of drawn out negotiations.
“This is a humongous negotiation and project,” Ivan Rogers told MPs. “I think it will take years to get to the other side of it.”
At just 143 words, the “European Union Notification of Withdrawal Bill” has been tightly drafted, making it difficult to amend either to delay the government’s plans or to tie its hands in the talks.
But May’s opponents are still trying, and dozens of amendments are scheduled for debate over three days in the House of Commons which begins on Monday.
The bill will then move to the Lords for debate from February 20, with the government hoping for their approval by 7 March.

BRITAIN HAS SAID it has picked a “tough negotiator” to replace its ambassador to the European Union,who unexpectedly resignedjust weeks before Brexit negotiations are due to start.
Career diplomat Tim Barrow, the former ambassador to Moscow who has previously served in Brussels, replaces Ivan Rogers who resigned yesterday with an email which criticised London’s approach to leaving the bloc following the shock referendum result in June.
A Downing Street spokesperson said they were “delighted” that Barrow was taking up the post.
“A seasoned and tough negotiator, with extensive experience of securing UK objectives in Brussels, he will bring his trademark energy and creativity to this job — working alongside other senior officials and ministers to make a success of Brexit,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
During a 30-year diplomatic career Barrow has twice served in Brussels at UKRep, the office which represents Britain in negotiations in the EU, and has also been posted to Kiev as British ambassador.
Barrow said he was honoured at being appointed at such a “crucial time”.
“I look forward to joining the strong leadership team at the Department for Exiting the EU and working with them and the talented staff at UKRep to ensure we get the right outcome for the United Kingdom as we leave the EU,” he said.
‘Muddled thinking’
The appointment was welcomed by Tom Fletcher, Britain’s former ambassador to Lebanon.
“Great news. Tenacious, human, expert, connected, thick skinned enough not to worry about nutters, and will avoid poison in the chalice,” he wrote on Twitter.

“Good that Tim Barrow will replace Ivan Rogers at UKREP. He is expert on EU (&Russia) & will be respected by its governments and institutions,” he tweeted.

Barrow will begin his new post at a key moment in relations between Brussels and London, as British Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to kick-start negotiations to quit the EU by the end of March.
Barrow’s predecessor faced criticism last month when he said it would take 10 years for Britain to conclude a trade deal with the EU.
In a resignation note to staff Rogers said London lacked multilateral negotiating experience and urged colleagues to continue providing their expertise even when unwelcome.
“I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power,” he wrote.
The appointment of Barrow as his replacement disappointed anti-EU campaigners, who had hoped a strong pro-Brexit candidate would be posted to Brussels.
“Good to see that the government have replaced a knighted career diplomat with…. a knighted career diplomat,” Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party, wrote on Twitter.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/uks-brexit-choices-3140053-Dec2016/,"BRITAIN HAS FALLEN into a trap from their impulsion to Brexit and they don’t seem to know it. The Article 50 withdrawal procedure is fundamentally flawed, mainly against the departing state.
Without an advance meeting of minds between the EU and the UK, this unfair procedure puts the latter in a hopelessly weak negotiating position and may collapse it entirely.
Section 3 Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty:
A two-year time limit
In practice, the two-year time limit runs against the UK. From the time the EU makes its final offer, the UK has only two choices: “take it or leave it”. If rejected, on the expiry of the period, there will be a Brexit which is as hard as you can get and on no terms whatever.
Membership ceases with no further obligations or privileges subject to paying any outstanding money. The UK’s relationship with the EU would be conducted as an outsider perhaps with disappointed former colleagues.
The question of submission of any deal for UK parliamentary approval after the Article 50 notice, proposed by British Labour, is a distraction to any real parliamentary input, and irrelevant to parliamentary veto on any proposed new arrangement.
If Parliament had power to reject it and did so, the EU has to do nothing but watch the clock wind down the two-year period and the UK becomes by default a former member state of the EU on no terms at all.
At best this would delay massively such new arrangements as the UK would make as an external state. For Ireland, there are severe implications as there would then be no arrangement in place to avoid a hard border and provide supports for the current shared administration in Belfast.
Legislating for Article 50 invocation
Demonstrators wave flags from the top of a bus outside The Supreme Court in London. May's government will ask Supreme Court justices to overturn a ruling that Parliament must hold a vote before Britain's exit negotiations can begin.Kirsty WigglesworthKirsty Wigglesworth
Parliamentary approval and the possible requirement of enabling legislation for Article 50 invocation, now under consideration by the Supreme Court in London is another factor.
Advertisement
The Government motion in Parliament on the 7th of December approving the Article 50 notice could impinge on the judge’s deliberations and is so being spun by the Tories and some British media.
Even if the judges decide for parliamentary authority prior to Article 50 notice, the vast majority of members of both houses in Parliament clearly have no stomach or other glandular strength to invoke any independent or conscientious wisdom to review the current obsession to depart the EU rapidly at any cost.
Further litigation now proposed here in Ireland will question whether Article 50 Notice is revocable. Nothing in the Article itself suggests it is and I doubt there is anything implicitly so either, so it is doubtful that this will be an effective challenge.
EU trading benefits only leverage
The stark sad simplicity of the above exit scenario can be obviated only by considerations the EU may have an interest in securing terms from the UK for their leaving. This will depend to some degree on the evaluation of trading benefits to the remaining EU members.
Article 50 seems designed as if never intended to be used, possibly as a deterrence. There is neither suggestion nor likelihood of it being redrafted within the current turmoil.
It would be lunacy for the UK to proceed with the Article 50 notice without some vital terms being agreed in advance. Without this the UK will be entirely at the mercy of the EU in the negotiations and the EU itself at the mercy of a “rogue member”.
This is no mere scenario but is what must happen without unusual goodwill on the part of the EU. Its effect is far more drastic than the well canvassed risks from advance disclosure of the UK’s agenda.
UK must pause and plan
There is still time to avoid this outcome and the UK is sincerely advised to defer any further steps along the departure road and not to serve the Article 50 Notice. This allows pause to clarify options and to plan and if necessary to hold out for terms.
It has implications for us all and in particular for the Irish interests. Ireland would have to consider supporting the UK both for Ireland’s and the UK’s sake. It will be harder for the UK to row back given its entrenchment.
Ireland has done due diligence on Brexit. The UK, including Northern Ireland are not so prepared. Sectional and populist politics are playing too great a part in the drama. The outcome is potentially severe but with due care and foresight the impending shifts can be much better managed.
Wisdom is called for now rather than driving petulance. A considered resolute approach will lead to greater fairness and a more successful outcome for all concerned.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-future-poll-3217048-Feb2017/,"BREXIT HAS CREATED a lot of confusion about Northern Ireland, and a poll has confirmed that people aren’t feeling great about it.
After Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, the issue of what would happen to the UK’s land border with the Republic of Ireland has gathered a lot of attention.
It’s been escalating ever since then: the Stormont Assembly collapsed and Martin McGuinness, one of the leading figures in Northern Ireland politics, resigned.
In aClaire Byrne Livepoll conducted by Amárach Research, 1,000 adults were asked:‘Are you optimistic about Northern Ireland’s future?’
The results were:

Theresa May and Enda Kenny have both made it very clear that ‘there will be no return to the borders of the past’ but as Article 50 has yet to be triggered, and EU negotiations are still to come, no one is really sure what will happen.
This was confused further when a statement made by an MP said that it mightn’t be up to either Ireland or Britain – but that the EU could force a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
On theNews at Oneyesterday, former Tánaiste Joan Burton suggested that there would be a ‘lycra option’ – a quirkier wording for a ‘soft’ border through technology.
It is hoped that this would create a frictionless border with no delays, that could check through sensors whether drivers have the right passes/credentials to travel across the border.
But Burton also said the outcome of the border depended on “the strength of the case Ireland makes” about protecting jobs and maintaining relations.
It depends on the case Ireland makes, not only to the UK, but to the negotiators and the dealmakers in the other 26 countries, so they understand how technical and how difficult this is going to be.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-brexit-michael-gove-3188807-Jan2017/,"PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD Trump has described Brexit as a “great thing” and said he thinks more countries will leave the EU.
In an interview with conservative politician Michael Gove, Trump said that the EU is just a vehicle for Germany and claimed he would be setting up a trade deal with the UK as soon as they leave the bloc.
Outgoing president Barack Obama had claimed Britain would be “at the back of the queue” if they voted to leave, something he had to retract following the UK’s vote last summer.

Trump toldThe Times of London: “You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.
“Trump said Brexit is going to happen, and it happened. Everybody thought I was crazy. Obama said, ‘they’ll go to the back of the line,’ and then he had to retract his statement. Countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity, but I do think if they hadn’t been forced to take in all of the refugees then you wouldn’t have a Brexit.”
Trump also attacked Angela Merkel’s immigration policy and declared her decision to bring in thousands of asylum seekers as a “big mistake”.
He added: “I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from.”

UKIP WILL NO longer be represented in the British parliament after its only MP announced today he was quitting to become an independent.
Douglas Carswell said his membership was no longer necessary following last year’s referendum vote to leave the EU, saying:

The announcement comes just days before Prime Minister Theresa May is due to formally notify the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave, starting a two-year countdown to Brexit.
Carswell’s ties had long been strained with the rest of the party, in particular its founder Nigel Farage, who has repeatedly tried and failed to win election to the 650-seat House of Commons.
Farage, one of UKIP’s 20 members of the European Parliament, last month publicly asked Carswell to leave the party, saying he “actively and transparently seeks to damage us”.

But his resignation is a blow after months of infighting in the party, which is struggling to find a winning platform beyond its core message of euroscepticism and opposition to mass immigration.
Carswell was first elected to parliament in 2005 as a member of May’s Conservative party, but resigned in 2014 to stand again as a member of UKIP in the south-eastern English seat of Clacton.
“Like many of you, I switched to UKIP because I desperately wanted us to leave the EU.” he wrote in a blog posting, entitled “Job Done”.
He paid tribute to UKIP’s efforts, saying that despite their failure to win more MPs, “in a way we are the most successful political party in Britain ever”.
“We have achieved what we were established to do -– and in doing so we have changed the course of our country’s history for the better,” he said.
“Make no mistake; we would not be leaving the EU if it was not for UKIP, and for those remarkable people who founded, supported and sustained our party over that period.”

2016 HAS BEEN the year of the upset.
Pollsters, financial markets, and bookies have called almost every major event this year the wrong way.
The three biggest surprises have beenLeicester City winning the 2015/16 Premier League season in May,Britain voting to leave the European Union in June, andDonald Trump beating Hilary Clintonto become the 45th President of the United States.

British bookmakerLadbrokestold Business Insider that if someone had made a £1 accumulator bet on all three events to happen when they were at their longest odds, they would be sitting on £4,530,906 (€5,342,924) today. In other words, you could have turned €1.20 into €5.3 million.
Ladbrokessays the longest odds it offered on each event were: 5,000/1 on Leicester winning the Premier League, 5/1 on Brexit, and 150/1 on Trump winning the election.
The bookie says nobody had an accumulator on all three events happening but around 100 people had accumulators on both Brexit and a Trump victory. The average odds on these accumulators were 20/1 and the biggest bet was £100 (€120) at that rate – whoever made that bet is sitting on a £2,000 (€2,400) profit today.
Pascal Lemesre, spokesperson for betting exchange Smarkets, told Business Insider its most successful punter made £165,000 (€195,000) trading the US election result overnight.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/how-do-irish-in-london-feel-about-brexit-3155728-Dec2016/,"THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: IMAGINE you are Cillian Murphy at the start of 28 Days Later but instead of 28 days you’ve been unconscious for a year, and instead of a zombie apocalypse you awaken to the world as it is today. Would you believe what you were seeing?
It’s been over a year since Iwrote a piece for TheJournal.ieabout joining the Labour party and the startling rise of Jeremy Corbyn. In that space of time we have seen the UK vote to leave the EU, the USA vote to elect Donald Trump and a very near miss for the far right in Austria.
2016 was like some cosmic prank
We have seen Russia massively ramp up its military intervention in Syria, ongoing and widening divisions in the Middle East, Islamic extremism establish a foothold in mainland Europe and a general failure of western media to properly challenge blatant lies spouted by elected officials amidst a resurgence of populist, nationalist and racist rhetoric.
We have watched the beginnings (because it is only the beginning) of the greatest mass movement of people in the history of the planet in what is currently dubbed the Migration Crisis. Not to mention the apparent epidemic afflicting our most celebrated icons and the Killer Clown craze. Yes, it would appear as though 2016 were just an exercise in dystopian surrealism or some sort of cosmic prank.
Those on the political left have sadly responded by living up to the usual stereotype: either blaming each other or arguing about who to blame, while the far right have succeeded in lowering the bar for political discourse and gaining serious political ground.
Those in power meanwhile waste time attempting to diagnose the disease after the patient has gone into cardiac arrest. There is now a real danger that a lack of understanding and a too-slow response will push more democracies towards more radical alternatives.
France, for example, isnow a major cause for disquiet. Even if the French cast aside Marine Le Pen’s racist demagoguery, François Fillon means the left will have already lost ground. The mere fact that he is being described as CENTRE-right speaks volumes when you scrutinise some of his social policies, which are far from centre.
My unease turned to anger and shock
I don’t really believe it is true to say that the Brexiters and UKIP won the referendum, but rather it is more accurate to say the other side lost. They completely dropped the proverbial ball. Cameron employed the tactics used so effectively in the General Election campaign.
When the American President came to the UK and told the peoplehere that they would be at the back of the queuefor any trade deals should they vote to leave, I couldn’t help but ask myself how they thought that would look. Of course one of the key tenets of neoliberalism is that people are rational actors and would therefore not act against their own interests.
But people are much more complex in reality. Besides, when did it become acceptable for the leader of a foreign power to actually visit another country and intervene in their democracy?
I was in Exmouth Market looking for lunch a couple of days before the referendum when I was stopped by a Government campaigner to ask which way I’d be voting. I told him I was a member of the Labour Party and would be voting Remain. I told him I was disappointed that David Cameron had effectively decided to employ the tactics of notorious right-wing strategist Lynton Crosby.
His response was: “I know, I know, I hate Crosby, he’s a ghastly man but this is really dangerously close now.” It was a quintessentially grassroots-Tory response and I couldn’t help smile a little at the use of the word “ghastly”.
Parallels between Brexit and Trump’s election

Just as the courting of fringe demographics by US Republicans over decades created the space for Trump despite the party’s own wishes, Brexit was the result of the Conservative Party indulging in long-held bogus claims about the EU.

Doing so was about appeasing a vocal minority within the party itself who refuse to let the Empire die. It might be difficult for people in Ireland to comprehend but there really were people here who cited “straight bananas” as a reason to vote leave and therefore “take back control” (presumably of their bananas).
These are the days of the populist and while it is unpalatable to many on the left to indulge in the practices so diligently and effectively employed by the right, it is surely self-evident that the main strength of the right is its simplicity.
Even unoriginal slogans like “take back control” and “make America great again” are simple and effective messages that give voice to a sense of loss or at least a loss of control that many people feel. It seemingly doesn’t even matter if they’re followed through or not. “Lock her up” anyone?
What do we know about Brexit so far?
Well, we know that it will be of a consistency that is yet to be decided: a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit. Colour-palette wise it will likely be either grey, or red, white and blue. The vacuity of these statements is almost Python-esque and yet they are circulated and repeated again and again until (almost) legitimised.
Labour’s leadership has been depressingly ineffective and the current strategy of appealing to both Remainers and Brexiters is impossible to actually achieve. Theparty’s recent win in forcing the Prime Minister into promisingto give details of her Brexit plans gave some hope, however.
The other big news stories
We have seen the secret mechanisms exposed that enable the rich to hide their wealth in offshore trusts, remember thenow curiously quiet Panama Papers?
Jo Cox, a Labour MP, was shot dead outside her local constituency surgery during the poisonous Brexit campaign for her welcoming stance on immigration. The UK has passed the use of the most intrusive surveillance powers in the developed world in the Investigatory Powers Bill, and around a year ago the world had finally reached some form of consensus on a combined effort to tackle climate change in the Paris Agreement.
The last of these is under serious threat now that a climate change denier holds the highest office on the planet, despite the fact that denying climate change today is the equivalent of standing in a burning house which you know is on fire but refusing to acknowledge the fire until you yourself are set ablaze.
‘I no longer feel welcome’
The spikes in hate crime after both Brexit and Trump have been well documented and the notion that this small but vicious sector of society now feels empowered is very worrying for many people.
What we are now bearing witness to is a complex set of circumstances which has ingrained disenfranchisement within large sectors of the developed world, something which will surely be exacerbated as vast numbers of people flee their current dire circumstances and migrate west in an existential desperation.
We find this extremely difficult to understand and our elected officials – wedded as they are to an outmoded neoliberal system – are categorically failing to deal with it.
There are seeds of hope within all this gloom. I think the current climate will force people to become more politically engaged by sheer necessity and there are already policy changes happening within the power circles of the world. The only real question is will they happen fast enough?
It is no longer acceptable to extol the virtues of the EU without acknowledging its many problems and we need to fix them quickly. When Europe rumbles the world should know, by now, to tremble.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-ireland-survey-attitude-3163810-Dec2016/,"IRELAND HAS REMAINED one of the most pro-EU countries despite the UK voting to leave the bloc, new research has revealed.
The study conducted by RED C Research found that 80% of respondents said they would remain in the EU if there were an exit referendum tomorrow.
The EU also appears to be secure elsewhere in Europe as well, as the percentage of people in Germany, France and Belgium who would vote to leave has fallen from this time last year.
The RED C survey revealed 62% of the Irish public believe the country is heading in the right direction. The next most optimistic country is Iceland at 57%.

However for most in Europe, the view is that their countries are heading in the wrong direction, most noticeably in Greece  at 89%, France on 82% and Italy with 79%.
Richard Colwell, CEO of RED C said: “2016 saw the EU foundations severely shaken.  While Ireland remains the EU’s strongest supporters, votes in Greece, Italy, Finland would create further uncertainty in the markets.
Last year, those in Denmark and Sweden were also significantly less likely to vote to leave compared with 12 months ago.
However, there has been a significant increase in support to leave the EU in Finland (up from 29% to 40%) and in Greece (up from 38% to 46%).
When the study asked those in the UK how they would vote in a second referendum, 54% said they would prefer to be a part of the EU and 46% preferring to remain out (down from the 54% recorded in our poll 12 months ago).

https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-eu-meeting-3220353-Feb2017/,"TODAY, TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny will attend an EU heads of government summit in Valletta, Malta.
Donald Trump, Brexit and migration are set to dominate the agenda, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May set to be excluded from the second part of the meeting to allow other EU leaders to discuss the way ahead after Britain leaves the bloc.
According to a government statement, the Taoiseach will “call for a balanced approach to the many challenges facing us”.
He will also seek out certain EU leaders individually, to highlight and explain Ireland’s concerns arising from Brexit.
This informal gathering is the latest in a series of meetings called since Britain voted to leave the EU last June.
The first part of the meeting, which all 28 leaders will attend, will focus on the migration crisis amid warnings of a new surge in people making the dangerous sea crossing from Libya.
“Our main goal for the Malta summit is to stem the flow of irregular migration from Libya to Europe. This is the only way to stop people dying in the deserts and at sea,” EU President Donald Tusk said in Valletta yesterday.

Theresa May will miss the second part when the other 27 discuss the way ahead after Brexit, including a flagship summit in Rome in March to mark the EU’s 60th anniversary.
With doubts growing over the Trump administration’s commitment to the transatlantic alliance with Europe, the leaders will also discuss “international issues” facing the union.
The leaders will agree steps to stop migrants taking boats in the first place, including help for the Libyan coastguard and border forces, according to a copy of a summit declaration seen by AFP.
With rights groups warning about terrible conditions caused by people smugglers, other steps include helping Libyan communities to host migrants and working with the UN refugee agency and International Organisation for Migration, it says.
But talk of a Turkey-style deal with Libya is impossible given the chaos following the 2011 toppling of Moamer Kadhafi, while plans for processing camps for migrants outside EU territory are not yet “mature”, an EU official said.
“This is a very difficult, complicated route but there is no alternative to trying. More and more people are dying, so the status quo is not sustainable,” the official said.
The Irish government statement added that “developing our external migration policy, in accordance with international law and human rights principles, is a priority for the EU”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ida-job-numbers-2016-3168090-Jan2017/,"DESPITE THE POLITICAL and economic turmoil of the past 12 months, IDA Ireland was upbeat at the announcement of its 2016 results today.
According to the investment agency, it currently has the highest level of employment across client companies in its 67-year history.
Total employment at overseas companies now stands at a record 199,877, with 18,627 jobs created over the past 12 months.
In a statement, the IDA noted its 244 investments “came against a background of unprecedented geopolitical changes, an underperforming European economy and intense competition from other jurisdictions for foreign direct investment”.
Of the 244 investments, 99 were from new name companies.
With job losses taken into account, the net job creation by FDI firms was 11,842.
Although no exact figures were given in today’s report, the IDA says “losses as a percentage of the overall employment portfolio were at their lowest level in 19 years (since 1997)”.
However, the positive trend came with a health warning from CEO Martin Shanahan who – citing ongoing global and political and economic uncertainty, the impact of the Brexit vote, competition from other jurisdictions being at its strongest and cost competitiveness pressure – cautioned that it is not expected to continue.

“That companies have continued to invest in Ireland is testament to the quality of the offering we have here,” he added.
IDA Ireland confirmed it has received a “significant volume of specific queries to IDA offices from across the world” following the UK referendum on European Union membership last June.
Ireland is hoping to make the most out of opportunities arising from Brexit but the agency remains realistic about possible adverse effects on FDI companies that depend heavily on the UK market. Some of these “may need to consider their future access to the UK market in a post-Brexit environment”.
Regional gains
Dissecting today’s results, Shanahan made clear that many of 2016′s projects were ‘capital intensive’ and took place outside of Dublin, a fact reiterated by Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell-O’Connor who said she was “especially pleased” to see the IDA “achieving growth in all regions”.
Both the Minister and the IDA areoft-criticisedfor their focus on the capital and urban centres. Today, they were quick to point to the developments secured in all of its regions, creating over 6,200 jobs (net) in the west, south-west, south-east and the border and midland counties.
These included the establishment of First Data’s 300 employee-strong R&D hub in Nenagh, Co Tipperary; Kellton Tech Solutions creating its EMEA headquarters in Drogheda creating more than 100 jobs; Wayfair Inc expanding in Galway, taking on 160 new people; Ballinasloe becoming home to 100 new Surmodics employees; Fazzi Healthcare Services setting up a new Irish-based coding and healthcare services company in Limerick, creating 300 jobs; and Cylance expands with the opening of a Cork office.
Although 59% of all FDI employment is outside of Dublin, the IDA concedes that there is still a “global trend towards favouring large urban centres”.
It also claims that for every 10 jobs created by FDI, another seven are generated by the economy with particular positive benefits seen in the construction, retail and hospitality industries.
According to today’s figures, IDA client companies spend €18.7 billion in the Irish economy annual, €10 billion on payroll and €8.7 billion on Irish-sourced materials and services.
